<START> you know sometimes you just gotta have it that's how this movie is with me i am almost embarrassed to admit that i like it it is so goofy in some parts but i find myself reaching for it when i'm down and just need a good laugh and trust me i am just not a goofy movie kinda guy br br you can read the synopsis so i don't have to bore you with that just rest assured if you like <UNK> you will probably like this movie br br one more thing be sure to watch the end credits you don't need to read them just watch them and catch the performance of in the navy by the village people and friends
<START> i have just finished watching this film for the first time and i must say that i am very impressed br br how bleak how full of despair how nightmarish incredible br br visually stunning several scenes are <UNK> in my mind the first appearance of the phantom <UNK> the soul of david <UNK> as it rises from his corpse his spirit on his knees <UNK> br br this film takes a simple story that of the ghostly driver of the phantom <UNK> doomed to collect the souls of the dead for a year brings it into the present setting of the film and then uses flashbacks as a means to explain how david <UNK> ends up in his <UNK> br br i would love to see this released on dvd so that more might see it everyone should
<START> this landmark film can now be seen in two different versions on the <UNK> video release which also includes the english translation of <UNK> novel which she based on a swedish the first version is the swedish edit under the title of the phantom <UNK> the second version is a <UNK> of the way it was shown in the united states under the title of the stroke of midnight as released by <UNK> before it was m g m the actual us release has long <UNK> but a detailed review in the new york times lets us know how the scenes were for domestic release and both are fascinating to see each version of this film was presented at the <UNK> <UNK> in salt lake city with live theatre <UNK> scores provided by artist <UNK> <UNK> a live recording was made of these performances and are included on the <UNK> video dvd along with the novel and notes about the two versions while the phantom <UNK> follows the order of novel the stroke of midnight is in some ways easier to follow seeing the two different edits is an education in how silent films could be changed effectively for release in different countries br br some viewers look at this film as a horror film which it certainly is not this is a morality play with shades of the supernatural used to hit home its stark message the directing and lead performance by the great victor were way ahead of their time it's easy to see why m g m brought him to hollywood to direct such films as <UNK> <UNK> in the scarlet letter and the wind as well as <UNK> <UNK> in he who gets slapped in america he was known as victor he would also star in the lead role of <UNK> <UNK> wild <UNK> giving a masterful performance bergman was greatly influenced by or the phantom <UNK> in his earlier days br br this is a powerful film that is well worth taking some time to discover and study the <UNK> video release is an excellent way to do this
<START> the 1973 musical version of lost horizon is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of all time the 1973 musical remake of the james hilton novel about mythical <UNK> la is a real special gem music by burt <UNK> and lyrics by hal david a strange mixture of straight drama adventure and musical sequences it has the distinction of being the only anti war musical fantasy ever filmed br br this film was a critical and financial disappointment in the united states but made a lot of money overseas only in america did it fail highly different and unique in it's approach as a film musical it deserves far better credit than it's given as a story lost horizon is an incredible adventure and both the <UNK> frank <UNK> film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the james hilton novel what i like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented the film has a <UNK> cast and a gifted director and cinematographer this is a burt <UNK> <UNK> la and it's a wonderful place songs like the world is a circle share the joy and living together growing together evoke a happiness that hilton wrote about in his novel why shouldn't <UNK> la be a slightly goofy place the two love songs i might <UNK> her away and the deleted i come to you are the sensitive spots in the picture there's a <UNK> and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story moreover the things i will not miss is a good <UNK> with a strong melody it's a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with olivia <UNK> and sally <UNK> <UNK> singing and dancing on tables they're a wonderful team and the number is well staged br br i always found it interesting in this story how the high <UNK> kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in <UNK> la the character of the high <UNK> is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole he has no hope for the world outside of <UNK> la if this film were to be remade today it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character richard conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he's found in <UNK> la br br of course for the film to be believable the character of richard <UNK> must be presented as suffering <UNK> at the end like he was in the book neither film versions of lost horizon were faithful to the novel in that regard did <UNK> find <UNK> la or was it imagined did they all die in the plane crash every man has his own idea of what his <UNK> la would be the conflict with <UNK> wanting to believe in <UNK> la and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful i like the melancholy on the faces of <UNK> kennedy and van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley interesting how <UNK> doesn't want to leave paradise but is being <UNK> out by his brother both versions of lost horizon work in different ways but both are successful in <UNK> james ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and <UNK> is the rule so in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and <UNK> is not the motivation human kindness decency compassion courtesy <UNK> and living <UNK> with each other is the rule br br lost horizon has a much stronger story than most musicals it attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not <UNK> one has to remember that lost horizon in 1973 was post <UNK> it was no longer <UNK> for characters to break out in song in a musical much less to be dubbed by other singers lost horizon was an easy target for jaded critics the expectations for it were high almost <UNK> there were two targets to be hit the producer ross hunter and burt <UNK> and the critics were out to get both of them ross hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and lost horizon was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster airport that film was biggest <UNK> up to that time and the success of that picture <UNK> a decade of disaster films for years airport was the most watched film ever to be shown on television it was nominated for 11 academy awards including best picture at the time burt <UNK> and hal david were the most successful <UNK> in the country the <UNK> sentimentality of lost horizon hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like easy rider midnight cowboy and the godfather sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's audiences were <UNK> to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made today lost horizon can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels it's the ultimate <UNK> film with a strong story wonderful music an expensive budget and some quirky humor it's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film it changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not lost horizon '73 is a heavenly film that deserves <UNK> a lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than it's reputation
<START> kevin spacey is without a doubt one of the best actors of the 90s after his performances in the usual suspect <UNK> and american beauty you expect more and more from him that is why ordinary decent criminal is a huge disappointment br br michael lynch is the most <UNK> criminal in <UNK> who is never in a bad mood his next heist becomes an obsession when his partners start questioning michael's ability to plan everything perfectly although this is the only thing he does when he isn't playing good father at home br br i guess it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand plot details which sadly turn out to be the essence of the film i gave the movie a chance by calling it a parody and well parodies are always funny no matter what they spoof or how they do it so it wasn't after all a complete parody on purpose it's just a different con movie that desperately tries to be funny and fails br br unlike some of his colleagues ordinary decent criminal depends too much on story development and logical continuity forgetting what's the main reason the viewer has picked this kind of movie to be entertained this is definitely not entertainment it includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever the introduction of michael's two wives i don't know whether it's some kind of a mindless metaphor or strange dark humor but the chicks are sisters remember <UNK> character has kids br br ordinary decent criminal is complex and confusing you are not waiting for a funny scene instead you carefully follow the dialog because there is a big possibility of losing yourself into the boring pale universe the film has inhabited br br let's go back to spacey i wonder in what condition he has been <UNK> for that movie it's not <UNK> but something much worse an insult to his work in american beauty released an year before ordinary decent criminal the character michael is eccentric and <UNK> spacey is almost pathetic at times the only cure for this is thinking of lester and roger br br writer <UNK> should definitely re consider his screen writing abilities and be more objective this time because the dialog is very weak and the scenes are often pointless and we are still talking about a comedy br br ordinary decent criminal is a really bad crime comedy which does not deserve your attention
<START> brit director nolan now has a career in america and a reputation for making movies both popular and <UNK> acclaimed but this small film was where he started and it certainly <UNK> his talent with its striking black and white cinematography and storytelling that <UNK> his later albeit in a less extreme way <UNK> and the plot reminded me of david <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> but the film still feels fresh and sharp right up to the final twist of the ending whose <UNK> was expected but whose is unexpectedly delicious the acting on the other hand is not quite in the same class the film has a <UNK> quality and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended but it's still a fine debut simultaneously claustrophobic and <UNK>
<START> i read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature finally it's about time hollywood got their act together the big studios always <UNK> at edgy material with oscar written all over it go figure br br <UNK> mile was made ahead of it's time it's a masterpiece br br michael mann a true <UNK> found a way to engage an audience without <UNK> peter <UNK> emmy award performance is probably the best character role i've seen in my film viewing lifetime any actor who touches this role will never be the same unless an academy award is already sitting on their <UNK> br br the gritty multi ethnic ensemble a backdrop for the <UNK> mile makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world this is about redemption without public <UNK> and the power of the human spirit <UNK> all <UNK> imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of <UNK> that doesn't know he is possibly the <UNK> runner in the world what would you do br br this movie makes you walk away feeling you haven't been cheated on any level totally thrilling engaging emotional and a rolling stones soundtrack that ass br br i always thought this would be made for the big screen can't wait in the meantime i'll have to continue re watching my <UNK> vhs copy i've had for many years
<START> crazy director yeah you need to be crazy to make a near movie rob lowe was bad in his character ice t is always bad and burt reynolds had nothing to do in the movie crazy six is an unknown movie with some known actors this is pretty weird a bad movie with some good actors in it it looks like the bad movie did an influence to their performance it did crazy people i give it and a half out of
<START> i cannot see how anyone can say that this was a real good entertaining movie with a few well known actors i found it hard to believe that this was only made in 2005 it's crap the acting is <UNK> to amateur <UNK> poor amateur <UNK> unless you want to laugh <UNK> at an amazing 100 minutes of pure corn don't bother to <UNK> it or rent it worst that i have seen in years it's from the <UNK> days of acting where <UNK> are shooting 8 bullets from the six <UNK> the more well known the actor the worse they were <UNK> was just sad i was extremely disappointed with lee <UNK> has he actually <UNK> to this sort of garbage it was bad enough when he played the six million dollar man
<START> the deadly <UNK> certainly won't scare any one but as sci fi <UNK> go it is better than most a <UNK> <UNK> at the south pole <UNK> out a giant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the north pole military men go missing dr ned william hopper <UNK> son and best known as paul drake on <UNK> perry mason is called in to i d the creature but by this time the creature has eaten up several <UNK> and is en route to the washington <UNK> br br about a third or more of the film consists of stock footage old government educational films military men in radar rooms air planes and would you believe <UNK> putting out to sea which explains of course why a tribe of <UNK> is attacked in the movie hey guys think we can work this in mix in some <UNK> special effects some clunky dialogue and some sexist attitudes and you're good to go not as original as the monster that challenged the world but fans of 1950s big bug schlock will enjoy it and the kids will have a good time throwing popcorn at the screen br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> <UNK> love is surprisingly entertaining while the plot goes off in perhaps too many directions making for an overlong movie it never fails to charm and <UNK> itself the several <UNK> one <UNK> reminiscent of shirley valentine provide ample smiles laughs wisdom and <UNK> it all shouldn't work and at times it certainly <UNK> along but forgive its inconsistencies sit back and have a good time it's a <UNK>
<START> they were alternative before there was alternative the residents are a band like no other and i love them for it this has all their classics from <UNK> <UNK> and to their homage to the great james brown with a take on <UNK> is a man's man's man's <UNK> but that is just the beginning as a bonus it even has <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> beautiful for swinging and even features the residents cover of it needless to say i highly recommend the purchase of this dvd i would also recommend buying their latest album <UNK> dance <UNK> it is fantastic br br uncle willie <UNK> buddy <UNK>
<START> i own a video store with hundreds of documentaries i have seen loads of them and love all of the great info out there only a small handful though even come close to offering info as important as this one i have been reading through other peoples reviews of this film and can't help but notice that the main things people are <UNK> are irrelevant such as it is very one sided such a pathetic criticism every where in society that you look you will see the other side and if you still need help go to com it is the same people over and over uh one might be led to believe that these people are the experts so maybe they are the best people to interview filming style is all the same head shots with few exceptions if you want flash and <UNK> watch micheal moore if you want info watch real <UNK> such as this one as you can <UNK> see none of these complaints have any relevance to the information contained my guess is that these people are just missing the point and don't wanna give up there <UNK> br br my recommendation watch it learn from it and continue your education about such subjects it is very important stuff for everyone
<START> this one was truly awful watching with fascinated horror i kept on asking why have they done this that is taken all the scenarios out of the day after tomorrow the perfect storm and <UNK> and them in a three hour miniseries directed by long time junk tv director dick <UNK> with every disaster movie cliché known to man and not an ounce of real suspense many of the cast were unknown <UNK> and location filming was done in canada <UNK> for chicago so no doubt tax breaks had something to do with it although some ambitious special effects were attempted the execution is so poor no decent spectacle is achieved the actors may be a competent lot the script is so bad no one had a chance to show it except perhaps for randy quaid as tommy the <UNK> <UNK> who went right over the top and was quite amusing br br believe it or not the producers have since made another one of these canadian disaster <UNK> called category 7  the end of the world which was very <UNK> shown on cbs in the us a few weeks after <UNK> <UNK> how could the network of ed <UNK> and walter <UNK> do such a thing in prime time <UNK> <UNK> nobody ever went broke <UNK> public taste is proved right once more
<START> this was the first feature film for just about everyone involved including director <UNK> <UNK> so they deserve credit for pulling it off but this film was awkward in its direction preachy in its style exaggerated in its acting and overly politically correct the plot was all over the place <UNK> any aspect of it from developing well gangsters get involved in the story though i'm not sure what their presence added to the movie other than making the film even more unrealistic they could have been completely left out and the film would have been better as a result br br the plot is about a young ethnic chinese <UNK> who returns to his home country after studying in the west his studies have brought him back with the skills he thinks he needs to fulfill his dream of managing a rock band and taking them to the top of <UNK> <UNK> a rather juvenile premise the beginning of the film hints at conflict with his traditional father but once the gangsters get involved this part of the story is dropped <UNK> br br the film tries to take advantage of <UNK> diverse ethnic mix but unfortunately the manner in which these aspects were put to film either seemed terribly contrived or downright preachy there is a pretty scene of <UNK> women doing a beautiful traditional dance on a beach but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural br br the acting came off as somewhat amateurish and the male lead was particularly unconvincing the female <UNK> lead was a notable exception leaving the most positive mark the film also has an openly gay character and though he is a bit of a caricature he provides some of the funnier moments in the film but the movie was just barely a notch above a typical local television soap drama sadly this film which is not in the least offensive has been banned in <UNK> 3 10
<START> i first saw apocalypse now in 1985 when it was broadcast on british television for the first time i was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of <UNK> of the ring this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after i first saw it br br this leads to the problem of how i can even begin to comment on the movie i could praise the technical aspects especially the sound editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised rightly too these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and robert duvall in particular have also been noted and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the <UNK> long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling <UNK> after passing through the border br br how about the script francis ford coppola is best known as a director but he's <UNK> a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director i said was in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head but his sacrifice was worth it in john <UNK> original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen but <UNK> involvement in the screenplay has <UNK> a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war check how the screenplay starts off all <UNK> and macho with a star turn by bill who wouldn't have looked out of place in the green <UNK> but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes so much so that by the time reaches <UNK> <UNK> the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have <UNK> into another dimension when coppola states this movie isn't about vietnam it is vietnam he's right what started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist <UNK> in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting the <UNK> trial suggests it's 1970 had changed america's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of america br br it's the insane beauty of apocalypse now that makes it a <UNK> of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the <UNK> of politicians what did you do in the vietnam war mr president than michael moore could hope to say in a lifetime i've not seen the <UNK> version but watching the original print i didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic in fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a <UNK> colonel who's leading an <UNK> war party or a sci fi movie where a un assassin is to eliminate a fellow un soldier who's leading a resistance movement on mars though this is probably down to joseph <UNK> original source novel br br my all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that i chose this movie to be my one review at the imdb
<START> possibly the worst movie i have ever seen pathetic in almost every way br br i threw the dvd straight in the bin i didn't even think it was fair to give it to the local <UNK> shop br br the effects are beyond a joke the <UNK> control room looks like cardboard the water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds nothing works br br then there is the limp plot about as much depth as a scooby doo cartoon br br i couldn't wait for them all to <UNK>
<START> spoilers br br i gave this film 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that i will never forget by the way my husband rented this surprising non blow 'em up almost chick looking flick but i guessed why when i saw the cover girls in school uniforms duh lol ah well men if ya can't beat 'em join 'em br br <UNK> <UNK> one of my favorites on the indie screen too cute not only gets into <UNK> her toy dog is the best lesbian in town according to her <UNK> outrageous character that would be the first worthwhile scene br br then she enters a <UNK> in a lovely <UNK> goes into a <UNK> after a bit she gets up goes out to the party she the <UNK> sad <UNK> character are at hands a shiny silver ice bucket to the host of the party the host looks in her precious silver ice bucket and says oh my god it's poo br br i love <UNK> phillips myself for her creativity and unusual movie choices this would definitely be one of them and um i would rent it for the poo scene if i were you i am not a big poo jokes fan but it definitely puts the <UNK> <UNK> in their place they didn't look like they were having a good time anyway lol you will never forget these two scenes hmm but is that what we want in our <UNK> maybe you shouldn't follow my advice at all lol br br <UNK> <UNK> is kind of <UNK> sad in her confusing nonsensical role in i don't know i can't decide if i like her because she is so into indie films indie films are awesome all but couldn't she pick a few good ones i am going to check out a few more of her movies and <UNK> judgment but this one was <UNK> the reference to <UNK> a dog
<START> i happened to see this film on a flight from paris to boston and it reminded me of the food on the plane generic tasteless and obscure the french cinema seems to have lost its <UNK> these days and this is a good example of how a <UNK> script can waste brilliant actors while some may find the of the script to be in line with the <UNK> of euro post <UNK> the whole project seems more like a post <UNK> on the death of euro <UNK> golden years and truly fabulous talents one is vaguely reminded here of <UNK> but without the charm or wit
<START> a beautifully photographed and paced short film it <UNK> captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after pearl harbor br br i appreciated the visual look of the film <UNK> and simultaneously poetic great work by a great d p david <UNK> br br though a family film the story never becomes <UNK> or <UNK> we understand and believe the motivation that <UNK> the young boy on his odyssey i understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does i understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis the kid is tough and the performance by jonathan is superb as is the veteran performance by ron <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a show that you really have to be a certain age to appreciate otherwise it's likely you'll miss the references to 80's cop films and simply think it's a running gag about a walking <UNK> think it's brainless <UNK> <UNK> humor go watch the stallone film and you'll see what i mean this show actually has very subtle humor which says a lot both for a show that aired on adult swim and for a show about a walking ass br br all the standard genre clichés are in place that made movies like dirt harry and <UNK> so great and <UNK> for parody <UNK> is partner who is as per the genre level headed and constantly <UNK> for his <UNK> homicidal behavior the police chief is of course a fire breathing hard case who lives to scream i want your <UNK> on my desk first thing tomorrow morning the over the top and sometimes completely nonsensical manner in which the 1980's <UNK> film is <UNK> suits the subject matter well for instance while breaking up a bus robbery one of the criminals stops to ask hey where are you going <UNK> to which the title character <UNK> off the one liner i'm going to shoot you br br highly recommended for anybody who loves 80's action movies and has actually viewed enough of them to understand the humor
<START> having seen most of the <UNK> brothers previous films i expected something different and off centre is certainly those things but it also has a heart as big as well as big as <UNK> it is one of the most <UNK> enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times intelligent well crafted clever and superbly acted br br characters are delivered in their <UNK> shades by a group of marvellous actors george clooney winning me over completely with his clark gable ish looks and character having only ever seen him in three kings and his thin red line cameo i am now a fan more comedy please george br br john and tim blake nelson <UNK> assist especially nelson if ever the simpsons is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play <UNK> the slack <UNK> <UNK> i don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast my special favorite is stephen root as the blind radio station man br br great old <UNK> music a <UNK> type dance by clooney that i am trying to learn and a feel of depression era southern us enhanced by <UNK> like photography make this the best movie i've see so far this century the only <UNK> to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack the dvd and a dvd player to play it on it's that good br br
<START> i live up here in croc territory and remember well the true events that inspired this movie our guts fall out each time we hear of a croc attack black water is quite simply the best croc movie i have ever seen while i loved rogue last year for all its effects and <UNK> scenes it was the local scenes that captured our audience we laughed in rogue more than anything black water however really <UNK> with the <UNK> and fear that you can experience when you are alone in the you guys call them <UNK> or but they're every tourist should see this film before heading to the northern territory the ending was a bit of a letdown after the rest of the film but i'll be adding this one to my dvd collection when it becomes available
<START> in bollywood it isn't rare that worthless films become hits good films <UNK> and good actors not making it big br br is such a movie br br <UNK> after a music director and singer tried acting hell man just because his songs became a hit that means next he becomes an actor br br the producers were sure the film will work perhaps the songs were a hit too and of course <UNK> did his cheap publicity as usual br br the film tells such a poor story such poor direction such poor acting it makes you cringe br br indian <UNK> in germany stunts by <UNK> and lot of stupidity cap is intact even when he is in the car which <UNK> br br direction is poor music is saving grace though most songs sound the same br br <UNK> tries hard but sadly his <UNK> scenes are a joke lacks expressions he is best suited for his music director and some singing he cuts a sorry picture is awful <UNK> is okay <UNK> is okay <UNK> <UNK>
<START> jack the <UNK> is an adaption of shakespeare's play the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the plot from medieval italy to <UNK> during the time of the american civil war he includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in br br <UNK> re named <UNK> <UNK> is not the duke of <UNK> but a <UNK> in <UNK> he learns voodoo magic from the female slave <UNK> he saves her son ariel who thus <UNK> him into his <UNK> the island is not <UNK> on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the <UNK> there lives an alligator hunter a so called <UNK> man who later tries to rape <UNK> daughter miranda during the time of the civil war ariel wants to join the union troops to help fighting against slavery <UNK> does not care about the war he is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother <UNK> when <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> try to cross the river <UNK> raises a storm the union soldier <UNK> gets lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island he and miranda fall in love with each other but <UNK> won't accept that meanwhile ariel transformed into a <UNK> by <UNK> finds out that <UNK> has <UNK> to ally with the union but plans to <UNK> them <UNK> and <UNK> meet <UNK> man in the swamp and <UNK> with him against <UNK> they kidnap miranda and ariel but <UNK> freeze them and helps the union defeat the southern army in the end ariel is free <UNK> and miranda are bound to marry <UNK> returns to the plantation and <UNK> man gets back the island br br peter fonda represents <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and convincingly while the character of <UNK> stays rather flat it was no bad idea to perform the <UNK> before the background of the civil war but perhaps the director has <UNK> too much in some parts the story seems constructed or comical <UNK> man for example does just appear without any explanation that it needs a kidnapping to bring <UNK> to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that <UNK> tried to make <UNK> more human but only made him a weak old man without his magic <UNK> original authority and wisdom is not made clear br br end of part 1
<START> what can be said about a movie that makes two hours seem like three weeks the hero starts out in japan goes through an identity crisis saving a <UNK> makes a voyage to america saving a slave named sam <UNK> in a little wild west action saving a french japanese native american named julie goes hunting <UNK> gold and then heads back to japan to fight a war the film obviously has no clue where it's going at any point in time i think the director <UNK> each scene after the last movie he'd watched if you're going to watch this film i suggest renting the subtitled so you and your peers can openly discuss how dumb the movie is without speaking over the movie potentially missing another dumb plot twist br br movies the director was watching during the making of this movie an american tail goes west star wars indiana jones the <UNK> teenage mutant ninja <UNK> kung fu vampire hunter d the ten <UNK> br br notes of interests most fear inspiring line of all time about 90 minutes or 19 days into the movie the lead character has just <UNK> an american villain and just as one heads to the vcr to end the pain the hero <UNK> let's go back to japan and the agony continues for another week
<START> my only regret is that one cannot grade a movie on imdb with a 0 a cena would definitely deserve that at least br br spoiler the movie starts with a bunch of people entering a crypt to <UNK> an ancient vampire when a guy cuts himself and his blood <UNK> and falls onto the <UNK> and <UNK> corpse that is supposed to be a <UNK> the <UNK> takes place and the vampire in an animation like effect would you believe it quickly takes on a more human form only to reveal that he's wearing a <UNK> and a bow tie a bow tie yes red if my memory serves me right i tried to check out random scenes by skipping through a bit but it did not get any better than the opening sequences that's the point when i turned the movie off <UNK> it for having made me hope to see a vampire movie this is surely not one unless you're 5 and could take such stupidity seriously br br so if you like vampires and don't want to feel <UNK> or even disgusted learn from my mistake and don't even try to see this garbage
<START> i recently rented this promising mini series i didn't even know they had adapted it for television i was really looking forward to it since the book icon is one of the best spy thrillers i have ever read what a disappointment it was the plot only loosely resembles the one in the book the characters are completely miscast and there's some appalling acting a shame really the story behind icon is perfect for the silver screen but i think television budgets just aren't big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book br br <UNK> deserves much much better than this avoid and stick to the book which is a must read
<START> i guess that after leonard <UNK> had been successful in directing the search for spock and the voyage home william shatner thought he could direct too although he is a competent actor he shows here that he's just not a good director br br actually this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of <UNK> who say that william shatner being an arrogant <UNK> for although his character captain james kirk was always arguably the most important role in the original star trek it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie the two other most important characters captain spock and doctor leonard mccoy are just there to support him and the other characters are just there to add comic relief br br the plot is that some emotional <UNK> <UNK> named is with people and releasing the pain <UNK> up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever grateful they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace and his followers <UNK> the building in which a peace <UNK> between a human <UNK> and <UNK> is taking place this <UNK> the still being constructed enterprise there since none of <UNK> other ships have experienced <UNK> honestly with how <UNK> is run the <UNK> and <UNK> should have <UNK> them years ago adds the crew save spock who is revealed to be secret brothers with mccoy and kirk orders that the enterprise take off to the center of the universe to meet god who apparently every race has a word for however it turns out that this is only a minor <UNK> when he demands the use of the enterprise and kirk asks what does god need with a starship the <UNK> is destroyed but not before realizing he's been <UNK> to for years sacrifices his life and earns <UNK> respect in death after the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> destroy the <UNK> and inexplicably as well br br ok science fiction movies are not known for realism but at some point <UNK> must be <UNK> why do people follow just for releasing their pain why are all <UNK> defined by a single traumatic event i've certainly led a trauma free life why doesn't kirk try his crew for <UNK> and <UNK> after they join what was the point of <UNK> himself when the <UNK> were going to kill the <UNK> anyway br br so the <UNK> weak another problem is that though played well by lawrence is poorly portrayed just because he's an emotional <UNK> doesn't mean he should act exactly like a human religious fanatic shatner who was a co writer as well as the director could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional <UNK> i guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us gee i guess that means that <UNK> should say isn't and don't more often than is not and do not and the shouldn't <UNK> their sentences because they like to talk yeah i know it's sad that i know this please every st race uses unique dialog why is the exception br br the only thing to not complain about is the acting i've always known star trek to have great actors and this movie is not exception <UNK> also go to leonard <UNK> for it had to be difficult to play the <UNK> spock in his old age br br some other things i didn't like br br shatner and the late <UNK> kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing row row row your boat in this movie i guess shatner wished to silence his <UNK> of his singing ability what he did was prove their point br br <UNK> does a fan dance while wearing nothing but tree <UNK> to draw some men into a <UNK> trap after all the dreams of all us men are filled with images of middle aged <UNK> women dancing naked br br <UNK> all well and good as long as it doesn't affect the nature of star trek too much but when <UNK> <UNK> into an object on the enterprise and <UNK> himself it's kinda <UNK> overboard br br kirk is the only crew member who can reject offer of releasing their inner pain and see through the god <UNK> deception not even spock can manage either of these perhaps this scenes were from shatner to his character as many suspect br br the concept of an <UNK> posing as god had been used in star trek before this movie more than once be creative shatner br br speaking of i didn't care for the ripping off of the music of star trek the next generation br br all in all pretty bad trek movie if you're a <UNK> watch it once because it's star trek otherwise watch star trek ii the wrath of khan it's way better
<START> i like this movie above all others it is multi layered there is so much to see and appreciate every viewing brings a new appreciation of the story line the plot and the characters acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it i love the interaction between the players the subtle relationships the period atmosphere ralph <UNK> is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and geoffrey the <UNK> husband is beautifully <UNK> by colin <UNK> the scene in the sand storm where catherine el are discussing the different types of sand <UNK> is one of the high lights of the film and where the affair really starts the other relationship between <UNK> el is yet another <UNK> of the movie which is totally enchanting and heart <UNK> a worthy winner of so many awards
<START> i'm not going to tell anyone what happens in the end but it did not fit with the movie the rest of imaginary heroes though portrayed a realistic family going through realistic issues such as death drugs relationships and high school i could have <UNK> that they were my own family no joke br br <UNK> <UNK> was completely believable as a teen struggling with his brother's suicide and <UNK> weaver plays a mother trying to keep the remains of her slightly dysfunctional family together br br although this family may take their issues to the extreme anyone can relate to what they go through whether it be <UNK> living up to expectations or being a parent
<START> and kept falling asleep if you want to see miles <UNK> around in a <UNK> <UNK> by all means rent this movie if not please don't bother <UNK> with <UNK> was this supposed to be set in the ice age the iron age the steel age or the age of reason what was the reason for the black wig on the guy dressed up as <UNK> khan was that really supposed to be <UNK> khan if <UNK> had access to so much advanced technology and science why did we have wait another 1000 years for <UNK> it's never clear where <UNK> comes from or if he's supposed to be some superior sort of being you wonder if it was all explained in the first movie but after seeing this one you know you'll never bother
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen not only that it is a comedy which isn't funny but it's also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects br br the two heroes with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot that they touched each others <UNK> all the time but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the heroes which finds its climax in showing how and <UNK> cure a mentally ill woman with their <UNK> lifestyle but i hadn't expect anything better by director michael bully who also made two not funny tv shows a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sf comedy movie but and <UNK> had been just a little better in some of their stand up programs for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra who is very beautiful to me
<START> this is a great film for pure entertainment nothing more and nothing less it's enjoyable and a vaguely feel good movie br br a minor but nonetheless irritating thing about the movie is that we don't know why <UNK> and broke up okay most first relationships don't work for one reason or another but they more or less seemed like a nice couple br br in a nutshell it's worth a watch to escape reality
<START> technically <UNK> with <UNK> pops between scenes and <UNK> amateurish flesh requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers but the dialogue rings amazingly true and joe who exposes his body in almost every scene also gives an utterly convincing performance a <UNK> to be sure but the more polished trash made two years later is a definite step forward i suggest you watch that instead 1 2
<START> i loved this film <UNK> post is really great in it i saw it on lifetime and it's in the same entertaining class as films like 'the betty <UNK> <UNK> up a mother's <UNK> etc which by the way are also very good entertaining films it's an over the top drama about a single mother who tries to break away from her middle class predictable personality this movie is just pure entertainment it doesn't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction but it does show how any regular middle class person can they do get addicted to heroin <UNK> aren't just homeless <UNK> people on the street by the way if you do watch it check out how the kid bosses his mother around spoiled 8 out of 10 stars
<START> this movie is amazing it is funny sexy violent and sick but it all holds together for a brilliant troma rendition of romeo and juliet if you don't mind being <UNK> out a bit ok a lot but it's funny <UNK> out see this movie it's worth it there's not one level on which it doesn't deliver i've seen it <UNK> now and it is still amazing i recommend it go get it
<START> quite simply i was <UNK> pink watching this in the movie theatre and <UNK> from ear to ear eyes wide open whilst trying to take all the details in that are at the same time insanely simple fresh yet incredibly sophisticated breathtaking and in imaginative br br in terms of audience age range it is probably pre <UNK> the plot works because of the pure heart of 5 years olds who are focused in what they want and <UNK> in their pursuit they lives in a world that is by cynicism and cultural learning of how everything is to work while most critics might disregard this film due to the lack of a <UNK> or <UNK> film although it is in there somewhere it is precisely for this reason the film should be <UNK> too often our judgement are <UNK> by our own limitations of cinematic and cultural standing like most of film each is totally unique but undeniably may at times feel so unique and fresh it may feel alien like br br the viewing experience provide a wonderful change from all the generic children's products that are generally to please the adult <UNK> ie animals that talks like their human counterparts eddie murphy in shrek it is perhaps <UNK> to know that good old fashioned hand drawn cells still work so incredibly well in this digital era where shrek cars generally triumph it therefore feeling rather nostalgic at the same time makes the film feels timeless a bit like how <UNK> and jungle book hasn't really aged br br the subtleties of each character's expression and body language is captured in such nuanced interpretation that digital films like wall e can never compete on or if it does it would be a very expensive process it would be a big pity for wall e to win over this one at the oscars and it probably will this year yet it might be quite unfair to compare the 2 <UNK> as it is really the <UNK> and the story telling that wins at the end of the day for this is a true master of
<START> a ridiculous movie a terrible editing job worst screenplay ridiculous acting a story that is completely br br if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done judging by this one the entire world movie industry would now be dead br br a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who think they can make movies br br i am still wondering who are those two girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour and are never introduced to us br br
<START> this is the kind of movie that i grew up on it is great family fun that the kids love and the parents enjoy as well i wish more films like this were made it's a great story about a little boy who raises a bull with his mother and sister and shows it all the way up to the national grand championship where he wins then he's scared that someone's going to <UNK> his bull so he kidnaps it and heads home with it i was really excited when i first saw this film in the theater and was surprised to see george <UNK> julia roberts and bruce willis in this little film the music was great with all kinds of huge country names like willie nelson and the <UNK> chicks anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie doesn't have any children or never was a kid them self
<START> i had been avoiding this movie for sometime because i viewed it as an <UNK> installment to a series that should have only had 2 parts but after reading some fairly <UNK> reviews from some imdb <UNK> i spent 1 50 and rented it at my local video store need i go further when i say this was a buck 50 lost this movie is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen first off i realize that <UNK> wanted to see a 33 year old <UNK> in this film but why <UNK> they have had <UNK> read a letter or something from daniel san maybe explaining what happened to daniel hell they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something but no and to the already bad script they added those stupid monks i thought monks take a <UNK> of silence guess these <UNK> monks don't take their <UNK> seriously <UNK> the training the girl went through in the movie was <UNK> and stupid and the <UNK> group of young males were a confusing concept to say the least this was far from even being a martial arts movie with the girl only fighting briefly in the final scene and then she didn't even come close to getting hit even once by the male fighting her give me a break she would have gotten hit at least once i guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get <UNK> by a male in this one i could go on and on but basically i'll end by saying that this movie was just so bad even the girl they chose wasn't nice to even look at she was sorta butch looking i can only think of a handful of movies that i have sit through that compare to just how bad this flick was don t waste your time on this one
<START> it is well known that irene dunne could sing somewhat more than a little and i think her talent as a <UNK> can only be really understood once one has <UNK> through a <UNK> by <UNK> or a song by <UNK> and made a success of it her <UNK> is her voice and her handling of it is pure <UNK> she could tackle any part the only thing she couldn't do was to not make a success of it this film is a perfect example in it she channels ruth gordon because the play is the thing is feminine charming <UNK> and self <UNK> generous protective and <UNK> but never pretentious she manages to stay as believable as alexander knox is in another difficult role he assumes with <UNK> the viewer gets to believe in what he is seeing and to care for it it is refreshing to see a film that is both entertaining and intellectually challenging while pushing all the right patriotic buttons i sincerely hope the entire dunne <UNK> makes it to dvd one day because it's really hard to keep a secret like that among just a few <UNK>
<START> this is a failure so complete as to make me angry br br all of the subtlety and structure of early films is gone leaving nothing but a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> images whose sole purpose seems to be whining about bad things humans do just how do star trek like <UNK> graphics <UNK> mo <UNK> <UNK> of obviously fake computer icons and shots of athletic competition that incidentally show that no one has ever been able to top or even match <UNK> <UNK> for filming bodies in motion edited together with an <UNK> of video <UNK> that a 1980s dr who producer would have rejected as too cheesy add up to a <UNK> against <UNK> violence there is no intellectual emotional or visceral connection between these images as assembled and mutated by and way too many digital effects <UNK> and the <UNK> tale i assume he wanted to produce with all of the <UNK> <UNK> involved no one seems to have pulled his head out the his own feeling of saying something important and considered that they might all be failing to say something new br br only people who watch too much television could make such a film and believe that it's meaningful this is <UNK> stan and ultimately <UNK> in its relentless <UNK> the only irony and tension evident here unlike in <UNK> where the relentless beauty and <UNK> of time altered ordinary images forced you to consider their meaning was when the dvd i was watching <UNK> and <UNK> this is mtv for the noam <UNK> crowd based on <UNK> rather than reflection and <UNK> nothing two stars for the music which is in <UNK> best <UNK> <UNK> style and features some passionate <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> ma i hope for his sake that he didn't have to record his parts to a <UNK> of the film there are some things you shouldn't have to do even for a paycheck
<START> is a movie that i treasure and its one movie i don't mind seeing at any time well almost any time this movie is simply marvelous and according to me is the funniest movie i've ever seen and yes i do put it over <UNK> <UNK> reason <UNK> <UNK> has scenes you'll watch out but not possible simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for <UNK> salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but i'll put the characters in order of <UNK> br br rank 1 crime master <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> best performance till date and yes this happened before the casting couch <UNK> is an innocent character who belongs to well <UNK> family of mr india fame crime master <UNK> is actually nephew but for he's more than a responsible handsome charismatic charming son <UNK> makes the biggest mistake of life by <UNK> <UNK> 000 <UNK> to who is as had once said a fraud and a cheat now only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money <UNK> realizes that there is more than <UNK> 000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins struggle against the <UNK> world br br rank 2 main <UNK> mark <UNK> is an evil character who is ram <UNK> twin originally named <UNK> chooses to change his name to suit his personality as a child had always <UNK> his brother and then one day things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to ram decided to kill his father but in the <UNK> darkness instead killed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dad though doesn't regret his actions sole mission now is to get back his property somehow and start his own <UNK> <UNK> farm also needs to return back the <UNK> to <UNK> but has no intentions whatsoever to do so in order to achieve his evil goals employs two people robert <UNK> who is very good at aiming and khan clone and son who is a very very smart boy br br rank 3 <UNK> <UNK> khan wants to marry the rich <UNK> <UNK> so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for <UNK> <UNK> has no problem taking care of the big business that father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to london if needed br br rank 4 <UNK> salman khan after <UNK> <UNK> is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way <UNK> tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend is tragic br br i won't reveal any more characters because jesus christ i just wouldn't stop <UNK> the movie is outright stunning go and get the dvd now and beware of those cheap as they have <UNK> many good scenes out of the movie br br the background music is stud and the action is better than the matrix especially the final encountered between <UNK> and crime master <UNK> watch out for it it appears in the climax is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and <UNK> it teaches us about bravery why else would <UNK> ask <UNK> to stay back when they go to meet the <UNK> even though <UNK> was complaining that he had to go to the toilet is also a tragedy especially the scenes where salman is targeted by <UNK> and is given <UNK> of stomach <UNK> <UNK> the part where reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to london and the part where <UNK> is arrested in the ending without even getting back his <UNK> 000 is overall a complete package sit back and enjoy the ride bet <UNK> be a second ride after that and then a third br br the movie was considered a flop back then and i bet no one liked it but <UNK> up guys this movie is a big hit even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres the movie is one of the highest selling home dvds and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back
<START> first they ruin it with the uniquely bad animation quality then they get voices that sound nothing like the original they make <UNK> many movie mistakes when <UNK> is singing in count me out the drummer disappears and then <UNK> <UNK> shirt keeps changing color his hat keeps changing position one of the bridge is white everyone in the background appears fat keep changing colors and appearing and disappearing even heaven appears different i don't give a damn if this is a low budget film they shouldn't cut <UNK> on animation they completely ruined the first <UNK> the only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack
<START> having grown up in new jersey and having spent many a day and night on the gritty streets of new york in the 1970's watching a film like the seven ups or its <UNK> spirit the french connection always evokes fond memories of a time and place which for some might have been darkest hour but which for me in my early <UNK> was always one fun filled adventure after another i truly miss those times as one reviewer <UNK> this film very <UNK> captures the stark cold matter of fact feel of the nyc winter season while <UNK> exposing the <UNK> of the <UNK> infamous underworld of crime and <UNK> a great <UNK> of a place and a time and a culture a spot on characterization of both the film and the city the stellar attributes of this film the plot the cast the characters and of course the car chase are <UNK> described in many of the reviews here so i won't go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occurs during the car chase when the camera focuses on richard lynch riding shotgun to the <UNK> bill <UNK> the look of horror on richard lynch's face along with the <UNK> gestures are so out of character for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it that it is actually comical to watch i get a chuckle out of it every time
<START> a brutally straightforward tale of murder and capital punishment by the state so painfully slow and accurate in the description of capital punishment from the <UNK> of the to the victim p ing in his own pants before dying it has the power to change your mind about death penalty the whole <UNK> from this story the screenwriter was the <UNK> lawyer <UNK> trying to defend and then <UNK> the accused
<START> i was a huge fan of <UNK> comics when i was a kid and watched every one i never heard about this movie when it was released but i watched it with my kids last night i remembered the comic well enough to know that a lot was added to the story for the film some of the changes i thought were a bit corny like the <UNK> <UNK> dancing and the <UNK> <UNK> daughter almost everything about her but i found most it amusing enough most importantly seeing the reactions as my kids watched it confirmed that the film pleased its target audience as a family film it works better than other <UNK> titles i've seen many of the names that weren't in the book i found had the same appeal as ones that were overall an enjoyable family film regardless of whether you're an <UNK> fan or not
<START> i made it through half of this but was not enough of a <UNK> to see it all the first half of the film had next to no dialog almost everything was voice over commentary to carry the story the scriptwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennium of detailed history in the voice over at the same time he forgot to do any character development most science fiction fans don't require huge amounts of character development but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet together ended up fighting each other br br there are some good things going on in the film the soundtrack was well done some of the computer generated graphics are very good but others were just mediocre
<START> the plot of in the mood for love is simple enough a married man and a married woman though not to <UNK> slowly develop a romantic <UNK> to one another the film's pace is numbingly slow and precious little actually happens between the two yet the backdrop of hong kong in the early 1960s and director wong <UNK> <UNK> keen sense for capturing the beauty of the setting as well as the principal characters make this film a joy to watch actors tony <UNK> and maggie cheung are both excellent and wong <UNK> <UNK> has done an extraordinary job in capturing the feel and nostalgia of the past something so many films and directors try to do but usually fail miserably there are so many little details that add charm to the film a trademark of the director and the colors and cinematography are what send this otherwise simple story over the top as a marvelous cinematic achievement 9 10
<START> writers and directors by the nature of their craft stand back a frame from the action in their work to show insights about characters and situations here huston and <UNK> have stepped back a bigger frame yet to show us the ultimate view of what it means to be human until it's very end the movie appears to be about nothing much the kind of typical circumstances that fill every day life it is not until the end of the very final scene that we realize that it is in fact about everything br br it is not possible to watch this final scene without simultaneously feeling pity and also deep affection for <UNK> and the rest of fellow beings
<START> i think i win the bargain contest for this movie since i got it as part of a martial arts movie classics dvd collection with 50 movies for 20 bucks which means i paid something like 50 cents for the chance to watch the black fist version of a movie that was released as <UNK> br br for a basic revenge flick black fist isn't too bad even though it is obviously <UNK> by a low budget one of my <UNK> rules of thumb for watching a movie is that if the lead actor is better than his production and screenplay the movie automatically gets at least three stars that is certainly the case here <UNK> has some presence and some charisma and probably deserved a better film career than he got br br the street fight choreography the <UNK> reason for the film really won't to impress anyone who has ever in a martial arts school or even just been <UNK> in a <UNK> fight i only spent about two years learning basic kung fu but even i would never fall for the front <UNK> kicks arm drags and <UNK> punches on display here but the atmosphere is good dust and blood and shouting crowds and the actors put some feeling into the fight scenes br br less believable is the plot <UNK> character <UNK> is portrayed as a street smart sharp young man who goes looking for work as a pick up fighter in illegal street matches yet he is surprised and <UNK> when he has to pay off the cops excuse me but i was raised in small town <UNK> and even i knew from watching hard times with charles bronson that the cops have to be paid off for this sort of action and that the guys who fight needed the in order to get their matches and that the were worth the money so you have to watch this movie with a sort of <UNK> suspension of your critical <UNK> in order to accept it as a black brother being repressed movie most of the other non black fighters in the stable get <UNK> in the face for the same deal too yes br br the movie suffers from a short attention span the director obviously didn't have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed so he had to fill in the gaps with some fairly ludicrous exposition scenes the i him i him and then i killed him scene just doesn't work along with voice overs and montages that are clumsy and unconvincing this is especially true with the whole romance angle which seems to have been filmed as if it were an <UNK> this is a little shoddy when you consider that the death of wife's death is supposed to fuel his drive for revenge br br but once the movie switches all the way from young fighter rising through the ranks to the revenge theme it picks up a little steam and plays with a little more conviction i'm not sure that the final payoff is worth the <UNK> roger ebert calls this sort of thing a long drive for a short day at the beach but it does tie things off in a reasonably satisfying way br br if <UNK> stallone had made this film with a real budget and the same cast <UNK> sets and costumes and himself as the hero people would have <UNK> it as the next rocky which goes to show you how <UNK> and chance can play havoc with would be <UNK> dreams br br worth seeing once for various decent shots and lines and to watch <UNK> coleman embarrass himself in a role that is beneath him
<START> i watched princess of the <UNK> for the first time when i was about 10 years old i am <UNK> now and have never forgotten the movie nor have i gotten over my fascination with egypt i have searched the internet trying to buy the movie but have not been able to locate it it makes me wonder if this is one of the lost movies in hollywood i loved debra <UNK> and jeffrey hunter together they have such charisma together if you were to ask me anything about the movie i could not tell you anything other than who was in it i vaguely remember a scene by the <UNK> with debra <UNK> a bunch of other women i have always wanted to see it again i never thought of it as an escape movie back then but i can see now where that was probably the case i do hope they will put it on dvd and i will be able to see it again before i die it was a wonderful movie
<START> it's about jealousy it's about racism it's about manipulation but the underlying message is love geoffrey <UNK> tried to pull off shakespeare's othello by bringing it to modern day context however the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off there were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective however john othello played by <UNK> walker over <UNK> a lot in this film causing for the down fall of <UNK> eventually ending in death br br ben played by christopher <UNK> was seen as the main character in the film he didn't give enough evidence for to be cheating on othello with michael <UNK> played by richard <UNK> instead he just played a friend to all and gave one reason as to why she was cheating in the play it took a lot more convincing from <UNK> to make othello even suspect anything this change made the movie more about rage for the wrong reasons than what the book was based off of however the movie did have a few good points it turned the army scenes into more a racist group toward blacks where othello is the main chief of the police squad these scenes are made believable by the raging crowds and burning fires you are able to sense the amount of racism in the movie more so than you can in the book this book plays up the modern day scenes by making it much easier to understand than the <UNK> times it was written in in the play <UNK> gets tortured at the end but in the film he gets his satisfaction and gets <UNK> position he never gets what he deserves and is never caught for telling the lie to othello until it is too late i saw this as a downfall in the movie because i feel that the villain is granted his treasure of the promotion out of lying and in the book he is found out by <UNK> overall the movie could have done a better job based on the play than what it did i feel that the director of the movie left out some of the most important parts of the play that were mentioned or there to make the play flow or make it more of a tragedy i would say that you should read the book first in order to understand all of the events that happened in the movie otherwise you may find yourself lost and confused
<START> when king kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake i was breathless i don't know how many times i went back to see that movies hoping to see more jessica lange was not a great actress then she became one but she was so hot i went to see sweet dreams when it came out because by that time ms lange had become a great actress it looked like a wonderful story and she's always exciting to see br br i never walked out of a movie faster my wife <UNK> br br when we got into the car i turned to her and said if you had told me i would get bored watching jessica lange take her clothes off i would have said your crazy i just got bored watching lange take her clothes off how bad is that
<START> i have bought the complete season of surface watched it in 3 days i was so captured by the the plot theories and basically everything about this show the actor who plays miles is great sister mother and father acted like real life family would you could connect on so many levels it's fascinating br br i find animals are so wonderful you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists br br am that surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows i have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book br br love the show very much for those who haven't watched surface if you like sci fi you need to watch this
<START> shadows is often acclaimed as the film that was the breakthrough for american independent cinema whether thats true or not it is an undeniably important film one whose influence can be <UNK> all the way to today's sundance fodder here is a film which <UNK> controversial topics of the day namely racism and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative fashion also it deals with sex in a frank manner that hollywood wouldn't even discuss until the graduate br br still the question remains is it as powerful today as when it was originally released the answer is yes while many important films are hard to watch and dated nowadays shadows <UNK> every ounce of emotional <UNK> when viewed now it deals with racism as a personal issue and not a political one so its still relevant plus it works as a great time capsule capturing the 1950s beat generation and new york art scene in a way possibly no other film has br br on a technical level its admittedly uneven cassavetes had yet to gain full confidence as a director and the choppy editing reflects the film's low budget still the film's story is remains powerful plus the acting considering the <UNK> of the cast and <UNK> nature is phenomenal all around the actors create realistic characters ones who remain sympathetic despite their often less than admirable actions shadows is absolutely mandatory viewing for film buffs 9 10
<START> what alice found is the greatest movie that <UNK> ever heard of i <UNK> it when i heard of it and i though that it would all sex no plot and just really stupid but in reality it was really good they say all indie movies suck but this one and <UNK> dynamite didn't suck i asked my friend who'd seen it before i did and she said that alice has all these three ways and you see all this nudity but no there is no three way that i remember and little nudity the movie did have a point and it taught me never trust <UNK> i liked that in the end they got alice a little <UNK> in the end on her way to <UNK> i totally suggest seeing this movie
<START> this one what came to my mind immediately was loving <UNK> as it has this same kind of mature mood and <UNK> dealing with the subject we simply observe as the story unfolds without taking sides or having to confront any moral issues or of course we are but are not <UNK> fed them sure there were some difficult facts to face and choices to make but it just <UNK> basically it was just like any other love story in any other life with any other <UNK> br br i personally found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outs the only thing i could really <UNK> as a problem would be it just felt kind of <UNK> held back it's not about the sex scenes or those missing but given that i felt the film at its <UNK> during the moments they were together having a good time it kind of <UNK> with the rest is good but it just never quite like loving <UNK> nor touched me quite as much br br this said i <UNK> recommend it it's by no means a waste of ones precious time on the contrary br br 7 10
<START> the story of ed <UNK> is interesting very interesting this movie however interesting only in the fact that it was actually made kane <UNK> portrayal of ed <UNK> is so far off it's not even the slightest bit funny ed <UNK> did not behave psychotic in public he was very calm and <UNK> and always extremely polite to everybody and talked to anybody who would listen this is one of the major things this movie failed to show the audience but the biggest mistake of this movie side from even one frame ever being shot was that ed never killed anyone without having been told to do so by his dead mother whom he thought was speaking to him from beyond the grave he killed only the people who his dead mother said he had to because it was god's will and he was very <UNK> about it though that didn't stop him from <UNK> with <UNK> and wearing people's flesh i officially gave this movie a rating of 1 simply because 0 wasn't given to me as an option br br i highly advise all to stay clear of this movie if you want to see a movie that accurately depicts ed <UNK> and doesn't try to put in a sub plot love story between a cop and a fictional woman who never existed i highly advise you see the original movie which unfortunately seems to not be on imdb com though i could be wrong but i have yet to find it here the original doesn't stray from the actual events and doesn't try to twist the story i can understand telling the story from a different perspective but this movie just tried to straight change the true story itself something that i find as horrible as if someone made a movie based on 9 11 but gave it a twist that canada was behind it or a wwii movie saying hitler was a good guy and helped fight the <UNK>
<START> an wonderful film that works on several levels it's a story about a great architect a son seeking his father about very loving relationships and about loss it's also a great about architecture br br very intelligent and very moving a real treat
<START> in a critical scene as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scott thomas lies in the cave of <UNK> she writes something read <UNK> by <UNK> juliette <UNK> in which she <UNK> that the light has gone out now and i'm writing in the darkness a sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of the far from tiresome the english patient with such a dramatic <UNK> that keeps one firmly on their feet and a strength about the film that doesn't let up this film proudly <UNK> the mysteries and romances of world war ii taking elements of casablanca and lawrence of <UNK> along with some independence in the form of <UNK> br br the english patient <UNK> pulls the <UNK> and takes us through a mysterious first act a romantic second act and a beautiful beautiful final act and it isn't just the wonderful pace and setting it's the performance of ralph <UNK> who keeps us sympathetic even when count from the very start proves to be a thoroughly unlikable character usually <UNK> as a villain he shows <UNK> but ultimately human colours as a man taken in by a desperate love that he must fulfill br br many will criticize this film based on its so called <UNK> of but those who do know nothing the <UNK> between the two periods before and after the plane crash seen at the start are spectacular as the patient is the <UNK> man who suffers because of what he did the evil that was once in him now absent whereas the man of before the crash is an individual like anyone else he wants this woman but he cannot have her <UNK> brings the human like qualities out of in a way absolutely no other actor could there couldn't have been a better actor for the job br br so please take these comments to heart see the film those who call it boring or despicable know nothing and should be ashamed of such a one dimensional view on the film a view that they have neither studied nor <UNK> and probably don't plan on the english patient is the best of every film to have ever won the best picture oscar and for so many reasons hidden in their poetic <UNK>
<START> while everyone does a decent job in this film i agree with the other comment it's too loose and scattered too much like a script less experiment with really talented actors as such it isn't enough to hold your attention having said that there are a few really funny moments one involving dylan mcdermott and a <UNK> shot glass that i think anyone who's been that drunk would find as funny as i did the other is a split second with an dinosaur <UNK> glover does his usual nutty <UNK> fest guy and does it fine harry dean <UNK> does his usual nutty <UNK> <UNK> man anyone etc good cast not enough to keep it going just a few gems seconds long
<START> my first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for 5 00 but since it featured sandra <UNK> who i generally like i bought it my disappointment with the film began almost immediately the dialogues are slow and stiff the color is distorted i kept <UNK> the volume to hear the conversations the acting is amateurish even the killing scenes are a failure twice dead people moved their legs when my cash <UNK> daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie i immediately and <UNK> <UNK> this is an amazingly bad movie tomorrow i am giving this dvd away at the company white elephant christmas party
<START> the cast was well picked <UNK> shore is hilarious and does a good job of bringing the plot of the movie together however <UNK> <UNK> is who really makes this movie special her talented acting combined with her great looks makes this movie a definite see
<START> one of my favourite films whenever it is on although i do admit one time missing it when it was on last year br br despite the age of the film it doesn't look like that and the story even though it'd been done a thousand times before still felt entertaining there were one or two little <UNK> for me in the story but i looked past them and just enjoyed the film for what it was br br overall i give it a 7 10
<START> this film is on my top 20 comedies list this is a truly unique film to the reviewer who said i must be really missing something you are correct you are missing something if you don't have the kind of sense of humor this film requires that's one thing but don't give it a bad review because you think it's looney but isn't intended to be loony is an apt description of both what it <UNK> to be and what it succeeds in being i laughed much more often and much more intensely at this film than i do at most other funny films br br michael <UNK> brought out the best in his cast in this his first big film for which he was nominated for an independent spirit award for best first feature <UNK> glover as usual is absolutely brilliant in some perfectly inexplicable way and some of his very funniest lines ever were said in this film glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now harry dean <UNK> puts in an excellent comic performance william <UNK> is incredible in a small role dylan mcdermott was <UNK> cast and lois <UNK> is completely excellent br br all of the above are perfectly funny in their own perfect way but this is one of <UNK> finest performances up there with his performances in <UNK> edge and <UNK> if you are a <UNK> glover fan but have somehow overlooked this film you need to stop whatever it is you're doing and see this immediately br br but just remember to relax first and maybe have a beer or something this is a great film but it is very unusual and i recommend being in or inducing an appropriately silly state of mind before viewing
<START> this is a romantic comedy so it's really a fairy tale but an unconventional one cinderella rather than living in the <UNK> lives in an castle in the <UNK> with a good looking husband who's no prince she does find her prince but he's not that handsome instead of a castle at least initially she gets a tiny walk up in manhattan br br <UNK> and <UNK> lead a cast of fully realized if a little over the top characters br br <UNK> reaches the highest level of movie making in my mind he creates a world i want to move into a manhattan neighborhood and street life <UNK> with life and community br br i wish imdb linked to <UNK> other comments i'd like to know what other movies the people who <UNK> this one hate i am always looking for a lot of laughs and for nice places in which to live at least for an hour or so
<START> this movie is almost never seen today the only reason i can enjoy it again and again is from a slightly worn out vhs copy i made when the film was shown on tv in 1991 here in england br br an ensemble cast are obviously enjoying themselves and this is reflected to the viewer a razor sharp script helps things along and once you've seen this you will want to watch it over and over again br br wayne rogers is the <UNK> but everyone contributes to a great film with a great jazz soundtrack to boot there are emotional moments during the film but never to the point of <UNK> sweet <UNK> these are guys on the trip of a lifetime and they convey that excitement wonderfully br br highly recommended if you can actually get to see it
<START> just lovely it is long no climax don't wait for anything to happen great for a rainy day about a man in a mid life crisis who takes his family to a secluded area of the greek <UNK> i saw this in my teens and still love it 20 years later i have been unable to find it in video stores however molly <UNK> is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then kind of <UNK> into the place there are no phones no tv boredom which when hit with <UNK> like that the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect and each character does so susan sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with john <UNK> character but he is unable to well you know gina rowlands is the wife that loves him but is just about to give up on their marriage he is demanding and frustrating to everyone there is another character in the movie a greek who talks to molly <UNK> <UNK> about sex but things that she is curious about but he is irritating and horny and i didn't like this character the locale of the film is what makes this film so so good it wouldn't work if filmed anywhere else i recommend this film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10
<START> mixing small town <UNK> high school students fake rock music and some weirdo who kills for well no reason in particular this film is essentially a re make of the giant <UNK> monster except without the <UNK> monster of course br br now anyone who has actually seen giant <UNK> monster knows that it is one of the worst made films of all time frequently so slow it's not even funny and i can't believe that by 1967 giant <UNK> monster had earned such a reputation that young directors were just dying to get to work on a sequel let alone a remake so will someone please explain to me why this film was made the dance sequence by the way is historically interesting although about three years out of date but even that's spoiled since it goes on and on and on
<START> i was sick one day and was <UNK> channels and i came upon this terribly rank movie the plot and even the subplots if you can find one have been done to <UNK> but as bad as the story was i <UNK> a special comment for <UNK> <UNK> her character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters i have ever has the misfortune of seeing on film her only two <UNK> in this category are john in the <UNK> and julia stiles in anything she's done or half done maybe she performed exactly as the script suggested or maybe <UNK> that is the limit she has to her acting range either way they should have had a rewrite and killed her off in the first 30 seconds of the film <UNK> like the girl that fell off the balcony in lethal weapon i but at least she had nice breasts br br most <UNK> <UNK> douglas
<START> the cast alone tells you this will be a notch above the usual italian western veteran actors robert ryan and arthur kennedy team up with alex <UNK> who at the time seemed on the verge of stardom the result is a movie that's both off beat and down beat and yet it'll satisfy those who seek more from a western than just <UNK> especially interesting here is the character played by alex <UNK> one expects the hero in these westerns to be <UNK> and <UNK> but clay <UNK> is an extreme example and surprisingly enough he's often <UNK> in a passive even weak position much is made of the fact that he fears falling prey to the <UNK> fits which his father and in these moments of <UNK> he's either at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who wish to help him to emphasize his <UNK> clay <UNK> don't you love that name is often <UNK> stripped to the <UNK> as if he were little more than an attractive <UNK> being put on display there's even a strong <UNK> streak in his nature most in evidence when he's used as a <UNK> bag by his enemies and then suspended by his <UNK> and left hanging above the middle of a street not only does he often fail to protect himself but <UNK> is equally <UNK> in protecting those around him nearly everyone who helps him is killed br br while a minute to pray a second to die is far from being a complete success it has a depth and a tone which sets it apart and causes it to <UNK> in the memory it's also a good showcase for alex <UNK> whose career tended to decline after this point following a few promising years in the mid 1960s he must have been about <UNK> years old when he filmed this in his physical prime and the scene of him hanging by his <UNK> bare <UNK> and <UNK> is a memorable piece of cinematic <UNK>
<START> one of my favorite movies of all times have seen it three times already it does a great job of <UNK> up the walks of life israeli humor and seriousness and much of the problems <UNK> go through universal theme of wanting to be accepted and be accepted for who you are good subtle humor and it's the charisma of the characters that makes this movie magic and says a lot about culture and the <UNK> and humor with a great actor in it cohen i highly recommend it to anyone and it's a movie perfect for practically anyone family movie boyfriend girlfriend movie and also says apart from israeli culture wanting to be accepted most of all how important family is with all its diversity and <UNK> br br great great movie
<START> ridiculous thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher <UNK> just to prevent her action against them interesting premise could render a good movie but this one is just lame and far fetched boring with an ending <UNK> just to say the least mrs <UNK> tries to give some dignity to this misfire but even she a good actress no doubt about it could save this garbage i give this a 4 four
<START> i cannot believe how this atrocity managed to capture the hearts and minds of a cross section of the <UNK> young <UNK> of its era but i'm certain i wish it hadn't in my opinion it is an inaccurate poorly acted <UNK> scripted <UNK> directed piece of the brief <UNK> to an imagined reality <UNK> any humour to death the situations are <UNK> <UNK> which make the the already flimsy characters even more unbelievable and <UNK> the romance is dull the end is unsatisfying and ruins the only sensible drugs message in the film and the simple plot and i ' <UNK> and is tested to extremes with the uninteresting motion of the film in short this film as a blatant visual assault with no hint of skill or <UNK> i <UNK> it to the ash heap of history and pray it stays there
<START> the action was episodic and there was no narrative thread to tie the episodes together and move the story forward the plot <UNK> along with few exceptions e g graham greene the acting was uninspired and pedestrian at best the actors seemed to have something on their minds other than the scene they were in it is boring to observe a man driving a car through the semi desert country of this movie's setting whether he drives poorly or well such scenes are typical of the level of tension in the video so there was nothing about this video to engage or draw the <UNK> in to make him or her care about the characters and the out comes i am <UNK> disappointed because i rented this movie based on the <UNK> of the executive producer redford and the writer of the novel on which it was based <UNK> i note that the jewel box reports that funding is provided by <UNK> and the corporation for public <UNK> as well as <UNK> international i would hope that this video was as disappointing to them as it was to me and my wife to the point that they will not <UNK> any more disasters coming from the same source
<START> this american masterpiece came as near perfection as popular art <UNK> to be from its beautifully <UNK> and suggestive title to the magnificent performance <UNK> by william <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> harold br br the film <UNK> both the dream and the reality of the <UNK> this intimate engagement with the psychological facts of american life gave it an almost universal <UNK> but unlike contemporary and <UNK> message pictures it was not a it showed americans as they are presented their problems as they themselves see them and provided only such temporary they themselves would the <UNK> values are the values of the people in <UNK> br br william <UNK> an outstanding director triple winner of the best picture oscar adds an air of distinction to melodrama epic and westerns with his <UNK> visual style and his taste for <UNK> material he gained a reputation as a <UNK> serious artist <UNK> most <UNK> use of deep focus reveals the real commitment to emotional content br br the film tells the story of three men coming home from war to a small middle american community and find it <UNK> difficult to pick up where they left off the three heroes are a middle aged sergeant march magnificent as the devoted family man who succeeds in breaking the ice with his family an <UNK> air force captain dana andrews returning to an <UNK> wife and a tormented sailor harold russell who has lost both hands in service replaced by <UNK> in real life br br winner of 7 academy awards including best picture the best years of our lives is <UNK> and compassionate a deeply personal motion picture with touching <UNK> <UNK> scenes br br the first words of the <UNK> loving wife when he arrives home unexpectedly i look terrible it isn't fair of you to burst in on us like this br br the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> mother when she first sees her son's mechanical hands she <UNK> out it's nothing br br with her dry <UNK> voice myrna loy combines <UNK> her qualities with <UNK> ones <UNK> wright is lovely as the <UNK> nice daughter who falls in love with the pilot virginia <UNK> is harsh as the <UNK> flashy blonde wife whose first loves are money and high life and cathy <UNK> is wonderful and sensitive as the <UNK> fiancée br br the situations and even some of the characters seem a little obvious but this is a superb example of high quality film making in the forties with smiles and tears <UNK> <UNK> and a film which says what is needed on a vital subject
<START> tepid poorly produced 70's made moore because of today's <UNK> nonetheless this film is worthy stink fodder because of acting absent direction and silly 70's clothing sadly the <UNK> remembers when clothing was all the rage this has the same sort of feel to it that some better 70's sci fi <UNK> namely <UNK> and <UNK> run while the premise interesting rich people clone themselves to keep a ready supply of body parts to keep them alive <UNK> forever the film makes the mistake of <UNK> us with richard tim <UNK> a clone who is at once both boring and irritating hollow acting by <UNK> doesn't help but fits right in with the rest of the cast even such b as dick <UNK> <UNK> tv series ghost with 1 000 000 eyes <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> the dark <UNK> and peter graves beginning of the end killers from space it <UNK> the world provide only the <UNK> tepid performances produced directed and edited by a bunch of <UNK> it's no surprise that fails to <UNK> anyone in the least much less keep anyone's attention truth be told there's nothing in the feeble flick that even schlock fans would love wanna see some bad funny 70's films put on anything by <UNK> clark is no bonus the <UNK> says even the mst3k version is a <UNK> so proceed at <UNK> own risk <UNK>
<START> it hasn't even been two years since i first saw this film and yet i can barely remember a thing about this movie needless to say i found it to be very forgettable of what i do remember nothing stands out as particularly good a talented cast is wasted in what i suppose was meant to be a dark comedy but if that is the case it fails miserably at best this film is mildly interesting at worst the seemingly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are more interesting than the storyline if you like watching films where it always seems <UNK> and cool then i guess you may find something to like in this picture just try to ignore what else is going on because it is barely watchable
<START> i must tell you the truth the only reason i wanted to see this movie was because of rose i think that part definitely worked out pretty well actually however the film was very good too some parts of this movie are really good br br the film has great action also the mystery is pretty hard to figure out and rose does some oscar worthy acting towards the end of the film but i don't want to give anything away adam beach and <UNK> <UNK> are also great in the movie along with some of the other stars br br if you like mysteries or action movies or just like rose i totally think you would like this movie
<START> who is <UNK> the store here how could any producer network executive director let a crew stick the <UNK> plastic palm trees in film history in the <UNK> of a <UNK> canadian beach and try to <UNK> it off on us as the <UNK> those trees were to real palm trees what a pink <UNK> k mart christmas tree is to real and who let <UNK> <UNK> go in front of the camera with painted on grey hair that wouldn't have passed <UNK> in a high school play and didn't any of the geniuses doing quality control on this thing think to correct the excellent canadian actor when he said <UNK> instead of gas everybody involved with this plodding slug of a movie writer director actors has done not just good but brilliant work elsewhere paced way too fast between events and deadly slow within them devoid of any emotion except the obvious <UNK> and contrived maybe this only seems like one of <UNK> worst movie because of all the red carpet hype with which it was presented and i'm saying this as somebody who love lifetime what gives folks br br all of that said a certain <UNK> work at a certain critical turn in the movie and if you've seen it you'll know exactly what i'm talking about was so brilliant that the movie would have gotten a 10 from me if that was the whole movie unfortunately it was only about five seconds of it
<START> this is not the masterpiece that is snow white cinderella or <UNK> but it is a very sweet enjoyable romantic well done disney animated feature br br there are of course lessons included <UNK> for the <UNK> and some very appropriate kiddie cheek but there is plenty <UNK> for the adults as well br br while this is somewhat of a <UNK> of the classic disney <UNK> adventure it still holds some elements which solely belong to the <UNK> is the tramp and <UNK> is the lady but <UNK> has several <UNK> and they are all trying to get home br br phil harris is our <UNK> you may recognize his voice as he also <UNK> the voice of <UNK> the bear in the jungle book and little john in disney's robin hood eva <UNK> lends her <UNK> sweet voice to <UNK> br br directed by <UNK> who directed or worked on every disney animated film worth mentioning until his death in 1985 br br this is among my very favorite of the disney animated feature films and belongs in any disney collection the 2 <UNK> special edition is due out this summer 2007 br br this rates an 8 4 10 from br br the fiend
<START> this is per se an above average film but why in the name of <UNK> was it made it's impossible to treat it as a thing <UNK> itself because it is an almost shot for shot remake of an alfred hitchcock classic of 1960 you can't watch it without the 1960 film <UNK> into your consciousness br br what does the word credit mean how can we credit van <UNK> and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors slightly different sets and color br br anne <UNK> is attractive but lacks janet <UNK> <UNK> determination to become a respectable middle class woman and <UNK> is younger than leigh who brought to her <UNK> attempt to marry and settle down the desperation of a woman facing forty and <UNK> doesn't project anxiety the way leigh did the scene with the officer looking in her car window illustrates the weakness in the role in the original the officer asks is there something wrong leigh of course not am i acting as if something were wrong the officer <UNK> before <UNK> well frankly yes that exchange is <UNK> from the remake for the simple reason that <UNK> isn't nervous enough br br the worst change without a doubt is the <UNK> of vince vaughn for anthony <UNK> it may not be <UNK> fault who could match <UNK> in the role <UNK> is <UNK> bird like long <UNK> <UNK> in an <UNK> charming exterior that masks an inner <UNK> his every move eating candy corn with his <UNK> apple <UNK> and every <UNK> the faint laugh the <UNK> chuckle is spot on he just can't be improved upon vaughn brings to the role the presence of a short haired <UNK> guy who was just <UNK> as a lance <UNK> from the u s army to suggest his <UNK> all he can do is <UNK> a <UNK> giggle on top of what appears otherwise a perfectly normal norman in speech and manner unlike the original norman vaughn doesn't even stumble over the word <UNK> because it resembles <UNK> he could be just hanging around the motel waiting to hear about his <UNK> for a football <UNK> to <UNK> br br the direction deserves a few comments i don't see what it adds to the story when we see norman <UNK> while <UNK> in on anne <UNK> i don't object to it i wonder why it's there just as i wonder why the rest of the movie is there br br and i suppose in order to impress us with how much color adds to the visual experience van <UNK> seems to have missed a bit of hitchcock's more subtle stuff <UNK> is given underwear of all different colors green pink orange and <UNK> is that a color if so what the hell color is it never mind the point is that in the original when the traveling camera first <UNK> through the window of the phoenix hotel it captures janet leigh in bed wearing a pure white half slip and a white <UNK> later after she has stolen the money we see her in her underwear again this time both her slip and <UNK> are black <UNK> a small thing but <UNK> own br br at that the idea of shooting in color might not have been bad except that the black and white shooting of the original was superb the color and odd lighting effects in this version turn the ordinary dull and <UNK> ominous motel into something that looks like it belongs in the <UNK> part of las vegas br br most of all the 1960 film was shocking in more ways than one i can remember seeing it in a drive in in san diego and staring <UNK> at the screen when it became clear that the central character was actually dead half way through the movie nothing like it had ever been done before br br that murder in the shower in both movies was a big improvement over robert original novel by the way in which the author writes something like the murderer then entered the bathroom and cut off her head with a knife i'm not making that up well not entirely even here van <UNK> movie gives us excess there is more blood and more bare flesh and where hitchcock closed in first on the blood <UNK> the <UNK> drain and <UNK> to <UNK> open eye then pulled the camera back slowly to reveal her face he <UNK> his camera from a slight <UNK> to the proper <UNK> giving the viewer a sense of not just disbelief at the murder but a <UNK> disbelief van <UNK> doesn't <UNK> his camera a delicate 10 or 20 degrees as hitchcock did he practically <UNK> it on its <UNK> br br it won't do to call this a bow to hitchcock because it's not it's a <UNK> of hitchcock's material already ripped off in psycho i ii iii iv and psycho the beginning years and come into my <UNK> mrs <UNK> revenge and hand me that knife would you the true story of norman bates a <UNK> of and <UNK> away at truly original stuff a act if not a criminal one and that's not to mention the many <UNK> in other films especially the french such as the notorious ocean of boredom scenes between marcel and <UNK> in the much admired la mere de la <UNK> maybe i'd better add that that last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics and when a <UNK> guts <UNK> corn it's a act i won't go on except to say these gags <UNK> as they are are more fun than the movie br br so who was it made for i'd have to guess kids who are too young to know about the original and who don't like movies in black and white kids who are hoping to see another ordinary slasher movie <UNK>
<START> this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that is bad it was done to illustrate character <UNK> of the main character consequently if you are not into <UNK> this is not your movie it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile if you liked <UNK> <UNK> and punishment you will probably like this if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the movie <UNK> is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his <UNK> ideas for another set the new ideas are quite opposed to the status <UNK> if you are a conservative you will not like this movie br br besides other philosophical questions i must admit that the movie was quite <UNK> pleasing as well the <UNK> and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start also there was use of symbolism in representing the of the main characters if these sorts of things do not impress you skip it overall i give this movie a 7

<START> when i saw this film it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had mostly filled with robots br br i can relate to problems and i have a similarity to <UNK> and this is a great film to watch if you're a <UNK> who is bitter and eccentric like me all in all watch it before it's out of print
<START> proof if ever more was needed that an action movie <UNK> of its budget can look better with more <UNK> or cameras closer shots and many more cuts the generation has moved on to john woo deep fault could be better for a work over in the cutting room ray
<START> i have to admit that although i'm a fan of shakespeare i was never really familiar with this play and what i really can't say is whether this is a poor adaptation or whether the play is just a bad choice for film there are some nice pieces of business in it but the execution is very clunky and the plot is obvious the theme of the play is on the nature of debt using the financial idea of debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional questions that becomes clear when the issue of the rings becomes more important than the business with <UNK> which unfortunately <UNK> into garden variety anti despite the <UNK> best attempts to salvage him with a couple nice monologues br br outside of jeremy <UNK> turn i didn't think there was a decent performance in the bunch <UNK> <UNK> consists of a slight <UNK> added to the end of every <UNK> and some of the better <UNK> scenes are reduced to variations on the standard pacino gets angry scene that his fans know and love but <UNK> collins is outright embarrassing to the point where i would have thought they would have screen tested her right out of the picture early on when she goes <UNK> as a man it's hard not to laugh at all the things we're not supposed to laugh at with joseph <UNK> standing there trying to look sincere and complicated it's hard not to make devastating comparisons to gwyneth <UNK> performance in shakespeare in love the big problem however that over rides everything in this film is just a lack of emotional focus it's really hard to tell whether this film is trying to be a somewhat serious comedy or a strangely silly drama surely a good summer stock performance would <UNK> more laughs from the material than this somber production the actors seem embarrassed to be attempting humor and unsure of where to place dramatic and comedic emphasis all of this is basically the fault of the director michael <UNK> who seems to think that the material is a great deal <UNK> than it appears to me
<START> crystal voyager is a strange documentary about an eccentric <UNK> living in australia an american by birth george has <UNK> and photographed himself friends and recently <UNK> in australia for 35 years all using various re invented cameras which he either <UNK> on his back board or boat in the mid 70s he teamed up with surf <UNK> editor and budding film maker david to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography the 75 minute feature crystal voyager is the result even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film neither surf ing movie nor surf movie because george <UNK> about on a children's <UNK> board not a real <UNK> it <UNK> the tedious <UNK> of george occasionally so dry or <UNK> that it was actually funny like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something with a spectacular <UNK> are <UNK> power <UNK> through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to pink <UNK> music in 1974 when the sydney opera house opened it also contained a cinema crystal voyager was <UNK> in there as an arty <UNK> oz <UNK> and by <UNK> became a hit as the house cost far more than a movie ticket audiences <UNK> to see this film as an excuse to <UNK> been to the sydney opera <UNK> so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show <UNK> this created this myth that the film was a huge crowd and the reputation spread as a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon fantastic planet and had a <UNK> run through the uk and europe as a double feature i ran it at a <UNK> cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather <UNK> about it all recently george has re emerged lord of the flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called <UNK> <UNK> that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild <UNK> of byron bay it is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min <UNK> george did <UNK> short each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the <UNK> in january 2005 all of which makes crystal voyager a <UNK> had to have been <UNK> <UNK> all those years ago however at a special oz surf night at an <UNK> cinema last year 2000 people turned up but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films so the damned thing another box office <UNK> how many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation however since 1975 has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many <UNK> australian and international films look up no <UNK> or <UNK> or undercover or rabbit proof fence or love in <UNK> for clear and present applause at his achievements george however is still floating around out there somewhere <UNK> away and looking for something else to film or drop a camera on
<START> i blow hot and cold over <UNK> he really can be a puzzle for me i think perhaps his inspiration left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation certainly a man who came to maturity in the thirties with the popular front seems ill at ease in the france of the fifties with its rampant <UNK> and heavy american influence he is almost thirty years older than his young stars and it shows the party scenes go on much longer than they should as if he were trying to buy time for the <UNK> scenario to work <UNK> character he plays <UNK> older brother seems to exist only to <UNK> the director that his old style ideas are still sound br br at two hours this picture is far too long still let me praise <UNK> <UNK> for her game performance she was a natural who should have challenged <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> supremacy but somehow lost her way <UNK> is excellent too as the girl who gets pregnant and wants to marry her and make her baby legitimate yes they still thought that way in the fifties <UNK> is the only french actor who could play an <UNK> convincingly he is great here as he <UNK> a cat from death then remarks he can't stand cats jacques only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor with that constant little grin and those blank eyes
<START> excellent cast story line performances totally believable i realize the close <UNK> group that <UNK> the marine <UNK> but this movie brought fear to my heart the marines let principles be damned it seems that this film was based on real life incidents it shows how difficult it is to go up against the establishment anne <UNK> was utterly convincing sam <UNK> portrayal of a <UNK> ho marine was <UNK> and eric <UNK> as her attorney was so <UNK> <UNK> his loyalty to the <UNK> but also his loyalty to his client while high above on his <UNK> he knew what his true course of action had to be but he was pulled apart by his <UNK> in the marine tradition loyalty to the <UNK> above all else i sat <UNK> to the tv screen all in all i give this one a <UNK> 9 out of 10
<START> mr accident is a deliberate series of non stop disasters and near death experiences reminiscent of saturday warner brothers cartoons like the <UNK> who falls off the cliff 5 times per episode the leading man more like an over grown <UNK> child always manages to <UNK> his meeting with the <UNK> <UNK> br br this australian surprise is <UNK> unfunny and at times even depressing the 2 out of ten are is for the visual stunts some never attempted by anyone since <UNK> duck and the use of vivid colors like in those high class national <UNK> commercials br br there may be an age <UNK> where this comedy finds a following i have definitely passed that age long ago calling all <UNK> here's a ha ha for ya
<START> this movie had potential to be a good little high school thriller instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat <UNK> the problem was there were too many unnecessary things a fight with the boyfriend random friends coming over to be killed it was obvious they were just killing time the main character was bland and uninteresting <UNK> bell had no emotion during this movie she was just there another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat the children survive so it's obvious they are going to let jill survive the only reason this got a four was because the last ten minutes when the killer finally comes out is actually exciting br br 4 10
<START> from the get go you won't be able to look away and you won't want to the melancholy of no is one of the most entertaining <UNK> i've seen in a long time if you can look away from the insane and sometimes perverse humor it's easy to find a brilliantly constructed and masterfully executed work br br part of the brilliance comes from the fact that the episodes are not in <UNK> order so you may not understand some of the things they talk about at first but as the series progresses you'll find yourself saying ah so that's what they meant even though this might confuse some people after watching the show you'll be hard pressed to make a case against telling the story in this fashion br br after all the focus is on the characters the title character is by far one of the most eccentric <UNK> of any anime ever her opening speech to her class in which she declares she is not interested in normal humans and is searching for aliens and time <UNK> is absolutely bizarre but she's lovable that way br br then there's the normal guy who is pulled into the madness surrounding san he's the narrator and his quick wit always makes the scene that much more entertaining he finds himself caught in the middle of various <UNK> all trying to influence and the other three characters are <UNK> of these <UNK> ironically they are the very beings is searching for and yet they cannot reveal themselves to her br br the first is <UNK> a quiet girl who happens to be the only member of the school literary club and also a representative of the <UNK> thought <UNK> she is basically an alien though the best description of her is a computer program in a human body her purely <UNK> <UNK> make her <UNK> deadpan and always make you think there's more than meets the eye then there's the time <UNK> who happens to be incredibly cute a major <UNK> and the subject of plans to <UNK> her club the <UNK> <UNK> to the world the end result is that does things to her that border on sexual <UNK> making her dress up in fetish uniforms the final character is the <UNK> and <UNK> optimistic <UNK> who happens to be though he can only use his powers in certain conditions br br the end result of all these characters is a comedy unlike any other that is both crude and deep and always brilliant don't believe me watch the first episode their student film you'll see what i mean
<START> this movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies i have seen the acting was utterly superb and when i wasn't <UNK> my tears i enjoyed meryl streep who's performance was extraordinary the movie deals with the <UNK> of a distant family <UNK> with a mother who develops <UNK> cancer the movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking the soundtrack fits this movie to a <UNK> <UNK> bette midler out of 5 stars i give this one 4 1 2
<START> i saw this episode of masterpiece theatre and immediately came to imdb to look it up i was <UNK> by a comment from another user who believed that it was nothing special a 6 out of 10 and <UNK> i would feel morally <UNK> if i didn't disagree br br now i am an avid fan of masterpiece theatre but <UNK> the stories can be a bit silly on television for example he knew he was right was absolutely horrendous <UNK> war however is probably the best i've seen so far the entire cast does an excellent job and it held my interest more than any other piece i've seen recently the character mr evans is of particular interest and through subtle images of for example an <UNK> birthday cake or a ring my opinion of him went from bad to truly good truly his ultimate demise and the story of how everyone around him left him a cold hard man is what brought out the bittersweet in this story for me br br the end is <UNK> in every sense but one that everyone did not get what they deserved but overall things worked out i absolutely recommend this to everyone
<START> pity the poor reviewer who disliked didn't understand this wonderful film what a sad life he must lead br br this movie has more to say about life and relationships than most i've ever seen yet it's not dark or preachy like the ordinary people type of film it is mostly humorous though not technically a comedy br br the whole thing feels a little like a fantasy perhaps <UNK> <UNK> dream beautiful intelligent women abound with wonderful cinematography and a non insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat br br i look forward to seeing it every time this film is re run on cable it's like re reading a favorite <UNK> book
<START> this game was terrible i think they worked too hard on the visuals and didn't do much with the <UNK> which is the most important part i mean the visuals look incredible but is the game really fun no i mean it's like hey let's jump off buildings and all i'm doing is holding up and a x the game play just isn't there and i don't agree with what did because they had this hot girl the producer of the game <UNK> raymond and they were like ok we've got this hot girl let's <UNK> her and if you go to <UNK> <UNK> you're not gonna see <UNK> stuff of <UNK> <UNK> you'll see her face with a <UNK> and it'll be like we interviewed <UNK> raymond about her favorite <UNK> it's like man shut the f k up who cares apparently a lot of people do because they bought the game and like it i mean compare this game with super mario galaxy a <UNK> game that really doesn't abuse the <UNK> remote but still is very innovative and delivers in the most important part <UNK> they were able to do a bit of everything with mario galaxy the graphics were still stunning the music in the game was <UNK> and sounded amazing and that's a game that deserves game of the year not <UNK> <UNK> man it doesn't even deserve to even be a <UNK> for game of the year the hype around this game where it was like oh it's the next generation of <UNK> really i think not so let me get this straight here because i think the people liking this game are only liking it because they're <UNK> fans so i'll tell you guys <UNK> will not make out with you or anything if you love or defend this game if you want a real game on the <UNK> get <UNK> <UNK> fortune if you want a real game for the <UNK> <UNK> get call of duty 4 and a ton of other games too and if you want a real game just in all the systems get super mario galaxy i know this comment will be hated by many but seriously <UNK> two buttons for doing all this cool stuff is that really a fun game the only reason why other games make it more complicated is because after it'll end up being more innovative and fun and this game just isn't it br br 1 3 10 a living hell
<START> i must say that i wasn't impressed at all probably because i was expecting much more from this movie maybe an accent on religion vs science or on the meaning of life not just a few lines so if you expect something to think about after you see this movie don't it's more psychological than philosophical i vote 4 because of the end it <UNK> up a bit and because i have a great respect for bbc documentaries there are a couple of very interesting scenes that actually gave some sense it was a brilliant idea to add it in a movie related to theory of evolution too bad that this wasn't the main subject ah i just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour the movie is quite boring and in a way cruel
<START> this documentary about the life and comedy of bill <UNK> features bits from revelations and other stand up <UNK> it also features interviews with fellow comedians and people in the industry who knew him as well as <UNK> and <UNK> who talk about how his political commentary was raw and brutal br br i enjoyed it very much i had already seen revelations but the comedy clips were still refreshing it's a nice balance of comedy and documentary that will explain popularity to non fans and please those who are already familiar with him br br i rated it a ten
<START> let me break down this film for you br br the first fifteen minutes are a showcase for terrible special effects i'm not one to <UNK> about special effects but what you've got to understand is that if you can't afford good special effects you shouldn't anchor your film around special effects <UNK> fire <UNK> of color at each other <UNK> into stock explosions and <UNK> past <UNK> with <UNK> counts low enough to count with your fingers you will have no idea what is happening it will not make sense br br the second act involves a woman walking in the desert at this point you will be treated to drab scenery and illogical boring fight scenes nobody speaks nothing interesting happens the <UNK> goals are unclear and are not very compelling this goes on for about 45 minutes br br then in a five minute montage she <UNK> into an enemy base <UNK> herself to a rocket tries to destroy a <UNK> weapon fails and dies br br none of this has any bearing on the eventual direction of the film br br in the last twenty minutes basically the <UNK> memories get transferred to her daughter who goes into <UNK> for a very large number of years learning the secrets of mankind after this we see the first and last five minute segment of human interaction in the film then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not you know because when the universe is <UNK> you get to decide if you want to be a part of it br br she chooses yes but the memories of mankind survive in a capsule maybe we won't make the same mistakes again huh if you like movies with characters then this is not a good movie for you the lead roles could have been <UNK> nicely by any old wind up toy capable of staying right side up while walking through sand all of the story is told through painfully dull narration br br the film tries to seem deep by throwing together a whole bunch of undeveloped science fiction ideas there are enough concepts here to fuel a number of films but as it stands it's <UNK> with completely irrelevant details two thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45 second montage instead the narrator fills in a worth of <UNK> without ever giving us a reason to care what happens to the characters br br there are good ideas in here but nobody watches films to see ideas <UNK> explained people watched films to be entertained this film does not entertain
<START> the reviews for rendition generally haven't been <UNK> so i waited until it moved to the local <UNK> theatre to see it the film tells the story of <UNK> el an american egyptian scientist who is <UNK> from his international flight and <UNK> in for <UNK> after a strange coincidence <UNK> him to a recent terrorist attack in an <UNK> north african country not as bad as i'd feared it's an interesting and thought provoking entry in the ripped from the <UNK> thriller genre br br the film ultimately asks tough questions concerning u s methods of <UNK> information from political prisoners is crossing the <UNK> line of openly <UNK> torture on suspected terrorists something our country should be doing does it <UNK> useful information that helps save lives if so at what cost what sort of monsters do we create when innocent people are taken prisoner and tortured by <UNK> the use of torture what sort of monster do we as a country become it's always disappointing when a film with such provocative material is sloppy with some of the details that make good films great for example i'd like to have <UNK> with wife who spends the entire film trying to track him down but the only <UNK> personality <UNK> she's given is an advanced state of <UNK> rendition also seems to imply that arab women who don't go along with their <UNK> arranged <UNK> are only asking for trouble and there's a poorly conceived <UNK> kept by another of the film's main characters that too conveniently spells out in great detail all the information his love interest just happens to be in <UNK> need of at that particular moment i laughed out loud when the moment should have been filled with dread br br the film features a good central performance by jake <UNK> and strong but too brief appearances by hollywood veterans meryl streep and alan arkin as well as impressive turns by omar as <UNK> el and also by actors and all of whom i would much enjoy seeing in future films that have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism good luck to them the five or so stories rendition follows are woven together nicely until the filmmakers insert a slight but effective twist that finally <UNK> to the never ending cycle of carnage that violent attacks of terror
<START> this film is so unbelievably awful everything about it was rubbish you cant say anything good about this film the acting script directing effects are all just as bad as each other even ed wood could have done a better job than this i seriously recommended staying away from this movie unless you want to waste about of your life or however long the film was i forget this is the first time i wrote a comment about a film on imdb but this film was just on tv and i had to let the world of movie lovers know that this film sucked balls so if you have any decency left in you go and rent a much better bad movie like <UNK> 3
<START> public enemies is a kind of throw back to those early 1960's gangster <UNK> like portrait of a mobster mad dog and king of the roaring <UNK> although made on the cheap the film has a great deal of energy and the acting over all particularly by eric roberts and frank stallone is quite good <UNK> russell might seem too glamorous as ma but she has some very good moments there are two action scenes worth noting a shoot out in a hotel and a machine gun fight in the middle of the street between the <UNK> and the fbi both sequences are nicely done and compared to other low gangster junk like dillinger and <UNK> this film shines
<START> you would think that a film that starred three of the biggest male film stars of the post world war ii era would have become a classic these three who also happen to be three favorites of mine walk around in a <UNK> looking like they'd rather be any place but there br br the sad thing is that the way west definitely had some potential to be a classic in these days of political correctness a film about american <UNK> and the <UNK> of their <UNK> is something not done now it should have been better done back then br br kirk douglas is a former united states senator who's heading a <UNK> train west to build a <UNK> in valley being he's an ex politician he rates above the <UNK> he's leading the script calls for him to have not only a covered <UNK> but a <UNK> to lead the train br br you think that's ludicrous you ought to see the <UNK> scene where douglas orders his black servant played by roy glenn to whip him i won't spoil it by saying what causes douglas to demand this of glenn but trust me it's bad br br robert mitchum is the trail guide and of the three stars he looks the most bored there was supposed to be considerable <UNK> on the set between widmark and douglas but mitchum just through the film above it all br br maybe the <UNK> helped somewhat because the movie calls for douglas a widower to have an eye on mrs widmark played by lola <UNK> now she's the best looking thing in the movie br br the film billing says introducing sally field this was made in between her <UNK> and her flying nun days she plays a piece of white southern trash with the musical comedy name of mercy we first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents <UNK> legs <UNK> and <UNK> of course she gets taken up on her <UNK> br br her character is something like what's found in every trailer park in america and then again what was a <UNK> train but one large trailer park on the move br br despite this film sally field went on to a two oscar career what that woman had to overcome br br victor <UNK> son andrew directed this item and together with a lousy script turned this into a turgid mess shame on andrew mclaglen he's certainly done better in his career br br and so will you unless you're a <UNK>
<START> this movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people there are only three locations the school the store and the <UNK> house that are really used it's primarily at the <UNK> house however a movie doesn't need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself br br four friends who had <UNK> during their basketball days meet up one is rich important and has no real love outside of money one wants to be mayor again but his competition is turning him sour one wants to be <UNK> of the school and take care of his family one is a traveling alcoholic br br first off i love the actors in this film they've all been household names to me they proved their worth here br br one of the most pivotal moments is when tom played by gary <UNK> blows up on the coach he yells and <UNK> about how the coach cheated in the winning game his blows the <UNK> <UNK> and yells back his <UNK> forgive me father for i have <UNK> it's amazing to watch with energy that just chills you br br highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn't need shiny effects to interest them
<START> i have seen this movie three times going back to <UNK> in the 1980's and again on the channel last night <UNK> 11 <UNK> based on a true story which i remember being in the news during the early 1980's i've decided that i find it too disturbing to watch ever again yet it's hard to look away from a car accident the <UNK> character is joshua john miller who plays reeves little brother br br the story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the internet just <UNK> it it's about anthony jacques who murdered <UNK> conrad in california in 1981 the characters portray generation x pre <UNK> borderline <UNK> with the exception of reeves who grows a conscience br br old hippies did a great job raising that generation br br for such a young kid i thought joshua miller was excellent as the serial killer in the making character in <UNK> he went to <UNK> and has written screenplays as well as directed his acting <UNK> in this film were amazing just the way he treats his little sister by drowning her doll and <UNK> up her dolls grave gave me the <UNK> it gave me nightmares even with whats happening in our world today in <UNK> it still is the most <UNK> film i've seen to date br br the <UNK> and <UNK> of these families is enough to make one <UNK> this thrill kill almost makes the <UNK> murders pale in comparison br br glover got a little too much into character he wound up on david to discuss his role and almost kicked the host in the head glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character br br also fight the good fight to the great dennis hopper you're one of the best
<START> it has carla <UNK> and a crappy ending boo br br jaded is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past <UNK> there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun but one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her <UNK> the second girl holds her down she is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital after that we spend the rest of the movie watching her attempting to bring down the two girls and at the same time learn some new info about who she is and where she comes from and a bit about her past br br director and co writer does an excellent job with this movie considering its uber low budget it hand held and sometimes looks like <UNK> but it fits the movie since the story demands a harsh look to it the actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and there's not really anything to complain about it the standout feature in the movie is of course carla who <UNK> it all in this movie she is actually more nude in this movie than she is in sin city christopher <UNK> is also in the movie but his character is really kinda pointless but he is fun to watch i didn't really pay much attention to the music since it doesn't really draw attention to itself but it gets the job done with what it's got the movie is r rated and it's that for a very good reason it's very sexual and very graphic at times it's essentially borders on soft core at times but the sex scenes are necessary for the movie so it doesn't feel like it's just there for the sake of being there although there is one pointless scene where we see chris <UNK> getting it on that scene was a tad pointless but it's not really much of a problem i guess the only fault with the movie is that we don't get to see the court trial after all that we go through in the movie it's like having sex and not having an <UNK> or something br br it's a shame that the talented has never made a feature film since this this is a highly gifted woman can do great things with a very little budget i really hope that she gets back in the game soon because she is an amazing director jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema instead what we have is an enjoyable movie that shows a great director in the making br br hide the kids and close the <UNK> you don't want people to think you're watching porn <UNK> watching this movie
<START> by the numbers oscar hungry biopic about the late great singer ray charles there is one exactly one great scene in ray it occurs during a flashback to <UNK> youth after the boy become completely blind running into the <UNK> house which he shares with his mother he <UNK> over a chair and <UNK> on the floor he cries out for his mother she in keeping with her philosophy that a person should stand on their own two feet <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> from the kitchen waiting to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources the boy proves to be up to the challenge using his ears and memory to locate a <UNK> on a <UNK> a nearby fire pit the grass blowing in the wind outside of a window the <UNK> of a <UNK> across the <UNK> board floor br br the movie pauses here it <UNK> it <UNK> even if for only 40 seconds the scene is a much needed <UNK> from taylor otherwise <UNK> film by <UNK> i'm not referring to the music which is of course excellent i am referring to the sound effects big <UNK> <UNK> yet another flashback and the inane dialog i'm speaking to you as a friend ray etc on the visual side is equally and <UNK> flashy <UNK> colored <UNK> over the camera <UNK> during the flashbacks <UNK> <UNK> from the camera <UNK> etc etc all the modern <UNK> what a horrible cinematic style is displayed in ray a style all too common in wanna be important movies from the past decade or so <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> very similar to this movie these gimmicks are employed to the cliché ridden screenplay some of us won't be fooled br br some of us also are not quite prepared to accept jamie <UNK> performance as anything more than superb <UNK> granted foxx <UNK> resembles ray charles he walks like charles talks like charles and even <UNK> like charles <UNK> imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect i'm not <UNK> mr foxx his oscar he deserved it it was a pretty weak field this year anyway but one wonders if foxx really understands charles the actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the <UNK> that his band mates are shooting up he <UNK> if only for a brief moment a disgust at the <UNK> of being blind and a life of darkness the movie seems to want to <UNK> the struggle within charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin with his <UNK> as the <UNK> between those two but the damn movie just won't take the time it <UNK> along from triumph to triumph never really <UNK> for any insight into the man one has to stretch to find the dramatic tension one must supply the drama for the movie one must in other words imagine a better movie than this one br br in its rush toward a glorious conclusion ray introduces then <UNK> several excellent ideas for a movie his early days on the circuit his bold musical <UNK> for the atlantic label the problem of his addiction to heroin the inevitable artistic <UNK> attendant upon overwhelming success the man's importance to the civil rights struggle touched on in the movie for oh about 3 minutes of screen time and much more the filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements two and a half hours of watching a man overcome one <UNK> after another may make us feel good but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art this sort of approach certainly provides no deeper insight into the film's subject and shouldn't insight be the real goal of a movie like this if i had wanted a <UNK> list of ray <UNK> <UNK> i'd have simply <UNK> him br br 3 stars out of 10 the extra 2 stars strictly for the music
<START> this movie has some of the best dialogue ever written the really good lines are all given to george c scott a man who knew what to do with a <UNK> piece of dialogue i just saw this movie again for the first time in 20 years and the dialogue is as good as ever the bizarre goings on at the hospital are so imaginative as to <UNK> you they frequently involve such marvelous poetic justice as to be near <UNK> of genius i love this movie
<START> if i compare two films with <UNK> cohen <UNK> and ali g then ali g is <UNK> better <UNK> no master piece but it's a film at least <UNK> is complete garbage and i do not understand how it rated better then ali g br br i cannot put my finger on it there something wrong with the ali g script half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old not by an adult scriptwriter and a number of jokes including mr <UNK> lower body are quite tasteless br br but the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny such as how ali g becomes a member of government for doing something <UNK> and stupid in the public sadly true in today's western society people get careers for doing stupid things in public also advice about immigrant policy and some others br br ali g overall remains a sympathetic character even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age but it's ok to watch it's quite funny br br but never ever watch <UNK> it's awful and makes every intelligent sick

<START> jack <UNK> portrayal of the marine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> new <UNK> in basic training requires no interpretation straight forward direct up front are all <UNK> to this classic in a time when <UNK> the statements of our leaders is a necessity in order to understand what they are saying this movie that plays no games with our language or our moral <UNK> right and wrong are clear and easily defined if you like clear well understood dialog in a <UNK> military setting this movie should suit you
<START> film <UNK> is a genre that requires a certain level of <UNK> <UNK> intellect and imagery this movie has none of that though they really tried hard with the imagery br br it's the kind of movie that your cousin <UNK> the dump truck driver who's always talking about how he's going to make it big in the movies someday would make br br the dialogue is wooden and lifeless the visuals while obviously expensive to make are the work of a director who has tried to be clever and failed miserably due to a severe lack in cerebral ability the acting <UNK> from sub par to just plain bad the story might have been <UNK> by a real writer and director but i suspect that such people would not have touched it with a <UNK> pole br br about 1 4 of the way through i noticed striking similarities with the scene in where <UNK> desperate to be rid of his actress makes the world's worst movie i figured i'd check imdb to see if a similar effect has occurred in this movie and to my surprise it has i'd almost be tempted to give a 2 out of 10 just because it's exposed the pretentious <UNK> but i won't it's that bad
<START> doll master is an example of a lousy horror film fallen somewhere in the space with it's two not so well established genres a horror film and an emotional drama film seems like the doll master tries very hard to be a very scary horror film but it fails the noise of the dolls while moving is like taken from the of in <UNK> on and the <UNK> are like esquire the killing dolls will remember you a cute version of <UNK> but compared to child's play this film is more superb but the story seems a nothing the brilliant camera shots and the brilliance of acting was taken away cause of the plot br br watch this if you are expecting great shocks
<START> yes i know <UNK> <UNK> didn't like to be called <UNK> but i couldn't resist the joke br br this is a fine lloyd hamilton short from his peak period directed by <UNK> the two work together with lots of good gags and usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting <UNK> uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera <UNK> to tell his story and to show ham as a fine actor as well as a talented comedian br br this story plays with some interesting themes like <UNK> classic move along here it's about <UNK> of reality and the confusion that movies make of them or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off
<START> director and playwright richard day adapted his own stage material for the screen clearly inspired by rock <UNK> real life dilemma from the 1950s what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual marry him off to an unsuspecting woman in order to <UNK> the <UNK> and keep him working <UNK> thin idea given some energy by the good cast and retro production design which <UNK> resembles a <UNK> card by <UNK> the dialogue isn't very clever and there's some slapstick <UNK> around near the beginning which fails to work spitting out food etc still when a serious tone comes over the final act it is handled with great taste and is far more welcomed by the viewer than all the <UNK> silliness matt does good work as movie hero male whore guy stone but are his experiences here enough to <UNK> his character or would he be right back at the bar the next night the movie seems not to know or care day wants to get off a few one liners and one carefully written pro gay speech a <UNK> for tolerance but he has no other agenda for audiences who <UNK> their time and interest in these people the sentimental bow on this thing can look like nothing more than a prank 1 2 from
<START> oh god why i am <UNK> at the sheer <UNK> of this delicious nonsense as if all that makes sense well like this film from bottom <UNK> poverty row of 1940s hollywood nothing in this door <UNK> horror made on three sets makes much sense except the <UNK> of dr <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> after some piano <UNK> daughter who has big <UNK> and a it is just terrible and even has a gorilla and a big dog for pointless added <UNK> more than elephant man and that is just at <UNK> minutes the monster maker is the sort of film kids in 2005 just <UNK> at with disbelief and wonder what the hell their grandparents saw in their youth that made them the lovable movie <UNK> they are today i guess you just had to be there in 1944 or whenever the hell this mad drivel was shown to <UNK> 13 year olds in glorious 3000 seat <UNK> movie <UNK> on a wet day somehow it was made for no reason by movie <UNK> <UNK> pictures in the war years by escaped german <UNK> who knew who to make a film since they got out of europe as the nazis advanced on <UNK> studios the monster in this film like the mad scientist is actually a nazi nightmare

<START> i saw <UNK> todd on broadway in 1980 it starred george and featured most of the other cast principals who appeared in the national <UNK> company production which was <UNK> for tv in los angeles in 1982 last night i watched the new dvd release of the los angeles production although i have owned the <UNK> for many years the production and the performances could have hardly been better but the original age showed because both the audio and video quality are below modern standards even on a newly pressed dvd nevertheless i still give it 10 out of 10 because of the greatness of the work and george and <UNK> <UNK> wonderful performances even today my most memorable <UNK> from a live musical theater performance has to be rendition of these are my friends you'll <UNK> <UNK>
<START> it's now 2005 and 15 years since this cartoon first aired i haven't actually watched it seriously or closely in about 10 years now that i'm an adult in my 30s i can look back with a serious eye as i watch the episodes again br br in concept the cartoon is partly an homage to the classic looney tunes but also its own original show there are a few episodes that are structured like the old cartoons for example there is a singer that attacks buster and so he <UNK> revenge on this <UNK> concert exactly like the old bugs bunny cartoon the ensuing cartoon is similar to looney tunes just in a different era if you look at the old looney tunes they did an awful lot of stuff exactly like tiny <UNK> did the old looney tunes made a lot of social commentary and parody there were celebrity <UNK> there were a lot of corny period jokes <UNK> and dialog the comedy was surreal and wacky you can say this exactly for tiny <UNK> as well the comedy <UNK> is the same most definitely a <UNK> to the classics which hadn't been done well if at all in cartoons in the decades prior to this show we recognize the cultural references in tiny <UNK> and we can roll our eyes when something we don't like comes up but the reason we don't think looney tunes are corny is because we weren't alive back in the 40s also looney tunes was original back in those days but today cartoons are <UNK> over and over so it's easy to perceive tiny <UNK> in an unfair light due to our exposure to current events and our <UNK> to cartoons in general br br there certainly are differences in many respects the timing the delivery and obviously the duration of the shows they are two different styles from two different periods being done under two very different circumstances looney tunes being made for adults in theaters and tiny <UNK> being made for kids watching tv even so they did a good job making an original show with original gags and still paying homage to and after the comedy <UNK> of the old looney tunes br br since tiny <UNK> had a lot more time to play with they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration you only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3 the baby <UNK> toilet episode there are so many more for example one of the best comedy dialog <UNK> ever animated is in when <UNK> and buster are on the phone in a split screen hoping each misses the other the <UNK> is spectacular notably the character development in this episode and in several others usually the ones penned by deanna oliver or <UNK> <UNK> is rather good the female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period br br this was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture <UNK> and self <UNK> humor this was way ahead of its time tiny <UNK> really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids yes i loved transformers and <UNK> but tiny <UNK> totally jumped away from all that it was a breath of fresh air bakshi's new adventures of mighty mouse may have been a <UNK> but tiny <UNK> made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success br br as a kid i totally overlooked some jokes for example one episode is an homage to the marx brothers that i completely ignored as a teen now i have a <UNK> respect for it there are so many inspired gags that i never noticed that are genuinely brilliant it's that kind of comedy that makes me think of looney tunes and family guy i never noticed that kind of comedy as a kid i've been thinking this for most episodes i watched recently br br you'd notice these kinds of things if you actually watched the show unlike some other reviewers here who i know are unfairly judging it i've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly exposed both as a kid and as an adult br br you can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too i'm not talking about just the main characters but the side characters were done really well and <UNK> too but back to the main characters some of the main characters were brilliant <UNK> <UNK> had in my opinion her best performances in this cartoon she hasn't been the same since rob <UNK> also did some incredible stuff here too br br this is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes it had plenty it had a lot of mediocre ones too but by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch br br out of 10 i give the show an 8 5 and kudos for pushing the <UNK> and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons
<START> i must say one big reason why i thought the <UNK> was so great is because i love cats i love cats which probably gave this film a big score from me but not only that it was definitely a good movie as well and i love where they make the setting of the film take place this is one of my favorite animal films although it's animated and i really love how the actors actresses didn't sound so <UNK> behind the <UNK> <UNK> to me this film seems like a classic but i guess to imdb it's not because it has yes i think too low of a rating you take a <UNK> at all the other original disney films and they have a much higher rating than this but nonetheless <UNK> is one of the best animation movies there is and i could enjoy it over and over again
<START> cliché <UNK> is one of this film's main achievements when you hear a vague outline of the story  <UNK> students of mixed <UNK> sharing a flat in <UNK>  you predict a collection of euro stereotypes in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> du <UNK> in fact it's a finely judged comedy about a young frenchman <UNK> trying to make sense of human relationships there are some excellently observed minor roles the arrogant french <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> brother of the english girl <UNK> mother and some fine visual humour especially in the opening scenes mocking the complexity of the <UNK> <UNK> so what does <UNK> learn about relationships nothing positive in place of a <UNK> happy ending there is a <UNK> <UNK> finale about  <UNK> has all the friends he made nevertheless this highly enjoyable film deserves its great success i saw it in <UNK> with a mixed euro audience who enjoyed themselves hugely and even <UNK> at the end
<START> this film isn't a comedy its an expose i've always hated dog shows considering the ridiculous get ups people put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give them hence the reason for my <UNK> <UNK> while watching this film i get a kick out of something being taken so seriously even though the <UNK> are small and insignificant it's like <UNK> golf or jump <UNK> or the need to set some obscure world record the acting was much more <UNK> in this film than waiting for <UNK> and its mainly due to the more <UNK> of the characters who seem more comfortable with their specific acting partners in this film than the previous eugene levy was great as was michael and fred <UNK> however it was the dogs who eventually stole the show but then again who wants to see a bunch of humans in a film about dogs anyway
<START> el <UNK> the latin godfather while this seems to be a straight to dvd video type movie my copy obviously looked <UNK> so maybe this flick had a limited theatrical run and the title character appears to more of a <UNK> than <UNK> i am half pretty typical rise and fall of a movie with the a list of b list actors robert wagner drug lawyer kathleen <UNK> <UNK> judge tiny <UNK> mob <UNK> gary busey child rapist brad <UNK> white power <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> faye <UNK> <UNK> lawyer and make as an uncredited party guest this movie is pretty lame i only watched it to kill time before the <UNK> game the only thing that saved it was jennifer <UNK> as a crazed <UNK> drug dealing assassin she was over the top and sexy <UNK> that it was fun to watch her scenes not worth renting or seeking out d
<START> this is what happens when a franchise gets lazy and no one can think of a new twist to add remember what happened to the <UNK> play series the first three were played as horror films with genuine scares albeit predictable that held true to the theme of the movie then they ran out of folks for the doll to stalk and decided to play it for laughs with the next two being black comedies br br well that s what happened here but i think it was not meant to be like that kind of like saying i wanted to make <UNK> for <UNK> i did this on purpose when your <UNK> accidentally <UNK> flat but the milk was <UNK> and it had some value in the theaters as a goof br br when the floor ripped out from under the passenger seats i sort of expected the passengers to <UNK> their legs through the hole start running <UNK> style to safely land the plane in the <UNK> i did it would have fit into the silly campy theme of the rest of the show br br instead of pointing out the obvious physical <UNK> of the film what about the social <UNK> like having george <UNK> character react <UNK> to the news that his date was a whore even back in 1979 a man would not easily accept the notion that he has just <UNK> his heart out to a paid companion he supposedly felt he made a connection with a <UNK> spirit who is subsequently shown to be a <UNK> sex worker with a come on line who wouldn't feel cheated by the experience and yet he <UNK> and <UNK> his arms around his <UNK> <UNK> as they <UNK> <UNK> off what a cheap wrap up of a sleazy scene <UNK> br br i had an <UNK> for <UNK> and got served insipid cliché <UNK> and no you did not do it on purpose
<START> heath <UNK> acting in this film really bugs me but overall its a great watch bryan brown is excellent when i dont normally like him but then his whole gang are a great piece of work jimmy is a hapless wannabe gangster who cant seem to do a thing right spoilers loses money car and nearly <UNK> a bank robbery but still comes out on top br br didnt know what the two kids were in it for at the start but they ties some <UNK> together nicely br br all in all a damn fine piece of australian cinema 9 10
<START> a classic late 50's film the <UNK> <UNK> joan crawford and louis jordan are not at their best but the direction cinematography and acting of the younger cast are compelling in a 50's sense which i love br br the look and feel of the artsy over artsy contemporary film far from heaven reflects exactly this sort of film and i suspect this film may be one of the models a silly plot of course hey it's 1959 but as a film glorious as a reflection of the society extremely interesting and as witness to how hollywood breaks away from the idealistic portrayal of american sexual <UNK> fascinating
<START> many movies try to take universal themes and make a comedy but few will rise to the occasion like checking out the movie is brilliant the dialogue is well written and true to form the acting is absolutely <UNK> peter falk has given a truly great performance as an actor as an actor he is able to carry the cast to greatness another great performance is given by laura san <UNK> she is such an intriguing actress her performances take one by surprise she delivers no matter what role she is asked to give from <UNK> in stephen king's the stand to her television performances however checking out allows her to shine it is a role she is meant to play the film is brilliantly directed by jeff <UNK> he was able to bring out the best in his cast and his direction in every aspect made the film a wonderful treasure jeff <UNK> was able to make a difficult theme laughable and yet profound he gives us an up close and personal look at why indie films need to be made the directors knowledge of his cast and script are extended to the finished film the results are superb br br hopefully it will be made available to large audiences because this is one you won't want to miss it has the potential of being the sleeper hit of 2005 in the fashion of my big fat greek wedding
<START> and is a wonderful <UNK> of the <UNK> tradition <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his pirate friends the tone is lighthearted with a touch of social commentary but nothing too heavy one could almost see errol flynn and basil <UNK> in this br br it starts out in low gear with the introduction of the characters and the establishing of the themes of social <UNK> and rebellion but it kicks into high gear once the boys hit the <UNK> the <UNK> are grand and stylish with romantic touches that are the bread and <UNK> of <UNK> the actors are engaging and help elevate the material a bit which is fairly hollow there's not much depth to the figures but they are played with such charm and skill that it doesn't matter br br has been said about the modern music period music tended to the more <UNK> which seems out of place a classical score with <UNK> <UNK> for the action pieces could work but the more modern rebellious rock and <UNK> music seemed to add an edge to the action since the characters are more legend than reality accuracy in the music seems pointless the pieces tend to fit the mood of the aired scenes so it mostly works well i just wonder how they missed adam stand and deliver make no mistake this is not a serious film it's pure <UNK> and a wonderful <UNK> tony scott shows some of the visual flair of his father but i don't think we are going to see many oscar <UNK> in his career just yet he seems to understand the material here and pulls off a fine film with time he may prove to be a name to <UNK> with his father took a while to mature beyond visual <UNK> and become a more rounded director this is definitely one to watch for an entertaining evening or for a <UNK> film fest
<START> one true thing puts <UNK> in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to care for her dying mother streep somber and plodding the film studies the adult child coming to terms with the adult view of her parents as they are slowly revealed to be something less than the ideal she grew up knowing as a child an excellent character study and a find production with little to fault <UNK> offers three fine performances by a trio of top actors and some <UNK> <UNK> on life and death
<START> the student <UNK> is not a typical <UNK> movie sure the nudity and sexual <UNK> is there but it's not all for laughs stephanie scripted a socially compelling well written tits ass movie which confronts the topics of racism <UNK> economic rape abortion medical <UNK> public health issues human rights the vietnam war free love <UNK> and drug <UNK> four sexy college roommates are taking their <UNK> at the same time sharon <UNK> is assigned to the <UNK> care ward <UNK> farrell to public health administration <UNK> barbara leigh to and karen <UNK> to <UNK> these four <UNK> have ample opportunities to <UNK> and <UNK> of which they take advantage much to the delight of male viewers these are <UNK> women at the height of the sexual revolution after all and are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful visceral yet low budget action sequences are interspersed throughout there's a very bloody <UNK> at the resistance movement <UNK> in which two policemen are shot and killed along with several members of the group an anti vietnam war protest <UNK> of <UNK> dressed young people of all races painted like <UNK> becomes violent with cops beating <UNK> the effective trip sequence on the beach consists of beautiful weird and confusing <UNK> and memory montages with hyper sensual overtones in short the student <UNK> is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times expressed through real women's perspectives since it was written and directed by a woman but it's still fun and <UNK> despite its <UNK> treatment of subject matter
<START> i still can't believe that computer graphics are able to create 3d images the moment i heard it from my friends over at a forum i swear to myself that i am going to make myself watch it br br i managed to watch parts of it at a fellow shopping centre where they had many <UNK> children dvds and showed it at a few for sale obviously i was <UNK> but it was still not enough then i headed off to youtube com to search for the movie all i came up with was music video <UNK> until that <UNK> day i found it i watched it despite all the <UNK> because i knew that i have to watch or else i will be called a loser br br enough about me more on the movie as if final fantasy <UNK> wasn't enough they made a movie about it my most favourite part was the end of life <UNK> couldn't be better but i wouldn't entirely spoil the show for you you have to watch it for yourself get the dvd now
<START> this is a harrowing movie and it moves relentlessly still it is utterly unique among war films in that it focuses exclusively on the <UNK> experience the loss of humanity ordinary people <UNK> during wartime the two young married musicians <UNK> a slow <UNK> process of <UNK> at the hands of both sides of a civil war utterly stripped of sentimentality the film offers a bleak vision of the modern world and one i believe particularly recognizable to many europeans with brave intense performances by <UNK> never better and max von <UNK> likewise for my money the most <UNK> film bergman ever created
<START> starring ann <UNK> <UNK> forrest <UNK> damon donald <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> patricia smith directed by john <UNK> 12 months to live so little time to plan a future she would not share for the sake of her 10 children she must succeed br br <UNK> <UNK> ann <UNK> is the caring mother of 10 young children she is the loving wife of <UNK> <UNK> forrest a man almost crippled by <UNK> she is also dying stricken by a <UNK> illness she has only a few months left to live her husband tormented by the painful truth turns to the bottle and with a broken heart <UNK> is forced to accept that he will never be able to cope as a father alone br br and so for the sake of the children she loves so much the young mother must make an <UNK> decision br br inspired by real life events <UNK> will love my <UNK> is a tribute to one woman's courage and strength a story of sacrifice and of a dying mother's <UNK> love br br one of the best films that i have ever seen cried from start to finish
<START> despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes this entry the fourth feels tired <UNK> who directed the superb mermaid legend and the <UNK> japanese splatter film evil dead trap shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise br br a <UNK> becomes obsessed with an <UNK> conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot predictable stalking <UNK> assault and rape ensues br br the <UNK> of roman porno is sex and sex mixed with violence both potentially exciting subjects to be sure but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh a masturbation scene in which a woman forces <UNK> up her opening via <UNK> is too little <UNK> to late br br the <UNK> rain <UNK> continues and the film's final scene brings relief
<START> i saw this movie at the philadelphia film festival today and enjoyed it overall it is an interesting and <UNK> analysis of the all too common revelation that our <UNK> marriage was more flawed and difficult than we originally imagined in addition this movie is an excellent example of process of discovering truths about our <UNK> lives after their death and the issues associated with that however i found the sound quality recording and editing to be relatively poor and annoying it may very well have been related to the specific theater and projection conditions i am not a film maker student or anything and claim no real understanding of the sound production process but as a <UNK> i found the audio portion of the movie distracting specifically i heard very unpleasant lip <UNK> noises through out especially one long interview with the younger sister the film and often the background noise level was higher in volume than people's voices for example the scene when a small group was <UNK> through the mothers papers has anyone else seen this movie noticed anything about the sound thanks

<START> i am definitely not a <UNK> but a couple people in my family and my boyfriend are so a little reluctantly i decided to find out what the big deal was with fantasy stuff i saw <UNK> rising and thought it was hilarious it's slapstick but not <UNK> to those that enjoy role playing games also and most importantly people who've never before can enjoy it and not feel left out or lost trying to understand the plot the acting was great and the field shots set were believable this makes me want to see other movies by this production company i can't wait to see what the future holds for this group three cheers well done
<START> this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see it started of as a few commercials with a <UNK> bunch at football matches then they made a movie out of it the leads are not pros and you can see that but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away br br <UNK> is known for making crappy movies no offense but i had a good feeling about this one even <UNK> i'm not interested in football i wanted 2 see it the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep <UNK> up there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them if you're ever gonna see a norwegian movie let it be this one

<START> <UNK> with <UNK> by most critics when it first appeared has recently done the rounds of uk tv i remember seeing it on its original release and thinking then that if hitchcock wanted to parade some kind of screen confession about his <UNK> he couldn't have found a <UNK> little vehicle to do so br br but time <UNK> perspective and so what was <UNK> bad in 1972 might all these years later be worthy of <UNK> re <UNK> br br might but not is <UNK> the <UNK> of an <UNK> director who desperately wanted to exploit the artistic freedom of 70s movie making without seeming to realise that freedom <UNK> its own <UNK> notably the need to bring integrity to one's work br br there's none here and not much evidence of the earlier directorial brilliance either the switch from spine <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> explicit is neither shocking nor for a supreme <UNK> stylish it's just banal the prolonged murder scene is precisely that prolonged without pace without reason without purpose other than the <UNK> of directorial desires to appear as contemporary an <UNK> as say that other acclaimed <UNK> of cheap sleaze michael winner br br and it goes from bad to worse with dialog that defies any human <UNK> not least in the ludicrous <UNK> into the home life of our dear wooden inspector and his wife's cooking br br perhaps the scene that best sums up and <UNK> as the most explicit <UNK> of hitchcock's persona is the <UNK> exchange between two lawyers in a bar where they discuss the serial killings and then agree that at least the women had a good time first by being raped br br i remember my <UNK> at that scene back in <UNK> and it's still because this wasn't hitchcock being clever or <UNK> or trying to make some universal point big themes big truths were not hitchcock's <UNK> nor personal <UNK> it was just hitchcock allowing a reflection of his own distorted mirror on life to shine through the <UNK> of the movie br br calling hitchcock's last great masterpiece is to <UNK> little if any understanding of just what hitchcock actually achieved in the way of cinematic <UNK> cinematic thrills and dazzling cinematic <UNK> br br is therefore now what it always was a cheap nasty and ham <UNK> movie that did no service to any of those involved or to the memory of a film maker who really was in his hollywood days one of the greatest there has ever been
<START> this movie is not realistic at all more of a comedy than a serious war film very old fashioned too maybe i was just expecting it to be on a same level with platoon i wonder why 50 of the voters gave it 10 something must be wrong
<START> i know my summary sounds very harsh but this film has very limited appeal the average joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film the entire film consists of animated <UNK> doing their jobs and dancing on floating <UNK> this is all done with very <UNK> and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to <UNK> in an art museum however unless you really love this sort of art or are a canadian who loves films about your native land then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish i have a rather high tolerance for this sort of thing and even i had to force myself to watch after a couple minutes i can respect the work that went into it but it's just not compelling
<START> i just watched this movie on it's <UNK> night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia i liked not loved <UNK> <UNK> as a kid mostly for robin <UNK> zany energetic performance this movie made me remember why was the original show great not really but robin certainly was which brings me to this movie br br i was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers <UNK> retelling of the show which in a way it was but of course the real focus was on robin it was interesting to see <UNK> journey from struggling street <UNK> to national t v star and how such a <UNK> difference affected him and his long suffering wife and my hat is off to star chris as he portrayed mr williams with integrity sensitivity and heart not just a cute impression although it was even dead on on an unrelated note i noticed that <UNK> struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman who was under appreciated by network t v and held back <UNK> but that's the taxi behind the scenes biopic br br all in all this was a very enjoyable flick in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the the acting was solid by all never melodramatic like i suspected and the story moved along well performances that were particularly good were by those who played <UNK> marshall and john belushi the scene in which belushi robin was a hoot not a great masterpiece by any means i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam but definitely watchable especially for those robin williams and <UNK> <UNK> fans out there
<START> i don't watch very many <UNK> movies but one night i sat down and watched this with my cousins now we're teenagers so we tend to make fun of a lot of things but honestly the acting here really wasn't very good especially at the beginning one line that stood out was when scarlett says to jill and <UNK> this is so high school while the next scene shows jill walking past a sign with their high school name on it many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny badly written badly acted <UNK> <UNK> episode however as the story progressed and the cast moved on to just about only jill most of the time i was able to appreciate the movie more <UNK> belle did really well in this movie and i think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her and i must admit this was one of the scariest movies i've ever seen well no there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark <UNK> and possessed dolls but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen and this movie really reminded me of what really is scary we all know we're not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you're <UNK> at could really happen the only flaw with this movie is that it's one of the most cliché movies i've ever seen it has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had turning the keys and the car starts shadows in the corner turning the <UNK> of the stairs with suspense turning around and seeing a dead body ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream etc at the suspenseful scenes it was very predictable but overall i would give it a 7 10 it's definitely worth seeing br br by the way this is my first review so i don't know if any of those things were spoilers but just to be safe
<START> this movie was horrid and at the end made me wonder why someone went to the trouble to make it now it was not all bad i have studied film and this film was put together very nicely and had very good cinematic everything with interesting angles to very nice lighting and excellent camera work i wish i could have seen it back in school because it would have made a good film to write a paper on but since i have <UNK> and lost most of my film <UNK> i have realized that a film should be entertaining above all this movie was long and boring and i'm not sure when it finally got to the point that it was worth my time br br
<START> the sun was not shining it was too wet to play so i went to the movies that cold cold wet date day br br the cat in the hat was the name of the flick and when it was over my stomach was sick br br mike myers played the cat his humor was lame and kids <UNK> see this the humor was not tame br br the film was like drinking milk from a <UNK> cow so it is fun to have fun yet the filmmakers didn't know how br br this film in short is atrocious the acting was bad the plot was <UNK> too much and the humor was surprisingly very crude br br it starts with conrad and sally a rule <UNK> and a future sheriff when their mother has to go to work she gets mrs <UNK> to <UNK> possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs <UNK> is watching a <UNK> court room a la c span she soon falls asleep and here comes the cat br br the film starts to spiral out of control the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun he's got thing 1 and thing 2 who suddenly start <UNK> the house he <UNK> a tv <UNK> and accidentally <UNK> his tail off and when the cat goes full carmen miranda it's not funny possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie <UNK> and there's a fish who tries warning the kids about the cat br br too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk or <UNK> your tail off br br soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog who has the key to a <UNK> on his collar if the <UNK> is not locked soon their house will be home to the <UNK> universe here it gets a little more interesting but not enough to save the film br br the acting overall is horrible mike meyers brings his brand of <UNK> austin powers humor to the cat saying things like you dirty ho and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a <UNK> in the <UNK> while posing as a <UNK> spencer <UNK> is great as the trouble making conrad and <UNK> fanning is cute as sally though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous <UNK> <UNK> waiting to kill john ritter accident waiting to happen alec <UNK> slick and <UNK> lawrence quinn is disgusting ever trying to woo the kids mom who is played by kelly preston and sean hayes is mr <UNK> mom's boss and is also the voice of the fish the latter three are also bland br br overall if i were a parent i would not take my kids who are into <UNK> humor cause there's plenty of it and more save your 7 00 and see something else as the late great dr seuss once said br br it is fun to have fun but you have to know how really universal stop <UNK> already turning over in his grave br br like my mom always says <UNK> killed the cat the cat in the hat out of
<START> considering that they wanted to do a vampire movie in space i thought well it'll probably be pretty cheesy but at least interesting enough to see a different take on the whole genre <UNK> i don't care what kind of movies you like even if you're the biggest vampire horror thriller or suspense fan in the world or <UNK> if you've never seen a horror movie before and would expect that your first would be impressive in any way whatsoever you're wrong i don't think i've ever seen a made for tv movie or after school special this bad i've never seen a tv pilot show this bad i've never seen footage of animals sleeping or that's as bad as this this is by far the single biggest waste of hours you could otherwise spend <UNK> the importance of dish <UNK> and their effect on your life i would far rather be trapped in a bathroom for weeks with nothing to <UNK> but my own <UNK> and <UNK> than watch even a single clip of this movie again watching this made me wish for the <UNK> that the characters fell to instead of dealing with knowing that i paid money to watch it it was however like a train wreck so bad you just couldn't help but watch hoping something good might happen it didn't please for the love of god if you or your friends even if using <UNK> <UNK> while doing so even consider watching this movie choose instead to have a contest to see who can shoot a <UNK> rocket <UNK> it will bring you far greater enjoyment and entertainment
<START> a town in japan is being taken over by a horribly brutal abstract shape the spiral it's becoming a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and <UNK> them mentally and literally this film shows it happening to several groups of people some demonic possession is implied but nothing is entirely sure except that the best bet is to get the heck out of dodge the film progresses really well from normal life to <UNK> <UNK> giant <UNK> and crazy people to the truly supernatural walking dead br br as a jaded american horror movie fan this was just what i needed maybe it was just the novelty of a different <UNK> film but it seemed to have a very original progression set of characters and the premise was definitely new the japanese may think horror <UNK> means spiral i'm told are old by now but it was nice for me because i'm used to monster alien virus disaster undead films in an american movie you know who's going to die the annoying nasty <UNK> racist characters and who will live the children heroine dogs cats nice guy that's not true in japanese horror it was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end up also it had this really new but probably typically japanese color pacific <UNK> style <UNK> day thing going which was a fresh visual effect for me the horrific moments were seriously creepy relying on a little gore but mainly just <UNK> overdone facial expressions think the ring and body <UNK> this should be one of the <UNK> up there with once original ideas like the first nightmare on elm street or night of the living dead
<START> i did a screen test and read the script for this turkey in 1988 it was awful then and even worse now i spotted it on vhs at the local video and said oh what the hey for <UNK> ang <UNK> <UNK> br br they had to shoot most of it in mexico after they ran out of money a couple of the stars pitched <UNK> because they ran out of some kind of exotic fruit drink crap the movie's plot is ok i suppose but i happen to know that the writer intended for it to have a spy <UNK> thread running throughout br br dr o ended up being a cartoon character he must still be <UNK> in his grave over in the <UNK> wall br br technical errors were all over the movie not only with the <UNK> atomic technology but with the uniforms <UNK> and military <UNK> they were too cheap to hire a professional military <UNK> of course even mr <UNK> august and expert presence couldn't have saved this bird from being stuffed for <UNK>
<START> in the era of the <UNK> brothers and the jackass series to have a movie made and performed by americans come out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is well <UNK> <UNK> this ensemble has been behind some other efforts most recently a mighty wind which was so subtle it seemed to be an actual documentary without the <UNK> of entertainment but best in show hits on all <UNK> it is superbly cast with some of the best of current us actors parker posey who exudes energy even when she stands still eugene levy as <UNK> <UNK> who is <UNK> <UNK> even when he appears to be or maybe the brilliant <UNK> of fred <UNK> the understated performances of so many others which is a characteristic not normally associated with americans or american actors one of the few humorous movies i can watch again and again
<START> patricia arquette plays american doctor laura <UNK> who takes a holiday to <UNK> in an attempt to <UNK> her spirit after the murders of her husband and young son she is left behind in during a military <UNK> and leaves the city with an aging man who works as a tour guide but he is no simple tour guide he is a professor who introduces her to the life outside of the tourist traps the two of them get caught up in the political <UNK> and laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and <UNK> its own people br br this movie is one of my favorites because of its themes first it's <UNK> describing some of the <UNK> that are occurring in <UNK> secondly it's about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss <UNK> it's about compassion and sacrifice and people coming together without even knowing each other to endure pain and fear br br just about every beautiful scene in this movie is important nothing is wasted here it's an earnest and moving film there is also a very emotional score composed by hans <UNK> which <UNK> scenes nicely br br a definite recommend especially to people concerned with human rights and people who want to know what purpose can i serve br br
<START> i really enjoyed north and south very much i think it is one of the best and most lavish television series i have ever seen the <UNK> of the cast is amazing you have actors from the golden age of cinema people like james stewart gene kelly elizabeth taylor robert mitchum and jean simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80's like patrick <UNK> james read jonathan <UNK> genie francis philip <UNK> and <UNK> anne down br br at the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men there is <UNK> main patrick <UNK> who is from the south and george <UNK> james read who is from the north throughout the series their friendship is continually threatened with the differences in their backgrounds particularly about the treatment of slaves in the south especially at plantation but when each needs the other they will forget the arguments and go and help their friend i really liked the chemistry between the two men and was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war br br i liked how the series showed what life was like before the war so the audience could see what were the factors that lead up to the war what was going on at the time then the <UNK> of a nation that was being torn apart and then the nation having to <UNK> the country again the war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic to me br br i think what is great about it is it has so many elements running through it romance history battles that would interest most of the audience there is something for everyone i particularly enjoyed the romance between brett genie francis and billy parker stevenson john <UNK> especially when she stood up to her sister <UNK> for the first time the other romances were interesting as there were not all the same each had something different to the others which kept me watching particularly the <UNK> and <UNK> story <UNK> to see if they would be together in the end br br it is one of the best american mini series that i have watched the story had the right balance of romance and the more serious history side that was happening in the country at the time but it is paced just right the characters are very watchable and the locations are beautiful and the music particularly at the start and end of the episode is so toe <UNK> good and works with the mood of the story
<START> well this is new famous italian horror director lucio fulci shoots a film about a famous italian horror director called lucio fulci after years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences it becomes hard for lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often <UNK> about committing violent murders he quickly <UNK> further into a <UNK> endless spiral of madness and <UNK> even the dedicated psychiatrist can't seem to keep fulci on the right track now when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value cat in the brain certainly is one of <UNK> most pleasant films the gore is <UNK> and <UNK> to say the least the amount of filthy <UNK> is impossible to describe especially when you manage to get your hands on the fully uncut version referred to with the aka nightmare concert <UNK> all around victims ' intestines are spread on all sides of the screen and the <UNK> are working <UNK> the film also becomes unintentionally funny quite soon since it's so exaggerated and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there's beer in the <UNK> of course from a more professional viewpoint this production can't exactly be called a masterpiece there's not the least bit of tension or atmosphere to <UNK> and the characters are completely empty headed in order to make more room for the gore characters are just being introduced for 5 seconds and subsequently die a horrible death especially compared with <UNK> highlights like the beyond or don't torture a <UNK> this film looks like a quickly <UNK> up <UNK> the best way to interpret cat in the brain is like a personal statement made by fulci and a direct attack towards censorship perhaps after seeing so many of his films  especially the latter ones  being cut by censorship <UNK> and <UNK> by pseudo artistic critics he wanted to avenge himself by delivering a gory mess that simply can't be cut if you take out all the explicit violence and the truly sick make up effects you only got about 10 minutes of footage left especially because the insane killings re occur later in the film as fulci <UNK> about them again you can almost hear our director think stuff like let's see how you're going to <UNK> this now even the entire development of the murder investigation happens in the background are the victims missed by any of their friends or relatives are there any police officers looking for clues that'll lead them to the killer you don't know and lucio doesn't bother to inform you about that because that would lead to sequences that don't require cutting oh and it's pretty damn pretentious as well the name mr fulci or even lucio is mentioned every 3 minutes <UNK> times throughout the entire movie to be exact and our director clearly enjoys being in the <UNK> for a change hey i certainly don't blame him after over 30 years of delivering amusing movies he deserved to have a little extra fun you're a god mr fulci
<START> i thought this movie was great not only because of it's storyline but because it was portrayed greatly by the excellent cast i read that drew barrymore wasn't exceptional as <UNK> <UNK> because she is beautiful yes she maybe but in the movie she played outside herself which brought on a plain girl searching for who she is in the world the story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless <UNK> out there i for sure am david arquette is mad as her brother rob and michael <UNK> is gorgeous as sam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> did an excellent job as her mate someone who wasn't afraid to be herself i think this movie should get more credit rather than being <UNK> as a <UNK> flick
<START> beautiful that one word pretty much sums up this whole film everything from the cinematography the directing the acting brilliant at any point of the film you can pause it and you will no doubt be looking at something <UNK> or artsy <UNK> as some people would say i assure you that after one viewing will be stuck in your head i know this from first hand experience even the soundtrack is great it goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film be thankful that <UNK> archer exists in this world we need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real and surreal imagery
<START> it's as if the editor and screenwriter only had 40 minutes of real running time this is supposed to be a remake of a chinese film which is obviously far superior to this trash it's clear that some brainless hollywood suit or writer decided that this movie would be <UNK> a <UNK> man against man instead of just letting the story play out with the personalities of the characters that were built in the first 40 minutes at this point in the film the characters just don't act like regular people and not even like their own personalities it makes little sense it's quite clear why this film <UNK> it's just not believable at all and that's too bad it started out with promise don't be fooled
<START> many films attempt the ambitious few succeed this film is one of them br br though billed as a black comedy that term seems too <UNK> to express the true nature of the story behind max and grace multi michael has managed to <UNK> elements of comedy with incredibly real human emotion quite a remarkable feat to be certain br br while the comedic aspects are certainly present the heart of the film lies in its leads david and natasha the delicate balance of the film really crazy versus real love falls to them and they achieve it carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming ending david in the titular lead role and as narrator anchors the picture and does an exceptional job we see the world through <UNK> eyes and <UNK> them with a sort of wonder and <UNK> that one would not expect to be believable coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide there should be no doubt from this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles natasha might be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles the role of grace is <UNK> in scope <UNK> her to show both great rage and great <UNK> sometimes within seconds of each other she manages to convince us of <UNK> deep <UNK> desperation that lies just beneath her <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br this is not a laugh a minute type of comedy so don't see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish think more <UNK> than comedy there are some very dark moments as one would expect given the subject matter of <UNK> individuals and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by emma adele <UNK> as <UNK> sister <UNK> the most humorous scenes are those populated by the <UNK> of name actors in supporting roles while <UNK> <UNK> and david <UNK> lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who <UNK> the institution where max and grace meet are the real treat <UNK> diaz is a <UNK> scene <UNK> as the delightfully frenetic oddball hector <UNK> as bruno acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal <UNK> arquette fully <UNK> the role of vera with the crass <UNK> of an <UNK> truck stop waitress even her character <UNK> eventually as does everyone who is touched by <UNK> literally <UNK> love for grace br br can love <UNK> all might be the question behind the film and even though the <UNK> within says no movies are about an escape from reality even if only for a few brief hours i recommend seeing this film as an <UNK> to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens spending a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psyche br br seattle international film festival june 2005
<START> a beautiful reflection of life's desperation and <UNK> of finding love tragic while at the same time <UNK> entertaining most people do not give this film a chance ignorance just a mere reflection in itself until next time
<START> the emperor and the assassin w english subtitles at <UNK> minutes is long but the time is packed with a story that barely fits into it golden <UNK> palace scenes and dusty yellow <UNK> of chinese landscapes background a true story of <UNK> <UNK> king circa 300 an intricate plot with a <UNK> twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast king simple wish for a <UNK> empire for his common people is <UNK> but not without <UNK> plots and counter plots and oh yes bodies lots of bodies this epic story of <UNK> <UNK> is a great way for <UNK> to glimpse little known asian history emperor include the thousands of life size <UNK> <UNK> figures which are still being <UNK> today as an historical person this film makes it clear that emperor should be regarded along with george washington <UNK> <UNK> alexander the great <UNK> khan and <UNK> <UNK> to name a few of the world's greatest i highly recommend seeing the emperor and the assassin especially on the big screen
<START> has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene by scene remake of the 1933 version with some of the scenes taken out it makes me think less of a film that does that showing a definite want of creativity in all fairness i tend to be biased in favor of <UNK> hepburn but this version of the film seems like cinematic <UNK> the 1933 version was nice and sweet though a little awkward in presentation and transition at times and then this version took the script the music and even a fair amount of the scene <UNK> from the earlier version i don't understand the point of making the film again when the method of <UNK> it was to basically <UNK> george <UNK> film with everything the same except the people working on it
<START> i must confess that i don't remember this film very well but certainly i liked it i think it was the best adaptation from <UNK> novel really and of course it's one of the best movie from christopher <UNK> br br a good movie about tarzan as cult as the ones with <UNK>
<START> this movie is simply amazing unfortunately in <UNK> not even a shadow of him and i agree with a former opinion only <UNK> fans will really give the movie the real credit but for the rest i dare you to watch it the story is great and i thought that the game has ended the story but the screenwriters have given us a great story to the god of all r p g 's the <UNK> as usual it came from heaven but the little details that they gave us us fans of the game are beautiful like the ring tone is the battle winning song of the game and even some moves are quite familiar just watch it it's a great movie great story great animation just a 10 10
<START> i saw this movie when it first came out patty didn't want to be separated from her siblings however the juvenile justice system don't care when patty looked at the case file the judge sent her to a juvenile <UNK> facility he claimed she <UNK> the rules of <UNK> by looking at private files she just wanted her family together i couldn't blame her the parents were not even fit parents one of the smaller children had to have a <UNK> the father stopped and let them off he drove off him and left the children stranded at the service station patty had to take authority to protect them since she was the oldest they were placed in foster homes the good part is that the social worker got them back as a family the head social worker kept telling him to butt out and not <UNK> he was power crazy he was the one who had patty placed in the juvenile facility why didn't they go after the father who was released from prison for <UNK> yet the children are caught in the middle and made to feel insecure
<START> i really wanted to be able to give this film a 10 i've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live action batman films to date and maybe it still will be i have yet to watch the <UNK> films again i'm also starting to become concerned about whether i'm somehow <UNK> being you see i always liked the <UNK> films as far as i can remember they were either <UNK> or <UNK> to me but the conventional wisdom is that the two tim burton directed films are far superior i had serious problems with the first burton batman this time around i ended up giving it a 7 and apologize as i might i just couldn't help feel that batman returns just has too many small direction plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10 br br but burton almost <UNK> the problems with sheer force of style and even though there are a lot of small flaws batman returns is still a great film especially if you're a burton fan as batman returns has just as much in common with the nightmare before christmas 1993 and edward <UNK> 1990 as it does with anything else in the batman universe br br the film begins strongly with the having a baby we see their <UNK> people walk out of the <UNK> room with horror on their faces ready to vomit later they have the baby in a small cage finally they take it out for an evening <UNK> and dump it in the <UNK> city river the baby ends up becoming batman villain the penguin danny <UNK> br br meanwhile max christopher walken is the film's evil <UNK> comparable to <UNK> jack palance in batman he is planning on <UNK> <UNK> city in various ways and we see him emotionally <UNK> his secretary the <UNK> <UNK> kyle michelle pfeiffer when kyle discovers one of the <UNK> plots <UNK> tries to get rid of her but she is rescued by cats becoming <UNK> br br while all of this is going on the penguin who has long been only <UNK> to exist and who is thought to be dangerous begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy despite having less than <UNK> <UNK> motives br br before re watching <UNK> batman films this time i didn't remember just how little the films are about batman michael keaton it's almost as if burton didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on the focus here is much more on the villains especially the penguin batman doesn't appear very often especially in the beginning of the film and surprisingly often we're watching him watching the penguin br br although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw i can't say that i do even if i'd like to know more about batman and follow his story more the <UNK> stories are interesting too and as an origin story for two major batman villains batman returns is already more than complex in terms of plot br br however there are some character problems that i do count as a flaw the penguin has a <UNK> of circus performers who do his <UNK> but even though they're frequently on screen we never get to learn anything about them burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in <UNK> <UNK> freaks 1932 available with actors as interesting as vincent <UNK> but he just doesn't have the space to use them br br for that matter he hardly has space to explore <UNK> the film plays as if <UNK> may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as the penguin but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long so the bulk of the <UNK> scenes had to be <UNK> of course all of this barely leaves any room for batman burton has batman turn very dark in the <UNK> eye in this film and unusually he never bothers to resolve this as far as we know at the end still think that batman is a murdering lunatic that's an interesting development but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next br br as for the script although there are minor problems including some non <UNK> and bizarre decisions in terms of logic made by characters it's clear that burton and writers sam <UNK> and daniel waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story a lot of the dialogue is pun oriented but often this is fairly subtle and or complex of course sometimes it is very blatant or transparent too it helps to look at batman returns as a more poetic film as i believe was the intention this also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions plenty of odd character actions including from minor characters are done in service of a general mood or style and that style works very well br br dark is the <UNK> way to sum up batman returns in a word and whether that's a positive or negative depends on your <UNK> anyone who knows me knows that i love dark so for me <UNK> style largely <UNK> the flaws in the plot and the script in many ways batman returns is like an insane campy horror film with beautifully eerie production design like batman burton is still making many references to other films but instead of vertigo 1958 and star wars 1977 well there's still a slight star wars reference he <UNK> films like <UNK> <UNK> including that max <UNK> was the name of the actor who played the dracula like character there motel hell 1980 the aforementioned freaks willy <UNK> and the chocolate factory 1971 which has a surreal dark edge to it and zombie films made most explicit in the <UNK> final scene br br in terms of visuals and general atmosphere and that includes the general feel of the story the characters and so on this couldn't be a stronger 10
<START> they both believed that a hidden sentiment has <UNK> them this is beautiful but the <UNK> is more beautiful they believed that they had never been met nothing has happened between them but those roads those stairs those corridors for all that time they could have been met although it did not mean to be it was a <UNK> song two young people who are neighbors and have never been met are found in the same places the same times doing most of the times the same things they finally meet in the dramatic and very brilliant end that brings them together meanwhile the woman has met an old man their relation is <UNK> like he told her his life it was like the young one's but with better the young man can do whatever the old man has not lived he can be happy with the woman the ending is exceptional there is a ship wreck the only survivors are the <UNK> of the three colors the man and the woman finally meet the scene lasts a few seconds the woman there looks like the photo she had taken for an ad in the beginning of the film sad in a red fond but every start is only the continue the book of the life is opened in the middle
<START> i <UNK> with the other users comment hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80's i think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match up if anyone can truly say this is a good movie they need to be locked up it is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it i feel i lost intelligence from watching this i used to have a little respect for chuck norris before i watched this but now i just feel bad i bought this as part of a 3 movie pack for 9 99 and i can honestly say i would have been better off literally throwing the money away forgive me jesus
<START> who doesn't love the muppets impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside so i guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special i don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film i recall quite <UNK> in fact there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self conscious in any bad way refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on <UNK> details and technique the magic <UNK> all that other stuff <UNK> indeed what movies are made of br br so how does the film achieve these things hmmm nice question <UNK> am i let's see really i feel like it's quite simple the filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process i probably wouldn't say the film has many truly inspired moments but it does have a certain life to it that <UNK> enough a great many real people movies lack a <UNK> you really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures they also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing br br generally i get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren't afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session lots of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through the cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance maybe i don't feel i have much to say about it because i was half asleep when i saw it and or as i write this review anyway i'm sort of semi repeating myself here but i really liked the sense of family the movie had full of love i suppose you might say again a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly br br and to repeat myself once more one of the film's best charms is its very relaxed and <UNK> atmosphere like the <UNK> <UNK> quote about happiness being like a <UNK> so the muppet movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so same with beauty being best <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> or something like that anyway if that sounds sappy i also <UNK> it was pretty hilarious br br so all in all this movie was very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to plus it features lots of great music highly recommended to all humans both the young and the young at heart
<START> george segal lives with his elderly and <UNK> mother there are many jokes about her <UNK> like <UNK> and most of them aren't funny though there were a few funny moments <UNK> in here and there such as the nude running through the park scene and the old folks home at first segal tries to kill his mother because she's tough to live with and because he's a selfish guy making the film sort of like a <UNK> <UNK> versus the <UNK> comedy where he tries again and again to kill this <UNK> gal would have been a hoot too bad this was not the overall tone of the film br br i do applaud carl <UNK> attempt to make a tasteless film that is intended to offend everyone i have a special place in my heart for films like ed and his dead mother eating <UNK> and happiness of the <UNK> all films about death that dare to offend the problem here though is that where's <UNK> has some funny moments but it also has a lot of flat ones and the overall product is amazingly bland plus topics such as homosexual rape incest and the like are really difficult to make funny i read in the rough guide to cult movies that it is considered a cult film though i just can't see anyone wanting to see this more than once
<START> every time i think about this film i feel physically ill to read such a great book and later discover there's a film of it was a great feeling years later and imagine my joy at switching on the sci fi channel and finding it starts in just <UNK> up go the titles and then if just a couple of things had changed ok everything is changed numerous characters are removed entirely new rubbish ones are added the main hero is <UNK> and de aged by about 30 years and hilariously his girlfriend wife is now his mother even the dog is reduced to sub <UNK> <UNK> this is truly appalling cinema at its absolute worst i would quite happily remove my own <UNK> with <UNK> rather than sit through another horrific viewing and i urge anyone thinking of watching this please don't if you own a copy burn it now right now and think how much better your life would have been had this celluloid insult never occurred
<START> carmen is a prostitute that lives <UNK> and stealing soldiers of the spanish army she is without any doubt the best femme fatale at the moment when a man resist her charming <UNK> she decides to do everything to destroy him at the end he falls in her web and he will be forced to make all the things he ever hated only for being with carmen despite paz vega is very beautiful she doesn't seem a gypsy as carmen is and neither her acting nor are good the story results very boring and in most moments it is very absurd while <UNK> to appear truthful in the same way are the scenarios and the special effects despite not being but they are not but acceptable and too much artificial for a historic film as it is to sum up boring and bad with a very absurd development there are much <UNK> thing to watch
<START> in the book of life martin <UNK> plays jesus who shows up at <UNK> airport on december <UNK> to <UNK> in the new millennium by battling with thomas jay ryan satan and deciding the fate of the world there is also david kurt the <UNK> from amateur as a <UNK> homeless <UNK> br br as usual hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and <UNK> flows through <UNK> framed scenes and urban industrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow as usual he introduces seemingly incidental details early then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected <UNK> the humor is simple but <UNK> and <UNK> hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and <UNK> moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous as usual he creates a tone that is jaded and world weary but at the same time vulnerable open and honest he moves within minutes from <UNK> humor into language that is <UNK> and poetic the kind of writing that is so dead on and perfect that it's difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion another awesome and highly entertaining film br br the book of life is shot a digital camera with a <UNK> effect a sense of the <UNK> hand in hand with impending doom and a hyper awareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in it's last moments all of hartley's films have a way of the present but this unique effect <UNK> it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it the final shot is spectacular all this may sound precious but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of <UNK> judgment day and although it is actually quite profound moving and life <UNK> it is for the most part lighthearted and playful the acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that hartley has developed in his films a tone that some people don't get and that <UNK> them to judge such acting as hollow the same people who have a negative response to peter <UNK> as always there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and <UNK> people put off by hartley's abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or techniques but anyone who is a hartley fan will love this film if they can get a chance to see it that is it's hard to say what it would be like on video
<START> it was full of plot holes inaccuracies doesn't the time clock stop for injured players or loss of <UNK> in texas football games and not so much redemption so your dad beats the crap out of you well do something right for once and then he will love you and make it all worthwhile br br either make the movie about a team and its quest for a championship or make a movie about a player within a team and his personal struggle but instead this movie tried to do it all and came up more than a couple <UNK> short the book probably showed the whole story much better the movie should have picked one element of the story and stuck with that br br instead the movie jumped from one character dialogue to flashes of game play and then another character dialogue months later without actually telling you who people were or why they were important the calling his sibling to take care of the mother whatever happened with that because the mother was coherent by the end of the final game does that mean she's not crazy anymore its one redeeming quality was the soundtrack buy that and then watch highlights while <UNK> pop plays in the background
<START> words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie and the sequels does it have flaws sure it does starting with the <UNK> themselves which were not executed well enough for a special effect so why do i <UNK> these movies for the herd of movie mass <UNK> out there who care more about <UNK> than quality about cheap fun more than about depth crap like blade it doesn't even deserve a capital letter underworld dracula 2000 dracula 3000 and so on are good movies to <UNK> popcorn to and drink a couple of <UNK> what makes <UNK> a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanatic on the other hand is obvious the vampire himself is romanian the story is set in <UNK> the scenes filmed on location are more than convincing and the atmosphere is not based on any action packed chases or expensive <UNK> music himself is the source of the atmosphere this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave add a <UNK> gloomy castle with dark <UNK> <UNK> in romania include some typical <UNK> elements such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight and you have a work of art in short if like me you <UNK> fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and dark there's no better place to look in than in a <UNK> movie or in vampire <UNK> the brilliant spin off of the former
<START> i have absolutely no idea why i watched ali g except for the fact that <UNK> seemed to think a crime was committed by not <UNK> <UNK> baron cohen for a emmy for his work on da ali g show it is a sure bet that i will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie comedy torture was more like it it was just about the stupidest thing i every watched i will admit that i was captivated by i had not seen her in anything she wasn't on the practice during the time i was watching so i guess i will have to check out boston legal one of these <UNK> to see how she does in something that may be worth watching
<START> i really wanted to like this movie because it is <UNK> different from the <UNK> of everyday horror movie <UNK> and i appreciate that the filmmakers are trying for something original unfortunately the plot just didn't hold together and none of the characters were likable enough for me to really care about them or their <UNK> br br visually the was pretty interesting the director took a lot of somewhat <UNK> moves like adding in little bits of flash looking animation in parts and really <UNK> up some of the special effects such as the light from a certain <UNK> sometimes this worked and sometimes it didn't but he deserves kudos for the attempt and the cinematography was generally of high quality br br unfortunately when this same approach of throwing lots of things at the wall to see what sticks was applied to the plot the results were not very good the film never really finds a tone that it likes moving from black comedy to family soap opera to 80's witchcraft flick to childhood nostalgia to <UNK> family slasher taken on their own bits and pieces of each of these elements work fairly well but nothing ever into a satisfying whole besides that large bits of the plot are never really explained i'm not one who likes to have everything <UNK> fed to me and i like movies that leave things up to the audience to decide but the parts that are left out from the just seem like they either ran out of money before they could explain them or they didn't really think things through to begin with br br i look forward to the director's next project since i think there is a lot of talent lurking under the surface here but i can't really recommend the on its own merits
<START> i gave this movies a 7 out of 10 i think the general dislike of this movie is due to people not really understanding the plot if you think about the story line this movie actually makes perfect sense it just doesn't ever give you a <UNK> down explanation its true that the special effects are sub par and it appears semi low budget but i think the originality of the plot keeps you drawn in people say that the vampire genre is overdone and clichéd out but with <UNK> what you get is not your conventional vampire flick its a dream alternate reality story line with a vampire eternal life spin on it i loved it the only thing that kept me from giving it a higher rating was the lack of special effects and that i personally dislike movies where most of the people have accents but like i said earlier if you really get the plot this is not a bad movie
<START> everyone knows that succeeded in the first <UNK> flight so how can there be any suspense or intrigue in this film well there is don't ask me how but there is partly due to the director's expert telling of the tale but mostly due to jimmy stewart's thoroughly engaging performance we are drawn into the story as if it were unfolding for the first time right before our eyes despite the fact that half the movie is filmed in a <UNK> <UNK> it is as dynamic as any action flick out there so if you are <UNK> about seeing this movie because you think you know the story already give it a shot i think you'll be impressed
<START> i am currently 22 years old and remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it first came out you heard me right i was 5 years old and yet i can still distinctly remember what i saw that afternoon so many years ago was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of mark <UNK> creativity no on the other hand it was a quite creepy film about mark <UNK> dark depressed and in fact <UNK> side one scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which mark <UNK> is playing the <UNK> at his own funeral br br would an adult enjoy this film well this movie quite possibly features some interesting <UNK> that a person with a working knowledge of mark <UNK> writing might enjoy but trust me on this adventures is not the film you want to use to introduce your young children to mark <UNK>
<START> probably the best comedy in a long time keeps you laughing <UNK> the acting is good and there are a lot of hilarious cameos such as ben stiller as the guitar store guy the plot wasn't as good as i had hoped but the comedy makes up for that i can only hope for a sequel cause it seems like they can still do so much more even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long i still wanted more at the end also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie i suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and definitely suggest it to fans of the d or jack black you should buy the album also the songs are so damn catchy and hilarious the music on it is top notch as well
<START> if you have seen the <UNK> version of you will find this to be very similar in story line but has different songs and takes place in <UNK> <UNK> not <UNK> although this is a remake of you will find that <UNK> and make this a unique film <UNK> and make a great pair a few <UNK> were when character <UNK> character for going to buy a present for him he never <UNK> and she still stays with him in the end good action and songs make this an all around great movie i recommend it br br i give it a 10 10 one of the best i have seen
<START> pitch black is a surprisingly good movie i was not a fan of <UNK> <UNK> before i saw pitch black but after seeing pitch black my respect for <UNK> <UNK> has gone up he did a great job playing <UNK> a man wanted for many murders his character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me like near the end <UNK> was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die i like this movie and how it deals with human instinct this movie is low budget but this movie goes to show you don't need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie i think all the characters made this movie i give this movie 8 out of 10
<START> widely known as don't look in the basement this is pure 70s horror b movie goodness that could actually pass as the <UNK> version of one flew over the <UNK> nest though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour of it's runtime i enjoyed this particular <UNK> of quirky <UNK> and their various personalities and <UNK> such as the former army sergeant a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll a lovable man child and a loony <UNK> after their head doctor is murdered by a patient a small <UNK> hires a new nurse onto their under <UNK> facility who becomes immersed in the <UNK> different <UNK> and <UNK> things gradually become stranger however when patients start acting far more <UNK> than usual you never really know or care where the movie is going 'cause it still entertains up until it's completely whacked out ending several of the twists felt a little too forced and i could have used a tad more blood but i really <UNK> this much too under rated blend of humor and horror check it out
<START> this was the greatest movie i have ever seen in my life the action was great and i was so scared there was a lot of gore which made it great i would see it 1 000 more times and paris hilton d <UNK> she fine in that movie but anyway i would recommend it to anybody even kids like me adults like it to you would probably have nightmares at night though but beside that it is awesome i cant stop <UNK> about it ever <UNK> when i heard about it i and and in school i gave out saying may 6 house of wax see it i got my whole school into it but anyway i would definitely it may 6 house of wax be there it be <UNK>
<START> buffalo bill hero of the far west director mario <UNK> <UNK> spaghetti western the beast with <UNK> kinski could only have been produced in europe hollywood would never <UNK> to have made a western about a sexual predator on the <UNK> as the protagonist of a movie never mind that kinski is <UNK> suited to the role of <UNK> johnny he plays an individual entirely without sympathy who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit pants and hat this low budget <UNK> has nothing <UNK> about it the typically breathtaking spanish scenery around <UNK> is nowhere in evidence instead <UNK> and his director of photography <UNK> who shot another kinski western and god said to cain <UNK> this horse opera in rather mundane setting around <UNK> <UNK> italy and <UNK> falls river <UNK> italy nevertheless the beast qualifies as a <UNK> western because it deals with wholly <UNK> characters and the action could be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by <UNK> circumstances that <UNK> them to resort to criminal activities predictably their well laid plans <UNK> <UNK> largely to the kinski character indeed the <UNK> kinski character resembles a <UNK> e <UNK> type character consistently he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women but either <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> each of his efforts ultimately the beast amounts to a tragic character study <UNK> with irony the <UNK> <UNK> score sounds as if it were lifted by the tony anthony western the stranger returns the mario <UNK> screenplay takes place on the western frontier between san diego and mexico that is being <UNK> by a notorious mexican <UNK> called <UNK> <UNK> of we still kill the old way and his gang they prey on the <UNK> and nobody is safe from their the first time that

get the money from <UNK> attorney gary <UNK> <UNK> of blood and black <UNK> but he grows suspicious because <UNK> doesn't look anything like he remembered nancy <UNK> <UNK> his six gun and warns <UNK> that they have kidnapped nancy unfortunately for <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> can only lay his hands on 50 thousand because <UNK> has struck such fear into the hearts of everybody that the <UNK> total inheritance cannot be <UNK> through the territory by <UNK> meanwhile back at the cabin horny johnny tries to rape nancy but she <UNK> him knows him out with a chair on the <UNK> of needing to be alone while she <UNK> after she knocks him unconscious she steals a <UNK> and drives it back to town johnny <UNK> <UNK> her and murders her about the same time that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> meet him on

clouds of gun smoke for an unhappy ending <UNK> johnny dies and never gets to <UNK> his lust if you think about <UNK> <UNK> the beast emerges as an interesting character study and an exercise in film noir in a western setting where everybody is <UNK>
<START> i found this film to be a bit too depressing i don't mind dramas but this was a bit too much for me luckily there does seem to be somewhat a decent outcome i suppose it was well done i'd watch it again but it's nothing to rave about
<START> i'm a big fan of the first <UNK> movie the second episode is good but it's not as good as the first <UNK> the third episode is a little bit boring but lovely and what is this what a crap it's stupid and really really boring it's the worst of the series i can't watch it again because i felt asleep at the first watch and evil side that's one of the most <UNK> moments of the movie in the first 50 minutes we can't see the little <UNK> monsters that's the reason why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie br br it could have been much better br br 2 10
<START> all the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced that is their main justification to give a high rate to the movie but a movie is not balanced when the main <UNK> <UNK> is given the last world in every single subject the director herself admitted to this at the first san francisco film festival showing she justified it by saying that she couldn't waste the chance of having access to that might be true but by showing so much of take on the issues makes the movie clearly pro and <UNK> i dare any of the other <UNK> to prove this wrong <UNK> 1 claiming <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and latin american <UNK> agree with you does not help your argument use logic tip 2 <UNK> with the director doesn't help your argument either the director says she thinks is charismatic and patriotic and therefore she portrayed him that way
<START> we saw la last night the chicago international film festival we were both immensely moved by it this is a haunting tale of loneliness missed connection in which the longing for <UNK> conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another the three leads as <UNK> <UNK> as flavia <UNK> as <UNK> are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising br br after all the movies which older women it's wonderful to see flavia who is a law professor at a university in rome presented as beautiful sensual as well as seductive powerful we're <UNK> to believe that when a younger woman enters 'the mix ' the older woman will become jealous of the younger woman the man will leave the older woman for the younger woman etc etc in this film however emotional truth is considerably more complex highly recommended
<START> this movie is a fascinating drama about the making of a movie the actor and the actress really can't stand each other but we build up to a scene in which they are to have sex she for the first time per script the actress shows little emotion on or off camera in the plot aside from she is <UNK> in the early scenes on a beach the actor is self absorbed and increasingly defies the direction of the director <UNK> i could not help being drawn in to the drama of <UNK> are these two possibly going to act their way thru a sex scene ' that drama in itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and <UNK> performed for the cameras not that <UNK> isn't lovely and worth seeing naked however there is a pretty young stage hand who walks thru a few scenes as an extra i think that is her in the far left edge of one of the pictures 2 of 9 here in imdb i don't even know if this girl is credited but when she walks by fully dressed of course in confident indifference with her short blonde hair she is sexy who is this girl
<START> one of my favorite movies i like horses i like happy endings and i like walter matthau i miss him and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why he was so wonderful watch it with your kids or your horse br br the story of an old hard boot horse <UNK> with kids and down on his luck if you have ever had or appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the <UNK> to <UNK> storyline it may be a little below but not a lot the story is the same one except it is the quarter horse version well acted correct racing terms and equipment and nice racing scenes don't take my word for it get it and make up your own mind
<START> i'm the type of guy who loves hood movies from new jack city to baby boy to season from the b grade to the hollywood but this movie was something different i am no <UNK> and this movie was kinda enjoyable but some bits were just weird well the acting wasn't to good compared to the <UNK> performance in hot <UNK> quite good and ice t in new jack and <UNK> great the scene where corrupt ice t kills the wanna be <UNK> dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both ice t and the other dude this kills the <UNK> however ice t is <UNK> very similar to <UNK> other movie urban menace which stars both of these actors were <UNK> character is supernatural however after this there is nothing suggested that corrupt is like a demon when <UNK> gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the <UNK> with out blood and when <UNK> <UNK> killing a cop <UNK> the cop was beating up his friend benny was weird benny isn't introduced in this movie and the scene isn't in the film it does hold weight to the fact why corrupt wants to kill <UNK> but is still makes u scratch your head <UNK> <UNK> writes a letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them <UNK> doesn't mention what happen 2 other main characters <UNK> and lisa the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto which <UNK> the lives of <UNK> and blacks word wide was a good part of the film even though the clip of the projects was re used thousands of times and the scene where miles kills the latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed not wearing a helmet and running into my latino brothers car would of killed him the movie was similar to the film urban menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team it was ok tho but me being from poverty i love hood films however if u don't love em like i do don't watch it only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars and my love of the genre br br <UNK>

<START> i accept that most 50's horror aren't scary by today's standards but what the hell is this when you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood <UNK> beast instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earth yeah which is what the people wanted br br the overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast but the title really kills the movie night of the beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isn't any blood to speak of br br i like how the 50's movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen but its almost up there br br 2 out of 10
<START> <UNK> situations abound one time director harry <UNK> gives us the ultimate post apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead left in the streets in the stores and throughout the landscape sans in the middle of a forgotten desert one lone survivor attempting to <UNK> his sanity takes food from the city to his <UNK> in this desert all alone he hopes for more but with nobody around he is left with white underwear and a passion for a local indian tribe  until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the <UNK> of human co existence alan a man of the book is left on earth after an unknown disaster thinking he is alone he begins living life his way  until <UNK> ryan appears like she would in any dream out of the woods <UNK> and unhappy to find the final man alive to be well like alan anyway they try to co exist fail get drunk and before creating the ultimate <UNK> they run into redneck <UNK> played by newcomer  dan <UNK> jr bonds are torn confusion sets in a couple becomes a third wheel and the battle between physically inept nerd vs brainless jock even with nobody left on the planet it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will <UNK> br br using a <UNK> film technique <UNK> gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled the quiet earth which i will be viewing next oddly which he never gives any credit towards with a borrowed story i guess he does a decent job of it his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while <UNK> tries to find his <UNK> <UNK> yet again from other film director's techniques to attempt to find his own he opens the film interestingly enough but fails to answer any direct answers sure the final days have arrived but could there be a <UNK> answer as to how or better yet why these <UNK> few survived a beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film the <UNK> would have been like shawn of the dead but instead left us feeling like we were watching a made for tv program listening to the audio commentary i have respect for <UNK> because he worked <UNK> to get this film made and his passion nearly sells the film but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn't as happy with his overall final product there were mistakes ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out while this does make for decent independent film making it sometimes feels cheap and in case it was the latter br br i must admit david portrayal of alan hooked me he played that <UNK> school nerd adult role very well he was funny to both watch and listen to and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer he was a key player in keeping the film together alas i cannot say the same for the rest this was dan <UNK> first film and it was obvious  i mean  really really obvious there were scenes in which i thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance but alas it wasn't the case then there was <UNK> ryan she pulled into her character near the end of the film which to me was the <UNK> of the entire piece of art she goes from estranged unknown to bitter <UNK> insane girlfriend by the end confused again she fell into her character by the end giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting <UNK> even as the commentary progressed all that she contributed was a laugh giggle or <UNK> look at that color moment while her beauty may sell tickets one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful this was her first film so can i be too harsh br br overall this film felt like it was missing something i though the idea was strong  the premise that even with only a <UNK> of people remaining on the earth the evil of human nature still exists jealousy cannot be killed by <UNK> or bombs maybe because it is consumed by and we as a race will always want what we cannot have <UNK> is not a surprising director his techniques are flawed and pre used but he does know how to make a low budget comedy i think our idea of funny is different so that is why i couldn't find myself laughing at many of the bits he found hysterical his actors provided the level of acting needed for this film which was lower than average his film was loose meaning that there were elements never quite explained or <UNK> i e anything with wings survived which overall <UNK> the intensity of the film this was a comedy but it could have been much darker and much much funnier for those thinking that roger <UNK> was a huge element to this film as we learn from their commentary all he was there for was money  the was in essence the bank for the last man don't get your hopes up for any classic <UNK> moments br br don't expect more from <UNK>  and that is how i will end it br br grade out of
<START> alright so this episode makes fun of al gore i'm sure it <UNK> a few <UNK> off the thing is south park makes fun of everybody much like the simpsons did if you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously with that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best al <UNK> portrayal is hilarious scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing it is basically everything you would ever want out of a south park episode and it is easily one of my favorites i'll won't comment too much further on the plot because i don't want to give anything away
<START> i think it is saying something that the bollywood bride and prejudice stayed more faithful to the source material than this 2005 hollywood version did i also laughed more at the bollywood version mr priceless if you have read the book or seen the 1995 bbc version and liked them you will be in for a nasty surprise going in to this film then my friend however who had seen neither was mildly amused by the film if you are a jane austen <UNK> though or even a film goer who <UNK> historical inaccuracies it will be painful to sit through this br br ugh the script the script was the biggest problem i imagine the actors wouldn't have <UNK> half so badly if they'd had a decent script perhaps penned by somebody who actually loved <UNK> work br br what were committed well you'll be forced to endure such <UNK> lines as don't you dare judge me <UNK> and leave me alone for once in your lives not only are such lines far from anything that could come from jane <UNK> <UNK> pen but can anyone honestly believe words like that <UNK> from the mouth of a <UNK> young lady from the <UNK> era the usage of modern <UNK> is one of the many irritating ways that the screenwriter <UNK> the book the writer also decided to give characters lines that in the book were said by a completely different characters and all for no apparent purpose worse of all when they do try to stick a bit closer to the <UNK> writing the screenwriter has a nasty and unnecessary habit of <UNK> <UNK> phrases and <UNK> awkward <UNK> for her already perfect words it was as if the screenwriter sat down with the book in one hand and a <UNK> in the other when writing the script stick to <UNK> words she did it better than you i assume all of this was done in a <UNK> spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic 1995 bbc version however for me it also made a travesty of the true spirit of <UNK> most beloved work br br the casting did have potential though it was quickly <UNK> away once the script kicked in but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> your crooked teeth does not equal charm and and i think mr though i find him <UNK> handsome enough his script and was under the impression he was playing <UNK> and not the <UNK> mr <UNK> i really did enjoy brenda <UNK> kelly <UNK> and the actor who played mr collins their interpretations were really rather refreshing br br oh but donald sutherland somebody described his performance as seeming like a <UNK> who had accidentally <UNK> onto the movie set and i must say it is an apt description and can somebody tell me why they fashioned after <UNK> though he was in the movie for under two minutes i <UNK> and without his impressive <UNK> skills to <UNK> up the movie br br on a wardrobe note i would kill for miss <UNK> dresses because they were <UNK> and would fit in more with the modern century a <UNK> <UNK> evening <UNK> please more <UNK> than austen that is sure and poor <UNK> all of the budget went to her <UNK> and not her wardrobe oh and i'm sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the one from the movie set unfortunately they didn't catch him soon enough to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> before filming rolled br br in short with this new hollywood version <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> subtlety and wit because you'll be getting the complete opposite
<START> this is not a serious film and does not pretend to be but it is not as bad as some of its reviews it's title and the first ten minutes lead you to expect br br the plot is very silly but this adds to the light hearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film the characters are played <UNK> and while they do engage in typical teenage angst they generally avoid the <UNK> sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre br br unusually set in london sympathetic to <UNK> this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on if you want some tongue in cheek silliness and don't mind <UNK> your disbelief
<START> if the ending hadn't been so fantastically unexpected i don't think i could rate this movie so well br br this movie has a lot of uncomfortable <UNK> marriage falling apart character interaction that sort of thing is not my kind of drama so the pace seemed to drag for me br br in addition the main characters are difficult to relate to and thus care much about the husband alan <UNK> is rather bitter and <UNK> and the wife polly walker is <UNK> and a little <UNK> the acting was just fine norman <UNK> was very <UNK> but the characters themselves were perhaps a little too realistically flawed for me br br the setting was nice and appropriately isolated and a little spooky the cinematography had something to it that seemed a little old fashioned to me somehow br br but the last 5 15 minutes of this movie are so ingenious that every uncomfortable scene awkward conversation and inexplicable character behavior absolutely worth it i guessed every typical plot twist except the one that occurred br br the ending definitely makes this movie worth watching the intrigue and the drama not quite as much
<START> often considered <UNK> last great film this entry into the giallo <UNK> is <UNK> better than any <UNK> film that has followed it though i have yet to see mother of tears but to call it his last great film might be <UNK> it a bit br br the directorial and <UNK> <UNK> the hallmark of all <UNK> films is indeed present with some of his sequences of suspense <UNK> up with his best the <UNK> sequence is especially memorable and the cinematography by <UNK> taylor is outstanding the <UNK> lighting is beautiful br br however the narrative which is hit and miss in all of <UNK> films is missing here there is indeed a potent sense of mystery and intrigue but the plot <UNK> to what is essentially a string of murder sequences with one following the another leaving no real time to fully <UNK> a right focused mystery to be solved all of this results in a climax that is well anti climatic as the film did not <UNK> enough interest to make us truly care br br regardless this is recommended simply due to the masterful direction and beautiful imagery that <UNK> evokes i <UNK> recommend this as a starting point for <UNK> films however for that i would recommend either deep red or <UNK> but if you enjoyed those or even any giallo then this is a very good addition to your viewing <UNK>
<START> not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal br br there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off <UNK> physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the 27 minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our hero br br earlier it's a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later it's big joe roberts a <UNK> cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his best br br it's just a <UNK> half hour that makes little sense but cares it's buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think 85 years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
<START> may contain spoilers br br i had very high expectations for this film based on the trailer i knew a bit about the real ed <UNK> so i figured this was a medium budget hollywood version of the real events man was i wrong br br first the writing apparently came from an eight <UNK> who barely knew anything about <UNK> history and <UNK> out the script in about 20 minutes the movie completely passes over the most interesting <UNK> of ed and his relationship with his mother not to mention what the real police found in his house and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy who looks like he just <UNK> onto the set likewise all of the male characters seem to be ad <UNK> their dialog throughout the entire movie i'm not <UNK> br br don't even get me started with the historical goofs in this movie seriously who the hell directed this this movie is supposed to take place around 1957 but the cops are carrying modern side handled some of the stuff in the <UNK> store look like they came from and when the cop gets to a he 9 1 1 didn't exist back then also ed was a small guy scary like anthony character in psycho who was supposedly based on real life ed not this <UNK> dude who ended up looking way too much like the bad guy in men in black br br another thing that really <UNK> me was the appearance that the makers of this film shot the whole thing in an abandoned 3 building set because of the clever camera angles you never see any actual town and the interior of the sets looked like old long abandoned <UNK> pop a cash register on a saw horse and <UNK> instant <UNK> store br br i'm usually pretty <UNK> of low budget horror films but this one just begs for it all you had to do was include most of the real events even <UNK> them pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones and for <UNK> sake take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while my advice <UNK> ed <UNK> you'll be far more entertained
<START> an anonymous film which could have been directed by anyone at all where is anthony mann the director of such classics as el <UNK> the naked <UNK> or the man from <UNK> br br there are marvelous shots of planes in the clouds lovingly filmed the story is very trite and almost completely devoid of <UNK> the couple lives an almost routine life and the user who complains about june choice for the wife imho totally misses the point with her less than attractive look her <UNK> voice she was the perfect housewife the screenplay needed at the time women were <UNK> and pregnant there 's not one single woman among the base staff even in the desk jobs all they had to do was worrying about their who were fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never hear but in 1955 it was not hard to guess it br br one wonders why a young person who has never seen a mann movie should choose this one among all the great movies he made
<START> i finally have seen the real reason why peter boyle became famous it wasn't being the monster in young frankenstein or being <UNK> frank <UNK> on everybody loves raymond for younger people who only know him from tv give this film a try it makes frank look like a saint br br joe is boyle in his finest acting role and as someone mentioned most likely gave the inspiration for <UNK> <UNK> on all in the family i think boyle even went back to joe a little to play frank i say this because i noticed the basement of both joe frank <UNK> look similar br br i knew nothing of this movie when i checked it out of the library i just knew boyle and susan sarandon were featured yes susan does look great here and for a young actress a very good early role a young hippie wanna be who escapes her parents home and lives with the ultimate lost in a drug induced <UNK> hippie who also sells as much as he buys br br after a near fatal over dose on too many <UNK> she is <UNK> while her parents go to collect her things her mother wont go into the <UNK> run down apartment but her father does while dad <UNK> up her things her boyfriend comes home and the two exchange words and then the father does what we will later hear joe say he'd like to do to a hippie br br joe is shooting his mouth off about how he hates different cultures races hippies and a <UNK> list of others when he says i'd really like to kill one of them the father trying to look like he's kidding says i just did joe almost buys it but then takes it as funny br br later when the police are at the scene and the story is in the paper joe realizes he wasn't kidding instead of <UNK> the rich guy for money through blackmail he actually kind of does blackmail him by just wanting him and his wife to get to know him and his wife long story short their association is awkward but after sarandon gets wind of what her father has done the bottom is at risk of falling out br br how this all plays out in the end you'll have to watch for yourself although it's over 35 years ago the ending is something you wont expect unless you've seen the film before of course again i recommend it mostly for those who haven't seen it br br 10 stars for boyle not just playing someone completely opposite his nature but for what will show others that he was more than just a tv and movie comedy actor end
<START> the film disappointed me for many reasons first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was well built but did only feature a <UNK> role then the story itself was a weak copy of lost in translation the middle eastern setting man with family meets new girl overseas <UNK> bar the camera movements and the imagery all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent lost in translation which had also credibility this movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural it is not i wonder why tim robbins even considered doing this film the female main actress is awful did she play the in minority report and why do you have to show the <UNK> in a movie like this lost in translation didn't have to show excessive love scenes r rated just for this this movie isn't even worth watching it from a <UNK>
<START> cuba gooding jr and ed harris are touching this movie is really surprising it was enjoyable from start to finish br br the story is about mentally challenged man who helps out with a football team br br
<START> i had the <UNK> of attending the uk <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> this evening having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films c'mon lets be honest self <UNK> is his middle name br br i was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one the film is rich with interesting dialogue perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination br br the <UNK> glory of this film though lies with <UNK> <UNK> whom no fault or error can be found he manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite theatrical couldn't think of a better word he definitely deserved his prize at cannes and is heading for an oscar no doubt hoping to see him in something again soon
<START> i was <UNK> disappointed with this one having just read the wonderful oscar <UNK> story i had hoped for at least a little of the magic to translate onto the screen well there was none this version played like a <UNK> <UNK> down <UNK> <UNK> movie not only did it feel rushed it was <UNK> and needlessly re written major characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed i appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen especially on what may very well have been a limited tv budget but there is no excuse for <UNK> a great story in this way i thoroughly recommend reading <UNK> tale of the <UNK> that exists under even the most beautiful <UNK> but i cannot advise anyone to rent this travesty
<START> this is the final episode we deserved at the end of the last season things were left in a <UNK> goes <UNK> mood which was hardly the wrap up that this realistic series deserved while not a happy show this series was always one that made you think a rare thing on television and this is no exception <UNK> death justified by reasoning ' <UNK> morals <UNK> of society or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power ' <UNK> is a just death and can it exist ' all of these questions and more are <UNK> by the writers of this show every week and this is their final <UNK> fine acting great writing wonderful camera work brilliant editing clean direction if you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran then get a hold on a copy somehow if you never watched the series when it ran then this will stand up on its own but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are <UNK> to in their varied <UNK> for those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons this is very satisfying viewing
<START> i bought a dvd collection 9 movies for 10 <UNK> where this one was included it turned out to be the uncut version whatever that means beside the low average quality and short scenes there was one thing that was really strange the soft sex scene it started with a close up of 2 bigger breasts after around 2 minutes i had an expression on my face which <UNK> the term quite perfectly 7 5 minutes of not even <UNK> <UNK> like tits at this point the term breasts is a bad choice is far beyond from entertainment br br the rest of the movie was more like people aren't that stupid are they br br lucky me the dvd was <UNK> and i got my money back
<START> yes my summary just about tells it all br br if you haven't watched this try it but not for pleasure for studies of one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct family oriented and cool at the same time br br the men always think they know everything are stupid and finally loose to the magnificent women etc this is especially offensive when all the characters are just as terrible and <UNK> i mean ok cody was funny one time or another but unlike other stupid characters <UNK> like woody in cheers or joey in friends he doesn't get good lines his stupidity is cast in a way which gets quite annoying after a while br br the family <UNK> is awful everything for the family mother and father are supreme <UNK> who <UNK> severe <UNK> and old fashioned <UNK> constantly say they love their kids and then of course in the end the kids love them back <UNK> br br and there's always a tender spot like that <UNK> into the action where american c <UNK> <UNK> lessons are forced upon the viewers about sex in a mature you can't have sex before you're 18 kind of way or drugs even church <UNK> are thoroughly described here the whole concept is directly sickening all made in a half hearted way to make money if there are people like karen and frank out there please lock them up and the key br br so with themes ranging as far as revolting religious propaganda i think it's fair to conclude as i did in my subject
<START> both the book and the film are excellent in their own right they do <UNK> slightly but that enhances and not <UNK> from what is an excellent script and acting the historical atmosphere the young girl looking for love the amazing background of music hall and the voyage into the lesbian world of london early <UNK> century make this an exceptional movie andrew davies as the scriptwriter excels himself as he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity <UNK> sterling and <UNK> are both excellent actresses and give these parts their best the rest of the cast are very good if there was higher than 10 out of 10 i would give it
<START> i was greatly disappointed by the quality of this documentary the content is poorly produced very poor quality video and especially awful audio there's extremely little about how bruce <UNK> produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music the interviews of people who knew bruce <UNK> are ad <UNK> mostly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> too much <UNK> and not enough <UNK> although i have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention span even for slow and or difficult subject matter i fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to review it to see the parts i slept through if you watch this make sure that you are set up before viewing like alex in a clockwork orange bruce <UNK> deserves much better than this shame on the producer and director
<START> <UNK> is an odd slice in the japanese pink genre as it has the requisite sex scenes and misogynistic tone that is all but required for these types of films but also throws in a disjointed drama dark comedy storyline that seems like it'd have been better suited for a different type of film <UNK> br br the film starts with two lone guys at a restaurant each <UNK> about a previous sexual encounter one is a mutual subway <UNK> the other a pretty typical for this type of film semi rape scenario the two <UNK> meet and start talking after one lends the other a cigarette they hang out for an evening and talk a bit about their respective sex lives the film is inter cut with flashback scenes of both of the men's interactions with the women that are central in their lives the two men have a falling out and the film ends on a weird but predictable note <UNK> br br i really don't know what to make of <UNK> it sorta comes off as a soft core <UNK> type of anti buddy film but doesn't really explore the subject matter to any satisfying degree there's also not much of the typical extreme <UNK> often so prevalent in these types of films so i can't really figure out what the point was i also cant quite tell if the film was supposed to be funny depressing or both <UNK> think that <UNK> could have had some potential as a more serious drama film with a dark comedy edge but as a soft core sex film that tries to be too <UNK> for its own good it just doesn't work <UNK> can't say i hated this one but can't say there's anything notable about it either 4 <UNK>
<START> looking for something shocking okay fine the imagery is that that's about it this film attempts to make deep connections with the audience through various symbolism and just ends up being annoying i am not quite sure if the director's purpose was to truly portray some sort of deep message to his audience or if he just sought to shock the hell out of them with gore sex and violence i am thinking that it was probably the first but in the failed attempt it simply ended up to be a piece of artsy garbage with lots of blood some obnoxious characters and an over <UNK> on religious symbolism if you're looking for some independent film to critique for its attempted use of metaphor have at it if you are looking for a gore flick that will make you <UNK> and uncomfortable here you go if you are looking for a film that will <UNK> you to no end because you realize that in the end the message was stupid the movie was stupid and you will never get those minutes of your life back this is surely the film for you
<START> i have always been a huge fan of homicide life on the street so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up i couldn't wait br br let me just say i was not disappointed at all it was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television i've ever seen it was great to see everyone back again but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre <UNK> back because the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> was always the strongest part of an all together great show
<START> henry don <UNK> turns up at the entrance to hell and <UNK> his life story to his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the story focuses on his relationships with females throughout his life and in particular his relationship with martha gene tierney at the end of the film we cut back to henry and his <UNK> for a very predictable ending br br unfortunately there is nothing more to say about the film because nothing happens its a sentimental story of one man's life and its very boring i watched it with my girlfriend and my dad and we all thought it was rubbish despite the lubitsch touch i <UNK> more than 15 times hugo charles coburn is good whenever he is on screen as the grandfather and there were a few funny moments of dialogue the colour made it a good spectacle but it wasn't enough to save this from going into the reject pile in the same <UNK> as its a wonderful world and you can't take it with you and so not surprisingly it was nominated for an oscar a story about ordinary people none of whom are interesting and with no storyline of any interest boring sentimental and the biggest <UNK> <UNK> of an ending that i can remember
<START> not too much the classic top gun or independence day when it comes to fighter jet excitement yes the movie top to bottom is based on a truly fictional example of how anyone can pull off a rescue but it is cool because it breaks all traditional rules the kid doing what he wants to do in a jet the way he wants to do it br br i can't really put my finger on just what i love about this movie but others i know that saw the movie feel the same way about it i do i think its just basically a lot of fun but maybe a little too unrealistic for some to buy into br br again regardless i loved it people who i know saw it loved it so its definitely worth seeing to make your own decisions about it put it this way i thought that top gun was one of the best fighter pilot movies ever and i like this movie just as much if not more than top gun don't miss out do see it a truly inspirational movie
<START> the second not animated movie about the only people still <UNK> to surrender to the roman empire is even more hilarious than the first film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br where the first movie got all the laughs because all cartoon characters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their identity this sequel which is a separate story as are all the comic books is even better sure all the ingredients that you find in the first movie and in the comic books are present again is still dying to taste the magic <UNK> that gives his other tribe members such enormous powers <UNK> and the rest of the roman empire are still enemy number 1 but some new refreshing elements have been brought to the stage as well br br not only is setting very <UNK> biggest part plays of course in egypt but rather than repeating movie number one some extras have been added by making all kinds of references to other movies bruce lee etc this is all not very new but the unexpected combination of the known story from the comic book with almost the same title as the movie and references to stuff that has got absolutely nothing to do with <UNK> really works br br in that way the movie builds further on a tradition by comic writers and who didn't hesitate to bring laurel and hardy on the stage and even <UNK> an entire story to kirk douglas br br if all of this doesn't convince you to watch this movie i'm sure monica <UNK> playing <UNK> will
<START> these days writers directors and producers are relying more and more on the surprise ending the old art of bringing a movie to closure taking all of the information we have learned through out the movie and bringing it to a nice complete ending has been lost now what we have is a movie that no matter how complex detailed or <UNK> can be wrapped up in 5 minutes it was all in his her head that explanation is the director's safety net if all else fails or if the writing wasn't that good or if we ran out of money to complete the movie we can always say it was all in his her head and end the movie that way the audience will buy it because well none of us are <UNK> and none of us are suffering from <UNK> not that we know about so we take the story and believe it after all the mind is a powerful thing some movies have pulled it off but those movies are the reason why we are getting more and more of these crap endings every director writer now thinks they can pull it off because well fight club did it and it made a lot of money so we get movies like the <UNK> secret window identity and this movie just to name a few
<START> this film has the language the style and the attitude down plus <UNK> rides from a world <UNK> and the great jerry lopez john <UNK> as turtle has the surf <UNK> down and the surfing scenes are still the best ever a true classic that can be seen many times <UNK> is a babe and <UNK> hamilton shows the early stuff that has made him the world's number one extreme <UNK>
<START> a sentimental heart <UNK> family film set in england of the 1920s a young elizabeth taylor wins a horse in a and decides to enter him in the grand national fortunately ex <UNK> mickey rooney is around to give liz some help director clarence brown displays some remarkable control with material that could've been <UNK> <UNK> in someone else's hands he and screenwriters helen <UNK> and theodore reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally true there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced but overall it's quite affecting and <UNK> filmed in technicolor the race itself is quite thrilling and like so many great classics there's a marvelous three <UNK> fade out at the end liz proves that she was a real <UNK> right from the start and rooney who i usually find rather annoying is surprisingly subdued and really very good donald crisp is as <UNK> gruff father and angela lansbury is a delight as her older boy crazy sister most of the acting kudos however belong to anne <UNK> who won a richly deserved supporting actress oscar playing <UNK> wise and caring mother
<START> one of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly <UNK> as an in name sequel there's nothing wrong with that except this the return of chevy chase as <UNK> <UNK> this <UNK> the viewer to this character from the original <UNK> in 1980 and makes fans thinking or wanting <UNK> ii to be similar to the first one br br there are rumors that rodney <UNK> was supposed to return he carried a big part of the first film so his return would have put <UNK> 2 over the top jackie mason is the <UNK> rodney for this movie and does a decent job even though their comic <UNK> are way different dan <UNK> was great but not in the film enough he should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time bill murray got in the first one robert stack airplane was good in the <UNK> ted knight <UNK> role we miss you ted danny <UNK> should have been back so many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later should not have <UNK> the total <UNK> it did instead the characters involved rather than the club itself should have been the main focus like they were in the first one when you watch this film keep in mind that it isn't a major sequel and you may think it's another good or bad eighties comedy fans of the first should see it but don't be shocked when the comparisons between the original and part ii are so far apart
<START> one of the many <UNK> about <UNK> was that the world was going to end at the stroke of midnight on december <UNK> 1999 in the book of life ' writer director hal hartley takes a look at the possible <UNK> of a new millennium <UNK> beginning with the return of jesus to earth on new year's eve the story <UNK> the task of the son of god who must open the remaining three of the seven <UNK> contained in the book of life now contained in a mac <UNK> computer in which there is also the names of the one hundred and forty four thousand good souls who will be <UNK> on the last day jesus martin <UNK> along with p j harvey arrives in new york city to make the <UNK> necessary for carrying out his father's will but he begins to have second thoughts must he judge the living and the dead do they deserve what must <UNK> them it is a cup he would prefer not to embrace at this particular moment which gives <UNK> to satan thomas jay ryan who fears that the fruit of all his hard labor is about to be washed away at midnight for he can only continue his work so long as there are people around who <UNK> to their pitiful hopes and dreams an artistically rendered high concept film hartley presents the story in an intelligent thought provoking manner taking great care in dealing with the sensitive subject matter so as to make it <UNK> even to the most <UNK> <UNK> the dialogue between jesus and satan is intriguing and stimulating as is the effect of their presence upon those they encounter during their <UNK> stay in the city it's an engrossing <UNK> on the spiritual side of man's fragile existence and a <UNK> of that which has been <UNK> in the revelations of st john in the apocalypse the last book of the new testament and there is logic in hartley's approach to the second coming he maintains the aesthetic of the contemporary setting while <UNK> altered film <UNK> which visually give the film an <UNK> quality christ wears a suit and tie effectively <UNK> in with the <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> is a bit more casual his appearance somewhat <UNK> he sports a <UNK> above his left eye <UNK> is well cast as jesus <UNK> a <UNK> and a sense of restrained urgency to his character that is very effective it is of course a unique portrayal of the <UNK> and possibly the best since max von <UNK> in the greatest story ever told ' he successfully conveys a feeling of inner peace and <UNK> of <UNK> that is the essence at the very core of the character and ryan is thoroughly engaging in his role of the prince of darkness he has a distinct manner of speech and a <UNK> quality to his voice that make him absolutely mesmerizing to watch his eyes are darkly <UNK> a <UNK> he uses effectively with <UNK> <UNK> and captivating stares he's the guy who could sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you ever knew what hit you it's a memorable performance that <UNK> so well with portrayal of jesus the supporting cast includes martin <UNK> edie dave dave d j <UNK> lawyer james <UNK> true believer <UNK> assistant and anna <UNK> hotel clerk in his own <UNK> style with the book of life ' hartley has crafted a perspective of the last days that is interesting entertaining and truly unique he has a way of capturing life as it is just off center a method which works especially well with a film like this <UNK> short for a feature film running time of <UNK> minutes it nevertheless is one of hartley's best and more than worth the price of admission it's a film that will stay with you and perhaps make you think about some things you may have <UNK> away in a corner of your mind for later and that is part of the attraction of this film it makes you realize that <UNK> most likely is now i rate this one 9 10
<START> i watch family affairs <UNK> st east <UNK> on <UNK> every week night family affairs is by far the worst bad plots bad sequences and the worst acting of any even worse than the americans and that is saying something br br i find it very frustrating that all these shows on <UNK> australia are so far behind the uk and when one <UNK> to find out the reason for this they just <UNK> you off with some story that they will show double episodes to catch up needless to say this never happens i am very happy that family affairs is going to make space for something of better quality but at the same time i would to know the background reasons did they finally realize how bad it was did people stop watching it whatever it was you <UNK> leave us in suspense why do you feel that you have to keep everything a secret from your fans or is it that you just don't care i feel strongly that you should try and keep your public up to date family affairs is notorious for just having its characters disappear and <UNK> for seemingly no reason we do get involved in the people and enjoy following their lives br br i can understand why family affairs would have to come to an end even though we are so far behind here in australia it is easy to see that the writers are running out of ideas for new plots so many plots are being repeated and old episodes coming back i have also noticed that as new characters are being introduced a lot of them are really bad actors like you are <UNK> the bottom of the barrel and ending up with the <UNK> regards vince
<START> is one of the most interesting movies that i have ever seen i experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as i was <UNK> for the two leads to reunite that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end but the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie it is not a movie which people are likely to <UNK> but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people as of now i haven't <UNK> the movie and i don't think i will br br the story follows the experiences of a man max who is engaged to be married to muriel he remembers his old girlfriend lisa he considers this the love of his life as he <UNK> by accident to lisa talking on the <UNK> thus he tries to find lisa here starts his extremely frustrating search for lisa there are many layers to this movie there are <UNK> of jealousy and so on there is also another character called alice who is involved in the whole confusion the movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways it is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique what i love about the fact is that a movie about obsession jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner it has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience the main character max has shades of grey and i felt the ending was perfect i don't think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a <UNK> with alice br br the character of alice is even worse her manipulation and her <UNK> lying can really <UNK> viewers that is the point i guess the scene where she breaks down in front of <UNK> really shows another <UNK> of her character it shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life in the end she understands that she needs to get away from it all the ending lends a cynical touch because it seems as if <UNK> love for alice is temporary and fake it is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option i e muriel than to pursue something that is so fleeting i e lisa or alice in many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance in a way br br the performances deserve high praise vincent <UNK> as max gives a great performance he perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement his geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly but the real star of the movie is as alice her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of alice and is in love with max the scene where she screams i am a <UNK> too really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her br br btw i also thought <UNK> is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie <UNK> actions can be explained in many ways and her <UNK> obsession with lisa may also be explained as a <UNK> of a lesbian desire it may be far fetched considering she encourages lisa to forgive her current boyfriend but i got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time she also avoids questions from lisa regarding a boyfriend she spends a whole lot of time with lisa and she is happy during that time that may lead many to question her sexual <UNK> br br overall i would give it a 9 10 i think it deserves it but i <UNK> one because of the <UNK> factor i think it is a perfect movie otherwise
<START> larry <UNK> billy crystal has a crazy life his wife kate <UNK> stole his book and left him he has a new budding romance with a girl named beth kim <UNK> he doesn't know how to start his book and his students of his screen writing class are stranger than most however one student danny <UNK> is extra strange he lives with his evil <UNK> anne <UNK> and he can't get up the courage to kill her so than he goes to larry for help making his life go from normal crazy to extra crazy br br <UNK> silver should have done more the dialog the characters the whole script is near perfect and danny <UNK> has proved to me he's more than a great actor he's a great director his kid's movie <UNK> is among my favorite family movies and now this is one of my favorite comedies br br it's a black comedy most jokes are about murder but it's damn funny all of the actors are doing their full potential whether they're main characters billy crystal or just one bit minor characters olivia brown br br if you like comedy who doesn't than you'll like this 8 10 stars

<START> the original airport 1970 was a classic of its kind and the first two b movie follow ups airport 1975 airport <UNK> were watchable fun at best amusing camp at worst but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience it's <UNK> and not even good for laughs br br all of the three airport sequels were theatrical releases made by <UNK> television wing but this one is beneath even the modest standards of a tv movie of its day with <UNK> production grotesque casting visual <UNK> and tasteless unfunny comedy the project was clearly doomed by the creative efforts of universal executive <UNK> lang who personally produced and is given a story credit br br everyone starts somewhere and writer eric roth forrest <UNK> might have provided an element of self <UNK> as had the previous films especially the notorious airport 1975 but there is nothing worth <UNK> in <UNK> turgid incoherent script and even the comedy airplane left this <UNK> <UNK> br br what makes the <UNK> airport <UNK> particularly offensive is its insulting <UNK> of professionals the worst victim is the <UNK> gifted <UNK> the autobiography of miss jane <UNK> reduced to a <UNK> subplot involving her <UNK> a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight br br a special kick to the <UNK> is reserved for the wonderful george kennedy who is the true lead despite being buried in the cast list the official <UNK> of the airport series and the only actor to appear in all four movies kennedy had more than earned the starring role and his turn in the <UNK> seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry other than the <UNK> of one last buck kennedy provides the only warmth and real humor in this mechanical briefly putting aside the <UNK> <UNK> and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side to himself and his lovable and heroic character of joe <UNK> unfortunately we are never allowed to forget how fat and old and over the hill kennedy is and <UNK> pretty boy <UNK> <UNK> relentlessly calls him <UNK> pig as part of a buddy bonding that falls completely flat even <UNK> <UNK> romance the only <UNK> part of this plane wreck turns out to be merely a set up for a hateful joke at <UNK> and the viewer's expense
<START> spoilers even though the movie they made me a criminal is nowhere as good as the later john garfield anti hero classics like body soul in <UNK> force of evil in 1948 and his last and very underrated he ran all the way in 1951 it's the film that defined his career from that point <UNK> until his <UNK> death on may 21 <UNK> at the young age of <UNK> br br <UNK> plays the part of light weight champion <UNK> and later the fugitive from the law jack who's innocent of the murder that he's charged with even though he's been <UNK> officially dead manager doc ward robert doc who during a drunken victory party killed reporter charles <UNK> john <UNK> who was going to expose to the public his fighter <UNK> lies about him being a one women guy as well as non drinking <UNK> boy doc <UNK> a bottle over <UNK> head killing him as was almost dead drunk with a number of women <UNK> in his hotel <UNK> br br doc was later killed in a car crash with girlfriend goldie ann sheridan but doc burned to a crisp and with watch on him was mistaken for <UNK> told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer robert strange who took 9 <UNK> 00 of the 10 000 00 of money that he had for this great piece of advice told <UNK> to take on a new identity and call himself from now on jack and get the hell out of the state of new york talking about sleazy <UNK> <UNK> now jack travels the <UNK> from new york down to arizona ending up at the date farm where most of the film takes place br br if it wasn't for john garfield in the lead role as both jack the movie would have long been lost and forgotten garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie even the transported dead end kids i guess we can call them the arizona kids here acting were <UNK> above what you would have expected from them and they came across as real and sensitive persons not a bunch of slap stick <UNK> like in almost all of their movies all that due to being on the same stage or filming location with john garfield br br they made me a criminal is a good story that has the undercover <UNK> acting like anything but not to draw any attention on himself and end up not only behind bars but in the electric chair in the end jack showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family at the date farm including his girl peggy gloria <UNK> to open up a gas station with it br br giving the european <UNK> <UNK> frank the fight of his life and getting 2 000 00 thats 500 00 a round for doing it jack showed everyone who looked up to him like the arizona kids that sometimes taking a punch is far and more courageous then throwing one the fact that jack could have easily <UNK> but didn't in order not to expose himself to the police as on the loose killer <UNK> but instead went as far as he could taking everything that could throw at him to help out his friends showed more then all the fights that he won in the boxing ring put together br br i for one didn't find the ending of the movie contrived at all but fitting right in with the story the cop <UNK> claude <UNK> who came to arizona from new york to arrest jack had to live with for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair we were told all this right at the start of the movie why knowing that jack <UNK> was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again i can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies
<START> i enjoyed this series but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording mixing br br for whatever reason they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called <UNK> where the actors replace the original location sound with a re recording of it in a sound booth br br the reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain br br it wouldn't be so bad if the <UNK> was done well but at times it's just plain distracting it's not just the <UNK> that's the problem the sound mix just doesn't match up to the quality of performances and the pictures br br i'd be curious to know what went wrong
<START> i personally found the film to be great i had it on pre order for a month and watched it twice the day i got it in the mail and several time since yes the time <UNK> may be a bit much but the rest of the movie clearly <UNK> for it all <UNK> cast yet the acting was right on for each part the plot itself is just <UNK> there's no other way to describe it who makes a movie about someone getting f <UNK> thats who genius simply genius two thumbs up i would be <UNK> to work with him any day any time on any thing
<START> i can't explain it but i find this movie not only funny but so enjoyable i feel compelled to watch it over and over or at least i did when i had cable tv i always felt it was a really poorly made movie but perhaps that is because i watched it on cable i plan to get a dvd of this movie to really take an honest look at at but more importantly to just have a good time watching it i liked the plot and the idea of the movie and i especially liked the cast i always wonder if the cast enjoyed making the movies they are in and this is no exception this film deserved a better fate than it received and <UNK> <UNK> deserved at least one love scene with ms holly who wouldn't the characters in this movie were the kind of guys i could identify with when i was in the military and the <UNK> was exact nice going troops
<START> caution potential spoilers ahead br br steven spielberg presents tiny <UNK> adventures was always one of my favorite cartoons growing up heck it still is and this movie perfectly captures everything i love about the show and puts it in full length form br br beautifully animated by the tokyo movie studio wb <UNK> every tiny <UNK> project and this was the best studio to handle the show the movie starts at the end of the school year at <UNK> the renowned cartoon college where buster and <UNK> bunny no relation and their teenage <UNK> peers learn from the masters of animated <UNK> the looney tunes after the final bell the movie <UNK> off into five different plots buster <UNK> <UNK> in a water gun fight that <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> wave sending buster <UNK> and dog byron <UNK> on an <UNK> <UNK> table in search of adventure in the deep south <UNK> duck talks pig and his family into letting him come with them to the <UNK> place in the western <UNK> but he has to put up with an excruciating car ride and the threat of a chainsaw wielding <UNK> cat <UNK> finally runs away but she isn't not when there are plenty of to play with at the <UNK> <UNK> park <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> her summer to hunting down her <UNK> movie star johnny <UNK> in the hopes of getting an <UNK> of course the hotel he's staying at is nearly <UNK> and shirley sets up a fortune telling booth on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and lets her guard down on her day off when takes her to see the horror flick br br all these story lines are hilarious and some of them even <UNK> in the end the only complaint i have with this movie is that it doesn't make full use of the tiny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> devil and mary have only one scene <UNK> <UNK> only appears at the beginning and end of the film and montana max <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and little are nowhere to be found still they're <UNK> flaws in an otherwise perfect film this movie is pretty rare today since it's over 12 years old and has never been released on dvd to my knowledge but i highly suggest you track it down anyone who's a fan of warner bros animation either classic or contemporary needs to see this movie
<START> this movie stinks <UNK> the only reason i gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming it's total disregard for a plot and the lack of even <UNK> surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings this is by far the worse anime that came out of japan i can't believe they actually put their names on this garbage what a rip off selling this thing for 20 if you haven't seen this don't bother if you have i pity you
<START> the <UNK> of al <UNK> br br who shot <UNK> br br <UNK> lands the part of gypsy in the tv remake br br these are some of the great <UNK> mysteries of the 20th century how else can i say it except i thought she was awful <UNK> mannerisms poor <UNK> acting ie that blank stoic stare while he co star in the scene speaks and a singing voice that most voice <UNK> would rate mediocre but she is stunningly gorgeous and after all wasn't that what the gypsy character is all about <UNK> in on her looks she didn't cut the <UNK> in the talent department br br as for the rest bette is fantastic whether or not she's playing herself or playing mama rose it works either way and i for one thought <UNK> russell was as exciting as <UNK> in the original peter as <UNK> is the perfect understated foil to <UNK> over the top mama and he's the medium <UNK> <UNK> between <UNK> hot dish and <UNK> stone cold <UNK> is right br br one final <UNK> to the man responsible for decades to come of cher jokes bob drag queens would kill for the <UNK> and <UNK> on display here <UNK> coming up <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br
<START> aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in ma which is a beautiful town where my mother once rented a small <UNK> and i spent many a pleasant summer as a child it is fun and cute little film br br i must admit that i had no desire to actually see this movie even though i have a for romantic comedies i don't know why the trailers i saw were not appealing the cast did not look that interesting and i had no idea what the plot would be about in the end i found it to be an interesting <UNK> on relationships and family i thoroughly enjoyed myself and must admit that i thought that this film was one of the most overlooked gems of last year i am disappointed that so few people seemed to have enjoyed the very human <UNK> that this movie presented the viewer with br br i have read many bad reviews of this film and must admit a certain level of shock at the cynicism that is prevalent in them as a <UNK> student i consider myself to be quite cynical but this was a beautiful little film that deserves much better than it got
<START> the child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit it was a pretty weak field for best picture that year i think apocalypse now should have taken it but the academy probably felt it was too violent and strange plus vietnam was still too recent meryl streep was tremendous as always playing a very unlikeable character i don't usually compliment directors but i really liked that bit with the elevator doors grade b
<START> this is the first movie i ever owned on video and 14 years later i still have the same copy elizabeth taylor was as <UNK> at twelve as ever later in life mickey rooney gave real dimension to <UNK> taylor and donald crisp was solid as ever as mr brown the amazing anne <UNK> as mrs brown seemed to be the <UNK> woman in the world after nearly 60 years the warmth humor and excitement of this film still affect the viewer we still laugh at the jokes root for the pie and love <UNK> for the spirit and capacity for love that she displays i love it as an adult just as i loved it as a child a must for every family video collection
<START> i'm a huge <UNK> allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie this was also my favourite scene where he <UNK> a character's weapons and directs her to down below unfortunately unlike <UNK> river of souls most of the action took place off station i didn't care much for <UNK> after the first three seasons and think sheridan is okay but no <UNK> i like <UNK> but she only had limited screen time if you like <UNK> or space battles you should enjoy it personally i can only give it 1 10
<START> this show has everything you could ever want from a prison drama there are twists and turns all the way till the season finally the characters are very strong and it gives the show a lot of power when watching the show you feel for not only the prisoners but the prison staff the actors who play prisoners on this show have done a very good job portraying a prisoner also if you like law and order <UNK> or law and order criminal intent there are many actors from this show that appear in those shows the only problem with oz is that it was not long enough this show could of easily had nine to ten seasons without getting old even after the season finale i <UNK> find myself watching oz all the time on dvd this show is easily one of the best shows on television don't be a fool go watch oz
<START> cool flick enjoyable to watch hope to see more from fred carpenter soon i really like the location setting with all the new york references it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end the suspense factor was effective and the acting though kept simple was also effective in portraying the characters there are a bunch of neat little tricks <UNK> into this film that make all the better i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role the casting and directing in this film seem to be <UNK> together <UNK> and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive the movie is not without its soft moments either which gives it a nice sense of balance
<START> a bunch of <UNK> girls make a new <UNK> spend the night in a creepy <UNK> of course the recently deceased don't stay deceased for long and all hell breaks loose one dark night is an enjoyable 80's horror with some ghastly dead bodies floating around that are being controlled by the spirit of a dead psychic there is no gore and nudity but the atmosphere of a <UNK> is very eerie the acting is solid but the script takes too much time to develop the characters until the final 20 minutes that finally breaks out of his grave the cinematography is impressive and the the <UNK> is a great location for the climactic events the film takes so long to get going and this is its major flaw 7 out of 10
<START> excellent movie in many aspects <UNK> has succeeded in depicting the time <UNK> with <UNK> care the light the places the feeling are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie and along with it in opposite to what happened to mad love la a rather episodic historical movie all of this beautiful photography music clothes is <UNK> a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way br br concerning the actors paz vega as carmen is outstanding liar seductive totally sexual so beautiful carmen is a little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for carmen but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie i recommend it to everyone the best spanish movie of the year
<START> even though the story is light the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so <UNK> and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie br br the film consists of four <UNK> stories all about different aspect of attraction between man and or woman and how it frequently is <UNK> their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto it will flow out like a handful of sand br br i thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more <UNK> the woman was the more the man desires her it parallels her deep love for god who is infinitely out of reach but never closer to her heart br br a very good movie 7 10
<START> 1975 is a cult classic starring <UNK> ray moore as the <UNK> superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the man along the way he has two enemies that no good willie green and the sleazy mayor watch <UNK> kick punch slap and <UNK> his way across the screen what's the man's name <UNK> br br interesting film that <UNK> the way for a generation of <UNK> and performers to sell more of his party albums <UNK> ray moore made several on the cheap films during the seventies self produced and <UNK> he <UNK> towards a specific audience some people call it <UNK> others call it trash i call it entertaining <UNK> was followed by the semi sequel the human <UNK> and a direct to video return of <UNK> 25 years later br br highly recommended a definite cult classic br br <UNK> if the film was properly <UNK> on video you wouldn't see the boom <UNK> <UNK> was cut to receive an r rating
<START> i just <UNK> over another comment posted here in which the writer <UNK> the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all no surprise it's what <UNK> <UNK> character does he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his the killer's girlfriend not because did not like this individual rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do this poor boy is bored in life and dead inside that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because it provides him with something to focus on
<START> what bergman has got here is what if all that bad stuff happened here in sweden to nice people like us and what he gives us in the swedish language with swedish actors on swedish locations and using what appear to be genuine swedish military vehicles is what was familiar from war films set in almost every other country in europe all the confusing <UNK> and counter <UNK> political lies camps <UNK> <UNK> summary <UNK> torture <UNK> <UNK> and so on as in a modern short story it's done in the abstract with no real names cities or countries used but the stronger <UNK> are nazis they <UNK> about self importantly and some wear shiny <UNK> boots one even <UNK> things with a riding crop ok it's actually a <UNK> the <UNK> couple are named <UNK> apart from the shame they feel at finding <UNK> ways to survive and who would not do what they did what all of the above suggests is that the title is clearly meant to refer to de <UNK> <UNK> with the nazis indeed what we are shown is what sweden might have looked like if germany had asked for a bit more than mining <UNK> br br the first half plays like a black comedy we see the fog of war from the point of view of a <UNK> passive couple who ignore the troops all around the long <UNK> the bombed out buildings the news reports c they do not even bother to find a working radio they are the ultimate in not in my backyard they talk of wine and meanwhile friends are mysteriously <UNK> and growing numbers of troops show up in the town they show no curiosity about the war that has been going on around them for many years br br the man von <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> the woman <UNK> is somewhat more <UNK> passionate and <UNK> looking there's a beautiful scene in which the man talks about his <UNK> the <UNK> he says fought in the <UNK> wars but his own interest stops with the cultural <UNK> in his hand or more precisely which his own warm feelings about <UNK> it and the security that that <UNK> assumes not in my backyard but when war finally breaks into their <UNK> <UNK> the man's <UNK> an <UNK> in good times turns into a <UNK> one he ends up <UNK> for as is often the case as bergman demonstrates subtly and beautifully definitely worth seeing
<START> okay last night august 18th 2004 i had the distinct <UNK> of meeting mr van at a showing of the film the <UNK> family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival here's what i have to say about it first of all the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger roman polanski oliver stone and terry gilliam movie i've ever seen second of all in a short q a session after the show mr van immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual <UNK> family members or charlie himself calling them <UNK> and saying he wanted nothing to do with them that the film was based on his van take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news and i'm assuming from the autobiography and the book <UNK> <UNK> which were directly <UNK> through the narrative so i had second on questions i asked if he was trying to present the <UNK> mtv sex drugs and rock <UNK> roll version and not necessarily the true story this question obviously off the by now <UNK> director who started shouting f you shut the f up this is the truth all those other movies are <UNK> br br well anyway i didn't even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when i read the <UNK> for the film you've heard the laws side of the story now hear the story as it is told by the <UNK> family excuse me if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be <UNK> that he doesn't want to have anything to do with how in god's name can he tell the story for them this is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard the film was obviously <UNK> to the sex drugs and rock <UNK> roll audience that it had no trouble in <UNK> to the small <UNK> lit theatre and was even more obviously <UNK> by the sex drugs and rock <UNK> roll mind of a man who couldn't even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky <UNK> call line to the actors on screen this film <UNK> little more than <UNK> the <UNK> image of actual events which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today into some sort of slasher comic book porno rape fantasy <UNK> up by an obviously shallow individual br br the film was definitely very impressive to look at the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual <UNK> of charlie's work with the family off of his lie album the editing was nice and choppy to <UNK> the nauseating <UNK> of most modern music videos all in all this film would have made a much better addition to the <UNK> at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual <UNK> i felt like i was at a midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving probably the best part of the experience the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who <UNK> some sort of stoned <UNK> and dragons <UNK> more than the actual role he was portraying the <UNK> the film gave of him as full of energy throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow <UNK> and <UNK> representation that was actually presented br br all in all the film basically explains itself as <UNK> or maybe it was linda declares at the end you can write a bunch of <UNK> books or make a bunch of <UNK> movies etc etc case in point even the <UNK> based on a true story is a dead <UNK> <UNK> that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world all you have to do is a little bit of <UNK> to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead br br all i can say is this when the film ended i got a free beer so i'm glad i went but not so glad i spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f up for asking the director a question peace
<START> this was one of the worst columbo episodes that i have seen however i am only in the second season br br the typical columbo activities are both amusing and irritating his <UNK> <UNK> causing him trouble have been seen before and the bit where he always <UNK> in some way with the murderer in this case cooking tho the scene on the tv cooking show distracted from the main theme br br also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the <UNK> of the <UNK> the reason was never explained nor did it serve any purpose but the part i disliked the most was the death of the bride to be this was never explained and it is the main reason why i give this episode such a low grade
<START> do not be <UNK> this is not a zombie movie take it from a guy who loves zombie movies and who <UNK> them all the good and the horrendous yes this movie has an extended zombie sequence but it's basically an artsy <UNK> exercise in <UNK> dread which is a long way of saying it's boring if you've worked hard all day and want to spend a couple of hours being entertained rent something else br br rise of the undead has cheap special effects mediocre acting and crummy dialogue all of that is understandable in an indie low budget film and i can forgive such flaws as long as a movie has an entertaining story to tell unfortunately rise of the undead hardly has any story at all moreover the acting is not laughably bad so much as non existent all of the actors seem to have studied at the buster keaton school of wooden faces would it have killed them to show some emotion and no yelling does not <UNK> with <UNK> the one character who actually had some <UNK> was killed off first granted there was another character who briefly held my interest he looked and acted like kyle <UNK> <UNK> norman bates but it was too little too late br br the filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a tiny detail film is a visual medium that means lighting your scenes well enough for the viewer to actually view what's going on and all those artsy jump cuts and close ups might have seemed cool at the time but all they did was make watching the film jarring and confusing there is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple clear fashion just look at george romero's low budget night of the living dead to see how it's done superbly and i know these folks had a small budget but if you can't hire the equipment and <UNK> necessary to actually make the dialogue <UNK> then just go ahead and make a silent movie then those buster keaton wooden faces might actually work br br i will say this for the film the zombies were creepy unlike most zombie movies where the undead are shown in all their <UNK> glory the <UNK> the better the zombies here were just <UNK> bloody faced people it actually worked to make them more like us and therefore scarier that's the reason i gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 br br the sad part about all this is that despite all of its flaws rise of the undead does not insult your intelligence the filmmakers seemed to have actually wanted to make a smart scary original movie and it's a shame that they failed so miserably if they could just <UNK> the too fancy editing buy a few extra <UNK> up the dialogue and come up with a real story that actually goes somewhere then i think they have the talent to make something really good br br trust me do not waste your time on rise of the undead
<START> i am a 20 year old bloke from england i don't cry at films but this one moved me i cried like a girl this is absolutely the most moving film i have ever seen even though the story was questionable joseph little face when he dreams of crying made me <UNK> every time how could anyone hurt such a sweet looking kid i'm going to cry now just thinking about it remarkable
<START> i went to crooked earth to see a piece of new zealand what i found was a badly scripted and badly acted echo of the people i know br br great moments between characters  including many of <UNK> and scenes together  were often ruined by long and <UNK> monologues that the actors were forced to stumble through beautiful and ill fitting phrases <UNK> away from lawrence in particular as if he were the new <UNK> at his <UNK> of beer <UNK> br br when watching any film with actors i've found that i can always pick a half dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life with crooked earth i <UNK> to find one key character that <UNK> true for the entire two hours most  including and  wound up saying or doing things that i didn't understand and couldn't connect with by the end of the movie the writer had succeeded in <UNK> the audience where the weren't able to relate to it and the were therefore given license to dismiss it my feeling is that the movies message  or at least the main one of several that was being at the audience  is important enough to avoid using character <UNK> unfortunately no one who read the script before it was filmed thought to pass this piece of advice on br br the soundtrack was <UNK> and as irritating as that horrible bing noise that they laced through eyes wide <UNK> the audience was not so subtly auto <UNK> to laugh cry or be angry when the music changed it reminded me of darth <UNK> entrance music in star wars obvious and mildly amusing br br i think that there are some people out there that might enjoy this film it's funny in parts has a fair amount of action and has some really powerful scenes <UNK> and quentin did bang up jobs as well as a whole though i didn't enjoy the experience as much as i know i should have <UNK> wire speed 2 the island of dr <UNK> and crooked earth look like they're going to be <UNK> of crap
<START> a stolen <UNK> of the mexican <UNK> a beautiful girl who is trying to <UNK> her life and to leave her husband a boss of the italian mafia a young sheriff who falls in love with his old sweetheart this is the plot of the <UNK> a country comedy located in small town of paradise arizona despite its simply and classic story the movie directed by alex wright has its fun moments when elizabeth <UNK> as candy porter looking at a green <UNK> says what s this a <UNK> candy or when the girl enters the sheriff s house and finds him completely naked or when the <UNK> ends up in that lake at the final sequence the cast offers some nice performances by matthew <UNK> as the sheriff of paradise valley who still loves his old girlfriend and by elizabeth <UNK> who s character still loves her old boyfriend the supporting cast including nicholas <UNK> paul rodriguez as the mexican and g michael gray what kind of teeth makes a pleasant work too not an oscar material but not so bad a fun comedy without <UNK>
<START> this movie is about a very delicate argument and if you are searching for something that makes you think here you are right tim robbins has made a wonderful job and the result is a kind of <UNK> drama that should be shown in schools for the strong themes treated what about the actors well they are simply great susan sarandon is truly 'the face of <UNK> and sean penn is unbelievable as almost always an absolutely must see
<START> <UNK> beware the <UNK> video release uses a print that defies description the movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so the print that is used is so faded and <UNK> that it appears almost <UNK> toned after 30 minutes some color <UNK> back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes keep in mind even at it's best the color is pale and washed out it looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception adding to this travesty is the most plodding delivery of lines that i can <UNK> even the voice over narration is <UNK> inducing every line is delivered in this irritating plodding demeanor i found myself wishing that they would hurry and get the words out for this reason i couldn't wait for this movie to end it's one of those so bad it's good movies but i wish that someone would find a half decent print
<START> i recently visited the magic kingdom as an adult with my mom her best friend and my adult sister disney world is often <UNK> perceived as a place for just children but when you see quality shows like you realize that the magic of disney is for everyone it was such a great show that we left the theater and turned around and got in line again and then a third time it was absolutely breathtaking i would encourage anyone who goes to disney world to check out this show which is not just a show but a world wind fun filled ride with donald as he once again lets his temper get him in trouble
<START> in relative terms having watched a lot of <UNK> bad <UNK> tom <UNK> <UNK> are geniuses for creating delivering in this writer's book the greatest ever tv show oz was treated horribly in this country the finale went out well gone 3 in the morning before that it was strictly considered alternative viewing for those oblivious to prime time garbage br br i first caught oz towards the end of the first series and from then on it was an <UNK> watch my man possibly the most <UNK> villain ever the perfect anti hero <UNK> an acting class in <UNK> there was the hardcore stuff of course some plain evil but essentially oz had soul <UNK> <UNK> the unfolding plot with <UNK> of insight while the struggles of <UNK> etc are better than any soap opera before or since compassion violence wisdom tragedy intelligence pain joy brutality love <UNK> oz went through the spectrum of human emotion all inside a max security prison br br i can honestly say those <UNK> nights with the great to follow oz series 2 3 way back in 99 were the best tv i'll ever see <UNK> <UNK> in the gym is a moment i don't need a video for a small screen classic i'll never forget br br imagine what oz would have done with the same push as the sopranos given a 10 <UNK> <UNK> and all the <UNK> fine i'm over that now for those that caught it consider yourself <UNK> for those who didn't tv is <UNK> and you deserve it
<START> another black comedy that won an oscar for best screenplay starring george c scott this <UNK> the phrase <UNK> a new a hole in this case the target is america's and grand hospital system throughout the hospital patients and doctors are dying because their names and <UNK> are being changed scott <UNK> screams and <UNK> away his workers and bosses as they fail more and more his comment about <UNK> to one of his many bosses is sure to <UNK> laughs he even beats and rapes a hippie 3 times this is one that has to be seen and heard as the monologues and <UNK> are the key points in the film
<START> this movie was really funny the people that were expecting to see an oscar worthy comedy should get over themselves this was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters plot lines dialog quotes and catch phrases i rate a movie a 10 if i have bought the dvd or in this case the <UNK> and have watched it many times and in this case still laugh out loud i have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half don't have anything do do with the oscars again this was just a fun light hearted movie i hope this comes out on dvd i highly suggest checking this movie out if you are in the mood for a wacky comedy
<START> i will give it this it tried it did try to make it good and even got luke wilson involved luke wilson is good but he can only do so much he can't make up for the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdeveloped br br the running gag with the bully was <UNK> he was never funny and i got tired of the gag really fast and the kid bit was kind of weak too he to florida yeah ok br br the movie felt like an average kiddie film at times with this <UNK> <UNK> adults stupid kids smart and that bit gets tiresome br br but the only moments that were funny was the police <UNK> wilson drove around when he lost his squad car i loved that little <UNK> especially when wilson turned on the <UNK> but other than that nothing else was worth my time d
<START> for those who appreciate the <UNK> of silent cinema and social commentary this is a unique film part homage to german <UNK> part allegory the film is <UNK> with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the <UNK> moreover the attention to period detail and the visual composition of the scenes as an <UNK> for <UNK> the story is stunning aside from this the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice perception and opinion in truth it's not so much the silence that <UNK> the film as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thought that inevitably follows in sum this film is something not often seen and as the producer of the film said in the q a that followed will leave you thinking about its meaning well into the next day
<START> this series doesn't present the british view of the revolutionary war so much as an anti american view of it the underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of <UNK> enjoyed british rule that the <UNK> fathers were manipulative <UNK> whose only goal was to draw britain into a violent civil war that the american supporters of the revolution and the <UNK> were racist violent <UNK> <UNK> into the struggle clearly the intent of the author richard holmes is for the viewer to these characteristics in a straight line from the american population of <UNK> to today br br for example in the episode the shot heard around the world holmes up an obscure print of the boston massacre in which he claims the skin of a black man and the first man killed in the revolution was <UNK> <UNK> out holmes claims that portraying as a black man would have been bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause holmes never reveals how he knows this and there's more holmes goes to some length to work in a single <UNK> atrocity the <UNK> of the body of a british soldier he <UNK> the american <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> and the without mentioning any differences in the goals of these groups the list goes on br br supposedly this series was made in response to mel <UNK> the <UNK> it says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to mel gibson on any topic instead of presenting the british view it seems holmes really wanted to give a <UNK> anti american view and in the process he's made himself the roger corman of historians strictly third rate schlock
<START> i am pretty surprised to see that this movie earned even <UNK> reviews i found this movie downright awful the plot <UNK> around trying to decide if it is a comedy or a thriller then realizes it cannot achieve either so it throws in the <UNK> and continues with its absurd plot <UNK> with a unintentional hilarious scene with laura <UNK> an <UNK> and <UNK> coffee that leaves the audience <UNK> <UNK> in their seats looking at one another like is this for real basically it is abysmal and really disappointing for robin williams fans and it makes you think someone <UNK> laura <UNK> into adding this piece of trash to her otherwise respectable resume i wanted to leave after 10 minutes and wish i had even seeing it for free i wanted someone to pay me for my wasted time the computer <UNK> twist in this movie was embarrassingly stupid and by the end you don't care who wins the election i vote for straight to dvd
<START> this is on my tv right now but only long enough for me to finish <UNK> it in this comment the previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better no matter how much i hope and pray i will <UNK> this movie is a <UNK> waste of my time and would be of your time it is not going to get any better i can't believe this screenwriter is doing <UNK> <UNK> i hope he has improved a million <UNK> i see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews but i'm still not convinced if you are familiar with his work please post something here because i really want to see <UNK> <UNK> and would hate it if this guy turned it into the garbage that this movie turned out to be
<START> this is probably my favourite tv show ever i love all the characters especially alex who is the perfect woman always makes me laugh and feel good when i watch this show there is just something about it that is amazing hard to describe br br it seems some or all of the episodes with music albums as well here are a few examples the episodes start again when they end but don't play end credits until the very end but always play the opening credits with most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice but some go on further br br <UNK> pink <UNK> bob dylan br br 2 <UNK> kid a ok computer episode plays at least 4 times br br 2 14 kid a <UNK> shot of love br br 2 19 <UNK> without <UNK> kid a wish you were here <UNK> honey episode plays at least 4 times br br there are clues in the episodes which tell you which albums kid a may with every episode
<START> this is a brilliant film the story starts off in romania where billy crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything there is a really funny scene here where crystal is a child and talks his father who is a <UNK> into eating <UNK> you may know that this is a parody of <UNK> religion he is mainly a talent <UNK> and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie after finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew he <UNK> falls into a small river believing he is dead some huge hands come out to reach him he later thinks he is in heaven he finds out that he isn't but that he is in a monastery believing god saved him he becomes a monk searching for who saved him he later finds a 7 <UNK> 7 in man who he casts as the perfect villain he also <UNK> shakespeare see the film and find out the rest
<START> this is a film about loneliness and how the distance  physical and emotional between people tends to relationships br br the narrative is simple to the point of <UNK> a young man from a rural village arrives in <UNK> to stay with his older and successful cousin wants work in the big city after trying for a few weeks to find work without any success the strain of having living with him is too much for they <UNK>  nothing physical just verbal eventually goes leaving alone again end of story br br except for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film much is said visually dialog is used to bring out <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> that exist within and between the two men br br there are many visual gems in this film for example while searching for work young needing a relationship tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city the look on his face as he is <UNK> every time says it all br br or wanting a cigarette opens the door to the balcony of apartment and lights up in the <UNK> december air leaving the door open eventually gets up from his work desk walks to the door all glass and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time then <UNK> the door leaving out in the cold the metaphor is complete br br or cleaning up after <UNK> and with increasing anger and all the while wastes his time chasing <UNK> instead of looking seriously for work and spends money on a toy for a is emotional <UNK> <UNK> and vulnerable is rational logical self confident and a demanding control freak the right brain left brain <UNK> beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look a gesture a <UNK> than any words can convey br br but is not completely <UNK> he still loves his ex wife who tells him that she's off to canada with her husband to be affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex and makes sure that she is okay about going he wishes her well he says goodbye he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking later when she calls to say a last goodbye on the way to the airport goes there and secretly watches as she leaves the <UNK> of the emotion on his face as she disappears through a door is worth the wait br br all in all this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director some might argue that the pace is too slow but life goes slowly for much of the time especially for those who are alone the camera work is relatively simple also choose the scene set up the camera and lighting and let the actors move across the scene enter the scene and leave the scene all the while keeping the camera still there were a few <UNK> shots some high angle tracking shots a few rural scenes  but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens except for tv and radio music within the story there is no music sound track and there are those many long <UNK> as the two men sit and watch tv together and or engage in very limited conversation br br i saw this movie on tv so i was amused to see that on a few occasions i was watching tv as they were watching tv also the silence in the movie matched the silence in my house i was awake all others in bed my chair and position matched that of as he watched tv quite eerie giving me a sense of almost <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and i guess i was in a sense br br i'll say no more because i want you to <UNK> the other scenes that i haven't described it's not a movie for everybody for sure more than any movie i've seen it shows just how much we die when we are all alone  just as we are all alone when we die face as it fades to black in the final scene will stay with me for a long long time br br highly recommended for serious movie buffs
<START> by the time this movie came out in 1996 director mark lester had been making tight sharp little b action pictures for more than 20 years he was responsible for the great truck stop women from the '70s and several other little gems unfortunately he's also responsible for this dud it's a shame to see the talented and still smoking hot <UNK> russell wasted yet again but she's still the best actor in this picture eric roberts shows up for a while does his eric roberts thing then goes away a not altogether <UNK> <UNK> in a picture with eric roberts in it frank stallone actually isn't bad which should give you an idea of how truly pathetic this picture is as has been mentioned by other reviewers the action scenes which is the reason a picture like this gets made in the first place are almost completely illogical and unrealistic in addition to being somewhat inept other than some vintage clothes and a few old cars there's no feel whatever for the 1930s the era in which this film is set a by the numbers script with irritating <UNK> in logic and little historical accuracy this isn't a documentary of course but the filmmakers could have at least tried for a little authenticity and performances that range from grade b to grade school <UNK> this cheap little <UNK> to the 4 00 a m sunday <UNK> on hbo which is just where i saw it
<START> take a subject i didn't know much about and make it exciting why don't you it so happens that back about 1979 director robert altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding <UNK> if he doesn't break his neck will make the first movie well i wouldn't put such an expectation on <UNK> <UNK> but he is a <UNK> who has made a good movie of course he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage and it is certainly a good thing that so much <UNK> footage existed <UNK> edited it together well with not your usual talking head shots of his <UNK> colleagues as they are today the whole effect is post modern in the best sense but that has been done altman's <UNK> hasn't quite come true what <UNK> has done however is capture enough of the energy of those <UNK> days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern <UNK> was invented by the z boys this is all good i highly recommend <UNK>
<START> please do not blame korea for this bad movie i am in korea please excuse bad english it me to see these movies which make korea look like obsessed with blood and sex it me even more to see animal killings and hear americans say that is how korea is we do not eat live animals so please stop <UNK> movie for its crime by saying it is the culture there is scenes with the man eating live animals and non <UNK> think it is normal no it is disgusting to us too the director is a <UNK> sick individual who has obsession with killing and sex with family members i wish america and france will stop <UNK> this bad man who is laughable in his own country please watch any other movie from korea that will give you ideas of how artistic we really are this movie is rubbish
<START> guts of a beauty is a bit better than its predecessor guts of a virgin although this film isn't really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment i did find beauty to be a little stronger and better put together all the way around than virgin but then again that's not really saying much br br beauty starts off as a pretty rough and straight faced exploit film a couple of <UNK> cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang <UNK> her in pretty brutal fashion as this <UNK> is going on the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in africa and that they're gonna do the same to her they then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more she somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there <UNK> to her <UNK> story the ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide the clinic worker moved by the young <UNK> story decides to take revenge on the gang by <UNK> one of the lower level guys and trying to <UNK> him to make him kill the <UNK> leaders this whole plan <UNK> so now ms vigilante clinic worker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original got only worse some pretty rough butt rape ensues along with the pre requisite gang rape she too is drugged but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim it turns her into a raging blood demon no sh t that's what really happens this is when beauty really takes off with some pretty f <UNK> insane kill scenes including a very classy chest burst rape that looks like a cross between alien and a bad porn and my favorite a head <UNK> by demon <UNK> kill complete with demon <UNK> <UNK> that has to be seen to be believed br br definitely some promising stuff going on in guts of a beauty but still very disjointed feeling beauty almost feels like two different films being forced together in a non <UNK> way still i have to give the film credit the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall a solid 7 10 for another crazy j horror classic
<START> <UNK> not sure if discussing the television series is exactly where the comments should be drawn to however it is on the television where the the lone ranger really made a name for himself <UNK> not even referring to the original radio <UNK> of this masked rider of the <UNK> <UNK> though referring to a point where in a little boy about 9 or 10 years old i was to see the movie the lone ranger and never forgot it i can recall that i was on a line or we were moving toward the paramount theater the theater was located in the theater district if i remember correctly it was directly across going east to west from the building that has the ball that drops on new years eve this is of course if anybody doesn't know new york city high above the street on the roof tops there was a time and maybe even still today huge <UNK> would <UNK> what was being shown and so on it was at that point in time that i looked up and was never more impressed as i was when i looked at that <UNK> to see the lone ranger across the roof tops it was great it made an impression and was never forgotten that day we went to see the lone ranger it was the story of how the lone ranger was born the terrible <UNK> that the texas rangers <UNK> into and the subsequent <UNK> of one of its fallen heroes it was in this film we learn that the lone ranger will not shoot to kill but to <UNK> so as to let the law be the judge that type of thinking is so worthwhile that we might be good to learn something from history this is where we learn that <UNK> discovers the fallen ranger and upon seeing the symbol of the <UNK> friendship that the lone ranger established years earlier when he as a younger person came to the <UNK> of a injured young person in <UNK> for the <UNK> given <UNK> gave to his faithful friend a symbol of his thanks which now was part of a <UNK> that <UNK> recognized <UNK> said you are the lone ranger said <UNK> that is familiar then <UNK> tells the story of this <UNK> <UNK> the meaning of i think the lone ranger is one of the true heroes of the silver screen and one of the great heroes of television it should also be stated that these very respected individuals <UNK> moore and jay sought to live there lives according to the legend of the lone ranger it may very well be that there is an inspiring story in the story of the lone ranger and his faithful companion <UNK> i myself was so pleased by the ability to find and buy the dvds that i stayed up all a saturday morning and watched the many episodes now available long live the lone ranger and his faithful companion <UNK> hi ho silver
<START> this film is about two horse <UNK> who agree to <UNK> a small group of <UNK> across the desert along the way they encounter a murderous family of thugs who menace the peaceful folks and put their <UNK> in <UNK> br br <UNK> master is what i would term a little john ford film as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of his other westerns in particular this film lacks the big name stars like john wayne but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage long time ford stock character actors ben johnson harry carey jr and ward bond have been <UNK> to starring roles and perhaps the one who came of as the lead was probably johnson though the other two got nearly as much screen time and focus this is not a bad thing as the film worked just fine without the big star and is well worth seeing br br now this isn't to say i loved the movie it was very good but certainly not perfect in particular as far as the music goes you'll probably either love it or hate it i found the sons of the music a bit <UNK> at times it did evoke a nice mood but seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes i think a little would have worked much better plus with their <UNK> singing in the background i kept expecting roy rogers to pop out at any moment another minor problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the ending was pretty much a <UNK> conclusion br br however and i am glad to say there is a despite this being rather formulaic and sentimental the film still worked well this was primarily due to john ford's nice as usual direction as well as ben <UNK> exceptional performance he was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film another plus for me is that i saw this in the same week as <UNK> young another film about the mormon <UNK> while <UNK> young was a bit silly and overly <UNK> in its portrayals here the <UNK> were less perfect and more like real people with <UNK> and personalities oh and speaking of <UNK> young it seems as if jane <UNK> was the <UNK> <UNK> girl for mormon themed films during this era as she was a major supporting character in both films considering that she died in <UNK> young and it was set about 20 years before <UNK> master this is some stunt br br also if you'd like to catch a glimpse of the famous jim he's in a tiny role where he plays the <UNK> indian dancing next to jane <UNK> around the camp fire
<START> i'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one i find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of <UNK> and a need to survive this movie focused more on a let's just make it gory view br br the movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects when the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down there is blood just <UNK> out of the hole i wasn't aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so <UNK> and the original zombie lady kelly or something displayed the worst acting i have ever seen when she woke up and began feeling sick i laughed quite hard when she died deserved it in every way br br i was a little confused as to why dr kelly could talk after becoming a zombie but then there wasn't anything <UNK> by another zombie because annoying screams and <UNK> and they seemed to be killing the zombies pretty <UNK> by shooting them in the <UNK> yet when dr bennett is <UNK> from the airplane and into the engine <UNK> most of his lower half he is still able to live at the end br br i kinda felt that they altered things to make a good scene when one of the bitchy girlfriends i didn't take the time to learn their names they played a pointless role was in the bathroom she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror was it a two way mirror to watch mile high <UNK> i've never broken a mirror on an airplane bad luck and all that but i doubt there is that much room behind there with the insanely confined space of the actually bathroom and all br br the few redeeming qualities were too little too late sadly one thing the movie had going for it was the smoking hot flight <UNK> yet they felt the need to kill all but one off and i will admit that i laughed pretty damn hard when the old lady <UNK> down on <UNK> arm and he says she's me to death or something to that degree br br honestly i'm sad i wasted my nine dollars on this movie the fact that i bought it <UNK> kinda <UNK> that but still it failed on so many levels stick with dawn of the dead and 28 days later
<START> an extremely powerful film that certainly isn't appreciated enough it's impossible to describe the experience of watching it the recent uk television adaptation was shameful too ordinary and bland this original manages to <UNK> itself in your memory
<START> i can't believe the high marks people have given this film on this site the writing is incredibly bad with people coming in at just the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape don't you just hate it when that happens and the acting is so very very bad that you may get a <UNK> in your eye from all the scenery being <UNK> br br a nut is holding her hostage children are outside the open screen so she <UNK> for help instead of screaming when only a moment ago she was brave enough to be <UNK> windows to yell to these same children br br she's finally free and alone in the house her chance to go for help so what does she do wanders around the house and lies down she's in the basement locked away so what does she do takes a little <UNK> come on most of the movie is the nut wandering away and finding her sitting there <UNK> when he wakes her up four times what if the writer is too bored to actually write a real plot why should we be paying attention i think the key here is that it was originally a play for the radio so they filled in with the heroine just sitting around rather than pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any action br br and the ending is horrendous br br the whole movie is completely implausible horribly written and almost <UNK> acted beware this movie at all costs
<START> okay you hippies are probably wondering what i have against an education and informative show like barney well i have a lot of hate against it for these reasons br br 1 it teaches that having a personality and <UNK> is <UNK> no one on the show has a personality everyone dresses alike talks alike acts alike and dances alike even in the episode called being an individual kids try to tell barney about what they like and everyone on the planet should do what i like do you wanna teach your kid that being an individual is wrong br br 2 a stranger is a friend you haven't met episode while seemingly harmless the show's producers that it could also be extremely dangerous for young children in fact several young barney lovers from across the u s fell victim to <UNK> who were using the show's friendly message to lure children away from their parents the episode has since been pulled but the damage had been done so called innocent mistakes in programming like this one clearly show why parents need to watch television with their children br br 3 if your not happy all the time you are a bad person no one seems to show any other emotion but happiness no matter which situation they are in if the child's parents get mad or sad for some reason the child may think of <UNK> or daddy differently not a good message at all br br 4 magic <UNK> everything seems like every problem is solved by magic at least in shows like <UNK> rock it teaches us that magic can <UNK> at it is best to solve problems on your own does barney teach this no of course not there has to be magic in there and the problem is a lot of two year olds cannot tell fantasy from reality and might think their parents siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything yet become confused when they cannot use magic and think they are weird another <UNK> pulled again br br 5 barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing he has even specifically said that stealing is okay if the person you steal from doesn't mind kids can learn that if you really want something stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it this is not something that need authority figures to tell them br br 6 if i just have the right thing i can solve all my problems whenever the kids have a problem barney gives them whatever they need to solve it the message being sent here is don't try to think to solve this it's too much work and the solution probably wouldn't work anyway just use this because of this children could stop thinking through things barney said it was too much work and become <UNK> on the right object the right shoes the right food the right computer the right exercise machine this is obviously a good message for the barney <UNK> but it's not good for br br 7 the message that cheating is okay in another episode the children are involved in a contest to carry a <UNK> on a <UNK> without dropping it one child puts <UNK> <UNK> on his <UNK> and easily wins the child is then rewarded for his creative thinking when the child in fact bent the rules and changed the game so that he could win this teaches that cheating is good you win and people think that you are creative when in real life you will often be <UNK> or worse and severely disliked by other <UNK> who played by the rules br br 8 do the kids in this show eat anything else besides <UNK> <UNK> and candy that teaches that it is okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy food despite <UNK> so called health food song other than that everyone in the show eats junk food no wonder there are so many <UNK> kids in america and europe br br and finally br br most other kids' television shows teach creative problem solving well without having to resort to magic barney could also have done that but instead decided to use the method that was a best for the <UNK> and b took the least time and money for scripts it's a blatant <UNK> that shows just how little the <UNK> group actually cares about children br br that is my rant for you all
<START> this movie probably seemed like a great idea in pre production let's make a movie about one of the greatest and most controversial athletic <UNK> of the modern era and let's cast brian as coach bobby knight that's where this movie went terribly wrong why cast an actor who bears no semblance of the man he's portraying and then why let this actor turn his character into not coach knight but brian in a red <UNK> as i sat watching this movie on <UNK> i didn't find myself believing this man was actually coach knight he didn't look like him talk like him act like him or even walk like him i could not get past this fact and <UNK> i could not enjoy the movie when paul newman and robert redford were cast as the <UNK> butch cassidy and the sundance kid we didn't care if they were accurate historical models of their true characters because most of us had never even heard of these men until we saw the movie but with someone as visible in today's media as coach knight you have to do better when anthony hopkins was cast as <UNK> it was the same situation but anthony hopkins made us believe he in fact was <UNK> didn't even try what might have been a great movie was turned sour by this besides the fact that this movie tried to do for the four letter word what saving private ryan did for <UNK> it <UNK> too little of the real coach knight and too much profanity for the sake of shock value turned this movie into a season to turn off half way through the broadcast the only good thing about this is that it was television movie i didn't have to waste my hard earned money on this piece of trash
<START> supposedly director william shatner had in mind a much film when it came to <UNK> trek v the final but the suits at paramount looking at the huge box office <UNK> taken in by its humor filled predecessor insisted the new film have plenty of laughs too so what we get is arguably the weakest and <UNK> of the six star trek movies with the original cast there are bad ideas <UNK> along with a few good ones and if you're in a <UNK> mood you could look at 'the final the same way you would a so so episode of the tv series on the plus side laurence is a fine actor and gives one of the best <UNK> performances in any star trek big or small screen <UNK> right up there with william <UNK> <UNK> his portrayal of <UNK> half brother consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink which happens all too frequently charles cooper is good too as the fat old <UNK> general too bad his role isn't as large as he is if the story about <UNK> intentions is true then i owe him an <UNK> because i was prepared to lay the blame for the <UNK> silliness and not very convincing action scenes <UNK> at his directorial feet the reason is i've always felt that of all the trek <UNK> shatner was the least <UNK> to everything that makes star trek work and what makes it special to its fans having read his trek <UNK> it's very apparent to me that he considered the show another action adventure series that just happened to have a science fiction setting he preferred the vision of gene over that of gene <UNK> was known for his work on the popular western series 'the wild wild west ' shatner also mentioned that a favorite star trek episode of his was 'a piece of the action ' a silly second season episode co written by so finally given an opportunity to direct a star trek feature film would not shatner follow his instincts and produce an action filled flick with lots of tongue in cheek humor well somebody did because that's what 'the final ended up being shatner himself definitely returns to form as the great ham and as leonard <UNK> points out the film suffers from a bad case of 'the ' in the opening scene at <UNK> national park it's hard to say which is worse the super cheesy special effects or the <UNK> dialogue running gags about equipment on the enterprise have run all the way from of and by this the fifth trek movie have run themselves into the ground so has the idea of a one new development is an apparent romantic relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two it's a pointless subplot and adds nothing the climactic scene where <UNK> is encountered doesn't add much either whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is <UNK> but the scene itself doesn't make much sense the <UNK> <UNK> abilities seem to <UNK> according to what is needed at the moment roughly half of this is a tired <UNK> of the climax from 'the search for spock ' leonard <UNK> manages to salvage <UNK> integrity even while <UNK> such un spock like lines as get a grip on yourself doctor and <UNK> <UNK> as usual <UNK> both shatner and <UNK> he really came on as an actor in the final trek films so this trek outing isn't terrible it just isn't very good there was to be one more original cast trek movie before the <UNK> was passed to the <UNK> generation ' and it was far better suited to the task than <UNK> trek v the final frontier '
<START> <UNK> knightley and <UNK> miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of dylan thomas knightley is <UNK> <UNK> sweetheart he re encounters during the <UNK> meeting at a bar they <UNK> however things become complicated when <UNK> brings his wife miller along the next time he meets her the women hit it off and things proceed at pace until the trio are joined by the man who will become <UNK> husband this further <UNK> things as jealousy begins to show its face br br beautiful to look at extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted everyone disappears completely into their roles this is a <UNK> feast for the eyes and the ears it's so nice to see a film about adults being adults on a purely visceral level i really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing rarely have i ever seen a film that is this beautifully crafted br br the trouble with the film is i'm not entirely sure of everything that happened something seemed to be missing and a couple of times i had to replay the film to see if i missed something its not bad but its not completely satisfying as a result i tried to look up on line to see how much of the film is true but i couldn't find anything still i think this is a film worth seeing it's a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done
<START> i also saw the last stop at the moving pictures film festival in prince george i have to confess the only reason i went to see it is because i am a huge <UNK> keith <UNK> fan and he didn't let me down he gave a good performance of a rather unsympathetic character and provided about the only comic relief in the whole movie br br the movie itself is the usual of bad people trapped in a snow storm <UNK> storyline but it did have a couple of twists that kept me guessing the characterizations were strong and the whole cast performed fairly well the only problems i had with the cast was rose she was so cold throughout the movie that we didn't get any idea of her character's personality or motivations other than her and a few small problems with continuity this was a well written well acted thriller
<START> <UNK> had great expectations because of its spectacular theme and its high budget i was really looking forward to it and i really wanted it to be good but it is not the only good thing are the special effects that are very well done but like in a really bad hollywood blockbuster everything else is missing br br it is poorly written the screenplay tries to fulfill genre rules with standard suspense love story elements but there is no depth or originality at all it's way below average the next thing it is also poorly directed it has this uninteresting tv directing style with lots of close ups and wanna be great action by fast editing where actually no action or suspense is the actors are not bad but there is no performance that is touching in any way br br i don't know they obviously try to do a typical tv movie and not a film for the cinema where its <UNK> good to have some edges and a clear visual style but why do they try to fulfill typical commercial hollywood rules it really feels like the screenwriter did a weekend class with some american <UNK> guru and then delivered this mess is there no producer who is responsible for the project who has an interest in <UNK> visual style or plain in simple this magical cinematic moments that make some tv movies great do they think that an tv audience is stupid and doesn't need to get a high quality movie experience the downfall was a very good example for a good tv movie but there was probably some executive or producer who knew what he was doing br br don't waste you time with this one rent downfall instead
<START> people may say i am harsh but i can't help it the movie is so bad i was absolutely stunned the first movie was bad enough if you ask me it was greatly exaggerated and silly but this one despite the creepy scenes has a seriously ass stupid story they actually went deep into investigating past and found out that she had a mother who miraculously speaks english who was an exorcist and fed evil spirits to her daughter stupid ok it started out with who was an ordinary housewife who had an affair with some bloke and got herself dead this part is still ok because of this moment of rage she became a vengeful spirit who kills anyone who enters her house now her killings began to stretch a little where she actually had the opportunity to travel throughout tokyo just to finish her victims her victims were travelling weren't they this struck me hard now if a ghost could actually do such a thing like travelling throughout a country without paying public transport <UNK> i wouldn't mind being ask someone to come kill me then <UNK> and to crown things all up the ghost who was once depicted as a very vengeful one in <UNK> on the grudge which was way better than this trash is now depicted as some <UNK> who truly enjoys herself and felt that it is her mission to finish of people things became worse for me the viewer when the ghost became coming in forms of large <UNK> of hair i mean if a ghost had such power i seriously <UNK> mind being one i never really liked movies depicting ghosts as monsters cause they're not the overall results is just plain bad like the grudge 2 with a better storyline and less exaggeration this show would have been better
<START> blind date is one of three stories made into movie by author <UNK> <UNK> lots of familiar faces in this <UNK> from 1934 mickey rooney as a <UNK> little punk he seems to be in the film for comedic and <UNK> family values jane <UNK> again plays the strong <UNK> mother just as she had in <UNK> of wrath and the <UNK> incident ann <UNK> is kitty who has been dating bill paul kelly but meets up with rich bob played by neil hamilton who may or may not be better for her you can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the <UNK> production code at one point kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there isn't anyone else in the house what a change from just a year or two prior when anything and everything was ok good solid plot but a whole lot of conversation and <UNK> love talk it raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice or just find a man with big bucks as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had <UNK> and how do men change when their situation changes watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene tv viewers from the 1960s will recognize hamilton as <UNK> gordon from batman also some weird drama in the off screen lives for some of the cast in this one paul kelly had gone to jail for being <UNK> to murder in a love triangle mickey rooney had an affair with norma <UNK> who was 20 years older rooney ended up being married eight times tyler brooke <UNK> and spencer <UNK> <UNK> both knocked themselves off in real life the title blind date has been <UNK> many times for films tv series and even cartoons but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one
<START> this terrible <UNK> is fun on many levels the <UNK> obvious is the lame fake looking bird puppet which <UNK> around the cheap sets without ever <UNK> it wings like it was on a string perhaps attacking model trains and toy cars the science is <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> gun and what's up with the enormous amounts of in everyone's hair i guess the 50's were the <UNK> decade well this bird puppet apparently comes from some god <UNK> anti matter universe and it's here to build a nest lay eggs in new york seriously that they manage to kill the puppet is almost a shame i give it 1 <UNK> out of 4 it's silly and stupid but moore fun than <UNK> 8
<START> <UNK> <UNK> roy and a host of other so called <UNK> get the title of <UNK> because of the fact that they love portraying india and <UNK> in a bad light and <UNK> <UNK> makes her money from it anyway anyway <UNK> are too gentle or scared to protest the way muslims protest so anybody can take any liberties with <UNK> and it is a fact that during the 1930's women in the west were also when they were widowed just that nobody likes to point out anything bad about the west or anything other than india and <UNK> she paints an portrayal of india and the situation of <UNK> there nowhere is it mentioned that child marriage is illegal she ended the movie saying there are <UNK> million <UNK> in india of course among a billion people there will be that many <UNK> but how many are living life she has depicted in the movie <UNK> <UNK> finally is selling india and poverty to make dollars how pathetic
<START> contains spoilers br br this movie is utter crap do not watch br br there is no one in this movie to root for or even like except for the wife and she wins by <UNK> everyone is selfish and many things happen that make no sense br br the acting is mediocre at best and everyone <UNK> too heavily about everything no one can even cry <UNK> br br if you leave the room for even a second then something totally out of left field will happen and it will make no sense whatsoever br br for example i left the room for a second while <UNK> character was sleeping with her manager i come back seriously about 4 minutes later also i'm pretty sure there was a commercial somewhere in there and she's sleeping with that guy br br i gave up on this movie around the time that was being an ass to his fiancé in the car because she didn't want to call off the wedding br br i wasted 2 hours of my life you shouldn't
<START> did we all see the same movie i can't believe the <UNK> some of the others are giving this really awful bio which believe or not was <UNK> by shirley temple herself based on her book child star gives me the feeling that some are awfully easy to please br br first of all ashley rose <UNK> whatever her modest talents are in no way shape or form even resembles shirley temple enough to be cast as her in this sort of straightforward biography of the world's most famous child star she gives no indication of why or how this child was so <UNK> except for trying her hardest to do a shirley <UNK> which never <UNK> on any level none whatsoever br br and that is the major <UNK> of the whole piece but as if that isn't bad enough any drama inherent in <UNK> story of her climb to almost overnight stardom has been completely white washed with insipid writing <UNK> with occasional song and dance moments that don't even <UNK> what shirley did as for example the <UNK> ball with buddy <UNK> which was probably the high point of <UNK> choreographed dance routines br br simply putting a girl in a <UNK> <UNK> dress doesn't make her shirley temple none of <UNK> own brand of charm warmth and appeal is even remotely suggested all we see on display is a pale imitation of the original proving once and for all that there was only one shirley temple br br it's worthless to write anything further about this mess none of the others are more than ordinary in lifeless roles my advice for <UNK> fans is to read her book or better still watch her movies br br this is the <UNK>
<START> this started out slow then got worse the best parts of this were all seen in the previews br br bad apple has the feel of a pilot if that's the case <UNK> should save their money
<START> i work at the video store that <UNK> this video in <UNK> and i must say it should have never been made i even know some of the people who worked on it who regret doing so bad effects horrid acting bad script especially i swear the dialog wouldn't have passed for the original resident evil it's that bad if you want to know how not to make a movie watch this film to learn a thing or two if not don't waste your time and even the director know it sucks because he keeps coming in to try to get us to the movie no sir i've watched two thirds of the horror section and this rates even lower than plan 9 from outer space even ed would have said nope that's too stupid even for me
<START> this is not the true story it is the darkest possible fiction derived from the events it <UNK> suicide <UNK> obsession with death a totally gratuitous at organized religion in general and the <UNK> church in particular and generally provides a <UNK> pointless world view from which <UNK> i suppose are intended to walk away <UNK> in their poverty and more hopeful in their <UNK> br br utter trash though <UNK> performed by a capable cast that anyone would suggest this is a true rendering however is very much false advertising you want the real story rent <UNK> that's the real story see if you can find any <UNK> between the facts presented in either case i only found one the girls who made the original photographs were pre <UNK>
<START> where do i start the plot of the movie which is about a love between two high school students during wartime while one is a living weapon and their struggle to maintain that love is a very good plot it is based on a manga by shin <UNK> which was also turned into an anime in 2002 both of which i have yet to read or see br br this review is about this live action adaptation however sadly this honest to goodness was a terrible movie it isn't as if one could site certain aspects and say for instance the budget is at fault or the acting is to blame it is sadly a series of <UNK> and <UNK> elements that bring this film down br br the acting is poor not to say <UNK> <UNK> and are bad actors but they didn't have much to work with and seemed miscast neither seemed to have the physical range to draw the viewer in the story as well as being too old for their parts to a distracting degree br br the script was weak the leads act <UNK> and behave <UNK> the film also plays for the <UNK> but ends up being predictable all the while not being compelling and under developing the characters there are also pacing issues br br visually it is <UNK> the film uses green screen heavily and unnecessarily in too many scenes the other special effects also have a cheap look to them especially where <UNK> practical special effects could have been used there is also no visual flair as if there were no cinematographer or art designer to make the scenes look consistent and stimulating br br the music and sound effects were fine but <UNK> br br overall the movie isn't devoid of enjoyment and fans of the series shouldn't be <UNK> to see it at least once just for the sake of <UNK> people unfamiliar with this probably isn't the place to jump in as it isn't a very good movie or melodrama it isn't the movie or the cast and <UNK> fault it just isn't inspired and that is what kills it
<START> when a friend once <UNK> me for my first movie a pretty bad <UNK> affair i <UNK> that i could grow orson welles' first movie indeed was even worse he challenged me that it couldn't be so i pulled out the <UNK> <UNK> of i think citizen kane and played hearts of age my friend lasted just a few minutes before <UNK> the point br br there is a little humor in this short but it's basically as pretentious as and perhaps a <UNK> answer to blood of a poet and other avant garde films of the time it is what it is a succession of images with a vague theme and unless you really enjoy any footage of welles in heavy makeup to boot this isn't really even worth tracking down
<START> poorly acted and poorly directed <UNK> <UNK> tries to recreate the feeling of jurassic park but the truth is the book wasn't all that great either still the movie's first problem is that tim character was added the second problem is that the talking arm was added the main problem though is that the cast members don't create realistic characters i guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are killer <UNK> anywhere on earth also starring laura <UNK> happy birthday laura dylan walsh ernie hudson grant <UNK> joe don baker james karen and bruce campbell i'm guessing that they don't wish to emphasize this movie in their <UNK>
<START> i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this b movie in it's entirety br br all i have to say is save your time and money this has got to be the worst b movie of all time it shouldn't even be called a b movie more like an f movie because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie the story is not interesting at all all of the actors are paper thin and not at all believable it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it's almost funny almost br br the movie is just packed full of crappy one liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit br br this movie is supposed to be <UNK> towards men but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive especially that old <UNK> thing that comes in towards the end they try to appear sexy in those weird horrible costumes and they fail miserably br br even some of the most ridiculous b movies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch
<START> this movie was included in the six wives of henry <UNK> bbc miniseries dvd i loved those six movies they were well acted well scripted and historically accurate i did actually read <UNK> book and liked it well enough despite it's huge historical inaccuracies i mean the whole fake homosexual angle with george <UNK> in particular but this movie didn't even mention that that angle was one of the pivotal points of the book br br above all this movie just leaves me asking why why do we see as someone else <UNK> put the real world <UNK> england why are the camera angles so bad in general br br why is the script so bad i mean i know it was <UNK> but come on the actors at time <UNK> and <UNK> over their lines and it's obvious that they're making them up as they go along br br why are the sex scenes so awkward the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting in the movie they're just bad <UNK> on being absolutely hilarious at one point the actress playing mary <UNK> was having sex with the actor playing henry <UNK> he's <UNK> away and she's got this look on her face that says <UNK> i need to go to the store is he done yet maybe if he finishes i can go pick up some cheese real quick it's just bad br br why does catherine of <UNK> play such a small role in this movie her <UNK> to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that <UNK> she's the reason why henry <UNK> and anne <UNK> couldn't get immediately married why is she not present here over all this movie is just bad
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen a movie that is about a stupid looking monster from the ocean that threatens a small town which has to be filled with the dumbest people on earth br br spoilers if you even care br br they can't even kill the damn thing by the end of the movie the movie ends and they're like well some day we'll have to kill it br br avoid at all costs
<START> i had before a feeling of for all russian films but after seeing this film i <UNK> this is a unique masterpiece made by the best director ever lived in the <UNK> he knows the art of film making and can use it very well if you find this movie buy or copy it
<START> certain aspects of punishment park are less than perfect specifically some of the acting however i feel that this is probably the most important movie of the war on terror era i grew up hating hippies and in some respects i still do it wasn't until the united states was started down the path of an unnecessary and <UNK> war in iraq that i began to see the world through their eyes i can feel what they must have felt although the film is somewhat dated watching it brings those uncomfortable emotions about our present situation right to the surface it's clear enough early in the film that punishment park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the <UNK> elements of american society this is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our <UNK> society but it is credible at times i find myself believing that the usa could easily slip into <UNK> as i watched this film i could only think about how i hear similar sentiments from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost daily this movie is a raw concentrated of america's present political scene i am both impressed and <UNK> that something this relevant and yes accurate was filmed more than 30 years ago if you take a more <UNK> view of the movie and choose to believe that this couldn't happen here look more closely at <UNK> bay some of our enemy <UNK> the <UNK> cia secret <UNK> and the many incidents similar to the one in <UNK> in 1979 8 full years after the making of this movie
<START> i <UNK> seen this movie twice both times on <UNK> the first time in it s <UNK> version which is soft core porn at it s best and the second time in a <UNK> down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way the <UNK> version has a tremendous sex scene with <UNK> fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the <UNK> version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes rated or <UNK> it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we also get appearances by b queen <UNK> <UNK> and burt ward robin from the old batman series
<START> it's weird this film you get the impression that the makers of this <UNK> fest spent more time in the local bars than on set in fact it's a surprise not to see harry alan <UNK> name on the credits it certainly has the <UNK> of one of his tax shelter productions but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for all involved to enjoy a prolonged stay in <UNK> despite the fact that the film is supposed to take place all over the region les and the area around it stands in for almost everything br br david <UNK> makes for a spectacularly <UNK> hero as michael says at one point you're a walking cliché what is doing in this is anyone's guess for some reason the most interesting character played by <UNK> is <UNK> whereas regardless of the book she should have been the central figure because she clearly has the skill to carry the movie which would have been dull anyway but at least we'd have got more of something pretty to look at br br all in all a pointless affair that is only worth watching to see how action less an action movie can be
<START> <UNK> <UNK> i have been around this old earth longer than most and have seen nearly all the westerns that have have produced old west history is my passion <UNK> moon is one of the most poorly produced directed and acted stories i have ever seen there was very little historical accuracy but then it is obvious you were operating on a <UNK> budget which br br played a distinct roll in this insult to intelligence i am happy that i this show it was bad enough having to sit and watch the movie plus put up with the inane commercials once again there was not one actor that came anywhere near convincing i kept hoping it would improve as the three days progressed wrong i'm ashamed to say i wasted 4 1 2 hours of what precious little time i have left
<START> synopsis <UNK> finds himself alone on a coach getting dropped off on a desert land at what seems the last stop of his journey he doesn't know how he arrived there but a welcome sign has been <UNK> for him after <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> he is <UNK> by a man who takes him to his new life he then enters a world different to the one he came from br br as <UNK> is quickly introduced to his new job as an <UNK> he senses that his surroundings are a bit too <UNK> for his liking as he takes his first lunch break he instantly notices that everyone in the city walks around in grey suits on this same day he sees a fellow businessman dead on some <UNK> <UNK> of what looks like an act of suicide the strange thing is the city folk pay no attention to this horrific act and walk on by as if it never happened it is quick to see that these people are <UNK> and their ability to <UNK> between anything <UNK> or <UNK> is absent br br to help <UNK> settle in he is invited to go out with his co workers to a local nightclub the club appears to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a <UNK> night and as <UNK> drinks his <UNK> <UNK> he realises that no matter how much he drinks the alcohol has no effect on him as he tells these <UNK> to a stranger in the men's room a man in a toilet <UNK> starts to utter words which have been on mind all along <UNK> that this man is thinking what he is he follows him to his house and notes where he lives for future reference the plot predictably <UNK> with <UNK> wanting an escape he seeks out the man he once followed hoping that he could lead him to becoming human again but is it too late br br my thoughts this norwegian film is something which everyone should see as it holds the answer to the big question what is the meaning of life well close enough the film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today's working man or woman it's sole purpose is making people realise that life is too short to be <UNK> it tries to show that small cliché things such as the sound of children playing should not be taken for granted because the moment you stop hearing that sound is the moment you're one step away from becoming a robot the ending of the film <UNK> what happens when its too late to escape the mundane routine you've now become used to you start to adopt the saying of <UNK> it ain't broke don't fix <UNK> and become too comfortable to take a risk of change br br even though this film is not to be taken as a piece of realism its message is more than real the lack of empathy conveyed in the film and that of which <UNK> sees is a bold statement of what life can become the director <UNK> has put together a film which in any other director's hands would have failed this is a fine piece of cinematic genius and i eagerly <UNK> to see what he does next br br the lead role played by is perfectly cast representing the average joe provides a good <UNK> in making this picture darkly humorous the supporting actors also do an apt job and for some reason i feel that keanu reeves would have been perfect in this film as most of the supporting cast required their acting to be <UNK> br br the score for this film was beautifully composed the recurring theme was always a delight to listen to and it provided a very <UNK> but welcomed feel to the movie br br set for a release date in the uk for <UNK> may 2007 i will definitely be going to re live this experience on the big screen this film has gained its way in my top 10 now quickly becoming my top 20 it has some shocking scenes and is darkly humorous throughout a must see
<START> it is sad that some find this film worth watching i am russian and i am disgusted there is nothing in this film that deserves praise except cinematography however i am not one of those who find beauty in death or <UNK> i think this film is poorly designed and directed there is nothing more irritating and even <UNK> than shameless <UNK> in art if you can call this garbage art wanted to shock the viewers by <UNK> evil and he succeeded in creating a hopelessly dark film but the biggest shock is primitive directorial work i would never advise any of my friends to watch it huge disappointment
<START> even if you're a fan of jean <UNK> <UNK> body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional <UNK> into science fiction territory for once there's not a single vampire girl in sight true to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely yet this is largely <UNK> by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer <UNK> jean claude atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and <UNK> a k a gary contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn't resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore br br shot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn <UNK> <UNK> was already quite familiar with from his michel <UNK> cash gathering <UNK> efforts most notably french f <UNK> film <UNK> <UNK> in the demanding lead playing <UNK> rather well i might add she's picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert vincent driving home at the end of a long work day barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there <UNK> seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting <UNK> name and heroic <UNK> role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin further credit to <UNK> skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s because she cannot recall a single touch <UNK> his because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally <UNK> the <UNK> of other commercial <UNK> <UNK> has had to include in other works to assure funding br br when robert leaves for work he's inevitably <UNK> from <UNK> feeble mind a mysterious doctor comedian bernard effectively cast against type and his menacing assistant <UNK> striking porn <UNK> rachel move in on her during her absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes as she's re introduced to her roommate catherine the late a k a hardcore performer cathy stewart in a quietly devastating turn both girls desperately <UNK> <UNK> shared memories for one another in a <UNK> to <UNK> their inevitable fate that <UNK> is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and <UNK> unable to control her movements in trying to eat a <UNK> of soup it's also catherine who gets to voice the <UNK> compromise with the demands of <UNK> as she <UNK> <UNK> to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical <UNK> have deserted them br br several rather explicit if not quite hardcore sex scenes make up the movie's mid section and french porn <UNK> should recognize the likes of <UNK> a k a <UNK> val jacques and along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of was only present in the film's rarely screened <UNK> version the pivotal part of a girl <UNK> almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape <UNK> with is beautifully handled by the exquisite <UNK> in her unforgettable debut who would go on to play a <UNK> supporting role in franco <UNK> la <UNK> the six feet under ending reveals the <UNK> condition to be the result of a nuclear <UNK> the <UNK> patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell <UNK> <UNK> off in a fiery <UNK> the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of <UNK> modern times as <UNK> approaching complete <UNK> by now and a wounded robert stumble along the <UNK> bridge clumsily <UNK> each other's <UNK> hands
<START> the fact that after 50 years it is still a highly watchable movie says a lot about it it is more intelligent and interesting than almost all recent movies of the same genre you can find and has a certain endearing feeling of innocence to it i am not a big fan of this type of movies but i could watch the whole thing without being bored which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share your taste in films i liked the black and white palette the excellent casting the clever heist scene that keeps you guessing about what trick they will pull next and the ending like everyone else watching the heist sequence makes one realize the power of silence which is unfortunately so underused in today's cinema
<START> i received this movie in a pack called 50 all star movies for 18 45 cents each many are good this one was terrible it was a hackneyed <UNK> done 1000 times before and each time better a crippled ex jock is <UNK> to coach a team made up of juvenile <UNK> they learn from him that they can make it if they play by the rules i'm sure the kids and the locals were thrilled to be included in a real tv movie but i can't imagine what the folks that launched and produced this project figured they could bring to this already over beaten subject i kept waiting to see that <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> but honest it doesn't come avoid this movie forget about the 45 cents i want the <UNK> minutes of my life back
<START> most american remakes of european films are pretty poor but this is in a league of its own in fact this might even be the worst sandra <UNK> movie ever made i <UNK> i might have passed it off as just another <UNK> bad hollywood thriller had i not seen the dutch original <UNK> the altered ending here is stupid enough and executed with particular <UNK> but a far worse crime than that is <UNK> all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic the real horror to be found here is in the fact that the same man who directed <UNK> is responsible for this atrocity will the real george <UNK> please stand up
<START> about 20 minutes into this lame excuse for a movie i realized it reminded me of one of those annoying people at work <UNK> always telling really lame jokes or doing extremely unfunny things because they think it's funny and are trying to entertain everyone br br this film is billed as starring <UNK> <UNK> she's not that bad of an actress but her lines aren't funny and she's not the star br br the acting is some of the most god awful i've ever seen except for <UNK> the girl who plays <UNK> and maybe the colonel who seems oddly out of place i can't imagine why a retired military colonel would want to start a academy do those even exist br br the budget would've been better spent <UNK> these women into doing a full length porn feature br br freddy got <UNK> currently has a 3 5 score <UNK> has a 2 7 i'm <UNK> these two movies are within a 1 0 to each other is the godfather compared to this garbage br br 1 10 stars
<START> this movie wasn't too funny it wasn't too horrible either just a fun ride aboard the soul plane it's a black owned flight service with a kick ass disco beautiful bar and <UNK> <UNK> the plot takes you through the whole idea of a black not race or color but <UNK> owned plane with the same style of black humor at times there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> plane check that out there are <UNK> however and i find it most in the character who played the soul pilot watch to find out who it is all in all it's a fun movie tom arnold adds to the fun with his attitude this is one movie to watch when playing poker when you're drunk or just
<START> my mom and i went to the <UNK> worth premiere mainly to see george <UNK> but ended up getting the chance to see the movie <UNK> at bass hall what a wonderful beautiful film which not only depicts the beautiful texas landscape but also had a great feel good storyline it was well written directed and produced and my mom and i loved it from start to finish thank you jay for giving us the opportunity to be a part of the premiere of this wonderful movie it was a night we will never forget as if seeing the movie was not enough we also were fortunate enough to be sitting 4 <UNK> in front of my favorite singer george <UNK> thank you thank you thank you keep up the great work and again thank you br br debbie maureen <UNK> worth <UNK>
<START> so far i disliked every single jean <UNK> movie i've seen and that always bothered me because he's an acclaimed euro trash <UNK> and extremely popular amongst many regular reviewers on this lovely website people whose opinions i always value and usually <UNK> with apparently everybody always appears to <UNK> some sort of gloomy and <UNK> filming <UNK> in his work that are completely lost on me <UNK> movies are <UNK> boring they all feature the same basic concept lesbian vampires in various settings the dialogs are incredibly absurd the marvelous gothic setting are always underused and the production values are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket i had actually given up on <UNK> <UNK> already especially after enduring the iron rose until i found out about night of the hunted allegedly this movie doesn't feature any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a <UNK> <UNK> horror movie with gruesome killings and macabre plot twists and the verdict is  yes and no on one hand this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive <UNK> film i had the pleasure of seeing thus far and also the only one that i watching without <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand it still remains a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and <UNK> sex sequences to compensate for the <UNK> jean <UNK> heavily attempts to generate an atmosphere of <UNK> and suspense mostly through a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters but barely manages to hide the fact he actually hasn't got a story to tell at all the <UNK> beautiful lead actress <UNK> and the beautifully ominous musical <UNK> are the only elements that keep you hooked on the screen during a <UNK> drive back home to paris a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and <UNK> dressed girl who comes running from the woods her name is <UNK> but furthermore she can't remember anything about herself and from what or whom she was running away her case of <UNK> is so bad she even continuously forgets who picked her up the next day she's kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex where multiple people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive <UNK> knows nothing but she does sense she needs to escape from here obviously i won't reveal the denouement but i can assure you it is quite dumb illogical and far fetched apparently <UNK> realized this as well because the explanation is kept very brief and quick there's a large number of overly weird and senseless sequences the sex footage is dire and filmed without passion the nasty make up effects look cheap and randomly thrown without actual purpose as said the score is mesmerizing and <UNK> perfect body is <UNK> to at
<START> up until around 1970 lucille ball was one great <UNK> she was such a perfect clown i only wish more people could have seen her with bob hope in the facts of life because she could do dry deadpan too as well as slapstick br br yep lucille ball was wonderful until <UNK> br br trying to see lucille ball in <UNK> is physically impossible because there is so much <UNK> on the already <UNK> <UNK> that you'd need <UNK> to see lucille ball in some scenes so even if you see lucille ball in <UNK> you can't really see lucille ball in <UNK> which is a <UNK> br br that's about the <UNK> thing i can say about <UNK> the movie of the musical of the movie of the play this could go on but it started with a perfectly funny book called <UNK> <UNK> giving this a bad rap is like beating a <UNK> so it does not matter that the music is rather than sung most of the songs weren't much anyway there isn't any difference in the first three it's today open a new window and we need a little christmas are all the same song <UNK> should do an album with them they're so big and dull the killer <UNK> if he walked into my life today needs a confident gorgeous voice won a <UNK> for doing it in 1967 that poor lucille ball did not possess when she made this movie true <UNK> can't carry a tune in a bucket either but at least can put over a song br br if you still feel your life is not going to be complete unless you see the movie musical <UNK> notice how there is dancing in it but whenever lucy <UNK> starts to do anything beyond a <UNK> <UNK> the camera cuts away returning right when the number is over and the star poses with the dancers again it's just as well jane got to <UNK> the role of pathetic <UNK> after lucille ball had <UNK> <UNK> fired to ensure no comic originality would <UNK> the star is a stage performer who like carol <UNK> and <UNK> can't scale down her performances for films so she joins lucille ball in being embarrassing though for different reasons br br the lavish <UNK> are by van van <UNK> and they provide the color missing in all but one of the cast br br <UNK> arthur as the actress vera charles best friend ignores everyone and does her own fun thing if only she was in more scenes she's too old for her role too but at least she didn't it
<START> what can i say about this movie it really is one of the worst gay themed movies ever to come out of the uk i can only imagine the likes of diana quick and <UNK> hale needed the money what story there is is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly it's supposed to be based on real life events well all i can say to that one is that it's an insult to the real life characters the dvd is out at the moment in the uk it's available in either the split screen format which must make it even worse that the full screen version i watch gay cinema can be so much better than this and we deserve more
<START> i thought this movie was going to be good it absolutely wasn't despite the oscar winning lead actors i may have laughed once and i never heard anybody else in the theater laughing <UNK> <UNK> make up was very <UNK> everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off i think perhaps the movie must've sounded good in development but something got lost in translation were the roaring <UNK> really like this i think not everything seems a tad artificial randy <UNK> score was annoying the film is in <UNK> tones just like every other movie that takes place in the <UNK> or 30's there's just not that much originality here
<START> balance of terror is still one of the best star trek episodes ever made it was inspired by the film enemy below starring robert mitchum a movie that deals with a cat and mouse game between two <UNK> during world war ii in this episode captain kirk and his crew play similar game with a <UNK> this is the program that <UNK> introduces the war hungry <UNK> who are distant relatives of the <UNK> it is an incredibly suspenseful episode tightly constructed for maximum effect it is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story mark makes his star trek debut as the captain he will later play <UNK> father <UNK> a must see episode
<START> the story of ed <UNK> is a disturbing and terrifying story ed was truly a messed up character and his legacy went on to inspire such as the tooth fairy norman bates and <UNK> how is it then that such a fascinating man has inspired such a boring melodramatic piece of drivel ed <UNK> made <UNK> out of <UNK> <UNK> out of <UNK> <UNK> out of skin <UNK> around under the moon in suits of human skin none of this made it into the movie because they needed to give us a <UNK> story of a ridiculously awful deputy and his rather <UNK> sex <UNK> girlfriend this movie seemed to go out of its way to history what <UNK> me is that most movies stray from the path of truth to <UNK> history this one seems to do it to <UNK> it i just don't get it
<START> i'm sorry but this really does feel like a modern day apollo 13 knock off totally implausible at least <UNK> felt like a comic book this felt like a bad high school film project acting was about as cliché as one can get and landing a space <UNK> on an la <UNK> come on seriously jerry what were you thinking and all the clichés the pregnant <UNK> wife the <UNK> reporter who gets in everyone's way the <UNK> manager with go fever and it's one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story but at least make it good fact and science were totally butchered for this the space <UNK> doesn't have fuel tanks in it's wings and even if it did it couldn't steer by shifting fuel between them and neither could a <UNK> 10 br br if you like bad acting bad storytelling low realism and cheesy clichés this one can't be beat
<START> thank god for the internet movie <UNK> when i first got this movie i watched it every night just before before bed and was getting something different out of it every time but no matter how i <UNK> it it came up disturbing the black and white and all the <UNK> really freaked me you stare at the screen unsure of what you are looking at and just when you think you got it it becomes clear and it's something completely different the imagery is very disturbing <UNK> and straight <UNK> do not sit well with me in any movie still <UNK> i watched it i was <UNK> it somewhat differently there is no dialogue ya know so i decided to check the imdb for the plot summary boy that throws me for a loop i had no idea that was supposed to be god now i'm going to watch it with this in mind and see what happens
<START> i found this movie to be a big disappointment especially considering the cast the characters are not believable as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves the only part of the film i enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally get killed the special effects consist mostly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies a typical unimaginative slasher flick br br it's hard to believe make that impossible to believe that a <UNK> creature that <UNK> up on <UNK> in the middle of the night could be captured by a group of clumsy <UNK> idiots equally impossible to believe is how they knew exactly were to find it in spite of the fact the creature has capture or even <UNK> br br the man that pulls off the impossible in capturing the alive is our one dimensional dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the only thing dr <UNK> is more obsessed with than the creature is his <UNK> gun a <UNK> gun that works were mere bullets fail br br the captain of the ship john rhys davies is introduced as a <UNK> he employs his military <UNK> by having his men shoot at the creature regardless of were on the ship they happen to be the navy <UNK> that show up from nowhere repeat the pattern of shooting at everything br br dylan <UNK> plays an insurance investigator brought on board the cruise ship to catch a thief he spends most of the movie <UNK> along with <UNK> is trying to kill the creature at the moment br br the creature doesn't even closely resemble a it doesn't behave like one either instead of a small shy <UNK> animal that <UNK> by stealth at night we get a <UNK> freddy <UNK> killing everything in sight a simple search on <UNK> would have been very helpful to the writers and the special effects crew

<START> the book is great it's one of my favorite books ever the film on the other hand is amazingly insipid and bad when i heard damon would play <UNK> i knew this production was doomed but i didn't expect it to be this bad the actors go around and act very <UNK> except for law and even he is guilty of some <UNK> acting all the actors here are near amateurish speaking italian and moving one's arms or hair about shouldn't be considered as acting damon is miscast he's way too stiff for a character that's supposed to be a <UNK> paltrow is forgettable and hoffman plays yet another <UNK> slimy character talk about <UNK> br br what's really unforgivable about the script written by the overrated director is that it completely <UNK> every subtle details from the book and comes up with many of its own and none of them work the addition of the jazz music stuff is totally wrong i guess idea of italy in the late 50s early 60s is <UNK> with images of <UNK> baker <UNK> the italian countryside and <UNK> <UNK> yep is a true <UNK> the film is so bleeding obvious that silly scene when <UNK> drives through the narrow street full of mirrors very laughable yes we get the point every point or detail comes across a mile away so much so that the film might give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers we know for example that the <UNK> character introduced at the beginning of the movie will return later on only <UNK> things and the soundtrack at times is totally inappropriate whimsical when it shouldn't be the film goes on for too long and in all sorts of pointless directions there are too many boring characters the landscape many that weren't in the book this film is bad really bad br br apparently son told his father that the <UNK> novel was his favorite mr then <UNK> to direct it as a favor of sorts to his son well the director did achieve what he set out to do talented mr <UNK> with its hitchcock aspirations is a film strictly made for 12 year olds
<START> surprisingly good and quick witted adventure that features <UNK> supposedly in his first lead role in a feature as an unconventional navy sub commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own however he has earn it by competing against the u s navy in a series of war games with a crew of <UNK> questionable and lovable men and a woman too br br director david s ward major league and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand which they do quite well second besides the character most of the crew provide some or plenty of the movie's humor which is treated like a double edged sword three members of the supporting cast <UNK> williams toby and rob schneider provide the funniest scenes which includes weird gestures <UNK> and well their personalities br br down <UNK> is more than a navy version of police academy or the dirty dozen what the film does is get the job done the right way and i liked it
<START> i have seen this movie about 4 times and every time i am impressed with the second camera <UNK> work seems trivial but there is something very professional <UNK> and talented there the movie as a whole suffers from other problems as stated by other comments the significance so the issues being approached are as relevant today as it was 40 years ago the acting is a bit strained but the work of the second camera assistant is stellar this person needs to get back into the business perhaps directing what is this person waiting for i will be watching and waiting and cheering from the <UNK> bob
<START> as a great fan of the hammer studios and enthusiastic watcher of their gothic horror films i wonder what took me so long to start watching their tv series hammer house of horror which only ran for one season in 1980 now that i've seen the first four episodes of the show i can say that it easily <UNK> my expectations so far while this first episode <UNK> time is maybe not the most imaginative horror story ever told and doesn't quite deliver the marvelous gothic atmosphere that i love <UNK> films from the 50s to the 70s for it <UNK> does accomplish to tell a surprisingly spooky tale and create some genuine creepiness within fifty minutes film score composer david winter jon <UNK> is tormented by the <UNK> century witch <UNK> patricia quinn while he story may be simple but for a running time of less than an hour it is effective and delivers many creepy moments northern irish actress patricia quinn who is probably best known for her role in the rocky horror picture show 1975 as well as the fantastic monty python comedy monty <UNK> meaning of life 1983 is wonderfully <UNK> in her role which fits her like a <UNK> jon <UNK> is also quite good as david and while <UNK> gee who plays his <UNK> actress wife may not be the best actress ever she is definitely nice to look at the episode is accompanied by a nice score which plays along well with the atmosphere overall <UNK> time is a very entertaining episode with several truly creepy moments and decent opener to the series
<START> while i was watching this movie i never thought i'd be defending it it's honest enough from the about not having much of a plot there's no real characters to <UNK> onto except the killer some of the acting can be better but most of it is capable br br i know a three out of ten isn't stellar but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and completely useless etc i think it set out to do what it's supposed to fairly well the lighting is minimal at times more natural than most audiences are used to but it's supposed top look like a camcorder snuff film in fact at times the quality is probably still too high to be true to that but nobody would make it through minutes of camera work that's truly that bad br br it's not particularly scary but it is disturbing at times there are one or two characters who don't come across as believable at all and the soundtrack does get <UNK> at times but overall it was put together <UNK> than a lot of camcorder movies
<START> final solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid it shows how this hate was contrived and was <UNK> from generation to generation jan <UNK> was taught that a black man was a plague he was raised to be that way br br then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs <UNK> will he change his ways the film is a powerful movie that shows the <UNK> the different races had for one another it shows these <UNK> with quite a lot of accuracy the movie shows the world of how apartheid affected the psyche of blacks and whites br br this is a great film that everyone should watch
<START> the cure is a fantastic film about a boy with aids i've cried about 4 times watching this film and it's just so sad i can't promise everyone will cry watching this but it will make you want to very emotional and very sad the cure is a must see movie it shows you the meaning of friendship and love and is an extremely great movie br br at first i didn't think it would be as great and wondered why my mum always cried watching it but now i know it's a stunning film that is so original and is so close to real life situations unlike most of the other films that doesn't make sense words cannot describe the greatness of the cure you just have to see it
<START> nothing more than a soccer knock off of the mighty <UNK> this film proved to be annoying in most aspects this was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours to say the least my younger sisters liked it but it proved to be too much like the far superior mighty <UNK> oh well at least olivia <UNK> was hot and steve <UNK> still had a job at that point in time
<START> it was easy to dismiss this film as <UNK> at the time of its release fonda douglas and lemmon were known <UNK> but the accident at three island provided shocking context to this fictional drama br br this film works on many levels taking shots at both public <UNK> and tv news 1979 was the <UNK> of the infamous happy talk format of tv news see also ron <UNK> and it's on display here in all its glory the <UNK> anchor <UNK> reads a story about a <UNK> head on <UNK> before <UNK> introducing <UNK> wells fonda doing a story about a <UNK> who makes house or is that <UNK> calls the show's producer and the station manager argue about content or lack thereof behind the scenes br br there are a few technical errors the <UNK> <UNK> james <UNK> shows fonda and douglas the requisite scale model of a <UNK> water <UNK> plant built by later as lemmon and <UNK> <UNK> nicely playing <UNK> friend colleague caught between duty and loyalty fight a sudden crisis in the s control room they're obviously running a <UNK> water plant built by <UNK> a small point but curious considering how many details the screenwriters got right br br like any good drama the film asks more questions than it answers the real world accident at proves the film's basic premise the working title for the film was originally power and you'll see why as nuclear power <UNK> to make a comeback in these days of 3 gas the china syndrome is as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago
<START> in new york a group of <UNK> join the high school for the performing arts after being well succeeded in their audition for four years their dreams <UNK> success love and personal dramas are <UNK> though the insecure doris maureen the homosexual <UNK> the aggressive <UNK> gene anthony ray the hopeful <UNK> irene <UNK> the ambitious ralph barry miller and their friends until their <UNK> day br br twenty eight years ago fame was a great success with the story of teenagers seeking a spot in the show business and i loved this movie and the soundtrack on cd i have just watched fame on dvd and <UNK> i would say that it is a good movie with a great potential only but with too many flawed subplots the story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answer i do not know whether alan parker had edition problems to <UNK> the running time of this movie but what happened for example with the <UNK> that goes to a clinic for abortion what happened with <UNK> and his teacher did he fail due to his <UNK> problem what happened with <UNK> after <UNK> her <UNK> in the apartment of that crook the musician that plays <UNK> and his proud father are left behind in the subplot anyway fame is still a delightful entertainment and a cult movie for me my vote is seven br br title brazil fame
<START> cameron diaz james <UNK> frank <UNK> that's an all star power cast but the box proves once again that it is not a guarantee for a solid movie the premise sounds promising a couple gets a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollar the downside is that someone will die a person they probably will not know so what do you do this gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes after that the story <UNK> completely vague an uninspired plot lines about an alien conspiracy involving the <UNK> nothing really is explained here br br the box is a disappointment could have been so much better but since it is based on an ultra short story that explains the continuity errors
<START> some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow br br some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience these won't directly feed you but they'll help you yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have and after all the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept br br and then there are movies that do neither of these things that you will watch out of <UNK> or because you have a need for historical context these are pretty worthless experiences in terms of building a life br br the problem is of course that often you don't know which of the three a film will be going in you might get some indication from people you trust but because a life in film is so personal you really won't know until you go on the blind date br br for me this was pretty worthless yes yes i know for many <UNK> is the epitome of the sublime and rich and you should know if you don't that among my greatest film experiences are some very strange films very strange indeed br br it isn't that this isn't cinematic or <UNK> deep or politically friendly to the way i think its how it gets there that is off base its the <UNK> from real <UNK> that <UNK> me br br part of the problem is that this is successful alternative art which means that it is successful commercial art which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely acceptable but simply <UNK> in <UNK> surely all this is true br br when the term surreal is used generally it is used <UNK> to <UNK> any film image or world that <UNK> from reality or seems strange but when it is used correctly meaning according to <UNK> theory it always revolves around <UNK> and in particular this film and the one he genuinely did with <UNK> so because they invented surreal cinema they define and control the term that by itself <UNK> me and i have my own alternative definition that doesn't come from their philosophy br br its because the philosophy is wholly contrary it isn't a philosophy at all but a <UNK> of philosophy an anti order its <UNK> <UNK> carefully <UNK> the things that they use and the things they <UNK> without clearly <UNK> them br br so okay against <UNK> against narrative against history against religion an easy one against deliberate love but for an linear narrative for establishing its own history celebrated by countless film school <UNK> what else can they do for a sort of <UNK> accidental love br br it is its own enemy if there were a <UNK> alive today as he sold his image the first thing he would do is attack the church or the surreal br br my regular readers know that in nearly all matters cinematic i to the spanish and avoid the french but in the matter of the surreal i'd like to you consider the reverse get your <UNK> from alfred not <UNK> br br ted's <UNK> 2 of 3 has some interesting elements
<START> quite a ways away from go fish both were good films but had a bigger budget and cast to work with here this film was very entertaining and easy to like the acting was good lots of slow burn sexual tension br br
<START> some would argue this is better mainly because of the acting but it is indeed far worse for reasons that <UNK> the improvement br br the source from which all the problems <UNK> the story aside from one of them people being shot point blank with a shotgun in the chest and surviving for hours without medical attention there is a bigger problem <UNK> the <UNK> with the golden heart is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day and that includes asking an evil spirit for help <UNK> <UNK> who comes out of nowhere with a past in voodoo is willing to <UNK> <UNK> so long as <UNK> can hook her up the acting while improved is still horrid these people couldn't convey emotion out of a paper bag the script doesn't help them either stupid lines and i can only assume no direction from the director this script was read like shakespeare in high school with a teacher <UNK> them as they went br br while this movie if you can call it that at its 80 min run time thankfully is perhaps even funnier than the first because of all these things it is definitely more painful to watch 1 10
<START> first and foremost this movie has the stupidest plot of any movie i have ever seen and unfortunately i had to see this one i was flipping through channels one day and stumbled upon this lousy excuse for a movie and it confirmed what i have been saying for a long time <UNK> top is not an actor and is not funny in the slightest sense he acts like he's a great comedian and thinks he <UNK> the audiences attention frankly he has the acting ability of a 10 year old class clown scratch that less than a 10 year <UNK> ability to compare them to <UNK> top would be a grave insult upon their good name this movie tries to be funny using dull one liners which all seem to have been lifted from 50's cartoons by the end i would have done anything to <UNK> my memory of this movie but sadly the memories stay with me the only thing i can do is to warn others to never to watch this movie however it proves the rumors true <UNK> top can't act worth a damn
<START> if you tried to make a bad film you could not make one worst that this one i can't imagine anyone paying good money to see trash like this in a theater the thing that really gets you is being <UNK> in looking at the entire thing just for the <UNK> of seeing how lousy it could get the redeeming <UNK> of this film was seeing the words the end
<START> i first heard of this film when <UNK> talked about it on his werewolves and <UNK> cd he said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous being a lover of terrible cinema i knew i was in for a treat br br this film is hands down one of the <UNK> i've ever seen certainly one of the <UNK> <UNK> films basically a demon took human form years ago for a woman the woman died or something the demon cried blood the blood fell on the bed the bed is now possessed and it now eats along with fruit flowers and chicken it also has a taste for people the people can range between horny teens gangsters servants or professional orgy <UNK> there's also a sick guy who the bed ate but put his soul behind a picture in the room br br most movies let you figure out the plot through exciting action death bed takes another path it basically tells you through narration exactly what's happening while slow dull murder scenes take place also i must say everyone who's eaten by the bed are surprisingly quiet i would think if a bed is eating you through the ways of a <UNK> grade science fair experiment it would <UNK> a little i guess nerve endings weren't invented until 1981 or so br br the story is wacky the direction is slow and pretty awful the sets are sparse the acting it fairly painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally <UNK> actors i've ever seen probably would make a great party film if alcohol and smart <UNK> are involved certainly one you shouldn't miss
<START> i saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful it was pointless and just plain stupid the supposed plot concerned a <UNK> <UNK> too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life he disappears on his wedding day in a <UNK> no less and <UNK> up with an assortment of <UNK> br br we saw it with a bus load of people on the way down to atlantic city and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie it was trying to be profound but it wasn't it was stupid and offensive if i wasn't on a bus i would have walked out on the movie anyone considering seeing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been <UNK>
<START> i was amazed at the quality of this film particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director all <UNK> <UNK> of him truly a boy directing a movie about a boy i look forward to seeing more luke films br br i did think this one was a bit too long there was too much time spent showing connor being <UNK> and unwilling to make a move on owen <UNK> didn't try hard enough owen being so young could have easily become closer to <UNK> and later decided it wasn't his <UNK> and owen would still have learned the valuable lesson about corruption and politics instead he didn't give himself a fair chance to learn about his sexuality and what about poor <UNK> owen could have been a good influence br br though the film <UNK> to show owen as a hero who <UNK> perverted corruption i felt sad for owen he was offered the opportunity to have some boy boy fun with <UNK> who was extraordinarily beautiful owen didn't have to go along with the political <UNK> as offered but he could have tried to have some fun with <UNK> and still walked away when he wanted it was clear that owen was in charge no one forced him to do anything he didn't want to do but he could have had more fun and with a very hot boyfriend at that br br i hope luke makes more movies where appealing young characters have more fun
<START> now throw <UNK> from the train was not a great comedy but it is a load of fun and makes you laugh the title may seem a little strange but the entire movie isn't literally about that although it is about something just as sinister br br danny de <UNK> basically wants to kill his overbearing mother and fast forward a little bit some random and funny events take place the premise is quite funny and the things that billy crystal and danny de <UNK> get into were great some of the scenes seemed to not fit in for me but this didn't make it a bad movie br br for what it is a wacky comedy it pulls it off well and should be seen once just to say you saw it
<START> the photography is good the costumes are good but the editing is bad the various scenes are cut or stopped at the wrong times and the conversations are s l o w and tedious this <UNK> continues the entire show it is a very tedious show to watch i believe that more scenes should have been added but that would make it a longer show it is very slow moving the writers should have made it just a 1 night show and not <UNK> our agony night after night there is nothing else on otherwise i'd change the channel the first night i feel bad for the indians of the time and am angry at the white men for what they did to the indians but thats our history
<START> if you're a sucker for corny movies and are looking to see something you don't need to pay close attention to this might be worth watching the story itself is very unrealistic the dialogue is also not very believable it is <UNK> you will find yourself relating to any of these characters because none of them are very likable the acting could've been a lot worse victoria <UNK> is <UNK> out of place with the rest of the cast as she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress while it's not saying much this is one of the best acting performances i've seen from <UNK> spelling she appears to be getting better with age overall this extremely melodramatic movie is mediocre at best
<START> this show is actually pretty good like all shows on tv it has its good episodes and its bad ones br br i have read where people compare this show to married with children and i suppose it is a similar show for the new generation however because of what was expected and allowed on tv in the days of married with children that show was taken to great extremes to show that it was in fact a television show and not meant to be take seriously br br the war at home has the luxury of being a bit more realistic the parents talk to each other like real life parents often do telling their children one thing when they will turn around and do the opposite br br sure some of the content can be considered controversial but i find this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty like it or not there are a lot of families out there just like this one br br every episode does teach a its just that sometimes the lesson is that you will not find a perfect solution for every problem that a family may encounter and sometimes the solution is to pick the lesser of two <UNK> we all know that in some cases as a parent the only goal you can have is to keep your kids out of really big trouble and hope that they learn right from wrong br br i respect the writers for attempting to keep the show true to life instead of having some magical ending like the <UNK> family always had
<START> now i've seen it all just when i thought it couldn't get any more pathetic and cheesy than <UNK> massacre just when i thought dialogue and acting couldn't get worse than nail gun massacre just when i thought don't go in the woods would retain its title as <UNK> slasher film ever along comes the last <UNK> party somehow this cheap wretched <UNK> manages to avoid <UNK> but it remains terrible i couldn't believe my eyes for once i can't complain about excessive or in this case any nudity in a slasher film but it still managed to make me <UNK> with embarrassment for renting it never before have i seen such horrible acting <UNK> direction writing i could go on forever with this list here's a quick run down br br a mental patient somehow escapes from the loony bin dresses up like a surgeon somehow finds out where his doctor lives and breaks in while the doctor's daughter is having friends over for the night then begins the most stupid killing spree ripped off from other movies such as <UNK> party massacre and halloween this side of the universe the characters have negative <UNK> which suggests they are not human then again i guess they are not since they have the tendency to bleed <UNK> aid when they get cut as the slasher likes to show use when he holds up his to the camera in way too many scenes it is only 80 minutes how many times must we look at that like that before it <UNK> the whole movie which i suppose wouldn't be all that bad of an idea in this case there is one moment where i thought maybe just maybe the director would make it interesting a second killer was added but alas it was not to be and then to insult even further there is a stupid super cop out sub ending and an even <UNK> final conclusion that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense but i would hate to give away the dumbest few scenes in movie history to those two or three fools like me dumb enough to rent this <UNK> br br i sure hope that by writing this i have saved 80 minutes of someone's life i get on my hands and knees to beg anyone still thinking about renting this please please please don't this is a fan of the slasher genre talking i know what is good for you the only real victims in this <UNK> nonsense are the poor morons that have sat through the whole toilet tank score since there is no negative point scale i have to give it a 1 but a below average 1 at that avoid it at all costs please
<START> for all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie another <UNK> in l a for any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission a huge waste of time and money the saddest aspect of this ugly exercise to me is that we are watching an extremely talented actor pacino seemingly playing a parody of himself that's what remained with me as a total mystery i can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living what i fail to comprehend is an artist of al <UNK> talent <UNK> and embarrassing himself with this level of mindless junk hopefully he'll choose projects of better value in the future and for value save your time and hard earned money skip this let's send hollywood and al a message
<START> there must be an error this movie belongs with plan 9 and a lot others as a quite entertaining silly <UNK> you'll never accept you like it yet you will watch it whenever it comes out on tv it's as simple as that
<START> shirley knight plays sara <UNK> a long island housewife who runs away from her marriage when she discovers she is pregnant she plans to drive into america's <UNK> and start <UNK> along the way she picks up a friendly <UNK> james <UNK> who calls himself <UNK> ' soon she discovers that the good natured <UNK> is actually brain damaged and by picking him up she has <UNK> taken on a huge responsibility the two of them drive all the way to <UNK> where sara gets killer a job helping out at a <UNK> <UNK> farm it is here that sara meets gordon a local cop and soon things go horribly wrong for everyone br br this is a powerful drama about people <UNK> from society <UNK> by the choices they make or by the limits <UNK> on them by others even with such a low budget and a very <UNK> attitude the film is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters shirley knight has a complex role and there are moments of some awe inspiring acting by her one of my favorites is when she is on the <UNK> calling her home to her worried husband the first time it is such a tense scene on both ends and in every small gesture and <UNK> of a word so much about her is spoken with so little then comes in the character of <UNK> played by james <UNK> this character is unlike any i've ever seen him play and he performs wonderfully it's one of his best performances as he is very restrained and moving br br the way coppola develops the characters by using short dream like flashbacks is very clever adding a <UNK> kind of view onto it all the quick flashbacks that are graphic and self contained contrast well with the longer shots in some crucial scenes also because this film was shot on location all over the eastern u s it offers an interesting authentic look at america in the late 1960's br br i haven't seen many other films starring ms knight i'm only familiar with her more recent work on television usually playing a <UNK> mother in law or a <UNK> old woman it was great seeing her so young beautiful and so wonderfully subtle in this movie it's also kind of a shame that james <UNK> went on to be <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> for the rest of his career because this film <UNK> that he is capable of so much more than that

<START> before i start my review here is a quick lesson in australian <UNK> which may help you with viewing the movie and understanding some of the other reviews from australia and overseas br br in australian <UNK> <UNK> are a pair of rubber <UNK> not to be confused with the same american word that <UNK> to butt revealing underwear are a brand of australian short a <UNK> is a small can sized bottle of beer and a <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> for a small bottle of beer br br if you love black comedies about <UNK> criminals then you will love this movie a lot of people on imdb with weak <UNK> and no appreciation of dark humour have reviewed this movie which unfortunately makes this movie appear to be more mediocre than what it is a lot of reviewers have also compared it to lock stock and pulp fiction while it is the same genre it is a completely different and original style br br a lot of reviewers have also <UNK> this movie for using heath <UNK> characters dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this movie without watching the movie closely enough to realise that his brother was killed by the same villain that wishes to kill character this is explained <UNK> through the movie but not clearly enough for most to understand br br this movie is also reminiscent of lock stock and <UNK> dogs in that it is the director writers debut feature and for a debut feature it rates as well as these two movies as a matter of fact like lock stock and <UNK> dogs i rate this movie as a 10 10 for a director writers debut unfortunately unlike tarantino and ritchie jordan fails to live up to expectations in his subsequent movies like ned kelly br br this movie is one that you should definitely add to your dvd collection and is one that holds up to several viewings quite easily
<START> in the universal series of modern sherlock holmes stories with basil <UNK> and <UNK> bruce sherlock holmes and the secret is not one of the top films although it is entertaining i think the problem with it is that much of the film's <UNK> between holmes and his nemesis <UNK> here played by lionel <UNK> seems to <UNK> the actual point of the <UNK> work br br <UNK> appears in three of the holmes films with <UNK> in the adventures of sherlock holmes he was played by george <UNK> who gave real <UNK> to the love of <UNK> for its own sake to the role for my money performance as the professor was the best of the three there is even a brief moment of comedy in his performance when he's disguised as the sergeant of police towards the end like he's preparing to sing a <UNK> lot from gilbert sullivan next comes mr <UNK> performance here more of that later finally there is henry intellectual <UNK> in sherlock holmes and the lady in green it's a typically cool classy performance by mr <UNK> but his <UNK> with holmes seem to be a tedious bore to him they keep him from <UNK> the main plan in the stories that the professor pops up in he really senses holmes is a nemesis who will remain a danger as long as he is alive yet because of the intellectual <UNK> match between him and <UNK> <UNK> in his autobiography actually felt <UNK> was the best of the film br br if <UNK> captured the love of evil in the professor and <UNK> seemed to demonstrate the tired <UNK> don in the stories the professor is a well regarded <UNK> whose volume on the had a european <UNK> and who wrote an intriguing book the dynamics of the <UNK> <UNK> demonstrates the professor as <UNK> businessman first of all he's sold his services apparently to nazi germany this is never gone into but one <UNK> as this is before the nazis began to really collapse he figures they will win the war secondly he is not a fool when dr william post jr has shown he is a state of near physical collapse due to the torturing of <UNK> gang the professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who are <UNK> because he's as good a scientist as and would be able to put together the bomb site i somehow can't quite see <UNK> making such a sensible decision on the spot and if <UNK> had to make it he would seem annoyed that there is yet another <UNK> to his plans br br by the way one trick used in all the holmes series regarding the professor is how to rid the film of him if you read the holmes stories <UNK> appears as the villain three times in the <UNK> of sherlock <UNK> last story the adventure of the final problem in the return of sherlock <UNK> first story the adventure of the empty house and the last of the four novels <UNK> the valley of fear it's amazing how much <UNK> the professor got out of so few appearances he is mentioned in two or three other stories as well in passing but because of his fate at the falls in the final problem and the empty house we always see him fall to his death <UNK> falls off the white tower on tower hill <UNK> with more imagination tries to flee <UNK> and the police but is shot as he jumps and wounded fails to hold on to the wall of an <UNK> building <UNK> here it is not seen but heard seems to fall down a trap door he's planted in an escape tunnel it is really tedious after awhile to see the professor always fall in these films one turns to the gene wilder comedy admittedly a comedy sherlock <UNK> smarter brother <UNK> leo is a wonderfully wacky and villainous <UNK> complete finally with an irish accent who is not killed at the end but just left <UNK> in a <UNK> over how his careful schemes did not work out i rather liked that better br br the use of the dancing men code here like the use of the devil's foot root in dressed to kill <UNK> a part of a mystery from a short story the adventure of the dancing men appeared in the return of sherlock holmes and deals with a client of holmes whose wife has been getting weird blood <UNK> messages in this code charles <UNK> in his biography the adventures of conan doyle suggests sir arthur may have picked up the code from a magazine game in the <UNK> but we really don't know the code is basically one of letter <UNK> for the figures of the dancing men the story in the short story is dramatic but deals with a triangle the only <UNK> in the film is that makes a slight change that <UNK> both holmes and <UNK> br br the film will entertain but i still think the house of fear the scarlet claw and sherlock holmes faces death are better films
<START> this has got to be the worst piece of crap i have ever seen randy quaid funny as a supporting actor in the original but not as the leading too much eddie the original is a classic like the original the supporting actor carried the show ed <UNK> was very funny he is the eddie of christmas 2 how come still looks the same after all those years and everyone else in the original looks 14 years older after 15 minutes of watching this movie i don't believe i had even laughed yet the island thing just didn't work if it wasn't for the good looking south pacific female guide on the island the movie would have been a total loss i sat on this review for a week and yes i still think the movie should never have been made lets hope there is not a third br br shawn
<START> i've seen both movies and i saw without a doubt the re make is the best i know a lot of people would disagree those who have become fans of the original will most probably not like this re make but i thought it was well thought out and definitely scary it was so good i'm going to see it again tonight the original <UNK> me out because they kill the children i mean who does that in movies anyway but in this one the children have at least half a chance the only bad part about this movie is when the babysitter jill walks towards the sounds she hears and runs outside into the <UNK> to check for someone clearly no one in their right mind would do that whilst <UNK> so that is the only thing i found wrong with the movie and even so they probably had to put that in there to build suspense i don't want to give too much away for all those who have not seen it i recommend you do instead of listening to all these people saying its crap and worse than the original it would be a better movie for teenagers as it displays things that most of us are scared of but when i was in the movies there were at least 10 adults over the age of 70 in there watching it and they enjoyed it if they enjoyed it i think you will to i give it a 9 out of 10
<START> a handful of <UNK> young college <UNK> sisters decide to go camping with a professor a giant <UNK> want to sacrifice them to prevent the apocalypse come the year 2000 they also have to <UNK> with <UNK> an indian and a <UNK> <UNK> monster type thing worth watching for only 3 reasons george flower a sadly <UNK> b movie <UNK> is on hand as a <UNK> and the other 2 belong to the stunning <UNK> in one of only 3 non porn roles she had both have very small roles too bad everything else in the movie is <UNK> bad br br my grade d br br <UNK> dvd extras original trailer br br eye candy 4 <UNK> of breasts 2 <UNK>
<START> i saw the film in its original theatrical release in austin texas the old paramount theatre i don't know if it still exists went all out with <UNK> around the walls connected accurately to all six channels at 15 years of age i was blown away the concept of surround sound was completely foreign to music and film at that time br br i vividly remember at least three outstanding scenes where the surround sound made a huge impact though please forgive me if time has <UNK> my memories with inaccuracies the first was a travel by the camera through <UNK> row alive with the sites and sounds of daily activity you saw each one first such as a <UNK> for example then as the camera passed them by their sound would continue to be heard passing left or right down the side of the theater to the rear the second was a <UNK> band that was seen first in the front then it <UNK> past the camera splitting left and right not only did the sound of each <UNK> follow its own <UNK> path it also changed in <UNK> as it played toward you to the side of you and then away from you and if that wasn't enough they also <UNK> for the <UNK> effect for each <UNK> as it went by the third scene was near the end of the movie as is leaving <UNK> row for new york to look for <UNK> he and about half the cast members pass by the camera as they leave the village with the same sound effects as the <UNK> band the other half of the cast chorus sing along with them and also wave and voice <UNK> to and their other friends the <UNK> replies can then be heard from the sides and the rear br br surround sound was used with splendid effects throughout the movie i think i remember a rock or something thrown from a <UNK> and hearing it land in the water behind me little things like that were evident to theater goers lucky enough to have the full six channels things that would just seem mundane in theaters without it br br i stayed in the theater for several <UNK> you could do that then and i went back several more times before it left town i never saw the movie again it literally begs for release on dvd with restored picture <UNK> and surround sound i do hope someone somewhere has <UNK> it please gershwin family allow it to be released before it is lost for good to other generations
<START> you don't review james bond movies you <UNK> them rate them according to how well they meet expectations there are certain things one has come to expect even demand of a bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't so here are ten elements that make a bond film a bond film and even though never say never again is not technically part of the official bond filmography the mere presence of sean connery returning as <UNK> makes it something more than merely an <UNK> member of the series anyway here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10 br br title never say never again the clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline but is instead an in joke reference to sean <UNK> <UNK> to never play again after having been <UNK> back once before for <UNK> are forever whatever the case it is a catchy title 8 points br br pre credit <UNK> perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official <UNK> series of bond films there is no <UNK> the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits and even that is disappointing yet another oh no bond has been killed 4 points br br opening credits other than a screen full of tiny they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles 1 points br br theme song as written by michel <UNK> and sung by hall never say never again would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride as a bond theme it's merely okay 6 points br br bond james bond appropriately since this film sees connery being <UNK> back into service as bond after a <UNK> <UNK> the story begins with <UNK> facing the question as to whether bond connery is still up to the job happily connery more than proves himself ready for bondage again though he is a bit sporting a bit more <UNK> and wearing a slightly more obvious <UNK> he seems to have no trouble <UNK> back into action all in all it is one of <UNK> best and most relaxed turns as the character 9 points br br bond babes even in the best of the bond films the female characters aren't given much dimension they exist largely as necessary props for <UNK> use future oscar winner kim basinger is granted a great deal of <UNK> in creating her character of domino and the film benefits from this she does a nice job and she's not bad to look at either 8 points br br bond villain the reports of his death being obviously exaggerated is back at least for the moment showing he has more lives than his <UNK> <UNK> one time jesus <UNK> turned stereotypical villain max von <UNK> isn't given a lot to do in the role but is a <UNK> presence nonetheless but he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by <UNK> maria <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> after a string of banal bond villains it is so refreshing for <UNK> to gave a performance that is both subtle yet <UNK> evil funny without being campy ruthless without seeming cartoonish his <UNK> ranks right up there with <UNK> as one of <UNK> best villains 10 points br br bond baddies <UNK> what can i say as played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen barbara <UNK> <UNK> through the film displaying a mix of self amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity bond has crossed paths with a variety of <UNK> <UNK> most of whom have been so easily <UNK> of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters but few <UNK> to exhibit such a <UNK> for the dramatic or such fierce determination even her <UNK> demise is spectacular even by <UNK> standards 10 points br br sinister plot as a remake of sorts of <UNK> the film does seem a bit been there done that nuclear <UNK> are stolen and major real estate will go if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi dollar <UNK> but at least producer kevin was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest bond adventures by comparisons this effort blows <UNK> out of the water and despite the absence of many <UNK> <UNK> the film succeeds on its own 9 points br br production values the film starts out with an uneasy style like a tv movie trying to be more than it can but as the story progress the film <UNK> momentum and a sense of purpose making it a superior adventure 8 points br br bonus points there are several odd changes that sets this bond film apart from the official series miss <UNK> is hardly acknowledged as played by edward fox m is a <UNK> old <UNK> with no respect for the double <UNK> a <UNK> of how <UNK> <UNK> would later play the part and q suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy buddy with bond and there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film such as replacing <UNK> <UNK> martin with a vintage <UNK> and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story and a big rescue near the end is on <UNK> an homage to the <UNK> of the lost <UNK> which was itself a tribute to the bond films 5 points br br summary never say never again is a mixed bag in the really important areas it more than holds it own thanks to hero connery villain <UNK> assassin <UNK> and damsel in distress basinger but the devil is in the details as seemingly <UNK> as the opening credits theme song and such seem the film is lacking because of their absence it all comes off as a faux bond film a very good substitute but a substitute nonetheless br br bond o <UNK> rating <UNK> points out of 100
<START> i mean nothing happens 5 dumb kids go to <UNK> to find a magical forest of marijuana this could've been fun if it hadn't been for the 5 worst actors in the world and the dialogs weren't even half an inch of fun the only thing that i almost showed my teeth of was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either <UNK> or kansas the plot could have been fun had it not been for abysmal interpretation if you even think about watching this piece of crap movie don't how dumb is it that the guy gets away from the cops by telling them he's gay like his friend did just that he wasn't pretending and there's that dumb <UNK> joke about the several meanings to the word gay i'm laughing my hair off not anyway worst movie i've ever seen
<START> i didn't know what to expect from this hugely popular and hilarious swedish comedy satire team as they released their first feature film more broad satire well we do get four contemporary exceptionally memorable tales of family pains generation gaps and <UNK> in particular but it's drama thankfully and what drama epic in its scope as each episode is from carefully picked <UNK> different parts of sweden but each story could seriously carry a whole movie if expanded <UNK> br br it's dark twisted harrowing yet <UNK> entertaining and <UNK> executed script acting and cinematography are absolute world class as three hours seem to get by in a blink it's four shades of <UNK> and easily one of the best films in the <UNK> cinema history it's answer to short cuts or <UNK> if you like and instantly on par with those br br 9 out of 10 from <UNK>
<START> it's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren't expecting it the dead end kids <UNK> boys found themselves in a lot of uneven films and usually did better when in a support role as in angels with dirty faces here their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action br br john garfield is light <UNK> champion johnny a <UNK> who's a lot different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press when a newspaper reporter inadvertently learns that <UNK> a party loving <UNK> his plans to <UNK> that information in a <UNK> is interrupted by a <UNK> bottle to the head from <UNK> manager doc ward robert in turn doc talks <UNK> girlfriend goldie ann sheridan into running off with him to avoid the legal <UNK> of dealing with the <UNK> death as both flee a police chase winds up in a fiery car wreck and <UNK> body is as johnny from the gold watch he was wearing br br claude <UNK> <UNK> an edward g robinson <UNK> that doesn't quite work as a detective who's been <UNK> to <UNK> detail after a bad arrest years ago his character is monty <UNK> and he has a pretty good <UNK> that the body in the car crash wasn't johnny he his boss to hand over the closed case to him and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way br br meanwhile johnny looks for advice from his lawyer and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets <UNK> for most of his ten thousand dollar <UNK> making his way cross country johnny winds up at the date farm in arizona run by a <UNK> <UNK> may <UNK> the farm is the legacy of <UNK> brother a deceased priest from brooklyn and is now the home of a band of <UNK> tag street boys the dead end kids who work the farm billy <UNK> is the <UNK> leader of the boys in this one and his sister peggy gloria <UNK> becomes the romantic interest for johnny now going by the name of jack br br i get a kick out of the historical perspective offered in these pre war era films when johnny and the boys take a joy ride in the truck they fill up at a gas station for a 1 28 tommy <UNK> gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money and with that thought jack decides to take on a <UNK> boxer offering 500 a round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him the clichéd premise is turned on it's ear somewhat when jack gets knocked out in the fifth round but by then he's earned enough to give the fruit farm a fighting chance of it's own maybe grandma should have been in the ring she just about took out everyone sitting around her at <UNK> as johnny jack comes around in the locker room detective <UNK> is on hand to take him into custody knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar it's a toss up as to whether <UNK> follows through on his arrest you'll have to watch the film to find out br br i like the dead end films where leo in charge but he doesn't have a lot to do in this one however he does a great film <UNK> on the ticket taker at the gate of the boxing match another thought wouldn't it have been great if the ever present picture on the wall of the priest had been that of pat o'brien br br all in all this is a pretty good entry in both the john garfield and dead end kids filmography and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half if there's one downside it's not enough screen time for pretty ann sheridan the film might have wound up even more satisfying if the roles of sheridan and gloria <UNK> were <UNK> as the on screen chemistry between peggy and jack seemed more forced than natural
<START> it didn't feel like a movie and was thankfully short under it felt more like a commercial of in computer graphics most of the special effects are great to be sure but that don't a great or even a good movie make not saying it's absolutely worthless viewing since it's possible to see what are the possibilities in cgi or <UNK> or what ever it's called br br as i read somewhere you can't fix it in the cutting room a bad story and non directed actors can't be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work from br br however they thought this could be sold in usa is <UNK> idea since usa is the crooks br br and isn't it <UNK> typical of low budget stories they have to create an imaginative country south of mexico br br well well i it 2 just because of the special effects the rest is absolute trash
<START> i thought <UNK> offered the most boring and trivial trick ending in movie history but of course i was wrong i had no that this movie was going to be good unfortunately it was worse than i expected the worst part is that the obvious ending is so ridiculous and horrible that you can't believe it until it actually happens
<START> this film blew me away i thought i knew a little about the prison riot after watching this i see i knew nothing the story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black <UNK> both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting the flashback sequences in the prison were awesome it's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real it was not only a great piece of drama it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in american history i'm with ebert and <UNK> i give it two thumbs up
<START> veteran british television director alan <UNK> dracula a d 1972 qualifies as one of the least <UNK> entries in the hammer studios series about <UNK> <UNK> immortal <UNK> actually this represented the first time since <UNK> <UNK> memorable horror of dracula 1958 that christopher lee and peter cushing fought each other as mortal enemies they would <UNK> the same roles a few years later in the final hammer dracula the satanic <UNK> of dracula further it was the second to last dracula for hammer in which lee performed as the infamous for the record dracula a d 1972 was the seventh hammer dracula br br the exciting prologue from <UNK> you for something vastly different than what the rest of this disappointing horror flick <UNK> eternal rivals count dracula and his nemesis professor lawrence van <UNK> are literally at each other's throats <UNK> a runaway <UNK> in <UNK> hyde park for a <UNK> opening scene that makes everything else look <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> crashes and dracula emerges <UNK> half of a wooden wheel with its <UNK> <UNK> in his chest of course christopher lee has to grip this broken wheel against his body but the imagery is striking enough in its own way to pass <UNK> the count <UNK> and so does his <UNK> van <UNK> however one of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> ring and <UNK> some of the <UNK> <UNK> into a <UNK> for safe keeping br br don screenplay <UNK> the action ahead a hundred years to swinging london in 1972 we meet a smarmy young man johnny <UNK> christopher of no blade of grass who loves to raise hell with a group of hippies that crash parties and drive the british police with their antics <UNK> happens to be the <UNK> of one of <UNK> servants now <UNK> has the <UNK> ring and a <UNK> of his blood <UNK> chooses the sight of a <UNK> church to <UNK> a black mass he invites his trendy friends among them laura super sexy <UNK> <UNK> of the spy who loved me <UNK> hunt and jessica van <UNK> stephanie <UNK> to attend this black mass because it offers them something different not surprisingly they <UNK> the count and the evil <UNK> sets his eyes on jessica meanwhile after <UNK> body is discovered <UNK> of blood scotland yard inspector murray michael <UNK> of doctor who and the <UNK> help from van <UNK> modern day <UNK> peter cushing dracula wants to exact revenge on van <UNK> by taking the <UNK> <UNK> as his bride tracks down <UNK> they fight in his <UNK> apartment and the young vampire <UNK> in a <UNK> of water remember running water is just as lethal to vampires as <UNK> and <UNK> van <UNK> finds dracula in the deserted church with his daughter awaiting the count van <UNK> and dracula <UNK> van <UNK> <UNK> holy water into <UNK> face the vampire falls into an open <UNK> with a stake awaiting him and he <UNK> again br br the chief problem with dracula a d 1972 is that we don't get enough of lee as the count though we do get considerably more of cushing as van <UNK> furthermore <UNK> don <UNK> keeps dracula confined to the <UNK> church and never allows the vampire to venture out into the city despite its low budget dracula a d 1972 could have been a lot better the scene where the contemporary van <UNK> has to <UNK> down <UNK> and spell it backwards to get dracula seems almost laughable you'd think that he'd know about this backwards spelling trick unless you are afraid of horror movies this one will make you yawn occasionally gibson presents us with a superb close up of dracula with his <UNK> <UNK> and blood shot eyes but this is about as scary as this <UNK> gets and that isn't saying much
<START> when a <UNK> wife <UNK> loses her husband she decides to completely make herself over to win him back not politically correct by today's standards but still fun to watch especially the scenes with marie <UNK> and hopper

<START> i think my summary says it all this mtv ish answer to the classic <UNK> camera tv show features a gen x or is that gen y type putting in false <UNK> and wearing various hats and <UNK> and glasses and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations example kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his wedding kennedy is the bride done up in a full <UNK> <UNK> and long wig the joke is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his bits and pieces problem is this <UNK> goes on way too long obviously to fill out time and kennedy is about as funny as a dead <UNK> lying in the sun <UNK> camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one running around constantly asking do i look fat i recognize the show was not made for me it was made for 12 year old <UNK> who think jackass is the height of comedy today so let them laugh thank god the show was short lived
<START> in the realm of the senses is a beautifully filmed well written and <UNK> acted film it tells the haunting story of a woman who kills her husband after falling in love with another man the ghost of her husband continues to haunt her after his murder this film is really good anyone interested should definitely check it out
<START> okay so i love silly movies if you enjoy silly sci fi movies over the top movies or if you are a fan of mr bruce campbell i would go see this movie this movie is all that i wanted it to be being a fan of over the top movies this fit the bill every time i thought to myself this movie would be the best movie ever if blank would happen then just as i thought it blank would happen it's a wonderful silly <UNK> movie if you are a fan of campbell i'd say <UNK> <UNK> bring your friends laugh at it it's fun it's not classic or anything but if it's on tv some night watch it it has become for me a movie i would file under indulgent movies movies that may not be good but after a hard day of work i could come home and watch this list also includes and kumar go to white <UNK> of and ' <UNK> br br if you feel like a over the top wonderfully slightly bad movie watch this if not go rent <UNK> ho <UNK>

<START> i enjoyed this film very much it effectively combines humor fantasy and a few moments of horror with a solid film making effort from brilliant visuals and a very original story concerning <UNK> my only complaints are that it had its dull moments and wasn't as daring as it could have been still i give this a solid 8 out of 10 the u s should take note of this and other fine japanese horror fantasy films that have come along recently and have them available on region 1 dvd actually asian cinema in general have some of the finest films that have been <UNK> by the american public because they're hard to find i strongly recommend people to go look for these <UNK> they're hard to find but once you find them you'll be glad you did
<START> week after week these women just <UNK> all the men of their feet get real none of these women are <UNK> carrie sarah jessica parker looks like the type of woman men would pick up at <UNK> before the bar closed after their vision and standards were equally <UNK> by ten or eleven <UNK> yet she's the queen <UNK> a super sexy man killer the other three don't fare much better and their constant foul mouthed comments not to mention that they jump in and out of bed with strange men and never catch a disease this show is pathetic and creepy i don't think any man would be terribly attracted to any of these women even if he popped <UNK> like <UNK> while on shore leave
<START> <UNK> was used to a groundbreaking degree in this film but it only functions as a novelty no greater truth about the situation is got by asking the actors to <UNK> the performances are not improved by <UNK> because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good so that's why the performances in many robert altman films are often really because the actors aren't really confident saying lines which they've made up and therefore aren't sure are any good br br and quite honestly often its not very good often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings br br it <UNK> with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it <UNK> so badly br br nevertheless a fascinating raw piece of film and commendable 100 for taking the power over the green light into the street br br there are some generally great things in it this joke for example br br i'm a dancer what sort of a dancer like a ballet dancer oh no exotic br br and the whole party scene its in the following trip to the park and the scene where the boys go looking at <UNK> br br 2 5 i wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time though
<START> i can't say this show is perfect perhaps all the previous <UNK> remember the old <UNK> 10 30 <UNK> taken up by the childish humour of butch elvira <UNK> there's a space <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> oh the glory of <UNK> to hit any button on the remote to make it change br br face it comedy can't pull a showcase and create the comedic genius of the truly canadian trailer park boys but hey they try br br this show is by far one of the better original shows however none of the following will find themselves laughing at the apparent players who showcase their stupidity in picking up girls br br a dumb girls obviously they can't realise that they are just like the girls on the show oblivious jump on the man meat you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and get his name he looks good he must be popular and nice <UNK> oh but you'd never do that nobody would if they knew it was happening br br b guys who think women like nice guys obviously seeing these guys succeed at what you fail at or don't even get to experience is going to make your primal <UNK> <UNK> watch more closely they get shot down most of the time they say stupid crap br br c girls with respect for one another obviously seeing your separate distinctly female species get caught up in real world situations is wrong wrong wrong nobody gets played women are not objects they can't be played because they are all very faithful angels who are going to <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> with one another without fear of guys trying to pick them up br br oh wait <UNK> br br as much as everybody will say that this show is not funny and that it doesn't teach you anything i have to take the opposite side the show is very good at <UNK> the way relationships work for both men and women the way they think and the way they think each other think and social <UNK> its funny to see and hear the guys make absolutely idiotic comments to things the women say my grandfather died recently oh well are we having fun tonight br br besides its a club the place people go to have fun and get laid no matter who you are you're going to a club to get or give attention to someone guys go there to test their game and pick up girls girls go there to <UNK> with guys and find the one that <UNK> her off her feet the best <UNK> up br br if you're a guy learn a thing or two about different approaches and the different effects they have if you're a girl learn what these <UNK> man <UNK> really think like and learn to tell them apart from genuine guys next time you get broken up with by one of those realise its not because of him its because you're dumb and thought he was the greatest guy ever when he was quite clearly a dick to you the whole time
<START> first of all i believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read joseph <UNK> heart of darkness the book that was the literary basis for the movie with that said i believe that this movie is astounding it is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the vietnam conflict but more the psychological <UNK> that it took on the young inexperienced kids who were sent to fight it coppola showed real genius in the art of film making using many visuals to help tell the story the acting i felt was definitely all around up to par marlon <UNK> part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting his <UNK> to <UNK> at the end of the film <UNK> you in and reveals the <UNK> of a man that you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are <UNK> with this film because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all in my opinion this is one of the most <UNK> and best made films of all time
<START> a fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot though not original promised me a nice evening in front of the tv i was disappointed the actors delivered up to standard juliette lewis <UNK> as ever william hurt solid but in the background shelley duvall convincing as ever but the story was too thin to keep me engaged to the story and the twist to the finale was too obvious and too late there was only one character who was nice to he girl so guess what then the final after <UNK> i do not know what to think of that the boyfriend and the neighbor contract with the devil or just to get her to move in what the film had a nice idea behind it but the idea was not worked out in detail it could have been good but it was not too many loose ends to tie up columbo would say
<START> the quintessential housewife and perfect mother donna reed as donna stone could do it all settle <UNK> between the children or neighbors take care of her hard working <UNK> smoking <UNK> husband alex and still have a stack of <UNK> three types of breakfast meat and a tall glass of milk and <UNK> ready for the kids every morning before breakfast br br over the course of the past fifty years we've lost sight of the idealistic stay at home mom family <UNK> together at the kitchen table and preparing dinner for a hard working husband when he comes home from work br br i wish the show were available on dvd i'd <UNK> my cable altogether
<START> this is a perfect example of why many people say the 90's sucked when it comes to horror movies a boring voodoo on campus tale of terror starring the once so promising corey <UNK> stand by me the lost boys etc there might be just enough stuff happening to keep you from falling asleep and it doesn't look too cheap but this still is horror aimed at an audience that were in their very early teens during the 90's i might have been part of that audience but still i got as good as nothing out of it when watching it now and nowadays teens are used to a lot more and better already and i can't imagine any of them knowing or caring about who corey <UNK> was or is actually as the <UNK> still making films but the only thing still <UNK> him to his days of glory is the lost boys 2 the tribe sequel that got made recently and i imagine even that one isn't going to encourage anyone to seek out voodoo just another movie that got lost in 90's horror for obvious reasons
<START> catherine zeta jones and aaron star in a romantic drama about an uptight chef played by zeta jones who ends up carrying for her niece when her sister is killed in a car crash while she's out taking care of family matters she's replaced by br br unfunny <UNK> tale with no chemistry between the leads she's a dead fish and he's okay but not much of anything watching this i was wondering why anyone would want to see this since zeta jones' character is so unlikable come on she's so obsessed with cooking and being the best all she does is cook for her <UNK> or talk about food ugh i won't use any of the numerous <UNK> that come to mind i couldn't finish it
<START> first off if you want to make a good film don't <UNK> all your exposition into the last 10 minutes the viewer is expected to be <UNK> for nearly two hours only to have father explain everything to alex very late in the film to make matters worse the scriptwriter decided it wasn't enough to have the basic mystery solved but adds in a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about involving <UNK> father br br there's some serious motivation issues with characters also father's choices don't seem to make sense once the film is over why didn't he just kill <UNK> father and be done with it instead a complicated plot to obscure the truth is <UNK> but one which <UNK> that everyone will be in physical <UNK> for years including the completely innocent photographer who gets murdered by <UNK> father's thugs although alex is a doctor whom one would think is relatively bright he chooses to flee the police during which he not only his own life but those whom he involves in a nasty pile up on the <UNK> why was friend so keen on keeping her promise to <UNK> once all the crap hits the fan for alex and are we to think that father would rather kill himself rather than go to prison what about his wife did he consider her wishes those are some of the main problems br br then there are some nasty details like why was her father there the night of her <UNK> death how did he get a hold of the body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two <UNK> friend bruno seems over eager to be part of the mayhem in which he and his friends have to kill for alex notwithstanding the perceived debt he owes alex for saving his son's life what good would the photos of <UNK> do they don't <UNK> <UNK> at all and why would <UNK> have the safety <UNK> box key handy that night for her would be <UNK> to take did i miss some other things probably minor <UNK> of mine include the fact that although alex is a doctor he <UNK> like a fiend which makes his marathon run away from the police even that more impressive also when he is riding in the <UNK> with his lawyer neither of them is wearing a seat belt how bright could they be
<START> this film is just as bad as the <UNK> of <UNK> i do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films which try to portray <UNK> criminals as heroic figures moreover it <UNK> me when well respected <UNK> actors like alan <UNK> and burt <UNK> play such roles because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intent to elevate the film's subject a societal <UNK> br br i was in junior high school during the last years of life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news i remember the <UNK> of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and was the victim br br get a grip people read the history was a criminal and sexual predator he drove around the la streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle he stopped cars with attractive women inside under the <UNK> of making a traffic arrest then <UNK> and raped the women rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and <UNK> br br got exactly what he deserved it just took a decade too long no sympathy for the devil here
<START> several get on a russian ship bound for france they were going to get off there and make new lives for themselves after being discovered by the first mate and his henchmen they were held captive then things got very bad for them good show based on a true story
<START> this film is exceptional in that marlene raymond present outstanding performances the acting in this film is the greatest strength of the production but the script direction and editing deserve applause there is an extraordinary chemistry that <UNK> between the two stars if you like marlene and you like raymond you'll love this film it's a classic that <UNK> with casablanca br br
<START> wow br br reading through these comments i see a remarkable <UNK> cultural clash theme <UNK> between the us and the dutch the us p o v appears to be that this is quite a good little movie parker being a likable hero the story a light hearted rendition of what could be a <UNK> form of reality br br all three dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems they <UNK> and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disaster br br far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a <UNK> between cultures on this item as wide apart as the ocean that <UNK> them <UNK> still based on factual observation i saw the movie with my very own eyes i suspect the dutch are not too far off the mark br br parker kane is poorly made utterly boring and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation
<START> this was the one movie to see about the war my aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the justin and <UNK> wedding scene and my uncle was an extra on a horse the script was genuine and accurate the costumes were <UNK> done the was in order and even the accents were good i <UNK> love patrick <UNK> and james they were the best 2 choices and it even had a great supporting cast the civil war is my favorite thing in american history and i love movies about it i have seen quite a few and this movie and it's <UNK> north and south book 2 took the cake if you haven't seen it rent it as soon as possible it's quite an
<START> i don't understand this movies distinctly average rating br br i really really enjoyed it i even stayed up till early morning to finish watching it on late night t v br br there are three excellent characters here excellent characters danny <UNK> played a gem quite a feat considering he was directing as well his down <UNK> laughable at times character was brilliantly written and was surreal in a absolutely believable way there are people like that owen was just on the line without crossing it br br billy <UNK> comic and sense of timing was perfect for his role his frustration comedy was interesting and captivating and what's more you could understand his feelings to really feel like you know a character is hard to achieve from the writers point of view to find the right actor to pull it off is an art in itself and both were achieved here <UNK> over br br <UNK> who else could have played <UNK> there is no one that can play this part so well there is a style there unlike any other something you love to watch i found myself waiting for her to appear on screen and not because the rest was bad oh no but because <UNK> character was again so on the line without crossing it that it was excellent to watch br br and what's more a happy ending with new found friendships no one getting hurt and everyone getting what they wanted in life without a big hunk of cheese tied on the end br br brilliant script brilliant idea perfect cast great film
<START> even from the very <UNK> title of this movie i really love the artwork and <UNK> <UNK> of one of the national islands of japan we see some great rolling green hills and some oriental houses of a <UNK> town instantly we are looking at the pacific beauty on the widescreen of the theater and to prove how great this film is i have to say that charles <UNK> would be proud teachers of evolution classes and school <UNK> such as <UNK> would fantastically favor <UNK> miyazaki's brand new movie entitled the title character as you will see may be the perfect animation icon of media to be represented in all <UNK> and <UNK> alike br br besides the scientific aspect of all this let's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story we have a skinny old and powerful <UNK> named <UNK> who lives in a and is cynical of the urban <UNK> of mankind and their <UNK> of industrial waste he wants to have complete control of the <UNK> and the cute looking peaceful <UNK> life including fish and <UNK> <UNK> whose blood is composed to be half human and half <UNK> resembles both an ocean loving anti hero and antagonist similar to the james bond villain <UNK> in the spy who loved me who <UNK> an atlantis dubbed underwater city br br his daughter whom he treats like an over cared for pet is named she is a large <UNK> who already looks like a pretty red haired girl the father <UNK> her from the real human world claiming it to be dangerous and too much for her to handle but quite frankly <UNK> curiosity is as strong as her <UNK> nature eventually with building strength similar to wonderful scenes from nick <UNK> chicken run she breaks free of her father's rocky and <UNK> <UNK> city and <UNK> to the water surface of japan and to her luck and joy falls into the caring hands of a <UNK> ship <UNK> captain named br br living in an ocean front house at a neat looking beach or <UNK> filled beach has two <UNK> parents a senior home working mother lisa and the first mate of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lisa seems to be angry at her <UNK> for being away on a ship and leaving her with all the <UNK> even more so the black magic that is <UNK> by causes an apocalyptic chain of events to occur the moon approaches the earth too closely and waves <UNK> from the of the <UNK> interaction forces and <UNK> <UNK> waves rack the peaceful but <UNK> town however what seems to <UNK> this curse and seems literally more powerful than supernatural might is the love and tightly <UNK> friendship between the childish captain and the adorable red headed who wants to be a sensitive human than just a <UNK> fish much like the haired and free spirited <UNK> in the lord of the rings <UNK> me a slight reminder of that br br i could write on and on about this amazing animated film the best since <UNK> which was in theaters in <UNK> and right now <UNK> miyazaki feast your eyes on another 10 star grade from your animation fan graham abraham the year 2009 may be filled with dozens of animated films however is the most <UNK> film of many <UNK> <UNK> and should be dedicated as a new wonder of the world
<START> first off to rent or watch this film you are expecting something in the b horror range what this film delivers for the <UNK> fan of this genre is quite a hilarious romp via <UNK> flavor at times reminding me of the humor of jackson's dead alive and others of a stuart gordon flick this little find should have most <UNK> throughout br br the f x reach a few <UNK> of truly spooky the first time ed meets his nemesis but generally have the feel that this film was put together by a f x team that decided to use any and all props at their <UNK> from other films <UNK> <UNK> slasher films etc to pretty good effect and worked in thru the use of hallucinations br br the gem of the film is the humor the gore works most of the time but more for laughs at its heart its a parody and a fun one at that
<START> be prepared for the trip to <UNK> la <UNK> the psychological sickness of the main character wonderfully played by <UNK> goes beyond any limit you could expect the most stunning part of it is that you start feeling compassion for the character erika trash sexuality no <UNK> scenes though <UNK> <UNK> incestuous relations <UNK> gives us a crude meal heavy to <UNK> sometimes the only way you can escape the <UNK> of some scenes is to start laughing at it the <UNK> en is maybe not the most appealing part of the movie it has obvious <UNK> <UNK> sometimes <UNK> notes static long scenes but never boring the vienna settings the french language used make the whole look like a european blend the permanent <UNK> music background <UNK> is beautifully chosen above all both of the cannes awards for best actors are well deserved one of the greatest performance of the year by one of the greatest french actress ever
<START> this film centered on a young lady who makes <UNK> to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life it made me think of other movies like the song of <UNK> and francis of and has a very strong catholic faith influence in the film ann <UNK> is very charming as first the catholic school student and then later as a young woman who buys a statue of saint anne which is the name of the street that i live on by the way and makes many <UNK> for the whenever problems come up in her life frances aunt <UNK> from the andy griffith show and edmund <UNK> from miracle on <UNK> street play relatives of her a local priest of mine used to say that my sister <UNK> ann <UNK> and the both of them have the same first and middle names a nice good family film that came from an era when life was a bit more simpler
<START> spoiler alert it just gets to me the nerve some people have to remake and i use the term loosely here good movies in the american version of this dutch thriller someone decided the original ending wasn't enough for american audiences so what do they do they create a new one a stupid improbable i pretend i'm dead but come to life again so the good guy can kick my butt some more kind of ending do yourself a favor and get the original one
<START> i served as a at <UNK> island in the late 60's a little over 10 years after the d i was shot i was in some of the <UNK> where they filmed some of the <UNK> scenes i knew a lot of <UNK> <UNK> and a lot of <UNK> i think the movie is as close as any movie to showing the life of a <UNK> and that of a <UNK> <UNK> without a doubt i think it is the best thing jack <UNK> ever did if you have been in the military you need to see this movie this was the way it was it shows how important it is to take a bunch of raw <UNK> and turn them into men ready to defend our country one feature i found fascinating is that most of the characters are played by real marines not actors
<START> bad editing bad production values bad continuity implausible bad dialogue this movies is bad bad bad however if you want a movie to poke fun at a la <UNK> this is your movie i wouldn't suggest spending much money on it but if you do see this movie make sure it's with plenty of witty like minded buddies
<START> if this film doesn't at least be selected for an oscar <UNK> for best foreign film i'm going to stop waking at nights watching the event <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> that money isn't the key to making a good movie but originality out of a cold country comes a warm but thought provoking film of a mentally ill man and his struggle against an insane world after an insight like this you question whether or not the man is crazy or the world he lives in
<START> there's a good running bit about the price tag of a <UNK> <UNK> the bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for 22 <UNK> of tag later mary <UNK> finds the tag in the <UNK> bedroom proof that bimbo slept with him still later mary <UNK> is about to have an affair with <UNK> cortez looks at the price tag of her <UNK> <UNK> 14 and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo as well as the fact that she's spent 8 less than the most obvious woman she's ever met it sounds an obvious morality turn but it was well done the film would be stronger if robert character had been played by a more powerful actor he's too low key for a self made salesman and he spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera and if <UNK> cortez had been given more to do than smile ironically both male leads are bland and forgettable and are <UNK> by the <UNK> male makeup so popular in this film's era however the mary <UNK> character is interesting appealing and believable behind closed doors is well worth seeing
<START> like a lot of people i loved the original american <UNK> was one of the great movies of the 70s the sequel more american <UNK> is a horrible depressing mess of a movie it wasn't funny the wide eyed likable characters had become cynical and jaded and the stories were contrived such as <UNK> character having another brother because richard dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and terry the <UNK> and <UNK> joe somehow managing to serve together in vietnam they even have a police officer by the name of harrison ford's character in the original who makes a cameo he doesn't even look like harrison ford who was way too big a star by 1979 to even bother with this garbage br br the <UNK> word here is funny this movie isn't even amusing debbie candy clark is a stripper mixed in with a bunch of <UNK> hippies and trying to <UNK> her dealer boyfriend out of jail steve and laurie ron howard and cindy williams the <UNK> in the original have two kids and have become an annoying <UNK> couple adorable little <UNK> carol <UNK> phillips has become <UNK> yet another hippie child john <UNK> paul is a loser race car driver whose fortune was <UNK> at the end of the original even <UNK> jack whose voice was such an integral part of the original and gave it such a great flow only is heard <UNK> br br perhaps it was different writers a different director and the complete lack of a cohesive story line that makes this movie such a dismal failure br br the episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere to be found in the sequel it was a movie that didn't need to be made and its best just to remember what a great movie american <UNK> was and avoid the movie with more in the title
<START> let me start by saying you know a film is poorly run when extras make the cover with that said anyone who says this is the worst film ever is being dramatic and anyone who says that the film is great is completely <UNK> the film is what it is and what is that a modest budget 4 million i <UNK> studio sequel the film isn't terrible but for road house fans it will be a disappointment and that brings me to problem one just as dirty dancing wouldn't been what it was without <UNK> road house isn't the same without him the lead lacks depth character and <UNK> to carry the film i feel that the lead was poorly cast and the producers should have bent over backwards to get patrick to do it if they were gonna do a sequel the other cast was uneven with outstanding actors like will <UNK> along side day players who couldn't act there way out of a paper bag busey who i have seen do great characters seemed like he just <UNK> it in ellen was played well except for not being believable at all as a <UNK> raised chick <UNK> the <UNK> agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress yet her part was <UNK> small and undeveloped the writer totally missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters instead <UNK> for a base one dimensional film which leads me to the biggest problem the script i got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three script writers separated by an and and an it looked very amateur and that is what the writing was i heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard core sucking began some <UNK> parts of the film to watch for are during the first undercover meeting the obvious drug deal under the table hey lets meet at a crowded bar i will pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you pull cash out then we will slide them under the cocktail table wait make sure to look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking second i love it when someone gets shot in the chest and then you see him sitting up happy as a <UNK> 10 minutes later there are some nasty editing cuts towards the end of the film especially during fight scenes and when the main character is chasing thru doors and runs into a <UNK> which brings me to the realism of the <UNK> training i won't both to get technical but jumping thru doors isn't standard training nor do typical female agents who bust their <UNK> to make it in a male oriented field act like weak characters boring thanks for the <UNK> view heir director there is other stuff i could teach a course at a school about it the <UNK> up fighting the <UNK> dialogue the recycled story etc but aside from all that you just cannot like ex mr <UNK> he totally lacks the humble <UNK> <UNK> that made mr patrick <UNK> such a bad ass he just strikes me as one of those 5 foot nothing actors who think they are a bad ass but just like van <UNK> he runs into a real bad ass chuck in van don't case and he gives him a lesson about therefore that i feel is the major <UNK> of the film if you are a bad ass you are a bad ass you don't have to try example <UNK> if you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things then well you are why your audience the average joe will not rent this film and if they do they will write reviews like this
<START> the original title always struck me as a rather overblown definition for a bunch of gun <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> still their screen presence was at least <UNK> by a top quality group of actors to support <UNK> <UNK> most were movie stars in their own right br br however this first sequel was a pale imitation with a group now composed of largely b and c list players who were more mediocre than magnificent it was a similar set up had to <UNK> yet another team of gun <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to sort out the mexican problems again another <UNK> was giving them grief br br with the originality and <UNK> of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer the budget was evidently very limited this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the below par script which borrowed much from the earlier classic it was also more than half an hour shorter than john <UNK> original yet we still had a <UNK> of the <UNK> and <UNK> that made even the first a little turgid at times however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up was less <UNK> it failed to convey the broad <UNK> of landscapes that were a great part of the original br br generally it just lacked imagination the first movie had been a smash hit and this pedestrian sequel was evidently put together as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to <UNK> cash in on former success and it shows there's very much a <UNK> for <UNK> feel about it br br not recommended
<START> from the point of budget 2 <UNK> isn't very much when you look at the <UNK> <UNK> in this film that alone being the reason for the 9 week shoot i was really keen to see this film and had hoped to catch it when it came out instead got it on dvd recently my main problem is it's just not funny at all it's better than <UNK> d which hasn't got a funny bone in it's body but this was a truly disappointing film br br <UNK> <UNK> is a very strong physically performer but his acting sucks rachel gives what is possibly one of the most irritating and none funny performances i have ever seen the only really big star in this is david scott who's artwork for the monsters is <UNK> his special effects work is the main reason this film is worth watching loved the <UNK> and <UNK> and and the <UNK> monster was straight out of the <UNK> library br br if you watch this it won't be the biggest waste of time but if you are looking to see this for a great horror comedy romp don't bother
<START> this is truly a re make that should never have gotten out of the stable it has two casts that are acting in entirely different <UNK> at the top of their game are joan <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> every nuance of the <UNK> is in plain sight at the rock bottom are melissa gilbert and doris roberts i cannot imagine how <UNK> and <UNK> manage to play so well when gilbert and roberts are working their anti magic gilbert ruins every scene she's in it's like father knows best in the ghetto she's ann frank light her run at helen <UNK> was thin but not awful this is <UNK> doris roberts makes mrs van <UNK> merely annoying she is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose <UNK> <UNK> presence caused so much trouble in <UNK> this needed to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered what it was like to <UNK> her weight is not the problem joan <UNK> could have played this part beautifully roberts was on a career high when this was made getting lots of press and many opportunities her performance here displays her weaknesses as an actress <UNK> br br james <UNK> and clive have most of their scenes with gilbert and roberts and strong though they are they are completely incapable of <UNK> the damage done by their partners is a <UNK> actor capable of the kind of iconic performance given by ed in the original film he gets no support from gilbert she drain the color out of every scene br br i've read with <UNK> the comments by those of you who grew up watching this version filled with <UNK> to these performances it's a lesson in how the version you see first to you it makes me <UNK> my <UNK> to some inferior products i loved in my childhood i encourage you to watch the original it has very few weak spots and it's head and shoulders above this mess
<START> let's be fair there are no rules for <UNK> so i won't say the movie should be something other than it is i'll just state my opinion ok i really liked the script the way things are told and characters are introduced however i think when a play is adapted to the silver screen it could maybe try and fit this other media since this movie was directed by <UNK> the same man who directed the play it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical it's the man's first movie for out loud what i'm saying is there are parts in the film like the city of which slightly resembles the set of <UNK> de maria that feel like we're not at a movie theater we're at the theater lines are spoken too <UNK> characters are moving and the <UNK> is clearly meant for a stage sure maybe that was the intention but that's been done on stage wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie the beautiful closer for instance when i went to see this one though i didn't feel like i was watching a movie but overall it was a good one worth watching it's a nice love story funny at times and sad at others my vote is a 7
<START> owen david and chloe denise richards are a <UNK> couple living in manhattan owen is a moderately successful magazine writer while chloe is an aspiring actress happily for her chloe gets big role on a sitcom and <UNK> moves to hollywood missing her owen books a flight to <UNK> land as a surprise when he arrives at her set trailer however the house is shaking as chloe and her hunky co star are having a little romantic <UNK> the writer and the actress are through hurt and mad as a <UNK> owen goes back to nyc sympathetic friends decide to set him up on a blind date with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to get him out of his <UNK> <UNK> but it goes badly as the duo mix like oil and water mostly due to each having a strong personality and <UNK> huge shoulder chip yet over the next few months astonishingly <UNK> and owen become pals who <UNK> in each other and hang out can it turn into something more well who the heck cares this film is so stupid that most folks will <UNK> it out of the dvd player after the first ten minutes the script is pathetic dismal and oh stupid too then again gives a very obnoxious and offensive performance as well <UNK> is not much better but who could look good with the lines she has to <UNK> william baldwin too reaches a career low with his crude and sex crazy role as <UNK> brother the only cast member who is any good is richards but she must cringe when she looks back at this one okay the costumes and production values are adequate then too there is one clever element in that occasionally the characters will speak their lines but cartoon <UNK> will appear above their heads with the words of what they are truly thinking that doesn't save the film from bomb status don't be stupid dear film and <UNK> lovers do not rent buy or borrow this gigantic turkey i am the stupidest person on earth today for watching this thing until the bitter end
<START> if you have enjoyed the <UNK> effect <UNK> <UNK> or the <UNK> you will enjoy k <UNK> too br br to me this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end spacey delivers a great performance as also lets not forget the appearance of <UNK> williams in the movie who i am a big fan of br br after watching it i recommended the movie to lots of my friends and everyone was pretty much blown away br br but still it is very underrated maybe because of the lack of action and explosions i'm sorry this is not a movie about blowing things up it's about how humans behave and how people live in worlds that don't exist br br go on and enjoy
<START> the one who says that lucio fulci is not one of the most important names in the history of splatter is probably mad the italian director is a legend among hardcore horror fans and his work <UNK> the <UNK> of the genre who can forgot his western crime or fantasy flicks this is probably his <UNK> film and unfortunately one the last a horror director fulci as himself starts <UNK> about gruesome murders he goes to a psychiatrist who makes him believe he is the criminal in this time the doctor begins a long chain of serial crimes with such a plot the movie should have been filled with something and there are corpses crashed or <UNK> heads <UNK> <UNK> chainsaw <UNK> and many others kind of boring sometimes the film is saved by the excessive violence that will definitely please the gore <UNK>
<START> i awarded this presentation 4 stars they are all for the script which has been butchered beyond recognition in places what can possibly be said they took one of the finest plays written in the last century and <UNK> robbed it of its heart humor and humanity i don't really blame the actors who are probably doing their best with shoddy direction and <UNK> characters because the very complete characters of the stage version have had their <UNK> and insights ripped out i do very much blame the director who seems to strain to find ways to <UNK> the script there are so many awkward pauses <UNK> re staged moments and <UNK> re imagined line <UNK> in this tv movie that at times i forgot ever loving the play i'm not one of these people who thinks that genius plays are automatically inferior on film quite the contrary but this particular genius play has been tremendously under served by this outing now i hope they'll make a real film of this play the world deserves it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was the most successful karate master of the late 20th century he rejected the training of the karate <UNK> of the time focusing on an intense no holds form of training he eventually built his system into a huge business empire with hundreds of schools across the world without <UNK> his <UNK> the testing in the schools are still some of the most physically challenging <UNK> any martial art school requires one non physical <UNK> <UNK> faced was prejudice due to his korean <UNK> and he spent time proving that <UNK> were to japan and japanese karate this movie series was part of that effort although anyone who had the chance to meet <UNK> i did would never question his <UNK> to japan in this series most famous student sonny chiba is called upon to portray his master br br <UNK> arrives from the countryside where he has been training alone he challenges and makes short work of the established karate schools he encounters disgusted by the state of karate <UNK> returns to his lone training he eventually picks up a student falls in love and gets in the way of gangsters who are allied with the established karate schools in the middle of this is the legendary <UNK> with a mad bull how much of the film is true is questionable br br that <UNK> could kill a bull with his bare hands is true he was called on to repeat this feat numerous times there are filmed instances of <UNK> actually doing this although sometimes the <UNK> seemed to be <UNK> as <UNK> was getting on in years sonny chiba portrays his master with conviction and the karate is quite good chiba may not have been the best karate <UNK> but at this point in time he was certainly above average br br as a whole the movie is good much better then most martial art films in the drama department i always wondered why it's not more well known possibly it the very realistic depictions of martial arts people are shown getting tired and hurt unlike 99 of action film where the hero is a <UNK> <UNK> of energy and each blow instantly <UNK> an <UNK> to death chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch perhaps viewers rather not have their entertainment reflect reality so closely br br recommended especially for martial artists
<START> curse of the wolf starts as reluctant werewolf <UNK> <UNK> manages to escape from her into the city where 6 months later she is working in a <UNK> the rest of pack are unhappy want her back their leader michael todd says she will come back to them but fat werewolf franklin brian <UNK> picks her <UNK> up the pack decides to force the issue get her back using her affections for her human friends including her boyfriend danny dennis <UNK> can <UNK> save danny finally rid herself of her werewolf <UNK> i doubt you will care br br executive produced written directed by <UNK> who also had a fairly large role in the film as stick i was <UNK> watching curse of the wolf since was the man behind swamp zombies 2005 which is surely one of the worst films ever made ever unfortunately my worst fears were confirmed one has to say that curse of the wolf is a truly horrible film in every way both <UNK> technically curse of the wolf is the sort of film where the low budget <UNK> what happens the script rather than the script <UNK> the budget you get the impression that everything was written conceived to take advantage of the few sets actor's they had you can almost imagine the makers saying we've got a few actor's some basic equipment a couple of locations so lets make a horror film around them the story is awful michael finds the location of <UNK> by looking at a large dog two women are taking for a walk the character's are awful a big fat werewolf guy who <UNK> a lot the dialogue is awful just about every line in the thing there's never any motivation for anything that happens why are the pack so desperate to get <UNK> back people just do seemingly random things since director background is in martial arts he insists in <UNK> lots of random martial arts fight sequences into the plot no <UNK> but this is meant to be a horror film not a martial arts one isn't it in fact apart from the presence of a few werewolves you would be hard pushed to describe curse of the wolf as anything approaching a horror film at almost two hours in length it feels like it goes on forever is so slow <UNK> it's just not funny br br director was obviously working on a low budget but film making this bad should be a crime there's no continuity between shots the fight scenes look awful are so poorly staged it's untrue it's sometimes impossible to follow what's going on be it because of the choppy editing poor camera angles or the fact that it is sometimes so dark that you literally can't see a thing seriously there are times during curse of the wolf where the screen is totally black you can't see a thing i would hate to have to sit through this watching it on a fuzzy low resolution vhs the sound is awful too you can hear the wind <UNK> against the <UNK> there are also lots of other unpleasant <UNK> <UNK> sounds during just about every scene did the production actually have any lighting gear while making this it doesn't feel like it the special effects mostly consist of werewolf <UNK> that look like the sort of thing <UNK> sell at halloween for the kids basically they look awful br br technically curse of the wolf is as bad as they come i'm sorry because i know this had a low budget but it's truly horrible to sit through try to garner some entertainment from this is high school film student quality i'm sorry if that sounds <UNK> but it's a fact the acting is well you can probably guess so i'll stop myself right here before i say something else negative i mean i've done enough of that already i really take no pleasure in it br br curse of the wolf is terrible both <UNK> technically this is a real chore to sit through curse of the wolf is the type of film where while your watching it time seems to stand still it's the type of film that lasts for almost two hours yet feels like two years one of the worst films you or i am ever likely to see definitely one to avoid
<START> the fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and of course more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie the story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from <UNK> the ending out in one moment you think that something happens to coach jones or radio well it does but certainly not what you'd expect br br the film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by ed harris cuba gooding jr are some of their best in my opinion the ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right well i guess that was what michael mike rich were trying to do first class movie br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie the only sci fi part is the <UNK> <UNK> living in the present day br br elephants are attacking <UNK> in a part of india and these attacks are also killing people an expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this an american hunter blames these elephants are being frightened by <UNK> <UNK> which are suppose to be <UNK> nobody believes him at first but they do when the <UNK> appear at the end an <UNK> finishes them off br br the jungle was shot on location in india and has a lot of nice scenery and some good indian music including some songs which keep the movie moving along nicely the <UNK> are actually real elephants with fur <UNK> and long <UNK> stuck on br br the cast includes rod cameron <UNK> romero the lost continent and marie <UNK> cat women of the moon br br the jungle is worth seeing just for the scenery and music very enjoyable br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> i wish i could find some good things to say about this animated sequel but not really a sequel to atlantis the lost empire but this would be a very short comment the magic that the first one had is nowhere to be found here the animation is pretty poor all over the characters themselves are not very well drawn the backgrounds and the <UNK> are also not good there's very little attention to detail here and instead of a compelling and engaging story we have 3 short stories which are boring and don't make a lot of sense i swear even the characters sounded like they were bored and would rather be somewhere else which says that the voice actors were bored and wanted to be <UNK> else at least that's the impression some of the same actors return for this dismal effort but an integral par of the success of the first one was michael j fox as the main hero milo <UNK> i get the distinct impression this movie was just thrown together to capitalize on the success of the first one without much thought or care but at least <UNK> summer returns as the voice of <UNK> that's probably the only good thing about this movie and even she doesn't seem to have her heart completely in it mind you i guess you couldn't blame any of the cast for not giving their all considering what they had to work with or rather not work with this is a straight to video movie and i use the term loosely which should have went straight to the nearest <UNK> anyway shame on disney <UNK> deserve much better than this this one gets a 0 10 and a well deserved one at that p u
<START> i picked up a dvd at the <UNK> having no idea what it's about but at that price i can't resist in brief i was positively surprised br br so much that i did quite some research on the german dvd part 2 of a series of 3 episodes were into two 85 minute parts and out of order here are my results based on episode list br br <UNK> is in my boots the voice final episode br br war of the machines is <UNK> high water 1 2 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> down br br well what can i say <UNK> are of course interesting for older men i never watched charlie's angels so much so i can't compare but the more i watched the less i looked out for bikini tops and their <UNK> instead the characters both m and f became more interesting i can imagine <UNK> have their fun with this too all in all maybe a guilty pleasure but a pleasure it was
<START> very slow dull enigmatic film maybe the kind of film jean luc godard would have made had he been italian certainly conveys how tedious <UNK> <UNK> and empty a person's life can be but i don't usually go to the cinema to find that out the plot such as it is doesn't convince why a gorgeous hotel <UNK> an exception to the <UNK> of the film would be the slightest bit interested in a moody chain smoking silent loner who speaks in <UNK> <UNK> me very difficult to feel any sympathy with the main character one feels like shaking him by the throat and telling him to out of it ' his brother is a much more human character the ending is <UNK> and puzzling everyone in the cinema when i saw the film went out <UNK> about how they nearly fell asleep of course it shouldn't have to be a hollywood bruce willis style em <UNK> and but a little bit of energy and action would have made it a lot more thrilling one of the best italian films ever an art house curiosity at best
<START> a touching movie it is full of emotions and wonderful acting i could have sat through it a second time
<START> ok ok i must say i was impressed it's hard to say what i'm more impressed with my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch so that i don't <UNK> my eyes out or the movie itself either way <UNK> was pretty darn good hey it was good enough for me to watch twice will smith was funny and good kevin james was just hilarious and absolutely essential for the movie as much as this movie centered around <UNK> will smith without kevin james it's just not the same br br the story is <UNK> is a match maker that helps the guy woo the girl his job is to create the chance for the girl to notice the guy when she otherwise wouldn't after the encounter the rest is all up to the guy to make or break the relationship he works on only and stays largely <UNK> during the process albert kevin james is <UNK> project this time around and albert has eyes on cole <UNK> a paris hilton type figure while that plot unfolds <UNK> himself has eyes on sara eva <UNK> a sharp independent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that wants nothing to do with a relationship br br the two stories make for some funny moments and they tie together for a bit of a <UNK> of course no love story is complete without the obligatory <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> to send the guy chasing after the girl fortunately they make it brief and <UNK> was a fun and funny movie that <UNK> very well and rolled along without a <UNK>
<START> i bought the dvd a long time ago and finally got around to watching it i really enjoyed watching this film as you don't get the chance to see many of the more serious better quality bollywood films like this very well done and but i would say you need to pay attention to what is going on as it is easy to get lost when you start watching the movie don't do anything else i would actually advise people to read all the reviews here including the ones with spoilers before watching the movie <UNK> gave her first great performance that i have seen <UNK> was easily at her best all performances were strong directing and cinematography go watch it
<START> an annoying group of ex students from <UNK> international high <UNK> decide to spend a night in the now abandoned institution where a <UNK> killer called the <UNK> played by horror legend paul naschy murders them off one by one school killer features some references to such teen slasher <UNK> like scream or friday the 13th the climatic twist ending looks like from the sixth sense the <UNK> about whether the homicidal <UNK> is alive or dead provide some mild interest but the characters are one dimensional and the endless scenes of walking through dark school corridors really got on my nerves the presence of charismatic paul naschy almost saves this clichéd slasher flick there is also some decent gore on display including a <UNK> bloody <UNK> it's nice to see of <UNK> fame in a small role 4 out of 10
<START> this movie had reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad more true to life characters looking for love being in love and <UNK> it old story fresh view <UNK> <UNK> was so cary grant in style as the character may have been in a situation but the actor kept him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut out long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough almost like a hepburn this is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black man br br this movie is a classic superb acting well written a real love story set in chicago what more can you ask for br br superb black love story
<START> well my dad drove lee evans back and forth the <UNK> so i got to see some being made its a brilliant film bob <UNK> walked past a shed with a <UNK> and he accidentally let go and it went into a fence and he fell over br br lee evans was also funny as he seen me and said are you cold i said yes and he said well <UNK> your hands in your <UNK> i think it was really funny and it will be a well known comedy as like every other lee evans film they were really great people they seemed to be quite polite and funny i would like to meet them again one day brenda <UNK> walked out of her <UNK> with blood down her and <UNK> in her messy hair and i got really scared as i didn't notice her until she was right behind me
<START> i like all different types of movies so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes the matrix etc etc br br i just felt it was a lousy movie i don't feel that there was enough <UNK> of the characters to fall in love they were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe <UNK> and major issues in each of their lives richard gere and diane lane fall hopelessly and <UNK> in love it isn't realistic this movie didn't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot some emotional connection if someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly without any true substance than so be it you are neither right or wrong different <UNK> for different folks br br another very unbelievable <UNK> to the movie was diane <UNK> very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie does a teenage girl who is that miserable and <UNK> at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice this movie in a nutshell had some big names but to me was a major disappointment
<START> having seen the full length film <UNK> made out of this episode of the <UNK> years ago came back to this viewer as we watched the complete ten vignettes as with the other films this one is loosely based on the fifth <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> not kill br br <UNK> writing with took a look at the mind of a young man who commits a <UNK> crime in murdering an innocent person to <UNK> his own <UNK> this installment has a <UNK> character that kept reminding us about crime and punishment or at least some of the qualities of the novel are passed to the <UNK> youth who apparently has no redeeming qualities br br the story shows the young man as he <UNK> the streets of the city without a clear idea of what to do or where to go the only tender moment he displays is when he visits the <UNK> place to ask to have an old picture of his sister restored <UNK> leaves it up to fate to have the murderer board a taxi with the intention of robbing the driver but it's his anger and frustration that get the best of this youth to kill a man that didn't deserve to die the last moments of this criminal is one of the most gripping sequences in any film past or present br br the other element in the story is the relationship between the public <UNK> and the criminal nothing can prevent the court to <UNK> to death the young man the lawyer feels at the end he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he went wrong all he is asked by the young man is to retrieve the picture and send it to his mother br br <UNK> account of how he <UNK> the fifth <UNK> makes for a surprising film that will stay in the viewer's mind long after this episode is forgotten
<START> back in the mid late 80s an <UNK> anime by title of <UNK> crisis which i think is a military <UNK> term for when technical equipment goes <UNK> made its debut on video taking inspiration from blade runner the terminator and maybe even <UNK> with a little dash of batman bruce wayne iron man tony stark and charlie's <UNK> girl power thrown in for good measure 8 episodes long the overall story was that in 21st century tokyo japan year <UNK> living machines called <UNK> were doing <UNK> labor and sometimes cause problems a special <UNK> like branch of law <UNK> the advanced police ad police for short were formed to handle the <UNK> but were mostly <UNK> <UNK> millionaire scientist <UNK> the daughter of the scientist who made the <UNK> to create four powered combat armor hard suits to be worn by women to fight the <UNK> and fight the evil corporation that produced the <UNK> that group becomes known as the knight <UNK> and in addition to ring leader her <UNK> tag band of rebel women included a struggling rock and roll gal with a passion for <UNK> and a disdain for cops an <UNK> <UNK> with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends and <UNK> a young officer of the and expert computer <UNK> the first in a long line meanwhile is represented by <UNK> a tall <UNK> old guy who happens to own the company his younger assistant brian j mason killed in episode 3 and an annoying <UNK> man named <UNK> other characters included leon and <UNK> wong two ad police detectives leon appeared in a spin off prequel anime ad police files which i heard was very dark their <UNK> overweight boss chief <UNK> younger brother <UNK> and a funny little mechanic known as dr <UNK> who apparently helps with maintaining the suits aside from the overall knight <UNK> ad police vs storyline there was also another storyline involving a friend of who was apparently a daughter in a big crime family the annoying <UNK> trying to <UNK> and various wants revenge for a minor character story oh and did i mention that there were hints that herself might have been a <UNK> br br well it was a great watch full of chaos and mayhem and even some very nice pop songs but it was not without its flaws some of which unfortunately were due to the fact that the series was <UNK> after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in all so some of the <UNK> like <UNK> scheme or schemes the family of ill <UNK> friend and origins were never resolved another problem with the series was that at the time was the most popular character so a good portion of the series focused on her and unfortunately most of the oriented episodes basically focused on self <UNK> seeking justice revenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before but happened to be a friend of hers yet she rarely went out of her way for her the knight <UNK> who were always her out of trouble and for some reason cared a great deal about her well being just to be fair though she did go to rescue in episode 7 and her boyfriend got killed by a <UNK> and the acted wrongly in the investigation this meant we didn't really get to focus on the more interesting back story of or even the day to day antics of <UNK> and had two episodes oriented around her which <UNK> to her friend with the mafia family while <UNK> managed to <UNK> the last episode for herself which showed her eternal good cheer was genuinely good spirits and not <UNK> also got to put her computer skills to good use quite a bit or she sometimes just acted like a lovable goof which put her screen time and character development a few <UNK> above poor who was often thrust into the background with only her greed and her tendency to eat up boyfriends to get her any attention don't get me wrong i like it and i love the overall concept of it all but it did <UNK> me a little bit also this is one of those runner ups for worst english voice dubbing of all time features meaning you'd better stick to the japanese some of the voices were okay some really did match their characters <UNK> but others were just flat and <UNK> or in the case of really <UNK> br br well tokyo <UNK> comes along and pretty much <UNK> all that out the window set a few years ahead the story here is that after <UNK> <UNK> tokyo <UNK> <UNK> the city into a big old paradise except the <UNK> still have a tendency to fly off the handle which <UNK> the ad police to be formed followed by the knight <UNK> being formed so the overall story is the same but the <UNK> of the characters and the look and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot br br 1 originally had short <UNK> black hair and brown eyes was usually dressed like a stern proper business woman and was distant from others <UNK> has more of a super model look to her dressing more <UNK> and <UNK> white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light runs the gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray and also <UNK> is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies off the handle when she's not in public and possibly keeps even more secrets than before also doesn't take as much risk on the battlefield as she is more of a stay in the mobile pit type here but she does do battle when she has to br br 2 originally was a short woman with an <UNK> and a really bad temper always picking fights with people who offended her always biting off more than she could chew etc <UNK> however has gone the way of the clint eastwood loner very cold very stoic and emotionally distant more like the original you might say so she's not really attached to anyone also her hair is more and cat like a big improvement and she is clad in leather like <UNK> from the matrix although much less annoying than before unfortunately the writers screw her in the end when revealing her reasons for hating the br br 3 originally had this big black hair going for her but now her hair is shorter and well more 90s like <UNK> is also an office lady who has bad luck with being sexually <UNK> as if to apologize for the way she was treated by the <UNK> writers the <UNK> writers actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to writing her as a country girl new to the city but determined to meet the knight <UNK> and win a spot with them which she eventually does br br 4 originally a short red haired girl who was often the victim of <UNK> and ate a lot of candy <UNK> is now a short blonde haired girl who likes to <UNK> and take pot shots at detective leon revenge for him <UNK> with her in the <UNK> and other characters even her surrogate big sister and <UNK> brother whom she becomes <UNK> with and arrogant she still eats a lot of candy and is a master <UNK> but she is eventually <UNK> and grows beyond her comic relief status br br 5 <UNK> <UNK> is a new character a tall stoic <UNK> handsome man with long black hair he looks like adrian paul from tv's <UNK> he <UNK> dr <UNK> from the old series and now serves as the man who gives to hard suits <UNK> is also lover but you wouldn't know it by his demeanor he's kind of the father big brother mentor figure to <UNK> br br 6 leon and <UNK> are back but of course differently the original leon was a tall pretty boy built like a baseball player with <UNK> back brown hair blue eyes a black leather jacket tight blue <UNK> and always carrying a revolver that could magically pack more than a if necessary while he wasn't really a bad guy deep down he was kind of a jerk but he served mostly as comic relief as he tried to pursue <UNK> exactly what he saw in her is a mystery but occasionally he and <UNK> served as information <UNK> to important plot points also the original <UNK> was a fairly muscular red head who dressed in pink purple suits as he was a <UNK> homosexual character who was always hitting on leon when not providing important information in <UNK> leon is no longer a pretty boy but more your typical rugged tough guy type with <UNK> black hair brown eyes tall and sporting big <UNK> a brown leather jacket and blue he actually looks like arnold <UNK> a little bit or maybe a <UNK> up colin farrell or hugh jackman and he still carries a revolver a big one but it's not as powerful as before although <UNK> leon still has a bit of an attitude especially in approaching he's not nearly as much of a jerk as he was in the old series but he does have a bad temper and he is easily annoyed by <UNK> and <UNK> also he drinks way too much coffee oh and leon is still after but he has a lot more luck this time around <UNK> meanwhile is now a <UNK> but not as tall as leon more pretty <UNK> looking guy with red <UNK> glasses a white suit green eyes and light brown hair and he carries a big machine gun he actually looks like james <UNK> from the x men films <UNK> is a lot smarter and more <UNK> in <UNK> than the <UNK> and although it's not completely clear his homosexual <UNK> have been almost totally disappeared save a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears about leon <UNK> about e mail br br 7 brian j mason what does that j stand for is back and so is <UNK> but mason is much more the main villain here with <UNK> as co villain as he is no longer a <UNK> figure of terror but a <UNK> with a bunch of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> into him mason now sports <UNK> back brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the <UNK> he actually looks like <UNK> leon in a suit and he is very much from the alan <UNK> school of villains br br 8 though a <UNK> in the first series <UNK> is no longer a <UNK> in <UNK> of course there are lots of things different about <UNK> in <UNK> but they won't be revealed here br br 9 now has a companion an alfred the butler type named henderson who <UNK> about her and the gang br br 10 in the original series <UNK> were like the in blade runner armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions but in <UNK> they're more of the dumb monsters on the rampage type most of the time they're just big robots who do whatever they're <UNK> to do heavy labor combat clean up etc and they have this tendency to go rogue which means try to <UNK> and become a monster in the process br br what does stay the same is the theme of humanity vs technology do machines have souls sadly this series though well animated and well written only runs 26 episodes so it moves by faster than one might like especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters and unfortunately it still ends on a cliff <UNK> with <UNK> storyline bits which i will not discuss here what saves this show and makes it what it is however is the characters a colorful cast of <UNK> they are ranging from stoic <UNK> psycho women <UNK> mad men rough neck cops <UNK> <UNK> wise old <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> much more diverse than before and with a lot more to play off of they're enough to make you wish this show had gone longer br br it's not great but it's a good watch also the english dub by <UNK> is quite good though not without a few flat spots but certainly better than the dub on the original
<START> of all the movies in the history of movies i can't imagine someone sitting down and saying i want to spend x amount of dollars or pounds sterling to remake that flawed classic film called lots of stories have been turned into films about <UNK> coming to earth with something sinister lurking inside why not put your money into making a spectacular 3d remake of it came from outer space instead why look for a <UNK> <UNK> flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a <UNK> set of monsters and some naked <UNK> was the script for the 1986 version of so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time done correctly when you come down to it the only reason this film exists is to show off <UNK> <UNK> pie samantha <UNK> but if you're gonna make a skin flick and exploit sam <UNK> in it you'd better have her more naked than this and naked more often than this if you want to succeed br br meteor lands monster escapes <UNK> duff their clothes monster eats people and another what if ending ensues br br honestly i never thought i would ever recommend the original over any other film but this would be the one to come in 2nd place to it
<START> i remember this film as the other person that commented said i recorded over it but wish i had it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever funny in a real bad way i remember the tag line on the box was the ultimate frontal <UNK> i got it from my mom who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst <UNK> movie she had ever seen so my mom said my son will probably love it and the woman gave it to her just to get it out of her possession i then later taped over it which i regret i also remember the screw thing was one of those ball <UNK> things the yellow <UNK> shaped things with a red button at the end and when you hit the red thing it sends a ball flying well they used that with a <UNK> on one end and a <UNK> in the <UNK> when the killer killed they would show him coming forward with the weapon and then cut to a close up of what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victims head i don't know what else to say about this gem except that if you like bad films it doesn't get any worse than this
<START> spoilers for some strange reason oliver <UNK> talk radio based on the stephen <UNK> book talked to death and the films star eric play about the 1984 murder of denver talk show host alan <UNK> has never gotten the recognition that it so rightfully deserved the 1988 movie was <UNK> enough to recognize the underground movement that was developing in the farm and <UNK> of america a movement that <UNK> some seven years later the likes of an angry and disgruntled <UNK> war veteran timothy <UNK> who's hatred for the us <UNK> actions in texas lead to his and friend terry <UNK> <UNK> of the us federal building in <UNK> city on april 19 1995 that took the lives of <UNK> people the worst act of terrorism on us <UNK> up to that time br br the movie is as far as i know the first time that any major branch of the entertainment media mentioned and <UNK> on the rural <UNK> novel the turner <UNK> by the late william l pierce that has since become a chilling underground classic the turner <UNK> <UNK> a domestic and utterly disastrous terrorist attack like the <UNK> city bombing on a us government federal facility which was the fbi building in washington d c br br dallas radio station talk show host barry eric <UNK> is the top rated show in the dallas listening area and is now about to go national barry <UNK> his high rating by his razor sharp wit and abusive behavior when he's on the air taking on all <UNK> and <UNK> no issues no matter how <UNK> or taboo they are has gotten barry to be the most listened to as well as hated man on radio barry being a <UNK> at heart and not thinking that his talk can lead to violence keeps up his to his call in <UNK> as his rating go up to the but there are those in the listening audience mostly ultra right wing types that don't take too kindly to his in your face attitude one of them decides to take matters into his on hand at <UNK> expense br br <UNK> performance by eric <UNK> as the tragic barry who crossed the line from entertainment to hard reality in his actions on the radio thinking that he's not that important to be sought out and murdered for his on the air opinions which is enemies dislike he found out only too late that there are those out there who are crazy enough to do to him on the outside also in the movie talk radio is a very young baldwin as <UNK> boss dan who tries to have him <UNK> his tone but in the end goes along with his talk show style since he's killing the competition not realizing that in the end it's him that he'll end up getting killed br br both ellen green and leslie hope are the two women in <UNK> life his ex wife ellen and now lover and talk show producer laura whom barry uses to his advantage and almost ends up losing both of them at the same time the 1988 film talk radio is so far ahead of it's time that even if you watch it now in 2005 you still think that it's too disturbing to be shown to an over sensitive and delicate american public
<START> i just saw this movie on showtime in the wee hours of the night i was viewing the beginning with one eye open but instead of <UNK> off to sleep i became invested in this <UNK> nail bitter of a movie it was very believable and engaging i could have done without so much profanity as with every david mamet movie i see but thoroughly enjoyed the experience i know teenagers swear but i don't need to listen to it anyways the story had some interesting surprises which i won't reveal but if you have a chance to catch this movie on showtime i think you will enjoy it as much as i have
<START> my summary refers to the fact that this film has votes just 21 short of making it <UNK> to be on <UNK> infamous bottom 100 list the 100 lowest rated films on the website with a <UNK> score of only 1 8 this would place the film at approximately between <UNK> and <UNK> on the list talk about a very dubious achievement my score of 3 isn't that bad but it does bring the film that much closer to the <UNK> list br br as for the film it stars the once cute aaron carter yet another and forgettable pop star of the 1990s when he first broke onto the scene he was a cute kid with some songs that <UNK> to pre teens and <UNK> on radio disney his songs look and image were all <UNK> <UNK> and created by marketing folks and did the trick leading to some huge album sales unfortunately by 2005 sales were in decline and carter had hit his awkward stage of life something all kids his age have to deal with eventually to put it <UNK> he isn't cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life i assume now he's a gorgeous young man but in <UNK> he's no longer the heart <UNK> he once was here he is just very normal a death sentence for a kid in his position as a pop sensation br br interestingly the film has some appearances by some other ex teen heart <UNK> from the last few decades including a roles for david cassidy and <UNK> <UNK> two guys who also know what it's like to disappear from the <UNK> cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a <UNK> for himself while <UNK> is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke hopefully carter will take after cassidy in the future and so far thankfully he's managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many ex pop <UNK> i was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department it's not his fault he was <UNK> across the radio and television throughout the early to mid 1990s br br in this film carter doesn't exactly need to stretch himself he plays a pop star however despite making millions and being <UNK> by girls he doesn't have it all he's quite dense mostly because he has little interest in learning the problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school him forcing him to go to public school the problem though is that he is rather <UNK> about taking <UNK> and making the grade in school is difficult so he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to date one who would naturally be <UNK> to help him out in school he picks the cute but <UNK> jane <UNK> austin and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work br br this plot by the way isn't bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like the brady bunch or a <UNK> sit com sure it's predictable and you know that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt and he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her and by the end of the film all will be forgiven and they'll be a real couple but given good acting and competent direction this could be worth seeing for his teen fans as predictable isn't always bad and as it turned out this isn't exactly where the plot went but it was awfully close br br there are a few good things i liked about the film seeing tom <UNK> and stella stevens playing jane's grandparents was very nice their role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again also 1970s made for tv movie star andrew stevens appeared in the film it was nice to see him again though part of me hated him as he looks so great after all these years and i look ever bit of my 45 years he did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother stella br br as for carter with his many prior experiences on tv he was not surprisingly pretty good while his relationship with jane didn't seem very believable he and ms austin gave it their best the film wasn't great but they did try and i think most of the problems with the film were in the writing with a better and less formulaic plot it could have worked much better plus the whole angle seemed pretty contrived and rather insignificant who cares if a mega millionaire star gets anxious taking <UNK> in school overall not a rotten film as the current rating would imply though there isn't much here to attract a wide audience people who grew up loving carter probably will enjoy the film older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably haven't heard of him for them there is no nostalgia value in the film br br my favorite part of the film <UNK> <UNK> giving aaron advice i felt like screaming don't listen but didn't
<START> this was one of the most contrived tedious and clichéd films i have ever seen and yes i've seen pearl <UNK> even the likes of gina <UNK> couldn't act their way out of the appalling dialogue it has been described as <UNK> <UNK> this can only be a <UNK> for dull dreadful and quite frankly <UNK> why is it that when a film is devoid of plot critics feel it deserves to be called art but far more <UNK> why did america love it without you this film would have remained on the shelf where perhaps it <UNK>
<START> at last here's a movie that does as much for the <UNK> of the men of <UNK> and russia as <UNK> did for the those of mr affleck and ms lo from the edge of the city details the sad and <UNK> lives of some young russian <UNK> who live in and around <UNK> and spend their time <UNK> cars getting laid <UNK> woman <UNK> and <UNK> themselves but we're not gay because we don't do you know and if we do it's only once or twice with the same guy there is hardly anything here you have not seen before and better only the <UNK> locale adds a little novelty even then there's but a scene or two that's <UNK> writer director <UNK> 3 steps to heaven offer a relatively generic 95 minutes in which the standout moments involve how stupid sexist and from the looks of things pretty much <UNK> most of these guys are interestingly the <UNK> the guy the more <UNK> he appears what really <UNK> is the treatment of the women greek and russian males would seem to give the italians a run for their money regarding that famous madonna whore complex has life in <UNK> improved much for women since the time of <UNK> and <UNK> one has to wonder br br if i seem to be <UNK> russians and <UNK> in this review i apologize but even the non <UNK> <UNK> here the cab driver for instance are creeps according to another review on this site the film a hit on its home <UNK> was actually <UNK> by <UNK> for an academy award for best foreign film what this says about the state of greek movie making i hesitate to <UNK>
<START> i was very happy and at the same time quite surprised by other positive comments written by non <UNK> below this movie is amazingly and shows very <UNK> but view toward life which is typical to korean people i thought other <UNK> would not understand this delicate feeling and under rate this quiet film as a boring one but i was wrong the attraction of this film might be hard to avoid to <UNK> too even without <UNK> br br i would like to mention some points others have missed of course this film depicts love between a man and a woman however the very theme is way beyond that actually it is about time value of <UNK> and death in this film the focus is not on the <UNK> <UNK> between two people as some pointed out they do not kiss they do not hug each other even without holding hands so love itself is not completed whether positively or <UNK> in the film rather what <UNK> a leading actor is his impending death he's running out of time he can't hold it leaving a few behind including his father and of course a so the problem is how he can face the death and leave something valuable in his short life not how he can make love with br br this kind of theme sounds very familiar to us there are lots of movies regarding patients with disease such as <UNK> <UNK> however what makes this film outstanding is the way deals his death he is a loser but tried to do his best while he's alive in a silent way he does not tell anybody around him about his death he hides something in his mind but without rage hate vengeance he just tried to do best while he was alive this limited communication and <UNK> to fate is the typical mindset of <UNK> and the point most western people don't understand or at best <UNK> br br this theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film surprisingly his debut some say he's much influenced by japanese director <UNK> <UNK> who directed tokyo story indeed i remember i read in some magazine that the director himself admitted he was influenced by <UNK> i'm not that to analyze his style comparing to <UNK> but they have some in common and some not low angle and static camera especially remind us <UNK> style but in terms of theme again this korean director seems to have somewhat <UNK> and hopeful vision br br it is expressed <UNK> with last photograph very well done and really heartbreaking scene i think actually the director first had the idea of this film when he <UNK> the funeral of a very famous korean folk singer who died young of mysterious suicide they say he saw the photograph of the singer at the funeral and thought of a film on death and <UNK> and possibly hope for the <UNK> i think br br i highly recommend this film to anybody who has deep interest in film art as well as korean culture this film in my opinion can be <UNK> with other movies like tokyo story and a sort of american beauty it is that great if without language <UNK> dvd version is going to be out in the market this <UNK> so it might be a little help for <UNK> with english <UNK>
<START> sean bean returns as <UNK> hero richard <UNK> in <UNK> honour the fifth movie in the series and as always patrick <UNK> and the rest of chosen men are all along for the ride but this time major <UNK> is in serious trouble br br under the influence of <UNK> <UNK> enemy major a mysterious lady by the name of la has accused <UNK> of rape her husband arrives at <UNK> camp to challenge his wife's <UNK> to a <UNK> br br the <UNK> is discovered and stopped by the authorities and as a result <UNK> becomes the prime suspect when his <UNK> is murdered in the middle of the night br br as no one in the british army other than <UNK> and major consider <UNK> anything but a rough <UNK> with little or no honour he his given a <UNK> trial and is sentenced to death by hanging and <UNK> and the chosen men have no choice but to look on as their beloved commander walks slowly to the <UNK> br br however convinced of his innocence <UNK> and hang another convicted prisoner in <UNK> <UNK> and release him and his chosen men to find the real killer and la herself to not only prove his innocence but to find out her reasons for framing him in the first place br br micheal <UNK> and hugh <UNK> co star with brilliant performances by alice <UNK> as la and <UNK> as the villainous major in what is another exciting <UNK> <UNK> through <UNK> <UNK> journey through the <UNK> wars
<START> this is a cut above other movies of the genre genuinely suspenseful intelligent brilliantly acted and visually stunning yes the plot can be confusing but that's partly what makes it pack such a punch watch it twice if you can you'll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time br br don't be put off by the fact that this film comes from korea a country not too familiar to most western audiences while there are elements of the film that are <UNK> specific the underlying themes are all too universal guilt anger loss madness and <UNK> all of these are handled superbly by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> the lead character also worthy of particular mention is <UNK> <UNK> ah who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother br br while it has its scary moments this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it it's more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end and possibly beyond
<START> this film has some nice special effects <UNK> apart the japanese <UNK> to a degree that would humble godzilla the two leads also put in above par performances apart from that it is all a bit <UNK> in this understated disaster flick the <UNK> in the pacing are bizarre at one point we have sinking into the sea and snow falling on the rest of japan while <UNK> is buried under an immense <UNK> yet elsewhere in the country people are still <UNK> around <UNK> and <UNK> ice cream when another <UNK> rolls in also manages to travel great <UNK> without any <UNK> or even a in his cream shirt other people turn up with burns ripped clothes and mud <UNK> on their faces br br the of the film is both touching and <UNK> sacrifice in his final evening with <UNK> is a touch of <UNK> seldom seen in this genre these days however the ill <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the japanese psyche and the seduction of death and the fact that japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance hint at a darker paranoia that <UNK> japanese concerns regarding their status in the world br br sadly the final sequence is a rip off of edited with a cookie cutter br br finally my own particular bug bear the heavy handed product placement for <UNK> this time around it is mad or is he scientist who gets to be the poster boy for japan <UNK> at one point he manages to light up <UNK> <UNK> below the ocean surface in a <UNK> sub the size of a phone box <UNK> a break
<START> i can't even describe it it's the worst movie i've ever seen i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie just another big budget made to someone who doesn't like to think much it's not even scary it's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this thing to trick movie fans i guess big producers make whatever they want br br just get a big producer hot chicks <UNK> horrible actresses and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so and you'll get the nun br br and i thought bad boys 2 was horrible
<START> this is being commented on only because <UNK> 1953 may not of known at first just how powerful a score and how actually <UNK> these lyrics really are if you read the lyrics to alexander <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there is nothing here that is less than a witness through the song to one of the most beautiful and moving scores in all of musical literature this film with its accompanying score have a special place in the world and that may be just as true on the internet as anywhere the <UNK> own website which is <UNK> by his estate provides for additional care given such a score as this score truly deserves it is to me as deep as it is wide with such <UNK> that you wish to be the one the one they called great this is a song about alexander <UNK> yes it happened on the river <UNK> on the river <UNK> on the wide waters there we slew our of fighting men there pick of fighting men the army of <UNK> ah how we fought how we <UNK> them ah <UNK> their ships of war to <UNK> in the fight our blood was <UNK> shed for our great land our native russian land hey where the <UNK> was as an open street through their ranks a lane where spears ran we <UNK> down the <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> grass grown on desert <UNK> we shall never <UNK> native russian land they who march on russia shall be put to death rise against the <UNK> russian land <UNK> rise to arms great the call to arms goes on <UNK> to arms <UNK> russian folk in battle just in the fight to death <UNK> <UNK> people free and brave defend our fair native land to living warriors high <UNK> immortal fame to warriors <UNK> for native home for russian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> people russian folk in our great native russia no <UNK> shall live rise to arms <UNK> native mother russia no <UNK> shall march across russian land no foreign troops shall raid russia unseen are the ways to russia no <UNK> shall <UNK> russian fields here dear reader we are asked to live forever with the following <UNK> titled the field of the dead i shall go across the snow clad field i shall fly above the field of death i shall search for <UNK> warriors my <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> here lies one <UNK> by a wild <UNK> there lies one <UNK> by an arrow from their wounds blood fell like rain on our native <UNK> on our russian fields he who fell for russia in noble death shall be by my kiss on his dead eyes and to him brave <UNK> who remained alive i shall be a true wife and a loving friend i'll not be <UNK> to a handsome man <UNK> charm and beauty fast fade and die i'll be <UNK> to the man who's brave give <UNK> <UNK> to this brave warriors now to its conclusion with entry into in a great campaign russia went to war russia put down the hostile troops in our native land no <UNK> shall live <UNK> who come shall be put to death celebrate and sing native mother russia in our native land <UNK> men shall not live <UNK> shall never see russian towns and fields they who march on russia shall be put to death in our russia great in our native russia no <UNK> shall live celebrate and sing native mother russia all of russia came in triumph to the celebration celebrate and <UNK> russian <UNK> it should be noted that was under quite a bit of pressure from <UNK> to if you will make good this musical score was really very much <UNK> of by <UNK> to me there is a <UNK> beauty in how we love this world and <UNK> tells of a hero whose god like attributes provides for all participation in that love a truly beautiful and <UNK> telling of the story of alexander <UNK>
<START> used this documentary to push a stereotype of <UNK> this documentary is biased and guided not objective the cutting techniques that jump from interview to interview may be used to take the spoken word of <UNK> out of context when you watch the film the sticking idea that comes from the interviews of the <UNK> is that they are pretty dumb band members and other <UNK> seem to be of low intelligence and unable to explain their motives or give detailed or coherent answers or even answers at all i highly doubt that if some of those who were interviewed knew what was creating or saw the final product would allow themselves to be included in the project this film puts <UNK> in a bad light by making them seem <UNK> and simple minded film should not be taken as a representation of the l a punk scene if you want to see a good punk documentary watch another state of mind featuring youth <UNK> and social <UNK>
<START> its perhaps unfair of me to comment on this film because for the first time ever i switched off a movie because it was so bad i can watch anything but this movie was so very boring i was bored before i put on the dvd and thought this might be a laughable action horror action movie to <UNK> the mood it is not even that it is a device which <UNK> the level of boredom by the power of 100 had to switch it off after 45 minutes because all that had happened in that time was some people had been <UNK> diving and a big mole had been discovered seriously this movie is not worth the time even if you can enjoy a bad movie like i can avoid this film like the plague worst thing i have seen in years
<START> stylized hollywood westerns full of familiar conventions seem to have eternal life and this is an <UNK> everything in it seems to have been <UNK> out of the back of a <UNK> from 1939 a larger budget applied and this production its issue br br gary cooper has played this sort of role dozens of times the <UNK> <UNK> fast on the draw and firm with honor though kinda easy going whenever possible he plays <UNK> who travels to texas looking for the gang who destroyed his <UNK> plantation he wears a shirt and packs two <UNK> handled six <UNK> he speaks with a accent a could get hurt <UNK> this <UNK> sergeant york the gang is led by <UNK> raymond massey who buys and sells land usually by <UNK> means whenever possible the gang includes steve <UNK> who cannot play a <UNK> though he's very good at <UNK> <UNK> in general the requisite woman is ruth roman daughter of the mexican plantation owner who looks and speaks about as mexican as a boston brown betty br br i don't think i'll bother too much with the plot no doubt someone has gone into it in some detail and it's not worth much more mention as in any 1939 western it's <UNK> everyone except cooper and his friends are <UNK> and there are multiple double crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets br br everything is retro the plot the dialog the wardrobe even the music the score is by <UNK> <UNK> max <UNK> he's the guy that scored king kong that was 1932 this movie was released in 1950 br br <UNK> name by the way <UNK> <UNK> me to look through the records of the the real american cowboy to see if that name <UNK> up in their <UNK> which date from the beginning of time to <UNK> 4th <UNK> when the last real cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged there has never been a real cowboy with the name <UNK> yes but not as a matter of fact there is no record of any real cowboy named <UNK> luke cole or matt either the most popular names for genuine <UNK> in <UNK> order of <UNK> were clarence <UNK> noble and <UNK> br br if this movie had been released in 1939 it would have been routine in 1950 it is a <UNK> <UNK> in the history of human <UNK>
<START> based on stephen <UNK> a brief history of time this amazing film by morris documents the the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of <UNK> he has contributed more to science despite his <UNK> disease <UNK> than an able <UNK> scientist could only dream of br br the film begins by telling of <UNK> childhood and how he was a poor student that was <UNK> bright he <UNK> his way through college and university where he was <UNK> with the disease that would take away normal functions of his body but would allow him to continue living and thinking perfectly br br morris <UNK> how the brilliant mind of stephen developed from childhood to the present at one point his mother tells how when she was pregnant she bought a <UNK> <UNK> to read while in the hospital <UNK> himself <UNK> the <UNK> of his <UNK> while morris interviews close friends and colleagues whom have been lucky enough to <UNK> the magnificent man br br he tells how he was first intrigued by the discovery that the universe was <UNK> similar to how a star would expand we also know that stars eventually die and become what is now known as black holes if this is the case will the universe not too begin to contract <UNK> itself until we reach the big <UNK> as <UNK> puts it and when the universe does begin to will time not reverse when <UNK> this question i began to think that death may not be the end perhaps one day time will go backwards and our death will become our <UNK> and our birth our death the universe is one big cycle just like everything else in life br br this is what <UNK> is telling us everything in the universe <UNK> itself this is completely logical and can make your mind wonder in a million directions <UNK> it this is why i love this film and why it is a must see an 11 out of 10 morris never <UNK>
<START> i really tried to give this film a chance but when i realized that most of the film was being told by a bunch of boring officials walking around and talking on phones i knew it was over a lot of this film also looked like stock footage that's just lame br br the camera person kept like doing these quick short <UNK> for no reason it bothered me so much but i was just wondering why in the heck did they think it was a good idea it doesn't add anything to a static scene of two people talking this isn't <UNK> blue or some cop show or something br br how could they have not realized that telling this type a story from conversations of people in <UNK> rooms and what not is boring did they not watch this mess anyway this was just a really boring movie and it does make it seem like whoever made it doesn't understand good storytelling in film br br darn stock footage that's just wrong
<START> is it just me or is this an awful film i'm going with it's an awful film br br knowing full well that it's a guy flick usually defined as full of car chases crashes <UNK> explosions etc i still expect some small degree of credibility if i can't somehow believe in the premise the film will not work thus we come to the problem with assault on <UNK> 13 br br not one for spoilers i never report details of the plot however i will make an exception here because the plot is so inane bad guy is <UNK> in <UNK> 13 bad guy's buddies want to bust him out surprise the bad <UNK> buddies are actually corrupt cops brooding troubled but heroic young cop saves the day while <UNK> the girl ugh yes it really is that simple and that dumb br br assault on <UNK> 13 takes place in detroit not a bad setting for crime and corruption i spent 3 months there in late 2004 so i know what i'm talking about even so it's outrageously violent and insulting to the police and the citizens of detroit i have spent a lot of time in downtown detroit but i cannot imagine how the final chase wound up in the downtown detroit forest i must have missed it br br there are no <UNK> for watching bad movies save your money there were too many good films in 2005 to waste even 3 00 at blockbuster on this one br br final rating 1 br br only because i have seen worse films
<START> contains spoilers br br the british director j lee thompson made some excellent films notably <UNK> cold in <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> is one of his more curious offerings the story is set among the upper classes of rural scotland and details the strange <UNK> relationship between sir charles <UNK> an eccentric <UNK> <UNK> his sister <UNK> and <UNK> estranged husband douglas who is hoping for a <UNK> with her we learn that during his career as an army officer charles was regarded as having <UNK> moral <UNK> this appears to have been an accurate <UNK> of his condition throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy <UNK> with the world and his main sources of emotional support seem to be <UNK> and his <UNK> bottle the film ends with his <UNK> to an upper class lunatic asylum br br peter o'toole was when he was at his best as in <UNK> of <UNK> one of <UNK> leading actors but the quality of his work was very uneven and <UNK> <UNK> is not one of his better films he overacts <UNK> making charles into a caricature of the useless <UNK> aristocrat as though he were <UNK> for a part in the monty python <UNK> class <UNK> of the <UNK> sketch <UNK> york as <UNK> and michael craig as douglas are rather better but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film there is also little in the way of coherent plot beyond the tale of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> slide br br the main problem with the film however is neither the acting nor the plot but rather that of the theme that dare not speak its name there are half hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between charles and <UNK> or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part and that his dislike of douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy unfortunately even in the swinging sixties and early seventies the date of the film is <UNK> given as either 1969 or 1970 there was a limit to what the british board of film censors was willing to allow and a film with an <UNK> incestuous theme was definitely off limits the american title for the film was <UNK> <UNK> but this was not used in britain was it too suggestive for the liking of the <UNK> these hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what <UNK> charles or what has caused his moral collapse resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre 4 10
<START> maybe i'm biased because the f 16 is my favorite fighter aircraft although the f 14 is probably second or third but i liked this movie the sequels iron eagle ii and iii don't measure up acting and plot wise but the first one along with top gun have excellent flying and music along with reasonable plots and acting ii and iii clearly have much less of a flight budget but their main <UNK> is plot and acting i suspect the relative fame and popularity of iron eagle compared to top gun is almost entirely a reflection of the fame and popularity of jason compared to tom cruise another plus for me is an all too brief appearance by smith 7 10
<START> if anyone ever <UNK> a <UNK> on modern american horror that is truly worth it's salt there will have to be an entry for sf in asylum horror every time i watch this movie i am impressed by the complete economy of the film from the <UNK> totally self contained plot with a puzzling beginning and an all too horrible ending the engaging performances by what was essentially a group of non professional actors and a sense of dread and <UNK> that effectively <UNK> the with a certain <UNK> which is all the more terrifying because the viewers know what is going on long before the hero <UNK> with the only question being when are they going to wake up smell the coffee br br shot on a dental <UNK> budget in native texas at an old <UNK> <UNK> that nicely serves as the setting for a private <UNK> don't look in the basement is another intriguing twist on the good old edgar allan poe <UNK> about inmates taking over the asylum just before an otherwise normal <UNK> <UNK> joins the ranks without realizing until it is far too late that not all is what it seems they are totally cut off beyond any outside help and inevitably find their own sanity <UNK> as the madness <UNK> out of control the original star trek tv series had a go at this with their whom gods destroy episode from 1968 juan gave the proceedings a <UNK> <UNK> mexican psychedelic trip in dr <UNK> torture <UNK> in 1972 and <UNK> related is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> asylum <UNK> slaughter hotel which <UNK> the elements of an unknown killer and an ending that can only be defined as splatter cinema may not have seen or been thinking of slaughter hotel but he sure came up with some similar ideas br br former playboy <UNK> <UNK> plays charlotte <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> psychology who has just left her nice job as a <UNK> at a major hospital to travel way out into the middle of some god <UNK> waste right out of a <UNK> movie to work with a dr stevens at his private <UNK> dr stevens has <UNK> a new form of therapy based upon basically <UNK> the emotionally psychologically <UNK> to face their inner <UNK> bring them to the surface and hopefully rid the patients of whatever has fried their sense of reasoning nice idea but <UNK> a <UNK> 250 pound utterly insane man with an axe and telling him to pound out his <UNK> and then turning your back on him probably isn't the <UNK> idea and dr stevens is <UNK> before ms even appears <UNK> with a good <UNK> to the lower portion of his skull br br this event leaves the <UNK> effectively in the hands of one <UNK> masters actress <UNK> who also served as the script <UNK> production manager a woman of <UNK> professional demeanor who quickly <UNK> the situation with the help of sam the film's wonderfully unlikely hero a <UNK> african american played by an actor named bill who was sadly robbed of a supporting oscar nomination for his turn as a mass of muscle with the brain of an 8 year old boy <UNK> one wish is to have someone help him put his <UNK> toy boat in the water and his <UNK> asking of the various female cast members to do so and his <UNK> <UNK> of chocolate <UNK> as some kind of underlying theme though we will avoid such here because the kids might still be up there is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients but i'll leave the details of that to your discovery br br ms arrives just as dr stevens has been effectively laid to rest and is quickly won over by the snappy <UNK> of ms masters who reluctantly allows the <UNK> young nurse to stay on in spite of the tragedy that has just happened oh twenty minutes ago which you must admit was rather sporting of her nurse <UNK> begins to demonstrate <UNK> of not being the <UNK> meat <UNK> in the <UNK> however when informed that she shares living quarters with a bunch of <UNK> and there are no locks on the doors doesn't <UNK> off for the nearest ace <UNK> store to pick up a and to secure herself and we are treated to a couple of truly creepy scenes where some of the inmates sneak into her room do stuff like smell her hair try to kill her with butcher knives and <UNK> her neck with axe heads but that's all a part of working in such a radical psychiatric health care environment ms <UNK> informs her and she goes about her oddly defined rounds that consist of wearing as leg defining a nurse outfit as you can find in a <UNK> street fetish <UNK> and getting to know the inmates br br is a obsessive <UNK> <UNK> with homicidal who likes to take off her shirt provide the film with some t a between fits of <UNK> harriet is a young former mother who let her child die in a stupid accident and now <UNK> on a beat up old doll that she is also <UNK> protective of the is an actual and implied vietnam vet who's <UNK> led to the death of his platoon and now watches from the window with <UNK> for the approach of an unseen enemy jennifer is a fan who couldn't score a ticket to the new year's eve show and went insane likes to <UNK> down and other when nobody is looking and likewise has hidden homicidal linked to her inability to find a <UNK> judge cameron is apparently a homicidal <UNK> who became obsessed with his own sense of power and now likes to chop things up with <UNK> ms is an aged poet who serves as a sort of old <UNK> from <UNK> before the cat gets her tongue and danny is an insane idiot who was included in the cast as the random element that the plot cannot control and who's antics serve as the real <UNK> for the series of <UNK> murders that ultimately take place in this dark old creepy house in the middle of nowhere br br the house itself is a wonderful set with a <UNK> early 1970's <UNK> that is remarkable in it's with a fantastic use of color achieved by subtle <UNK> lighting the house is a series of <UNK> and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors <UNK> confined <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> leading to the different larger areas and of course the basement mentioned in the title visited only once but boy it sure proves to be a <UNK> i love the old <UNK> where sam keeps his <UNK> of <UNK> the utterly plain <UNK> that remind me of a summer home our family used to visit every year force us to in the heat everyone is covered with <UNK> of and looks exhausted and even the ever cheerful sam at one point begins to suspect that bad things are happening though he cannot understand what it all means and <UNK> h is too firm in her belief of her profession to even suspect what has really happened and while ms limitations of an actress may have <UNK> the <UNK> of her big revelation scene she's a great <UNK> when all hell starts to break loose and <UNK> of some nice camera shots of her in various suggestive poses or stages of <UNK> that show off what a pretty lady she is without exposing anything more than her contract too bad br br the real show <UNK> is sam however and fans of what i have been taught to refer to as splatter cinema will not be disappointed by the rather shocking finale and there is something moving about how sam runs to the protection of his friend and brutally kills everyone within arms reach in a matter of seconds that either suggests he was one mean before his <UNK> or the film is cut in any event you won't be prepared for the ending the first time you see it even though you as the viewer know what the score is long before anyone else in the film has put it all together br br except for one person <UNK> <UNK> stereotyped old <UNK> mrs who seems to be inspired by the donald sutherland old woman character from the michael <UNK> 1964 christopher lee film castle of the living dead in addition to a rather nasty death by round spike to the eye who not only <UNK> the future but has the film's most laugh out loud amusing bit of dialogue while on a walk in the garden with ms that runs something like this br br it's really beautiful out here do you get out much mrs asks to which the old woman replies br br it's you who needs to get out br br hilarious and one of those things you gotta kind of see for yourself to get don't look in the basement is available on at least a half dozen bargain bin dvd releases by companies like <UNK> home video diamond entertainment and <UNK> disc <UNK> 's horror classics series i kind of like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 6 release from 2003 br br dig through those bargain <UNK> but make sure you get one with the <UNK> 90 minute print contained <UNK> an older <UNK> minute version is downright confusing due to some of the and you really need to see the ending credits as intended to bring this sick twisted and surprisingly entertaining yarn to it's end br br masterpiece maybe not compared to the exorcist or rosemary's baby but it is a very uniquely american horror film and a genuine classic of the drive in age that deserves to be <UNK> by anyone looking for something made with more than just a little bit of brain juice and not a penny more than they absolutely needed br br 1 2 out of
<START> this is absolutely the worst comedy i have ever seen it's hard to explain though because unless you've seen this i bet you've never seen a comedy that was not good or bad it's just there that's the original part not good or bad just there br br let me say that i have seen every comedian appearing in a main role and like them all that's what makes this such a mystery the supporting leads are actually acting although the dialog is bad the only character that is fairly good is the one played by john goodman he does a pretty good job with what little dialog he has and actually has one funny line i won't spoil the only funny line in the movie in case you decide to watch anyway it involves a <UNK> the big mysteries are the main leads i won't call them characters because no characters have been developed this script is so juvenile that they don't even bother to give the leads fictional names they all just use their own they don't even seem to be trying to act it's as though they are all reading out loud to each other from scripts that the local junior high sent to them i actually wrote a paper like this for my english class when i was thirteen it wasn't funny either br br bottom line just don't bother to rent this it isn't funny it doesn't even have the kind of bad dialog you can <UNK> to i just sat there and <UNK> through the whole thing it was so boring i couldn't even work up any <UNK> at how bad it was i can't imagine how this is even getting a rating of 4 here
<START> why all the negative reviews you didn't expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece did you what we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me not an oscar <UNK> just entertainment you can really see how the movie has aged especially with everything the internet has to offer nowadays i still remember when this was first released and the net was still so new crazy and scary thoughts when i saw this for the first time i was 15 and seriously thought anyone could get a hold of your information on a computer and destroy you but who's to say it can't happen i'm not the type of person to <UNK> a movie to death <UNK> it until i'm blue in the face that's not my style average acting and once again very entertaining sandra <UNK> as angela bennett is so cute this is my favorite movie with her in it because she's like the computer genius which i find very attractive of all the movies that were released in 1995 this would have to be my favorite although i didn't see it until 1996 my rating 9 10 because it did slow down a little
<START> so you wanna be a rock star see this movie you don't like rock you say or you're really into heavy metal then put on your favorite album and dream yourself away this movie has nothing to offer rarely have i ever seen a movie being able to portrait the dream of being in a rock band as good as this i had long hair during the late 1980's and early nineties and i have played guitar for the last 15 years or so did i like rock star oh yes the music is good not great the actors are good and believable even jennifer aniston plays her part to perfection and mark <UNK> is perfect as the wannabe rock singer so you know what you're going to get a movie about dreams coming true being stepped on and finally <UNK> out what life is really about it's a good solid seven out of ten no more no less
<START> when oh when will someone like anchor bay or blue underground release this on widescreen dvd le which i only know because of my rare vintage video collecting habit is a film in my collection that i would not only sit through but actually enjoy watching the fact that <UNK> kinski is top billed but is only in small parts of the film means little to me though several comments expressed disappointment in his rather limited screen time i cannot say that this is a good horror film a good mystery a sci fi epic or anything of that nature it is simply <UNK> in the genre sense of things it is more like a confusing frightening though not particularly violent or bloody dream filled with great visuals and mystery it relies on visuals and emotion much like <UNK> lisa and the devil both films are beautiful in almost every sense but almost impossible to describe in a logical manner they both occur in such a dream like atmosphere don't be <UNK> by force <UNK> synopsis on the back cover it is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that though force <UNK> release from 1986 the only one in the us that i know of is <UNK> to full screen on tape even in that format it is still great releasing it <UNK> and or <UNK> would make it magnificent hint hint dvd companies
<START> like many others i had been attracted to the combination of <UNK> ford and scott thomas i had enjoyed the work of <UNK> and ford on sabrina a well made film and a careful rewrite of the old material on hearing that this film was in production i ordered and read the book immediately it seemed that this would be a more difficult story to film the characters are not always sympathetic there is little if any humor and the author makes numerous plot <UNK> to focus on his principal theme that since each would see the other as the only one sharing the unique combination of loss and betrayal brought on by the air crash the completely surprised <UNK> would seek each other out moreover he <UNK> that resolution could come to both through a bitter exploration of the hidden lives and that this experience of thick and thin could <UNK> a deeper love than each had previously although much of the book deals with their <UNK> and their building hatred of their former partners in the end acceptance and forgiveness are found the film script <UNK> only the air crash and the shared <UNK> of the <UNK> where the woman is the research <UNK> in the book it is the man in the film and the woman is never a willing co <UNK> the film has a completely new dramatic sub plot for harrison ford which seems even more contrived than the double coincidence of the air crash the <UNK> up for re election sub plot for the woman is also new yet it works better audience the expectations of pure romance or romantic comedy cannot be met because this story on a very bitter <UNK> where resolution and forgiveness is achieved in the book however <UNK> the burden of <UNK> from the reader and <UNK> <UNK> there is no <UNK> moment in the film although forgiveness is never hinted at we are left to <UNK> that healing following a shooting does double duty ford's character need not be such an <UNK> man of few words and scott <UNK> accent change is a little <UNK> at first this film is not the dead loss suggested by others it is however a difficult film to appreciate because the rewrite and adaptation to the screen is below the standard previously achieved by the director cast
<START> this is a pretty good thriller at a nuclear power plant in southern california that was directed by james bridges and stars jane fonda jack lemmon and michael douglas fonda plays a tv reporter who wants to be an <UNK> journalist but is only allowed to be a tv reporter douglas is an independent cameraman and lemmon is a <UNK> at a nuclear plant fonda and douglas are sent on a routine assignment at a nuclear power plant and an accident almost happens and they get it all on film everyone tries to cover it up except fonda and douglas so douglas steals the film lemmon starts to investigate and finds out the company cares more about profit then safety at the plant it's a good movie with a pretty good ending
<START> warner brothers social responsibility at its most ham handed with <UNK> every five minutes or so about how we're americans we don't run from trouble we face up to our <UNK> it also suggests that if you're willing to yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters you're un american walter huston looking bored is the frustrated da and the average american family includes such familiar faces as sally <UNK> looking a lot like her sister loretta young and <UNK> moore as an allegedly adorable <UNK> both are regularly crowded out of the frame by <UNK> sale only <UNK> then but playing an <UNK> civil war veteran <UNK> jumping and <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> about how we're americans his st dance old <UNK> performance is tiresome <UNK> it's like walter brennan based his entire career on it william <UNK> directs <UNK> and quickly much like his earlier public enemy but he and the screenwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after the happy <UNK> i e they'd probably be <UNK> out by the mob
<START> it's hard to comment on this movie it's one of the few movies dimension actually has not <UNK> it's hard to come up with a reason why and it was rushed into a an unimpressive 500 theaters it's opening day maybe dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature using his <UNK> truck to pull a house apart piece by piece br br ray <UNK> is just a <UNK> truck driver until he <UNK> a voodoo <UNK> from a bad car accident and in return he gets attacked by a bag full of snakes and <UNK> at the <UNK> ray comes back to life and stalks a group of teenagers who witnessed the awful crash occur br br what brings this movie down is it's paper thin characters i didn't care for one moment about any of them also the dialog was less than ho hum also it was very predictable characters did the typical stupid horror movie character things like check <UNK> noises call out people's names and trip on a rock while being chased i also could immediately pick out who the final girl would be and why did the camera have those quick white flashes whenever somebody died or whenever the killer was shown br br what's good well there is an impressive suspense scene where the killer walks underneath swamp waters to get to his victims and a tense sequence where the final girl must <UNK> herself with bunch of other dead bodies while the killer looks on br br but other than that it's another august september disappointment i was looking forward to it but i did not get what was expected
<START> don wilson stars as jack cutter <UNK> real tough name a vampire <UNK> who goes up against a vampire army you see the story is a little different because vampires can't be killed with silver crosses or <UNK> but rather through <UNK> their <UNK> how convenient as it cuts down on the budget and it's here cutter runs into a reporter <UNK> smith of <UNK> iii fame night <UNK> action sequences shake for no reason during the fight sequences and although it's meant to emphasize the mood it just makes the movie more jarring what is worse is that these fight sequences are <UNK> beyond belief as <UNK> martial artistry is disguised by disjointed editing of course the most interest comes from the fact that indeed this <UNK> blade however the problem is that this was done on a small budget and that it had don wilson in it it's from roger corman and basically this turkey is a movie most people would pay not to see i unfortunately am a bottom <UNK> and i <UNK> to the section of the store looking for gems in this line of work you always run into <UNK> with night hunter i just may have the world's turd br br 1 2 out of 4 awful
<START> a couple of weeks after i saw this movie it began to remind me of john carpenter's in the mouth of madness not for the story for the atmosphere the fast elements of surprise and the <UNK> sequences on the other hand this movie mixes very well the image and the music note the 4th chapter in the movie
<START> here is another great film critics will love the problem is that it is not a very good movie br br the films premise is simple nine <UNK> escape a prison after the <UNK> one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is br br the first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy br br the two <UNK> simply don't mix individual scenes do work very well the guys crashing a friends house who has a new <UNK> bride is hilarious while a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant <UNK> at the <UNK> they simply don't <UNK> with each other br br the movie as well is missing entire set ups one scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted <UNK> machine to buy a <UNK> the very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant where did they get the dresses and <UNK> the crew includes both the big guy and a midget how did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal and most puzzling is why are they in drag they are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women i mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other in fact they wear matching white throughout most of the movie the movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch as we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes br br speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film it is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie br br 9 souls is a big disappointment the reviews <UNK> about a great film and it's in there somewhere good luck finding it yourself
<START> this movie has lots of action and little heart let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the russian revolution wrong after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story in fact the <UNK> after world war i proved a disaster for the country and a <UNK> government tried to rule as a pseudo democracy until the <UNK> took power nine months later mainly because they promised to immediately <UNK> russia from the war now back to our story br br here we have the revolution being <UNK> in russian <UNK> in what appears to still be a <UNK> country until violence <UNK> suddenly and <UNK> the life of <UNK> baron <UNK> douglas fairbanks jr he <UNK> his home with his former servant girl nancy <UNK> in <UNK> and they start to make a new life in before the revolution the baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl not out of any real passion but out of boredom as a <UNK> of sorts the revolution doesn't change this and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl it certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him <UNK> with her so follows the baron because she literally has no place to go after the <UNK> take over the <UNK> home and she has known no other life other than waiting on <UNK> hand and foot once in <UNK> quickly of life as a <UNK> <UNK> and that is when he meets up with his former lover russian aristocrat vera who has a plan for getting them to paris where the have after the revolution unfortunately for <UNK> plan does not include her br br this film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early <UNK> actress nancy <UNK> she does a good job with what little she is given to do but that is not much is the standout here even though she has only a small role as russian <UNK> vera was so often given supporting roles just as she is here but her <UNK> voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears guy <UNK> even shows up in a humorous bit as an american tourist who is curious about the russian <UNK> that has been <UNK> <UNK> from their <UNK>
<START> this is a cheap o movie made by al <UNK> a man who was perhaps the worst film maker ever even possibly worse than ed wood jr <UNK> <UNK> in extremely low budget horror and skin films during the 60s 70s and 80s and with such titles as five bloody graves <UNK> bloody <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of lust it's obvious he wasn't making shakespeare his movies all had rotten production values <UNK> gore and amateur acting br br here in brain of blood several stock <UNK> actors such as his wife <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are along for the ride and had appeared in <UNK> previous film dracula versus frankenstein this is fortunate because the prior movie was so terrible and so poorly executed on every level that brain of blood can't help but look good sure the makeup is laughable the plot dumb it involves the <UNK> brain transplant scheme and acting is level z but it's still better than their last film br br about the only positive things about this film are that aging supporting actor midget <UNK> <UNK> actually had a better than usual part with more dialog and a more important role in the plot and there is actually some sense of danger and tension at times as for ms <UNK> she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limp through this silly flick however it's bad enough that it makes for good watching by bad movie fans you've just gotta see makeup on the guy with acid burns as well as the ray gun that appears to be made out of an old tail light
<START> this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen br br we are supposed to like and be rooting for an arrogant know it all trashy bank <UNK> played by <UNK> robertson and a <UNK> <UNK> played by the extra <UNK> beautiful linda <UNK> in a fire engine red dress she must have been into that <UNK> br br a senator in the film thinks native americans and whites should try to come to an understanding the <UNK> however win the day i could barely sit through the endless dialog of <UNK> that <UNK> from the other characters mouths br br except for wounded <UNK> and dances with wolves there are few films that give a positive portrayal of american indians and very few old westerns do this one is exceptionally bad in that regard br br the romance between robertson and <UNK> set my teeth on edge as he came <UNK> in forcing a kiss on her while she plays the old hard to get game br br there are scenes that are unintentionally humorous such as the characters obviously not really riding in or on a <UNK> in several shots br br a <UNK> humorous incident in the storyline is linda character going to great <UNK> to purchase tickets for the <UNK> only to then demand a horse to ride minutes later for no apparent reason br br another humorous scene is when the <UNK> comes to a <UNK> halt at the sight of a cowboy hat lying beside the road and not only that but then all the passengers pile out for a look see br br 1 star

<START> god bless randy quaid his cousin eddie in vacation and christmas vacation hilariously stole the show he even made the awful vegas vacation at least worth a look br br i will say that he tries hard in this made for tv sequel but that the script is so non funny that the movie never really gets anywhere quaid and the rest of the returning vacation vets including the <UNK> audrey dana <UNK> are wasted here even european <UNK> eric <UNK> cannot save the show in a brief cameo br br pathetic and sad actually painful to watch christmas vacation 2 is the worst of the vacation franchise
<START> you would have thought given how much this overblown pile of rubbish must have cost that the budget could have stretched to a decent scriptwriter instead they seemed to have <UNK> for a <UNK> standard hollywood by disaster movie plot and dialog the only cliché they seem to have missed was the cute kid but every other one is there there's the <UNK> hero <UNK> together by fate with both his ex wife and estranged father there's the <UNK> dad and the rebellious teenager there's the <UNK> that everyone thought was wrong until it turned out he played <UNK> by the normally excellent tom <UNK> seemingly in the grip of some powerful drugs plus the comic duo wandering about in the deserted underground <UNK> br br i sat down to watch this full of anticipation the cast is as noted amazing yet within minutes it became clear how bad this was going to be stuff this useless should come with a warning something along the lines of br br <UNK> film may have been made in britain but was aimed at the american market it therefore contains tired clichés stock characters stilted dialogue and a plot so lame <UNK> and simplistic that even george w bush could understand it ' br br avoid
<START> compared to the competition soul <UNK> 3 is a god amongst games a true piece of art however compared to its <UNK> bit predecessors the latest in superior slash em up series is over ambitious its attempts to improve on perfection isn't quite successful br br there are new <UNK> and game play <UNK> that i <UNK> for trying to elevate the series to new heights but they just <UNK> things examples well the character creation mode is a great idea in theory but in <UNK> is full of <UNK> and is no way as as that found in the wwe games for example the chronicles of the sword mode is fun and thought provoking for a little while but eventually drags on and a chore to earn money rather than a genuinely fun game also the tale of souls mode which is basically the <UNK> mode with little bits of <UNK> story and style bits thrown in really feels slow br br <UNK> you don't know what your saying is probably what the more <UNK> of you are thinking but don't get it twisted i don't hate this game this game is great its still got that classic game play although some characters moves have been needlessly changed absolutely stunning graphics and that epic soundtrack that the games are known for and also on the good side of things are the new characters particularly who are all cool in their own way except yes i know i'm <UNK> br br its just that compared to soul <UNK> 1 and 2 it feels like its trying to be much more than it actually is that doesn't mean that its not a classic it just means that compared to its own high standards it falls a bit short despite having more characters moves stages and better graphics than ever br br still soul <UNK> 3 <UNK> the floor with 95 of games out there though and that counts for something oh and all those who mark this review as <UNK> clearly feel hurt that i insulted their darling well listen up <UNK> girl she ain't real and even if she was she wouldn't be caught dead with you
<START> i saw 2 <UNK> at the toronto international film festival in september and was blown away by it a scene of panic opens this film at 2 <UNK> <UNK> set in an <UNK> high school this scene is left <UNK> as we <UNK> to the beginning of the day and are introduced to the teenagers getting ready to go to school the audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters and explores the day to day issues facing teenagers including drugs <UNK> being gay bullying and violence each scene is played again and again from different <UNK> perspectives and is reminiscent of gus van <UNK> elephant this is a remarkable film by first time director k it was made with non professional student actors and work <UNK> through an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a script it features stunning performances by a number of the student actors particularly <UNK> <UNK> in the role of melody this coming of age film is both intimate and thought provoking with a surprising and disturbing ending
<START> the beloved rogue is a wonderful period piece it portrays century paris in grand hollywood fashion yet offering a <UNK> side to existence there as it would be experienced by the poor and the snow it's constantly <UNK> about adding to the <UNK> of the setting brilliant the setting is enhanced by the odd cast of characters including <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br a brilliant performance is turned in by john barrymore <UNK> only by the magnificent conrad <UNK> who portrays a <UNK> <UNK> louis <UNK> to perfection and yes <UNK> picks his nose on purpose pushing his portrayal to wonderfully <UNK> limits
<START> a wonderful story that should be seen by all families the story acting and production values are all first rate i highly recommend checking out br br peter falk is marvelous as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die so he can continue to know how things will end and not be a member of the audience his three children rush to new york to confront him and try to change his mind there are of course <UNK> family issues to be addressed and the script and actors handle them well and with great humor br br the story is about a jewish family but it could easily be about any other family well maybe not a <UNK> family the siblings have issues with each other and also with their father i loved the writing and directing as well as the acting all in all a humorous and touching film
<START> <UNK> is a very funny entertaining show you shouldn't take all the show seriously but if you wanna have fun that's your tv show being made by the producers of <UNK> is a quality guarantee and <UNK> isn't that different from <UNK> the female warriors formula is brought to the future where they don't have to fight warriors or gods but dangerous robots which <UNK> in the surface and the humans are forced to live underground along the two seasons of <UNK> they develop an interesting and funny underground world and we get to know the three main characters <UNK> jennifer sky <UNK> gina <UNK> and <UNK> victoria <UNK> they all are different but as a team they work really well the three main actresses appeared previously in <UNK> like most of the regular guest cast there are some known faces from <UNK> too or from both shows i specially liked the character played by <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> which is very different from any of her roles i previously knew so if you liked <UNK> and <UNK> you'll love <UNK> if you don't know them try it i'm sure you'll enjoy it
<START> where do i begin i first saw this film in 1995 and had no idea of what to expect i was actually at the time searching out films that <UNK> wood had starred in and this one had come highly recommended i sat down and watched the film once and didn't know what to think i watched it a second time a few days later and the <UNK> just opened never before in my life had i ever really cried while watching a film and i was every high and low the film i was riding right alongside on an emotional roller coaster br br it struck such an emotional <UNK> in me on many levels the intense sadness and <UNK> we see in the film the wonder and innocence of childhood the yearning for a time that once was but is no more more than anything this film reminded me of my childhood except for the abuse during a time in my life when i'd <UNK> off my childhood some years before and not even really noticed i'd given it up and moved on to a life entirely devoid of it the radio <UNK> made me wake up and suddenly realise what i'd given up without really even <UNK> from that day forward i immediately set about to change my life and myself and i did br br this is going to sound corny but basically i <UNK> my inner child i started down a path that has been ongoing over the past 6 years and has changed me so much so much for the better <UNK> and living that part of myself i've been finding out who i really am i don't think it was simply a case of the right film coming along at a crucial moment of my life the radio <UNK> really did something very special and i still look upon it as an incredible piece of work in all respects an incredible film br br in closing i cannot fail to mention the music i am a great fan of hans <UNK> and this is among his very finest works the sheer <UNK> and depth of emotional expression he has put into the score of this film is a huge part of what makes the film what it is to me like subtitles to a foreign language film his <UNK> music is a <UNK> sheet to the intense emotions this film will take you through find the soundtrack at all costs it was sadly deleted long ago i never expected to find it but amazingly did after <UNK> with someone i met on a hans <UNK> guest book br br watch this film let yourself live the emotions don't get <UNK> in trivial <UNK> of the ending be that child again
<START> but i would be lying a relative was a crew member and we got to go watch the production of this movie for a couple of days and i was an extra i get to die and have a second of screen time not that i plan on moving to hollywood anytime soon i just thought it was awesome to see how movies are made and be a part of it plus i got a copy of the movie once it was finally released they didn't have a studio backing when making this film so it truly was independent why the writing and acting is so awful is beyond me but the main character <UNK> is the director's sister so that could be part of it but the cinematography was good
<START> although this was a low budget film and clearly last minute it holds a certain charm that is difficult to <UNK> i tend to believe it is the scriptwriter grant morris see dead dog who despite the <UNK> plot line <UNK> a fantastic slice of humour sorely missing in many of today's box office hits definitely a must see for a sunday afternoon <UNK> speaking as a true single girl and very <UNK> this film did not inspire me particularly but did <UNK> a small flame of hope for a <UNK> not my <UNK> so much as my slightly crazy <UNK> who lets her <UNK> sleep in her bed with her she may find someone
<START> four daughters a sentimental story of a solid middle class family with four sisters was notable in one respect into this romantic <UNK> <UNK> enters mickey <UNK> dressed with an <UNK> attitude to all <UNK> values he really sets the hearts of the sisters his criticisms are not only directed towards those about him but also towards br br one day ann <UNK> lane discovers him <UNK> playing the that's beautiful she <UNK> it stinks he he falls in love with  and marries  ann but eventually realizing that their basic <UNK> is leading their marriage into disaster he takes the equally <UNK> step of causing his br br the role was superbly played by john garfield and it brought him not only stardom but also and perhaps more important won for him his place in cinema history as the <UNK> first rebel br br garfield was born in new <UNK> east side of russian immigrant parents and spent his <UNK> as a <UNK> a real life role that he only when he began to portray the rebel on <UNK> he continued however throughout his life to question and reject certain traditional he was occasionally suspended by the studio and <UNK> a cynical view of br br finally he ended his career and his life as one of the victims of <UNK> he was <UNK> by hollywood because of his suspected left wing <UNK> and friends claimed that being banned from working contributed to the heart that killed him at the early age of
<START> the frozen limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as the crazy gang they were a group of british <UNK> who formed in the early 1930s in the main the <UNK> six men were bud allen jimmy teddy knox charlie <UNK> and jimmy gold hugely popular in the variety <UNK> the group were also <UNK> of the then royal family the plot here sees them as the wonder boys <UNK> who set off to seek their <UNK> in <UNK> after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper only problem is is that when they finally get to red <UNK> it turns out they are 40 years too late br br i often cringe when i see the statement it's very british because it implies that those not of the british <UNK> may struggle to get it the reason it bothers me is because in this www internet age i have garnered a <UNK> of non british film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of ealing will <UNK> and the <UNK> terry thomas so then is it true that something such as the frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non british audience well yes it's true so much here is british but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well <UNK> in history and when all is said and done the visual <UNK> here is universal with the <UNK> not so wild west make over an absolute winner a winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an american audience now than it will be by a british audience not all the comedy works and in truth the big 6 are <UNK> big time by a film stealing moore <UNK> but there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of <UNK> from more <UNK> comedy acts you are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like i did because of an gag but if you be a classic comedy film fan i feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there's some very talented people at work here br br now then dose the <UNK> always get their man 8 10
<START> probably the best royal <UNK> in years br br match 1 sees edge battle shawn michaels in a good but very long match next up one of the worst <UNK> on the <UNK> takes on the undertaker in a boring <UNK> match match number 3 sees <UNK> defend his wwe title against big show and kurt angle in a surprisingly good contest the next match up sees triple h defending his <UNK> <UNK> title reign against randy <UNK> in a great match up br br next up the royal <UNK> takes place in which 15 raw <UNK> and 15 <UNK> <UNK> hit the ring to try and win the <UNK> and face the champion whoever that may be at <UNK> 21 highlights included tough enough 3 winner daniel getting his ass kicked by chris benoit eddie <UNK> and hardcore holly all of the <UNK> beating the crap out of <UNK> <UNK> and raw <UNK> vs <UNK> <UNK> br br not a bad <UNK> at all br br edge vs <UNK> 8 10 taker vs 4 10 <UNK> vs angle vs big show 7 5 10 triple h vs <UNK> 8 5 10 the royal <UNK> match 9 10
<START> as an avid fan of christian film and a person trying to maintain a keen eye for <UNK> in the realm of christian film making i was excited to get a chance to see this film i was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies i was left disappointed br br the beginning scene is excellent though a slight rip off of leon the professional on the angle it showcases some great cinematography in the early goings everything after that was pretty much downhill br br i was barely able to sit through this one i was tempted multiple times just to shut it off br br the acting while quite possibly sincere was incredibly awful but then again the heart of the problem was the screenplay itself the dialog was worse than anything i have ever seen and even my amateurish screenplay the awakening soon to be an independent film looked like a hitchcock thriller next to this which isn't saying much the bright side of this film is that it was filmed on <UNK> brand new high definition <UNK> cameras shooting in this film and star wars attack of the <UNK> were the first movies ever to use these new technology cameras that year unfortunately the <UNK> performance seemed to be wasted with bad lighting poor angles and awkward handling br br the only good feeling i got coming out of watching this movie was how good my rookie indie film is going to look next to it 4 10
<START> this movie just seemed to lack direction the plot developed so many twists in such a short amount of time that it seemed to lose any semblance of what the true storyline was there was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering the <UNK> scenes and possession story began to take a back seat to the character's back stories which were a little weak to begin with br br all in all i would say skip it unless you have rented out the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you haven't seen before you're much better off just watching the exorcist or the <UNK> of emily rose
<START> i have just watched this latest version of <UNK> and was pleasantly surprised with the solid acting and obvious effort that had to turn a low budget historical piece into a fully <UNK> watchable movie br br one note however the music was very lame and added nothing to the intensity of the film and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a bunch of as opposed to a full <UNK> score i think paul needs to get his act together
<START> my wife received tickets for our family to attend the <UNK> of this movie from her <UNK> for free i only regret the price of the popcorn and the two hours of my life wasted on this garbage film br br i own the dvd of the original mask and quite enjoyed it i expected a remake nowhere near the original in production values or writing but wasn't prepared for this vulgar pile of trash weak acting poor plot a bad cgi baby passing gas and <UNK> in hyper mask mode a woman turned into a giant nose <UNK> fun huh my eight year old son loves movies like lord of the rings harry potter and star wars after this was over i asked him what he thought his exact words i hated it it's like the scooby doo movie they take something good and have to put all that gross stuff in my twelve year old daughter and wife hated it as well my wife later told me that my son her twice during it if we could leave he's never done that before i'm proud of him <UNK> you think i'm some kind of <UNK> from the <UNK> and lack of laughter i heard in the theater i think most of the <UNK> agreed with me br br this film represents everything bad about children's entertainment today and any positive reviews must be from people <UNK> connected with the film
<START> the <UNK> of quentin tarantino and his dubious influence on the likes of guy ritchie may have <UNK> the wave of appalling british gangster flicks we've been <UNK> over the past few years but one of our most famous acting <UNK> only serves to <UNK> the cycle by <UNK> his considerable name to trash like this i only wish he'd taken a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain he admits he often employs it's not only <UNK> his talent but possibly the promise of future originality from british films br br not one of this film's characters are likeable or even remotely realistic and the dialogue consists of the usual empty <UNK> and colourful language caine doesn't give the material any more effort than it deserves either if this was meant to be in the style of a tragic fall from grace a la king <UNK> it would've helped immensely had i cared about the ultimate fate of the principals instead of just wishing that they'd get <UNK> in the <UNK> of life and dragged under almost immediately br br
<START> directed by the younger brother of great director leo <UNK> this is a pretty good short from the three stooges nominated for an academy award here the stooges are doctors named doctor howard doctor fine and doctor howard they are not the <UNK> doctors but they get the benefit of the doubt as long as they handle for duty and humanity br br i liked this short it is not one of their best but some moments are hilarious though one joke that is repeated more than once works every time the part where they must operate the <UNK> boss is terrific to say more would spoil some of the jokes so you must see it for yourself just another fine short from the three stooges
<START> one of the worse gay related movies i have ever seen since these are not characters in this story it's hard to comment on the actual film therefore since <UNK> ford aka <UNK> laid his life open for all to see i guess he's fair game to criticize and that's not hard to do here goes 50 something <UNK> is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer i guess 11 films makes him a star being gay and forty i have seen porno and i did not recognize him or his lover personally they all look the same to me with different hair styles face it guys he's no jeff <UNK> jim or <UNK> that's ok though the purpose of these films takes place in about 6 5 minutes so they all pretty much have the same <UNK> if you know what i mean br br so <UNK> wants to be a serious <UNK> singer after he <UNK> the porno industry but he can't get anyone to take him seriously i wonder why was he so stupid to think that he could <UNK> taking his clothes off and having sex on film and according to the film it's not just porn flicks he <UNK> in it's living in a house with other stars where people can hook into their bedroom the bathroom and where ever via it's 500 dollars an hour to entertain at a private party strip <UNK> at clothing <UNK> <UNK> doing something called <UNK> which i presume is a drug and then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a club gig tries to touch you because he's <UNK> now <UNK> br br the only interesting non cardboard character is the academy award winning gay screen writer who wouldn't give his name and considering this is a documentary well porn is as porn does you can tell he's most amused by the dumb bunny porn star br br <UNK> has one hyper <UNK> manager kyle who wants to him as a porno <UNK> in hopes of getting him gay club <UNK> he tries to do the routine wear this don't smile say this in what amounts to controlling issues but our anti hero will not be controlled or told what to do that's the first mistake i'm not saying kyle was right but if any budding singer starts questioning the manager they're not going to get far kind of like he who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client br br all of this wouldn't have been bad if it weren't for one small tiny bit of information drum roll please he's bad he sucks his singing talent ranks up there with <UNK> simpson it's hard to root for someone who while trying make his dream come true at 50 doesn't work like normal people no job can you say lazy ass and the whining and the why don't they accept me song and dance and after a few months of <UNK> the surface of the music industry he <UNK> off why don't i have a record deal by now what actors are <UNK> writers work in low level <UNK> or <UNK> whatever this guy is above that it's true he wants his success now merely because he decided he wanted it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his lover leaves him to return to <UNK> but i tell ya i wouldn't want that moron <UNK> medical care to me both of them were useless <UNK> the movie is useless unless you really like <UNK> and people stay away do not waste your money on the crappy lives of useless people there are far more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoe
<START> this has got to be the worst steven segal movie i have ever watched even worse than <UNK> <UNK> like on deadly ground fire down below i'll start with the good points it's got stylish direction for a <UNK> movie and has wonderful that's it the story <UNK> really go anywhere it's just an array of well staged set pieces just so seagal go shoot bad guys the body count can easily match tarantino at his <UNK> the plot is needlessly complicated and confusing you forget who the good and bad guys are the acting i use the term loosely is mediocre at best <UNK> usual one <UNK> expression and wooden acting i can take but the others especially the brits were down right terrible br br what's in the package why are bad guys after it is seagal being set up br br who gives a s br br when i rented this movie at my local blockbuster once i'd paid the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the shop i could have picked i felt like <UNK> him till my arm went <UNK> br br anyway i haven't seen half past dead or out for a kill yet and i go back for more <UNK> at my store but they can't be than this turkey br br the soundtrack is supposed to be young and hip it just gave me a urge for half a dozen br br all in all this is seagal at his worst the guy who's gained about and looks well past it he's a guy who just doesn't no when to stop he should <UNK> <UNK> now and have a go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something br br my rating 2 10 1 point for scenery
<START> this movie can best be described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom how many vaguely humorous <UNK> can you <UNK> into just one movie notes are misplaced <UNK> are switched conversations are <UNK> people get mixed up situations are <UNK> and somewhere along the line people are supposed to laugh about something the writers are really struggling to keep everything going which makes the dialogues feel really forced if anyone in this movie acted like a real person all this would be resolved in around two minutes or so and everyone could go back to their lives but they have to keep the <UNK> going at times this movie also tries to go for some juvenile laughs but all those do is remember you about how funny american pie was the scene with the nerd telling the hooker who he thinks is a foreign exchange student to eat his <UNK> goes on forever not one second of it is funny i've got to give this movie some credit though because of the subplot about stolen money it's not as boring as it could have been it also has a laugh here and there but then sadly goes back to yet another character <UNK> stuff overall this movie is just way too lame
<START> if you're ok with the outlandish work of <UNK> <UNK> horror to accept his outrageous story lines and flamboyant you should have a great time with opera if you don't then you won't br br <UNK> plays betty a beautiful young opera who is given a shot at fame in an avant garde production of <UNK> when the star of the show is hit by a car as any <UNK> who has the will know <UNK> is a production that carries a betty soon discovers that the show in which she is now the star is no exception a killer is <UNK> <UNK> the staff at the poor betty is forced to watch by the sadistic murderer who tapes <UNK> under her eyes to prevent her from closing them br br with the help of a little girl who <UNK> through her air <UNK> <UNK> her director and agent and a few <UNK> who have seen the <UNK> face betty discovers the killer's identity and the truth about her mysterious past br br let's face it opera is one crazy film with its preposterous plot turns convoluted death scenes and an ending that <UNK> belief and whilst director <UNK> <UNK> has never been one for shall we say conventional story lines this particular giallo is so <UNK> and features so many of his trademark stylish touches all <UNK> up to the max that it's almost as if with each <UNK> film he is seeing what he can get away with at times almost <UNK> his earlier work br br this is exactly why i find the film such fun br br <UNK> camera movements are absolutely incredible <UNK> <UNK> and in one amazing scene even <UNK> around the opera house above the audience the power of <UNK> music is combined perfectly with the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> score providing a suitably <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> visuals and several outstanding set pieces featuring sergio nauseating gore fx go to prove that no one does death better than <UNK> check out one character's stunning demise in which a bullet passes through a spy hole in a door in slow motion and straight into their eye br br 7 5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for imdb
<START> free stupidest name title ever is the worst episode of any of the tv shows i watch which includes x files <UNK> all 3 law and orders all of the family guy simpsons <UNK> show <UNK> report and more south park was for very long my favorite of the comedy shows because of it's shockingly obscene content and disturbing black comedy free has none of the content i mentioned earlier it was so tame so it might has well been an episode of <UNK> street kyle goes to sea world where a few of the workers play a prank on him making him think a whale is talking to him he befriends the whale actually befriends it hello this is south park the same show that brought you cancelled it hits the fan death camp of tolerance and so many more not <UNK> <UNK> ugh i actually watched the whole episode which is 30 minutes of my life i will never get back anyhow i was extremely disgusted with this episode and i can't believe the shocking decline in the quality of matt work
<START> like many a child born in the 1980's i grew up on the mel brooks films that weren't necessarily the ones like blazing <UNK> and history of the world part 1 i saw those of course though not as frequently as now but the ones meant for the whole family <UNK> and this film i knew at the time i wasn't seeing great art but just a campy goofy though always laugh worthy take on robin hood and or adventure movies but calling it a family movie in quotes means that a adults really can enjoy it as much as kids if not more because of the little in jokes and silly <UNK> and b once a kid sees it when he <UNK> it as i have a few times it's still as fresh but with some things not quite understood the first time around it's a comedy that is not only filled with jokes at robin hood movies and other movies godfather of course as well as little mentions for other movies of modern times but one that references <UNK> own movies as well this is a filmmaker who isn't above <UNK> fun at even his own style br br basic story robin hood cary <UNK> in one of his best turns returns home from the <UNK> to see things are in peril with king richard gone and so goes forth to <UNK> his land and to naturally rob the rich to feed the poor along the way he meets dave <UNK> heads with prince john richard lewis and the sheriff and of course still <UNK> for the love of maid <UNK> this of course is the usual <UNK> for brooks to let the comedy run off into the scenes and while sometimes a joke may not work or might become stale on a repeat viewing so much of it sticks that it's hard not to chuckle it also helps that a couple of bits are some of the best in any such as the godfather bit dom <UNK> at his very best <UNK> own cameo as the lewis and <UNK> acting turns and an endless slew of <UNK> lines and a couple of tongue in cheek songs some of it is obvious yes some of it just takes right from the pages of blazing <UNK> sure but is it a good time for the right crowd definitely and for parents who grew up on the 70's brooks work it is a fantastic way to introduce the young ones to his work through this even the suggestive sex jokes and such are not r rated all in good fun
<START> first off i'm a huge bronson fan have been since the late '70s i watched every film he made on the big screen since love and bullets which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name hollywood blockbuster star br br i kept hoping that things would turn around for him that he would make a really good film in the '80s but that never happened and i don't know what he was thinking when he signed with <UNK> studio cannon and hack director j lee thompson for most of his latter films br br <UNK> gave me some hopes when i saw that peter hunt was directing instead of thompson but those hopes were quickly <UNK> first off the film looks incredibly cheap like it was made for about 3 <UNK> minus <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i heard he insisted on 5 <UNK> per picture which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his cannon films the white house scenes were filmed on the <UNK> grounds in west la i was taking the bus when they were shooting nice job on <UNK> the white house but did no one think about getting the palm trees out of the shots guess not br br secondly the supporting cast is really bad ireland was dying of cancer and despite this she's not bad but the horrible asian woman playing <UNK> sidekick was typical of <UNK> talent at the time non existent i would be real curious to learn how she got this role i can't imagine a worse actress for the part plus she's a good 40 years younger than bronson the story is not that bad and it's something that bigger and better budgeted studios did later eastwood's in the line of fire and <UNK> bodyguard film but the way it's staged here is really sad i'm wondering if they could not afford to do more than one or two takes per shot none of it is believable in the slightest if secret service men really <UNK> like the <UNK> cops in this movie we'd have <UNK> <UNK> out of office and out of life every few months
<START> george <UNK> is probably my favorite comedian i have seen so many of his <UNK> and even had the opportunity to see him perform live he had a certain cynicism that always <UNK> to me his last 2 <UNK> life is worth losing especially and complaints and <UNK> have lacked a certain spirit and content george appeared overweight old and tired not to mention coming out of <UNK> i said not to mention it anyway life is worth losing was especially tragic as he was overweight disgruntled coming off of <UNK> there we go again and extremely unfunny if there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without <UNK> him off stage george achieved it with life is worth losing it is as if the new millennium and post 9 11 america was <UNK> <UNK> spirit the <UNK> had become too large to manage br br the comeback is partially successful with it's bad for ya this special is the <UNK> completed george is no longer trying to <UNK> his glory days he is in full acceptance of his age being old and dealing with the <UNK> <UNK> of death he has accepted being a <UNK> old <UNK> and is <UNK> in it this is better than his previous <UNK> yet far from <UNK> in new york it is a little tragic his observations are not cutting edge anymore and seem more andy rooney than <UNK> bruce george isn't george anymore he is no longer <UNK> us but is the man in the high castle pointing out how things were and how <UNK> modern life is br br this is an improvement over the previous two <UNK> but george does not as of yet <UNK> his old glory if ever he has been reduced from critical social and political <UNK> commentary to mostly personal <UNK> when he goes political he still has something to say it is heavily derived especially if you have seen any of his previous work but it still works somehow as opposed to his random <UNK> which lack a certain relevance outside of the baby boom generation the last 25 minutes is the best this special has to offer br br for now i will worship the sun and pray to joe <UNK> that george can recreate himself as a cutting edge <UNK> it's a 50 50 chance life seems to have become more tedious for george and his art is now his life this is a step in the right direction from his previous 2 <UNK> but is far from his old self where does he go from here he may never <UNK> but maybe he can further <UNK> <UNK> this new <UNK> old man routine <UNK> to hoping for 7 more words you can't say on tv or at least a <UNK> he can handle
<START> lame lame lame shall i go on there is one i repeat one funny scene in this entire drawn out anti amusing amateur hour special of a film <UNK> fat father knocking someone over with his beer gut that's it the rest of this shockingly mediocre pile of <UNK> consists of the usual trademark bored looking swedish actors delivering dialogue which goes into one ear and out of the other a banal story sloppy direction and well little else worth mentioning cast <UNK> <UNK> is as charismatic as a <UNK> and his nose rivals even that of <UNK> <UNK> in terms of sheer ridiculous <UNK> should only work with <UNK> <UNK> olsen the rest of the cast is luckily easily forgettable whereas <UNK> titanic nose will forever haunt me in my dreams br br <UNK> <UNK> helps ruin swedish cinema don't support him and his nonsense is to comedies what arnold <UNK> is to character acting would have been much more respectable if it had been a no budget youtube video and was simply the most pretentious pseudo touching garbage ever unleashed by a swedish director wake up and smell the <UNK> swedish movies can be so much better than this so stop pretending flicks are worth watching simply because they're good to be swedish please
<START> one of those movies in which there are no big twists whatsoever and you can predict pretty much whats is going to happen matt dillon was awesome once again but the rest didn't played a bigger part as they should have br br it was exciting in the beginning but kinda slow paced and predictable in the end its one of those flicks in which the good guy wins no matter happens if you have absolutely nothing to do you can give it a try i personally found it not worth watching the story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a b movie by <UNK> a happy ending

<START> days of heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films i have ever seen in no way shape or form would i recommend it to anyone unless you're trying to put your kids to sleep or god <UNK> give someone an <UNK> if i could go back in time and do one thing i would set fire to the <UNK> before they were sent to theaters why days of <UNK> plot is simple but extremely vague long sequences devoid of dialogue <UNK> much of the film the characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with the climax of the story does not touch you by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden <UNK> that your ability to think is gone the only things working are your eyes and unfortunately your ears who must listen to the sound of linda the little girl in the story who talks like a man i am now dumber for seeing this movie don't let it happen to you
<START> why would anyone make a film like this why would anybody <UNK> in a film like this why would anybody in the film business work on a film like this why would any theatre show a film like this why would any tv channel program a film like this why would any critic bother to review a film like this why would anybody watch a film like this why would mental <UNK> not be made of the writers producers directors of a film like this sometimes there are movies that are so bad they're good this is a movie that is so ghastly that it's horrible imdb really must <UNK> a 0 or even a minus scale to embrace works of this <UNK> pretentious awfulness
<START> i have to say that i know the documentaries of mister and so i knew that i will get a very well made piece of movie documentary i was not disappointed as a history nerd i did saw hundreds of documentary and liked the different approach of this work br br the director and his 17 <UNK> historians veteran families tried to access the reality of the <UNK> through the letters of <UNK> from both sides so the history is followed by british australian and turkish soldiers br br narrated is this <UNK> by jeremy <UNK> and sam <UNK> both boost the intensity and <UNK> of this documentary by their great voices br br i saw this film in a cinema in italy in <UNK> surround i did buy the dvd last year and will wait again 3 7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries br br summary well made intense history with emotions wrapped in a war documentary with great <UNK>

<START> from the first 10 seconds of pitch black i was hooked i had walked into this movie thinking that it would be just another cheesy sci fi movie instead i found a highly entertaining on the edge of your seat thought provoking action film the movie goes beyond your basic special effects flick the actors are amazing mitchell high art love and other as <UNK> is truly a joy to watch on screen while <UNK> <UNK> as is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak again br br the look of the movie is breath taking the contrast of blues <UNK> and <UNK> due to the three different <UNK> is amazing followed by the complete darkness of <UNK> i would truly recommend any lover of the alien movies or <UNK> mitchell which is why i went to see it to check out this film i'm sure by the end you'll look at the dark in a whole new way
<START> that this film has such a low imdb rating is not surprising in our post <UNK> era do we really need any more <UNK> of america's obsession with the greed <UNK> the topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort but will respond with barely <UNK> rage it was all i could do to sit quietly through this cinematic <UNK> of corporate corruption without <UNK> the dvd and <UNK> it into a thousand pieces br br what's really <UNK> with these kinds of films including purpose is their <UNK> that behind the <UNK> there's some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile in purpose i found no such meaningful message what i did find was a story that <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> power and wealth the two main characters nauseating in their do very little actual work instead they party they play golf they <UNK> their <UNK> they sound hip with dialogue straight out of mtv culture speak rock my world and now get back to <UNK> that's an order john is smug self important shallow and <UNK> a lot robert who wears funky little glasses is even worse br br the film includes two youthful garage <UNK> who look and sound like they're right out of the film <UNK> 2001 stereotypes are played for all they're worth and in this film also include <UNK> looking computer equipment and <UNK> doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our can do future <UNK> need some <UNK> after all that heavy duty <UNK> and with the time bound images and dialogue that such a story <UNK> can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years br br about the best i can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice <UNK> views of san francisco the film would have been a lot more enjoyable a lot more entertaining if they had <UNK> those <UNK> characters and that repulsive story and simply <UNK> us viewers around in that little plane for the film's duration
