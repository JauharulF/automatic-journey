<START> this series could very well be the best <UNK> ever and that is saying a great deal considering the <UNK> <UNK> towers good <UNK> to name just two br br what made <UNK> so superior even to the best of the best is that it did not just <UNK> great classic classy and intelligent comedy but it also expanded <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gently and at every detail the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time br br i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself this was the first time i saw real people using <UNK> phones and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies <UNK> still seen in north america at the time then there were the <UNK> shop <UNK> cars these people even the <UNK> sons with their philosophical approach to life and <UNK> humor were sophisticated they were examples of the new europeans that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade 1980s br br of course the premise was strange and fantastic the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so <UNK> and restless was revolutionary particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv but not with the intensity of <UNK> or the movie <UNK> and if the premise was not surprising enough the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme a potential affair that was not really about sex or even romance <UNK> <UNK> many but it must have left some people <UNK> their <UNK> in disbelief at the time anyway br br <UNK> turned out to be in so many ways <UNK> it documented ahead of its time post modern <UNK> all <UNK> lifestyle the notion of emotional infidelity and <UNK> <UNK> and male <UNK> portrayed perfectly by the strained father son relationships it is too bad this series has not been <UNK> in a big way and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful <UNK> of a certain time and place and <UNK> all the <UNK> and angst that was to come
<START> spoiler the young lover jed is kicked out by the <UNK> kate <UNK> mcdowell because she wrongly believes that jed is having an affair with one of her two <UNK> girlfriends kate thought she caught them en <UNK> <UNK> kate throws <UNK> shoes out the door jed reluctantly leaves and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on then he gets run over crushed one of the meaning of the title by a truck and dies br br and then he gets run over by a truck can you imagine a screenwriter actually <UNK> a script with this plot element up to then its a comedy that <UNK> to be <UNK> but lacks any real <UNK> everybody but jed is just annoying and then they kill jed and everybody's sad until the end where the <UNK> learn to love one another and be supportive instead of destructive i give it 2 <UNK>
<START> yesterday my spanish <UNK> wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again that is why this masterpiece should be shown in all spanish high schools it is a tremendous lesson in the hidden <UNK> of <UNK> the american pilot who gets involved in the spanish civil war chooses for the <UNK> elected <UNK> government the criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that <UNK> ever made the colors are magnificent the cruelty of a war could anybody tell me the difference between any war and a civil war is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other the <UNK> that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again a film like <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century it is a better lesson in history than any book could contain again great work from the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> in iran women are not admitted to soccer games officially it's because they are to be <UNK> from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience but of course it is about <UNK> women are lower forms of human beings br br some brave girls <UNK> this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks they are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage until the police will come and pick them up br br despite the insane situation this is a film with lots of humor it's also <UNK> to see how people always find different ways of fighting <UNK> you'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs good job by director <UNK> <UNK> this is in many ways a heroic comedy
<START> i've seen this film criticized with the statement if you can get past the <UNK> that misses the point <UNK> is in the conscience of the <UNK> as it were this is a decent film with a standard murder mystery but with a distinct twist that <UNK> <UNK> through the resolution leaves the viewer wondering what would i have done in this position and i have to believe that's exactly what the filmmaker intended to that end and to the end of entertaining the audience the film succeeds i also like the way that the violence is never on stage but just off camera we know what has just happened it's just not served up in front of us then <UNK> in our faces as it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing besides the violence is not the point the point is the <UNK> moral dilemma which is cleverly albeit <UNK> resolved
<START> this is a film for entertainment i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film i personally find this film funny <UNK> and memorable it is a fantasy not unlike a <UNK> girl becoming a princess this film was done very well i might add in the 70's a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person's sexuality this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not it is however about love in all it's strange forms this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the 70's in hollywood or in california pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career <UNK> were an integral part of the gay community br br then the fantasy begins let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some <UNK> and what do we have well this movie which in any way was better than that dismal <UNK> the next big thing perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better br br i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the 70's and it still brings a smile to my lips now i <UNK> advise anyone who wants a funny tender movie to <UNK> up with some popcorn and have some fun some people need to <UNK> up and this is the film you should do it with br br
<START> simply one of the best ever richard <UNK> adaptation of truman <UNK> non fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement stunning black and white cinematography that should have won an oscar a haunting <UNK> jones score and tremendous performances by robert blake and scott wilson as the oddly matched killers this film was 0 for 4 at the academy awards and wasn't even nominated for best picture while dr <UNK> was go figure br br although you don't get to know the clutter family as well as you do in the book it was a good decision to focus more on perry and dick and the pain <UNK> process of tracking these guys down john forsythe is also impressive as alvin <UNK> there are simply no flaws in this one 10 out of 10 best performance scott wilson with r blake a close second highly recommended
<START> i have never watched a movie in so little time the only salvation was the fast forward function on the dvd unit it was like watching a poorly produced cbc film there was obviously no money for lighting filming sets location <UNK> <UNK> actors oh there was absolutely no story either i need to write ten lines of comment bad awful horrible wretched <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sickening <UNK> disgusting flimsy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> vile <UNK> all thumbs down and i don't know if i can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap o <UNK> production was
<START> this film so not funny such a waste of great stars who seem to be caught up so in their own stardom that they forget only shining moments belong to john <UNK> as the hotel manager who likes to dress up you almost fall out of your chair with helpless laughter when he dances to donna <UNK> bad girls while wearing high heels a <UNK> coat and a <UNK> hat the rest forget it
<START> there is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films after being <UNK> first monster in the <UNK> classic dracula bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent sadly this last factor would also led him to be type casted during the 40s in the same way boris <UNK> performance in james <UNK> frankenstein transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster of course it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen and the movie that united them was <UNK> the black cat this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade and director <UNK> <UNK> mix of horror and science fiction the invisible ray is another of those minor classics they did in those years br br in the invisible ray dr <UNK> rukh boris karloff is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our <UNK> past captured in <UNK> of light coming from the galaxy of <UNK> while showing his invention to his colleagues dr felix <UNK> bela lugosi and sir francis stevens walter <UNK> they discover that thousands of years ago a meteor hit in what is now <UNK> after this marvelous discovery dr rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor this expedition won't be any <UNK> for rukh as during the expedition his wife diane frances drake will fall in love with ronald drake frank <UNK> an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition however rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip as he'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor br br written by john <UNK> who previously did the script for werewolf of london the invisible ray had its roots on an original sci fi story by howard <UNK> and douglas <UNK> given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi <UNK> puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist <UNK> and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up one element that makes the invisible ray to stand out among other horror films of that era is the way that <UNK> plays with morality through the story that is there aren't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices in many ways the invisible ray is a modern tragedy about <UNK> guilt and revenge br br a seasoned director of low budget b movies filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> got the chance to make 3 films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles thanks to his experience working with limited resources <UNK> films were always very good looking despite the <UNK> <UNK> and the invisible ray was not an exception while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films <UNK> movie effectively captures the essence of <UNK> script as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci fi finally a word must be said about <UNK> use of special effects for an extremely low budget film they look a lot better than the ones in several a movies of the era br br as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality as the film's protagonist boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so <UNK> by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he <UNK> as his colleague dr <UNK> bela <UNK> is simply a joy to watch stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was as <UNK> wife frances drake is extremely effective truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress still two of the movie highlights are the performances of <UNK> cooper as mother rukh and <UNK> <UNK> as lady <UNK> as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time making unforgettable their supporting roles frank <UNK> is also good in his role but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast br br if one judges this movie under today's standards it's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> however that would be a mistake as despite its low budget it is remarkably well done for its time on the top of that considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and <UNK> was still a relatively new concept it's ideas about the dangers of <UNK> are <UNK> accurate one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr rukh and the cold dr <UNK> as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors br br while nowhere near the gothic <UNK> of the frankenstein movies nor the elegant suspense of the black cat <UNK> <UNK> the invisible ray is definitely a minor classic amongst universal <UNK> <UNK> of horror films with one of the most interesting screenplays of 30s horror this mixture of suspense horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had boris karloff and bela lugosi 8 10
<START> <UNK> and his pal <UNK> have been at the <UNK> of the law during most of their lives we see them <UNK> in a car of the underground where their pitch to get <UNK> is so lame no one gives them anything <UNK> who is a hardened petty criminal doesn't even have any redeeming qualities that is until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next religion and show business prove to be a winning combination something that <UNK> <UNK> on br br he and <UNK> have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo <UNK> shows he is a natural for the reality show he transforms himself into a christ like figure who is an instant success in the program <UNK> who is a no nonsense woman who is show's producer can't escape from the way <UNK> pays her unusual attention ultimately <UNK> is the victim of his own success in the end br br <UNK> <UNK> whose first directorial job this movie is had some success in the way the film <UNK> the role of television spain which was vulnerable to these types of programs has seen its share of the bizarre which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience br br the ensemble cast has some good moments in the film mr <UNK> like any actor who decides to direct his first feature would have been more effective <UNK> on the picture in front of the camera <UNK> <UNK> a good actress is one of the best reasons for watching the movie juan carlos <UNK> david <UNK> <UNK> franco <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the rest <UNK> well to the new director
<START> <UNK> is a perfect example of a chicken soup not exactly for your soul the <UNK> unfortunately has lost its actual taste thanks to all the excess <UNK> and <UNK> that went into its making br br what's surprising and disappointing about <UNK> is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual clichés of hindi cinema in his first venture but who in his second outing gives in for all the stereotype film <UNK> while <UNK> shah had the conviction to show something as implausible as blind men robbing a bank in <UNK> he just fails to <UNK> life in the entire <UNK> of <UNK> that is based on something as <UNK> as a father son relationship adopted from a <UNK> play <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does have a sensible storyline with a social message to back up a mature look on the father son relationship a father's <UNK> love towards his son and a son's responsibility towards his family <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> amitabh bachchan who has established his entire empire on his own from the scratch leads an <UNK> life with his wife <UNK> <UNK> shah their only son <UNK> akshay kumar never had the need to <UNK> for anything since he got everything <UNK> made and <UNK> fed in life <UNK> <UNK> has only spoil him all the more br br <UNK> dreams to turning into a superstar but does nothing to make his dreams come true in the meanwhile he marries his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hopes that marriage will make <UNK> a more responsible man but he is disappointed <UNK> is still at his <UNK> best leading a <UNK> life br br the <UNK> limit finally <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from his house the sudden change in the attitude of his <UNK> father towards him and his now expecting wife <UNK> <UNK> he has no option left but to <UNK> for the <UNK> of his wife and his unborn kid he starts turning into an independent man but the <UNK> in the relationship between him and his father grows br br the story is simplistic while the <UNK> screenplay has a very <UNK> approach one can easily identify and relate with the credible characters of both the father and the son if you are not one of the two you at least might have come across individuals like them somewhere in real life br br add to it director <UNK> <UNK> easy handling of the screenplay with a family affair like this any other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama in the proceedings as per the cinematic laws of bollywood family dramas turning the film into a <UNK> <UNK> however shah excels in the <UNK> handling of emotions for most part of the film br br clear cut example of his <UNK> direction is <UNK> in the pre <UNK> scene where the father <UNK> the son from his house in a rather <UNK> manner the purpose of the scene is achieved without <UNK> a <UNK> on the <UNK> brains <UNK> for the scene in the second half <UNK> the now separated father son have a <UNK> conversation that's what <UNK> <UNK> from a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or an <UNK> <UNK> and in fact places it one level high in terms of treatment br br but after gaining all the distinction points one may wonder where does <UNK> still fail in the problem lies in the fact that while <UNK> <UNK> itself from the others in it's league in terms of treatment it gives in to the <UNK> in the terms of <UNK> what with the director forcing in song n dance every now and then in the first half there's a <UNK> kinda <UNK> song a <UNK> kinda <UNK> song a father son disco <UNK> song a dream song and a dream come true song inducing sufficient <UNK> in the viewer picture this the father has just <UNK> the son from his house and the son is dreaming of a song in <UNK> mountains with his wife out of place out of reason and the audience out of seat br br the film just drags in the first half and the actual story starts only in the second half the director has wasted too much <UNK> on unnecessary elements the much talked about dog chase sequence isn't bad but is not redeeming either however akshay <UNK> <UNK> dance is simply ridiculous imagine he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this unintentionally hilarious <UNK> add to it the climax set at the <UNK> of the star hunt where the son bursts out with emotions that's so <UNK> also the editing pattern could have been <UNK> to <UNK> the father's reason for the change in attitude towards his son br br <UNK> <UNK> music is fine though unnecessary in the proceedings <UNK> <UNK> camera work is competent enough though not much demanding <UNK> <UNK> has come up with some good dialogs for dramatic moments br br <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> make up or the light moments in the film very <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> has been going overboard with his comic <UNK> in many films off lately this time he <UNK> his character and is completely restrained his deadpan expressions are perfectly <UNK> with <UNK> over the top <UNK> br br <UNK> shah is convincing in the mother's role not to be taken as a <UNK> but she is flawless in both playing and <UNK> her character <UNK> is gorgeous and performs her part well br br of course the major applause deserves are akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan akshay is especially <UNK> in the scene where his <UNK> father intentionally <UNK> him to make him aware of his <UNK> though bachchan goes a bit dramatic in a couple of scenes his brilliance strikes throughout the film br br to sum up <UNK> is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and <UNK> but the final recipe somehow isn't as much <UNK>
<START> i love this movie it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging <UNK> i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves it is so eerie you feel like you are watching a real life band i would like to see more movies like this i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked and even if billy connolly is quite well known he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it <UNK> again i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill <UNK> and when you get to the final scene well what can i say
<START> the special effects of this movie are especially for its time laughable and used in such an over <UNK> way that you can't deny their terrible <UNK> br br the acting <UNK> the term terrible overacting at the hands of meg foster and richard joseph paul where julie newman and andrew <UNK> just <UNK> bad br br spoilers br br the charm in this movie can be found in two things first is the excellent casting of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the mysterious psychic <UNK> who can sense where and when people will die and is always there br br the second are original finds the combination sf western is obviously original if terrible but other finds are more original like the <UNK> <UNK> stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots though his acting falls short here br br <UNK> don't see this movie except if you love that ol' hunk o brutal <UNK> <UNK> as any self <UNK> <UNK> should
<START> wow could have been such a good movie starts of with <UNK> daniels tied up im thinking cool we are going to get a flash back but nothing movie starts <UNK> with the kid filming this movie probably would have been better if it wasn't for the acting i mean the acting was mostly horrible although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could still it really ruin the movie for me the twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills the movie drags to long for the supposed shocking conclusion all in all i have seen worse low budget movies but considering this was hype with the 8 films to die for i was very disappointed by the way were did some reviewers say there was gore and stuff did i see the same movie well this is 4 out of the eight and so far only one has been any good
<START> this abc straight to tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a <UNK> in time ms madeleine <UNK> brought children and adults alike into a magical <UNK> and original world like no author before her this novel the first in her <UNK> <UNK> is a beautiful take on life the universe and time itself yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand its <UNK> morals are prevalent throughout the book this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms <UNK> work of art honestly what were they thinking the effects look cheap and ridiculous the plot is <UNK> and uneven the dialogue is far fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent worthy director <UNK> del toro david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece this adaptation can only be compared to boring fake and cheap motel room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience
<START> when a small <UNK> named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a magic ring from his uncle the wizard <UNK> <UNK> and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord should the ring end up back in his hands he will regain his power and destroy middle earth <UNK> and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors this is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story regardless this is an epic and wonderfully animated film br br the animation is superbly done with <UNK> which is <UNK> over live action footage ralph bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given the film also boasts a grand music score by leonard <UNK> that fits every scene there are a few plot holes with the script but that has to be <UNK> considering the original deal was to make the book trilogy into two films much had to <UNK> in the first one my biggest <UNK> is some of the character design <UNK> was a bit too goofy while the other <UNK> act completely normal the other characters are actually well written for the screen and the voice actors do a great job i was pleased that <UNK> is actually a bit more helpful to the plot the <UNK> <UNK> are more comical than frightening while the <UNK> are eerie and nightmarish br br another problem is that the evil wizard <UNK> is called <UNK> thanks to the writers overall i think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice but there is something charming about it ralph bakshi made a <UNK> effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories the film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages
<START> before there was crash there was this interesting film called grand canyon released about 14 years sooner than the former film grand canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime to me crash was still a slightly better film but grand canyon was no <UNK> either br br taking place in los angeles an upper class lawyer named mack kevin kline takes a <UNK> through the <UNK> side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time he calls for a <UNK> truck and has to wait for awhile only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car soon the <UNK> truck driver arrives at the perfect moment and out steps simon danny glover to take the truck away both men are threatened but simon manages to get himself mack and the car out of dire <UNK> it is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with mack helping out simon just as simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier you see simon's sister deborah tina <UNK> is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children and fears for her oldest son who seems to be <UNK> the streets at night with some bad people mack offers them a better place to live as well as <UNK> simon up with his <UNK> friend jane <UNK> <UNK> br br this is the main plot of the film but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above mary louise parker as well as <UNK> wife mary <UNK> who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son <UNK> jeremy <UNK> in his first movie role has gone to camp for the summer and will likely be moving on with his own life soon the details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to <UNK> all the different scenes this simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story br br the director lawrence <UNK> whose biggest movie to this date was the big chill has created a splendid movie here the cast is excellent and most of the ideas are well thought out but alas it falls short of greatness because some points that would've made the film even stronger are <UNK> over the story involving the secretary is one and the second involving simon's nephew is the other these scenes should've been more apart of the entire story and then maybe lawrence <UNK> views of life between the upper and lower classes would've been more on a superior level instead of just very good still grand canyon <UNK> expectations and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after there is also a small role for steve martin as davis a producer of violent films who offers his own views on life and has a small part to play in this movie's ideas
<START> after being a big fan of the ten minute t v episodes of <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> this film with excitement and anticipation unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed br br i was <UNK> by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t v episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing as if the actors had said them once and couldn't be bothered to say them again i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had <UNK> with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again br br spoilers the plot of the film starts with stella street a normal english street in <UNK> gradually being populated by <UNK> of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty <UNK> including michael caine al pacino jack nicholson and the rolling stones all the celebrities in the street end up being <UNK> out of their entire <UNK> by a local <UNK> and are forced to live like <UNK> and common working class people there are some nice moments but on the whole the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring end of spoilers br br in the t v episodes all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil <UNK> including females but in the film <UNK> <UNK> is added to the cast i think this was a mistake her <UNK> weren't funny and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do br br if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street you may find this film entertaining but if you were a fan i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated 4 10
<START> this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes the money pit and are we done yet only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since <UNK> been lost br br i was 15 when i first saw this and even at that tender age there was much i could laugh at now of course being familiar with adult <UNK> i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth br br the three main actors cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas <UNK> perfectly but the core of the movie lies in the <UNK> encountered in achieving a dream it's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one <UNK> br br all in all this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it
<START> just saw a pre screening tonight what can i say it lived up to it's mediocre trailer run though that's saying nothing at all it did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn't done and it played out in such a cliché fashion that eventually i got to the point where i stopped laughing only because i was laughing with the audience and instead let the <UNK> movie play out br br so let's see we have the less than spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex girlfriend but he's not good enough for her check we have the three buddies that all have their own personality with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character's best friend but is constantly rejected another friend being the super awkward one that can't live down seeing the positive in everything 24 7 and is thrown in for the one liners which in this case is just a bunch of movie references specifically from disney and the third guy whose name you won't ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in <UNK> messages to <UNK> will care to listen check we have the girl's ex boyfriend and her parents block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up not to mention the awkward family members from the main character's side check we have the <UNK> period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed check we have the movie's funny moments come from <UNK> swearing people falling down or being hit scenes from the trailer and homosexual <UNK> check and dare i call it a spoiler but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie check br br honestly this could have no wait should have been a pg 13 movie all that needed to be dropped were any f bombs honestly it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor would have gotten less media exposure and <UNK> would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent r rated comedies like <UNK> and knocked up the humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn't fit in with what general people look for i bet even the actors were often times <UNK> with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera let's put it this way in the theater it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and others are laughing when this movie hits showtime and you're checking it out at 2 00 <UNK> on an off day you may be inclined to change the channel the only thing that will keep you watching is alice <UNK> <UNK> who is not quite a 10 but still very good looking br br aside from the main resolution this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the <UNK> and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie where everything else pretty much flies out the window so there is a main resolution but what comes of it it's never really clear cut nor does it allow the ending to be feel good with the <UNK> br br there was only one thing worth nothing in this movie and that was the good soundtrack aside from the nice choice of 90's alternative rock songs there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie more so the beginning of it that reminds me of something david holmes would mix up <UNK> i'll give them props for a great choice of sound br br one last thing this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer because the <UNK> yet proud <UNK> <UNK> showed the yellow bottle <UNK> that they had during that rock band promotion i just figured a lot of rock band <UNK> would catch onto that one if you saw it but i say hold onto your money if this was pg 13 and you were 15 years old on a friday night with a group of friends i'd say knock yourselves out otherwise definitely pass it doesn't try and compete with the r rated movies of the past few years and <UNK> it definitely isn't as good
<START> if you appreciate the renaissance in asian horror don't bother with <UNK> the film <UNK> deserves mention alongside a list work such as <UNK> a tale of two sisters cure and <UNK> on or even such good material as the eye or inner senses those films <UNK> with subtleties unexpected imagery rich characters and a decidedly non western take on what's frightening <UNK> is strung together with the <UNK> limbs and organs of everything that has made american horror lousy for the past twenty five years br br the film tries to blend asian ghost story and hollywood slasher flick but it's a bad fit one aesthetic is bound to <UNK> the other guess which having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers <UNK> <UNK> for an evil child subplot but the situation is hopeless clichés crap characters witless plotting a dull ghost ho hum
<START> i once used wesley <UNK> name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new <UNK> film in which he appears so now for the first time my snipes method of film recommendation has failed utterly i should first have come here to see these reviews br br snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in the <UNK> br br one of my worst flick fears has come to bitter <UNK> i feared that the shaky <UNK> pseudo documentary <UNK> directing and editing style first brought to my attention by the paul <UNK> directed bloody sunday might <UNK> to other films <UNK> sickening style was then brought to <UNK> new heights in the last two of the bourne trilogy films my fear had come to pass in my opinion these films are made really bad by these motion sickness inducing methods which mistake <UNK> <UNK> for action <UNK> but the bourne franchise as <UNK> so loving calls his cash cow apparently convinced others in hollywood to go <UNK> in the quest for fast big bucks br br read my lips you hollywood types action needs to be clearly photographed and presented not merely hinted at by poor lazy cinematographic techniques br br and the <UNK> goes so far as to <UNK> the bourne ultimatum in <UNK> repeated sound bites in hopes their juvenile apparently <UNK> audiences can't sense them for example if i hear a cop radio <UNK> <UNK> romeo one more time i'll just scream the chances are good i won't hear it again i certainly won't ever view the <UNK> again br br i recommend to those of you who have yet to see the <UNK> just be content with the <UNK> this lack <UNK> to your life br br 2 out of 10 i am tempted to lower that to a 1
<START> this movie was a major disappointment on direction intellectual <UNK> plot and in the way it dealt with its subject painting it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years with appalling lack of depth though it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner br br the approach to the subject of painting is very elite limited to vague and <UNK> terms as beauty according to the makers of this movie <UNK> can be only experienced in bob ross style <UNK> landscape paintings good art according to this film can be achieved by <UNK> basic like primary school level color theory and lots of sentiment in parts the movie is <UNK> e g at a point it is stated rather celebrated by dancing on tables that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting their works by definition being worthless <UNK> quote br br i do not understand how the movie could get such high rating then again so far not many people rated it and they chose for only very high or very low <UNK>
<START> the plot is rocky the acting is somewhere south of a jr high school play the cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with a <UNK> i couldn't decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film think death valley days meets <UNK> <UNK> people running around in a <UNK> modern town wearing quick draw 6 gun <UNK> it has more than its fair share of <UNK> stuff picture the good guys pulling up to an old farm house and parking the ford <UNK> right in front of a <UNK> <UNK> picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western <UNK> movie sporting a japanese sound track but with english sub titles it's all really strange but might be improved if watching it while <UNK> in a little <UNK> it's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of there's even a modern version of the good hearted dance hall girl and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the soundtrack really if someone brings this to your home for a saturday night movie session tell 'em your dvd player died
<START> time <UNK> are the devil's <UNK> for <UNK> minds they're fun to consider in a <UNK> if ' sort of way film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including <UNK> trek first <UNK> the <UNK> to the <UNK> trilogy <UNK> and ted's excellent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the stargate <UNK> homage <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you <UNK> was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time br br in the case of terry <UNK> excellent film <UNK> <UNK> it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re think our conception of the film repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind br br some seeing the film for the first time will regard cole played by bruce willis as a <UNK> most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the <UNK> wrenching of <UNK> visited upon him by time travel br br unlike other time travel stories <UNK> <UNK> is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by <UNK> events in the past cole tells his psychiatrist <UNK> madeleine <UNK> that time cannot be changed but a phone call he makes from the airport is <UNK> by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 in his own personal time line br br even this could be <UNK> as an event that had to happen in a single time line universe in order to ensure that the time line is not altered cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realized if that's the case time is like a fluid it always finds its own level or path <UNK> of the <UNK> forces working on it it <UNK> the mind to <UNK> on this sort of thing too much br br if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time as we see on board the plane at the end of the film then that means the future can be changed by <UNK> past events or does it the film has probably led to plenty of drunken <UNK> at bars <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for 80 of that time in complete disbelief i can give this garbage the turkey of the year award no problem to say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement frankly i am lost for words to describe this utter tripe not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of <UNK> killer <UNK> but the acting was dire for those who pay to see this i hope you get your money back for those who were paid to do this i hope you give your money back believe me folks there are many new releases out there that are much much better go see
<START> i enjoyed this film it was lighthearted delightful and very colorful you can see that mgm was showing off technicolor there are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film every scene is packed full the choreography was great gene kelly is a wonder he is so talented the dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed he understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else the last section of the film the grand dance sequence is very impressive what makes this film very special is <UNK> music few american <UNK> have had a better gift for melody i very much enjoy <UNK> music it is enchanting ira gershwin is definitely one of the greatest <UNK> writers he is so witty and charming this was a highly entertaining film
<START> as with most of the reviewers i saw this on <UNK> <UNK> after watching the preview with my girlfriend she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched i on the other hand thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching i mean the design of dr <UNK> alone <UNK> at least a brief <UNK> over this title after watching it i can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it namely the <UNK> over the <UNK> and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story it's best to pass over this one br br major spoilers ahead after making their first video for their as yet unfinished cd the lead singer cassidy kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend neil to notice her 3 months later the band is trying to decide if they're going to finish the album or not to try and see what cassidy would have wanted they go to see an old psychic friend of hers dr <UNK> and try to contact her through him in his card reading dr <UNK> turns up four straight death cards for the four remaining band members bad times are ahead i just wanted to make a point that later in the film they do explain that the death card really just represents change kudos to them on that at least even without the <UNK> of their deceased friend they decide to go ahead and finish the album but while in the bathroom <UNK> best friend <UNK> catches a glimpse of her deceased friend when another band mate goes in to check on her <UNK> is standing in the dark <UNK> his <UNK> that's when the killing begins br br my main problem with the film from the very get go is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault too many <UNK> effects unnecessary <UNK> and a <UNK> of other cheap effects <UNK> this film an incoherent storyline doesn't help anything either while the narrative hangs together for the first part once cassidy is <UNK> everything falls apart we have jump cuts between cassidy and dr <UNK> who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building which show they are connected in some way or another however within a few minutes of that revelation we find that cassidy really is an independent being from <UNK> she then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he <UNK> away in a way that calls to mind jack nicholson as the joker but not in a good way br br from this point on the <UNK> of cassidy are shown but there are strange <UNK> as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence one scene we see cassidy standing at a desk when a character enters in the next she's nowhere to be found as he moves behind the desk we see her at the end of a <UNK> then in another room grabbing the keys which neil already has then back again not to mention that from one moment to the next <UNK> mood seems to go a complete <UNK> without a <UNK> to it one moment she wants to kill everyone although she's only wounded 90 of the characters the next she's <UNK> to everyone and walks out the door to die again sound confusing that's because it is it's a <UNK> mess that i'm sure the writer couldn't even figure out br br as for the performances most are particularly wooden some though are interesting but overall this isn't a piece that would be known for it's acting the story is the driving force behind this piece
<START> seriously avoid this movie at any cost i just saw it in my first sneak preview ever and although i paid non <UNK> money for it i walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave first time ever i walked out of a movie and i lived through some pretty bad ones br br it's one of those films that is dubbed and badly so even though it is shown in its original language it relies on the oldest <UNK> and <UNK> jokes in the book on the military what do we do once we reach the fighting zone you get out of the car and die actually it's much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film on drugs a guy eats some space <UNK> behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high all badly written and acted on women in the army why do we only get <UNK> we were promised guns that's the way it is that's the way it'll stay <UNK> okay you might actually find these genuinely funny but in that case you seriously scare me br br additionally i have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on european late night tv so it had lame jokes delivered badly beyond lower average acting lacked pace was badly dubbed and edited  it just didn't work at least not on any level used as a measure for films br br i would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny <UNK> <UNK> germans and that's saying something if you like stereotypes which i don't it's nice to play with them though just in case somebody thinks i'm not being pc enough br br instead of going to see this film do something useful try to teach <UNK> to <UNK> paint your <UNK> in a really irritating colour <UNK> your <UNK> change some light <UNK> try to understand <UNK> theories <UNK> to a different religion and back in fact go and listen to last christmas by <UNK> on endless repeat anything but don't watch this awful flick
<START> that's what one of the girls said at the end br br is the soccer game a metaphor for a <UNK> game between the girls or more <UNK> a free thinking group and the authority to germany means to a future that's of hope br br it's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience i've ever had despite the crude cinematography and plot and mild over acting though i like the cast they're lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs the ridiculous situation is well captured i can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game being female and a soccer fan and i cannot stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise i wonder why there's no women's section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided <UNK> the flawed reasons for the deny br br the movie is very cleverly made the amazing title the filming during the actual game the <UNK> and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters the game that's so important but <UNK> not shown the <UNK> light and cheering sound from the stadium the <UNK> of the van and the <UNK> of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside i can feel the comfort coming from the radio the drinks and the food and of course the kindness and consideration from each character to others during the end credits i am amused that no character has a name he's just any soldier and she's just any girl or sister
<START> i bought this it was only 3 ok under the title grey matter the novelty of seeing <UNK> <UNK> in a non <UNK> role intrigued me as the other reviewers warned it's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry br br and yes there are plenty of establishing shots especially of a house with a pool in front of it some of the characters and interiors are so <UNK> i guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who so they keep <UNK> us off by first showing the outside of the buildings it's actually kinda funny after awhile the pool shot feels like a tv <UNK> station <UNK> <UNK> reminding us that we are watching grey matter br br i also enjoyed two <UNK> of name calling at one point an angry test subject <UNK> somebody in charge by calling her a scientific b <UNK> it's just a very <UNK> insult several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by <UNK> about that scientific b <UNK> it just sounded very awkward to me br br someday this movie will disappear forever another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it almost like it never happened br br
<START> well where do i begin my story i went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the actors that were in it and that it was supposed to be a horror movie br br well i figured out within the first 20 minutes what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie the plot was crap and so was the script the lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically br br the cast couldn't have been more plastic looking even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much <UNK> like they dragged on for no particular reason very poor editing br br all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money boo
<START> if you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on dvd it was probably <UNK> you were looking for how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines i was too young to see richard <UNK> during his greatest time and when i was old enough to see eddie murphy's <UNK> and <UNK> not as funny i never knew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration now that i'm older and have seen both <UNK> and many of the comedians after murphy i realize two things everybody steals from eddie while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard that's the huge difference eddie was original funny provocative thoughtful  and more he was something never before seen he was all we ever needed these days eddie murphy is boring and old  but once upon a time he was the king and <UNK> was the greatest castle ever built truly one of the funniest routines of all time
<START> ok i would not normally watch a <UNK> brothers movie i can't recall ever watching one i also don't recall watching a jimmy fallon movie alright i did watch taxi but i said <UNK> and was forgiven for that mistake but this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the <UNK> thing i don't know what it is about her but i just smile the whole time i am watch her she just <UNK> me that way i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in 50 first dates how sad is that this wasn't the greatest baseball movie it wasn't supposed to be it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for it had a predictable ending but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile
<START> not much to say on this one a plot you can pretty much <UNK> in the first 10 minutes nothing overly wrong with this film very little action for an action film there was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally whether an action film is the right genre to do that with i'm still <UNK> sniper was one of the <UNK> films to watch without giving full attention to as it had little twists and a straightforward plot i was probably guilty of that so with a second watch or with <UNK> attention it may be better br br 4 10 but the best of my 4 out of <UNK>
<START> this had a great cast with big name stars like <UNK> power henry fonda randolph scott nancy kelly henry <UNK> and brian <UNK> and a bunch more lesser but known names with shorter roles it also had technicolor one of the few movies made with it in 1939 br br now the bad news <UNK> i can't say much positive for the story it portrayed the james boys in a totally positive light and hollywood has done that ever since why these criminals are always shown to be the good guys is beyond me this film <UNK> them and made their enemies the <UNK> people into vicious human beings the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous well that's the film world for you evil is good good is bad br br hey hollywood here's a news flash the james boys were criminals really look it up
<START> at first sight this movie doesn't look like a particular great one after all a bette davis movies with only <UNK> votes on imdb and a rating of 6 5 must be a rather bad one but the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise br br you would at first expect that this is a normal average typical <UNK> movie with a formulaic love story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch br br the story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love story that work humorous as well it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch that is perfectly entertaining br br the movie is quite short just over an hour long which means that the story doesn't waste any time on needless plot lines development and characters it makes the movie also rather fast paced which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or fun br br a delightful pleasant simple romantic comedy that deserves to be seen by more br br 8 10
<START> big spoilers i've seen one other takashi miike film and that was the very disturbing and brutal <UNK> which was an examination of the japanese ideals of <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> which i think means <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> in a very <UNK> gross way the family unit miike's surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be <UNK> in terms of confusion and film making but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue we the audience are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure <UNK> <UNK> who was actually quite good paying for sex with his <UNK> daughter <UNK> then as the father returns home he is struck on the head by the visitor <UNK> <UNK> wielding a fairly <UNK> rock and for some reason they both end up back at the family home the mother <UNK> <UNK> is beaten and <UNK> by her son <UNK> <UNK> who is also beaten and <UNK> by his school peers when the visitor enters the home he somewhat <UNK> <UNK> himself as part of the unit eventually the family begin to improve their relationship with assistance from the visitor through <UNK> breasts murder and <UNK> a sense of family pride br br and there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together it's has uncomfortable humour but is equally <UNK> silly and over the top in its weirdness there is a <UNK> scene that is utterly disgusting but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses partly because of the situation itself and partly because you can't believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this the style of the film is poor to say the least and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak the characters themselves are all over the place and while i understand this is not meant to be realistic there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd the camera work is sloppy and doesn't have that cinematic feel that lynch's work <UNK> it's hard to take this film seriously on a <UNK> level or on an interpretation of <UNK> the family unit in japan it just seems that miike was out to shock and the film seems self aware that it's trying to be shocking and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously all in all i would say that this film is a <UNK> dark comedy but it looks and feels amateurish and seems to unnecessarily want to shock miike's previous film audition was finely balanced between disgusting horror character development and technique which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become <UNK> with the plot <UNK> <UNK> is a step down as it tries too hard to be <UNK> bizarre and intentionally confronting without really having much to say in the process br br out of
<START> i am a massive fan of jet li he is the best hk action film star alive and consequently this film <UNK> i saw it in the video store and as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store i didnt register its presence at first and had to look twice i immediately knew what i would be renting out my only <UNK> i suppose i expected it is that it was dubbed <UNK> and not subtitled <UNK> the movie's original strange cool plot and full on action made it one of jet <UNK> better movies even though they all fall under that category
<START> two women sick of their controlling husbands taking a vacation in italy for a month with two other very different women they come back <UNK> and <UNK> in this wonderful little film by <UNK> <UNK> br br great scenery and the location isn't bad either seriously a very good period piece 7 of 10
<START> i was 15 years old when this movie premiered on the television being raised in texas i understood the boredom <UNK> of teenage life there this movie touched my <UNK> teenage heart i remembered it <UNK> through the past 12 years i recently got to see it for the 2nd 3rd 4th times thanks the the love channel i still cry because the movie reaches in touches my inner confused teenager
<START> i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone's been <UNK> the score br br either way it was a real disappointment the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff and that's about it the plot is thin and unoriginal the snakes are bad cgi but it makes sense to cut <UNK> on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone the acting is poor and all people are unbelievable <UNK> types br br to sum it up it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen stay away
<START> i watch a lot of films good bad and indifferent there is usually something of interest to <UNK> upon even if it is only set design or the reliable labor of a good character actor or the <UNK> laughter that emerges from watching <UNK> captured forever br br however i was quite pleasantly surprised by this film one i had never seen before graham greene has been translated into film many times of course in such masterpieces as thin man and in lesser vehicles <UNK> agent is one of those lesser vehicles yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway despite lackluster direction the <UNK> of bacall and <UNK> depictions as respectively british and spanish and the almost complete non existence of any chemistry between the two leads in some ways this last problem actually begins to work in the film's favor for how can love really <UNK> in the killing atmosphere of <UNK> and capitalism meeting about one person's tragedy the most compelling aspect of the film <UNK> directly from <UNK> complex and guilt ridden psychology which <UNK> the film i know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull and i can understand that yet i found that plodding <UNK> rather than <UNK> from what is a claustrophobic world i was compelled to watch not by any great acting although boyer is marvelous as usual managing to convey a rich mixture of world <UNK> tragedy hope and <UNK> with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes but by the down <UNK> rush of one man's slim hopes against a world of <UNK> and money what is a thief what good is love in the face of death where does mere profit taking end and exploitation begin the film does not rise to the level of art and thus cannot hope to answer such questions but it is much more than mere entertainment and its murders and <UNK> are very <UNK> drawn the lack of <UNK> of bubble of narrative <UNK> help to make this movie very worthwhile br br and there is no happy ending for history wrote the ending

<START> in some ways the wrath of <UNK> surpasses <UNK> death but it also loses some of that film's greatness the plot of this one is more cohesive than the first which is quite amazing the second half of the actual poem is a lot <UNK> and a lot harder to <UNK> through until that is you get to the climactic battle scenes only the <UNK> are better lang and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> the poet <UNK> of the <UNK> didn't know a <UNK> from his right ball and as a result they are more or less the same as the <UNK> in <UNK> for example although the poet clearly describes <UNK> as a <UNK> which is <UNK> main concern as <UNK> tries to <UNK> her to marry him when she gets to <UNK> the first thing she does is go to mass the <UNK> here are clearly <UNK> they're almost like <UNK> the depiction of them is hilarious especially verbal the <UNK> who has two marvelous scenes <UNK> character has been given more weight he is much more <UNK> all he does is <UNK> his fate in the original poem lang and <UNK> are masterful at building suspense especially at the <UNK> scene which is <UNK> with <UNK> second performance to an amazing effect however as is the nature of this half of the poem the film's amazing technical <UNK> are missing in this one for the most part except for a dazzling sequence where <UNK> hall burns down with the <UNK> inside the one thing i do have to object to is the way <UNK> changes the ending spoilers in the poem after <UNK> captures <UNK> and <UNK> they are imprisoned <UNK> visits <UNK> in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the <UNK> he refuses and she herself <UNK> her brother when <UNK> still refuses she <UNK> him <UNK> or possibly <UNK> is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he in turn <UNK> her calling her a devil woman <UNK> who is much weaker in the poem than he is here says something silly like ah me i can understand why they would want to keep a <UNK> of time and place as <UNK> brings them from the castle to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very <UNK> i also understand why they didn't have <UNK> kill <UNK> his character is much reduced here his name is only mentioned once but to have <UNK> kill herself <UNK> <UNK> death from the <UNK> sources is just <UNK> to the audience instead of challenging them the point of the poem is that <UNK> wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil here we simply have her die for her lost love it's not as interesting
<START> i think a round of applause is in order for whoever <UNK> together the trailer for rogue <UNK> latest release 'the <UNK> i myself along with everyone else have been <UNK> into believing it is in fact a horror film on the contrary though its actually a supernatural thriller too bad it is not the least bit thrilling br br 'the <UNK> stars sarah michelle <UNK> as joanna mills a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven it was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met while in texas on a business trip she is led by these visions to the murdered woman's hometown la <UNK> there she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions a man by the name of terry <UNK> who is played by peter o'brien joanna is now on a desperate search for answers a search that could in the end result in her very own murder br br i really don't know where to begin here folks which should i mention first the atrocious acting hideous directing or the terribly bland story no matter which one i choose my point behind each is the same they simply suck adam <UNK> screenplay is downright moronic its not interesting its not compelling its just plain unpleasant i kept waiting for something to <UNK> the film i've placed <UNK> around film because i don't believe 'the <UNK> deserves to be called an actual film due to it's <UNK> and at least give it some slight chance of hope but nothing ever happened i was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster of course they probably knew this having read the script then <UNK> to do the film i assume this is why the acting was so awful at least that's what i'm choosing to believe i really hope the cast doesn't pride themselves on their performances they need immediate medical attention if they do br br now the directing was <UNK> bad but i can't quite <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> entirely well i could but i won't since i'm such a nice guy i look at 'the <UNK> as a test for <UNK> because for all of you that don't know this is his first full length feature film he's just getting his foot in the door and still learning next time around well if there is a next time hopefully he will have improved vastly the only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely <UNK> the visual style of marcus <UNK> 2003 re make of 'the texas chainsaw <UNK> now that's nice the film was given that but unfortunately he still won't be receiving any kudos from me for that <UNK> someone else's work isn't something i consider to be praise worthy even if it is from a film i very much enjoyed br br i think jim <UNK> american re make of <UNK> will now have to <UNK> over the title of worst film of the year to 'the <UNK> it beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way now i don't doubt this will make a small and i mean very small profit no matter what though it won't <UNK> or even parallel the <UNK> success of <UNK> previous acting effort 'the <UNK> on that note there's one last thing i'd like to add i can honestly say i had never been embarrassed to have been seen leaving a theater <UNK> until seeing 'the <UNK> that is something i never wish to experience again along with the film itself
<START> silly often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting havoc this causes on tim jeff daniels and the people in his <UNK> br br am always amazed by daniels he showed such depth and promise in <UNK> terms of <UNK> as shirley <UNK> <UNK> son in law as the years have passed daniels has been unable to get his hands on a good <UNK> role instead he is in inane comedies such as dumb and dumber br br as for this picture it fails because of the subject matter at least the television show brought about a variety of situations in the film we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is <UNK> into capturing the martian martin br br the part of mrs brown is a perfect example of the non success of the film on television pamela <UNK> portrayed a <UNK> individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her <UNK> in the film version a blond bomb shell as brown tries romantic <UNK> br br television star ray <UNK> has a small role as a government agent or is he really that br br a very big disappointment for those who enjoyed the television show so much
<START> painfully bad christmas film that has an equally painfully bad performance by vince vaughn who is paying his usual frat boy self but this time for a children's movie but with out the wit or charm that is in his r rated films vaughn seems like he's on <UNK> though most of the film and he keeps running into walls with his lackluster performance after 30 minutes into the film you would be in touch your inner <UNK> and say <UNK> at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point out of all the actors involved in this mess only paul <UNK> and rachel <UNK> brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that's <UNK> because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film paul <UNK> brings some depth and warmth to the character of saint nick himself but he's forced to <UNK> level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling <UNK> you can see in <UNK> face that he's not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film rachel <UNK> brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she's well aware of that so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film fortunately for her she's not in the film much at all and is able to save some face unlike <UNK> who looks like he's about to fire his agent by the end of the movie the direction also feels uninspiring like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down br br i don't know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved <UNK> and <UNK> trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with <UNK> direction with no feeling for the subject at hand and this is a christmas movie of all things and a actor who just does not care about his performance vaughn you have a very <UNK> bad film that is very painful to watch
<START> first of all i apologize for my english br br everybody from ex <UNK> who isn't some extreme serbian radical will agree with me this movie shows serbian side and only serbian side no serbian crimes were represented luckily everyone can see that this movie was made by <UNK> so there is no <UNK> all <UNK> who were interviewed are not professionals at all some guy only read a book written by some radical serbian the other one is <UNK> <UNK> etc etc br br even <UNK> were accused in this movie and the whole war in <UNK> lasted for few days and only because <UNK> were lucky there weren't many <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> couldn't reach <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> war started every <UNK> is <UNK> by all <UNK> in this movie br br every reasonable <UNK> will agree with one thing the independence was too early perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided however mentioning wwii and some unrelated things was truly pathetic attempt to justify everything just imagine japanese throwing nuclear bombs at seattle and washington and saying that was justified by <UNK> and <UNK> you will find no evidence about <UNK> <UNK> soldier and murdered serbian civilians near <UNK> but you can find the tape with reporter committing that his claims about serbian civilians near <UNK> were lies all over the internet and the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of <UNK> by <UNK> now on serbian and <UNK> side and 100 full of <UNK> and <UNK> and let's not start about the <UNK> movement at the beginning it was simply a resistance movement but director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the nazis including <UNK> ethnic <UNK> and fighting again the <UNK> <UNK> there are thousands of other things but all of it can be easily checked there are many misleading things in this movie only few of all <UNK> are true every <UNK> is <UNK> by this movie br br i believe that i don't need to mention <UNK> <UNK> denial the <UNK> that has too many evidence imagine the movie about holocaust denial this movie is the same and according to this movie <UNK> muslims in <UNK> bombed themselves every <UNK> muslim is <UNK> by this movie br br somehow director forgot to mention the short <UNK> of small piece of <UNK> <UNK> land by the <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> never entered serbian borders if you are not serbian and you actually started to believe some things from this movie know that <UNK> have some kind of propaganda that <UNK> <UNK> muslims and <UNK> are actually <UNK> who made up their history so br br even 50 of <UNK> will say that this movie is <UNK> extreme and pro serbian br br and serbian <UNK> are very very pleased with this movie there is about 40 <UNK> who vote for <UNK> br br i think everyone understands my points in here in this so called documentary is very little truth and my advice to everyone is inform yourself before watching this movie after that you will only laugh at all pathetic <UNK> br br watch real neutral documentaries about death of <UNK>
<START> yes i'll admit it i believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work about the trials and <UNK> of 6 people living in mexico city concerning their sexual lives and so i was really expecting to finally see a mexican movie in ages that was both popular and interesting to watch unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing the story presents us with two couples both with very obvious marital problems when a third party comes into the life of each couple their problems reach a pivotal point or absolute absurd the plot then turns into a battle of the <UNK> the stance taken by each group yes they literally group girls with girls and boys with boys is blatantly stupid and childish i guess the humor was supposed to be there and it all goes from bad to worse the performances range from good miss <UNK> to mediocre mr <UNK> with <UNK> doing an acceptable job on his opera <UNK> however the flat circumstances that make up the plot the one dimensional characters the very poor if not stupid perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc make the movie fail miserably <UNK> has had an impressive good reception at the box office believe the hype at your own risk
<START> an old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he <UNK> br br people are getting murdered and blood is being <UNK> and rats are <UNK> all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed br br kitty barbara <UNK> is the suspect but we know she is not the killer is it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is it evelyn back from death for revenge is it a plot to steal an inheritance the color is superb in this thriller from <UNK> <UNK> who only did one other giallo as far as i know br br the only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out someone calls the police and suddenly they are there trying to save kitty
<START> me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good but we were wrong first of the acting wow the acting was the worst the effects were really bad as well it seemed like a film a college kid made the plot was pretty good but it'd been done the thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors the main guy was the worst actor ever it's a shame i'm even calling him an actor the only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny so if you want a good laugh see it but other than that stay far away from this one i usually love b list movies and such but this one i do not know how it was passed to even be put on video this one is the worst i've seen and i've seen some bad ones
<START> this documentary now available free on video <UNK> com is a fantastic <UNK> of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice everyone must see this br br chavez was elected in a <UNK> vote in 1998 his platform was to <UNK> the fantastic oil wealth from the 20 middle class to the 80 poor he banned foreign drift net fishing in <UNK> waters he sent 10 000 cuban doctors to the <UNK> to treat the sick for free he wiped out <UNK> and set up new free <UNK> br br but it was his 30 tax on oil company <UNK> that got him in trouble with the bush administration in 2002 while irish film makers kim <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were <UNK> chavez inside the presidential palace about his social programs a cia backed coup was launched with the cameras rolling chavez was captured and <UNK> out of the country it was announced on national tv that he had <UNK> br br but the poor of <UNK> didn't believe the media they went to the palace in their millions and <UNK> that chavez be returned in the face of such overwhelming numbers the military turned on the coup leaders and the <UNK> <UNK> to the us chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to <UNK>
<START> good work by everyone from <UNK> director and cast a lovely fun film that becomes believable for sentimental reasons only a good film for television on those <UNK> cold <UNK> days when you just want to sit back and enjoy
<START> a number of <UNK> have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak she was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released i think that the difference didn't matter for a suspense drama like vertigo but it does matter for a romantic comedy we can easily understand that is why his character would be attracted to hers but it's less clear why hers would be attracted to his br br still the movie works as a light romantic fantasy the scene where she stares at him across the <UNK> head with her dark painted on <UNK> <UNK> and the sounds of her <UNK> and the cat <UNK> is true magic it's a little jarring therefore when the scene shifts to the top of the <UNK> building and we see the age difference very <UNK> as he <UNK> her she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair but stops that motion and just <UNK> her <UNK> lightly against his <UNK>
<START> the brilliant thing about <UNK> i is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other <UNK> <UNK> is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15 16 i know some of the broad sheets stuck the knife into this film when it came out in cinemas but i saw it at a packed house in <UNK> and everybody seemed to really enjoy it i grew up in the forest of dean and this took me straight back to my <UNK> and <UNK> days had some great mates hate to think what they're all up to now probably running the local <UNK> i've watched it a couple of times on dvd and already i see the film as an old mate that will stay forever as part of my collection how can i like this film and the <UNK> doesn't seem right somehow i certainly edge towards the second half of this film and i think the social <UNK> scenes with the locals are brilliantly done i like the mix of the three lead characters and there really is some lovely writing in here along with some very <UNK> lines and dare i say a good <UNK> of integrity i have tried to obtain the soundtrack but it has not been released shame as it's a <UNK> someone told me it was originally a stage play not quite sure how that worked but i'm sure it was fun i liked the little <UNK> touches references that seem to crop up throughout the film also spotted the dylan thomas <UNK> as well and like all little gems there will always be little things to discover like the final scene giving a nod to <UNK> as they start they're next journey all in all a genuinely <UNK> piece of film making love it
<START> personally i couldn't get into <UNK> is not a love <UNK> its a brilliant film and there's a great story line to it i just found myself checking the time on my phone every two <UNK> to see how much was left of the film br br i love the relationship between spike and <UNK> there that close they depend on each other to get along in life at the same time i wish the relationship was more than what it is <UNK> is in love with spike but spike <UNK> in love with <UNK> or he doesn't know how to love him the acts of betrayal on both parts have a big effect on the two men they are both <UNK> by the fact that the other ran away and abandoned them at a time when they truly needed each other for survival
<START> fred claus somehow avoids becoming this year's the santa <UNK> by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that tim allen <UNK> but it doesn't mean that it's got enough going for it that's worth a trip to the theater br br as holiday movies go it's contrived and sentimental but actually that could be the least of one's concern as fred claus <UNK> of having david <UNK> shanghai knights the wedding <UNK> at the <UNK> contains virtually <UNK> a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily <UNK> the line between a <UNK> vince vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy christmas film in the end it amounts to not much of both and with a cast that <UNK> of paul <UNK> kevin spacey rachel <UNK> and kathy bates all the more it leaves one disappointed br br vaughn plays fred <UNK> <UNK> older and estranged brother who once upon a time left him and their parents bates and <UNK> <UNK> after having had enough of enduring his parents' <UNK> of his younger sibling nick grows up to be santa claus and as the voice over tells us time <UNK> on you and your family when you become a saint while fred becomes a <UNK> jaded <UNK> man in chicago who's having a hard time remembering his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> birthday br br he runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother who <UNK> looks at least a decade older than him to <UNK> him out of jail nick agrees but only if fred agrees to help out on the toy <UNK> business up in the north pole fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism <UNK> with santa and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nature even as an <UNK> expert spacey is checking on the toy factory <UNK> only too happy to have the whole <UNK> <UNK> shut down if things fail br br the film as said does have its moments but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration in between are <UNK> of christmas film clichés that were handled better in say <UNK> and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last year's <UNK> br br <UNK> as usual brings on his coarse charm to the table but the <UNK> script of dan <UNK> keeps him from really doing his thing <UNK> underneath the bad fat suit brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character but unfortunately has to play second <UNK> to fred spacey brings his game face but his turns usually end as <UNK> vapid br br ultimately fred claus becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve sure there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema but there are certainly far better ways
<START> in panic in the streets richard widmark plays u s navy doctor who has his week <UNK> interrupted with a corpse that contains plague as cop paul douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest that's not the issue here the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease br br as was pointed out by any number of people for some reason director <UNK> kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they're from <UNK> having been to new orleans where the story takes place i can personally <UNK> to that richard widmark and his wife barbara <UNK> <UNK> can be <UNK> because as a navy doctor he could be assigned there but for those that are natives it doesn't work br br but with plague out there and the news being kept a secret the new orleans <UNK> starts a <UNK> of the city's underworld the dead guy came off a ship from europe and he had underworld connections a new orleans wise guy played by jack palance jumps to a whole bunch of <UNK> conclusions and starts <UNK> a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague <UNK> palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice br br personally my favorite in this film is zero mostel this happened right before mostel was <UNK> and around that time he made a <UNK> of playing would be tough guys who are really <UNK> he plays the same kind of role in the <UNK> bogart film the <UNK> sadly i can kind of identify with mostel in that last chase scene where he and palance are being chased down by widmark douglas and half the new orleans police seeing the weight challenged zero trying to keep up with palance was something else because i'm kind of in <UNK> league now in the <UNK> department br br kazan kept the action going at a good clip there's very little down time in this film if there was any less it would be an indiana jones film panic in the streets won an oscar for best original screenplay that year br br kazan also made good use of the new orleans <UNK> and the french quarter some of the same kinds of shots are later used in on the <UNK> in fact panic in the streets is about people not <UNK> when they really should in their own best interest very similar again to on the <UNK> br br panic in the streets does everyone proud who was associated with it now why couldn't <UNK> kazan get some decent new orleans sounding people in the small roles
<START> i despise horror movies that is no secret no plot bad acting and <UNK> of blood are <UNK> of these mistakes of cinema and this movie is no exception i cannot believe some cable stations actually run this garbage this particular garbage was released straight to video as i recall as mentioning any other movie would be a great insult to that other movie i say this all of the phantasm movies all of the jason movies freddy movies <UNK> movies and most of the michael myers movies can be summed up in one word terrible br br rating phantasm iii 0 5 10
<START> well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that bore oh god i was totally <UNK> and <UNK> all the way through carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one don't consider her to be either ugly or <UNK> i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file <UNK> thinking it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the <UNK> that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this <UNK> best
<START> steven spielberg produced wrote came up with ideas for and even directed episodes of amazing stories so naturally this would have to be the greatest anthology ever right unfortunately wrong some episodes are just fantastic but all too often it was a mixed bag in fact that might have been it's downfall is it was way too mixed some episodes were light comedies some were dramas some were horror and one was even animated which made this a similar but not as good 80s version of the twilight zone which also was around br br normally i'd like having a mixture of stories in an anthology show but they just didn't fully work here some of the more <UNK> dramatic episodes felt like they would be better being shown late on night on the lifetime network like the episode ghost train which was directed by spielberg himself in that episode it gave the message of hope and gave us a fantasy story but overall it was just a build up to the ending which didn't blow me away anyways the horror episodes tended to work better than the drama but there were far more dramatic ones and they grow <UNK> to watch acting wise this anthology got some big stars similar to the original twilight zone kevin <UNK> <UNK> sutherland <UNK> <UNK> dom <UNK> harvey keitel beau bridges charlie sheen forrest <UNK> tim robbins john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> danny <UNK> patrick <UNK> christopher lloyd june <UNK> kathy baker weird al <UNK> and many other well <UNK> have been in episodes of the show it's fun to see well known actors in almost every episode of the series great directors have also had part in episodes including spielberg himself clint eastwood burt reynolds bob clark joe <UNK> mick <UNK> paul <UNK> joe <UNK> robert <UNK> danny <UNK> and even martin scorsese i'd actually recommend this more to fans of the directors and or the 80s than anyone else br br amazing stories was sometimes amazing usually good occasionally mediocre and every once in a while a real stinker came out but this show has nostalgic value to me and it's sort of fun to sit on boring <UNK> and watch some episodes john <UNK> theme music for the show is sure to be caught in anyone's head who watches this too br br my rating good show 30 mins per episode <UNK>
<START> i was drawn to this movie the moment i saw a preview of it on oscar night when i read about kay <UNK> i was hooked we americans are <UNK> for a comeback kid br br i understand this movie was a huge draw in sweden as a very <UNK> american i can only <UNK> on the reason perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the lena character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social comment but perhaps it is because of the central message which i believe has the same appeal everywhere in <UNK> societies br br the message of this movie for me is the same as the movie titanic life is short people and as far as anyone really knows it's all we've got it can be taken away at any time so isn't it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls <UNK> us from other people because we're so afraid of being hurt <UNK> down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls feeling alive is worth taking the risk give and you will receive so start living now br br many people are <UNK> this movie for it's lack of characterization and other flaws i say you are all pseudo sophisticated get a grip folks it's a <UNK> a fable for we <UNK> <UNK> who are <UNK> rich but whose souls are in <UNK> poverty br br so join a choir or a band or help build <UNK> or <UNK> food for those less fortunate than you spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you get out and <UNK> with your fellow man writing a check is not enough we are a social species by the way even the <UNK> of your fellow human beings can affect you in ways you never thought possible br br rugged <UNK> has its place but it is over rated
<START> sometimes a premise starts out good but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention <UNK> disorder it <UNK> into an <UNK> mess and for three well respected actors who have made better work before and after this is a mortal shame br br so let's see premise a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop interesting to say the least make the <UNK> cop a little disturbing why not it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female and it's a proved ticket to a successful thriller br br now <UNK> lies the dilemma create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous or throw any semblance to reality <UNK> up the shock factor and make this cop so extreme an ultra bad variation of every other super villain that's hit cinemas since the silent age br br the producers and directors chose the latter thus is the resulting film badly made with actors trying their <UNK> to make heads or <UNK> in roles that they've <UNK> before and nothing much <UNK> to even less
<START> what can i say ms erika <UNK> is my favorite blonde girl ever and like a italian american fan number one of female beauty i can't forget this movie br br you know i really don't remember a lot about the plot or the situations or the other actors i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous erika and that in this film she looks better than ever i really don't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in brooklyn just <UNK> <UNK> beauty br br well just to conclude if you are an erika <UNK> beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you
<START> so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless i know it got awards and things but i personally did not enjoy it too much there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested just a bunch of <UNK> and their jobs some of the people in are rather different which isn't a bad thing it just didn't leave a good impression on me i was thoroughly bored by this movie no offense to my creative writing teacher the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didn't get it and <UNK> and lion <UNK> is definitely not my thing the green animals thing was neat i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers but how did these four jobs connect it just didn't make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that but if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it who am i to stand in your way i am just <UNK> you about possible suffering

<START> i remember i loved this movie when it came out i was 12 years old had a <UNK> 64 and loved to play rambo on it i was therefore really thrilled when i got to buy this movie really cheap i put it in my vcr and started up man this movie is really bad <UNK> stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie except for that awful sentimental speech at the end and has the same expression on his face all the way and that stupid love thing in the middle it's just so amazingly predictable i just ended up fast <UNK> the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else
<START> title zombie 3 1988 br br directors mostly lucio fulci but also <UNK> <UNK> and bruno mattei br br cast <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ring <UNK> <UNK> br br review br br to review this flick and get some good background of it i gotta start by the beginning and the beginning of this is really george <UNK> dawn of the dead when dawn came out in <UNK> lucio fulci decided to make an <UNK> sequel to it and call it zombie 2 that film is the one we know as plain <UNK> zombie you know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark ok so after that flick named zombie 2 in italy came out and made a huge <UNK> of cash the italians decided heck lets make some more zombie flicks these things are <UNK> in the <UNK> so zombie 3 was born confused yet the story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we've seen in a lot of american zombie flicks that we have seen before this one the best comparison that comes to mind is return of the living dead lets see there's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies <UNK> gets released into the general population and <UNK> we get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh a bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel they gotta fight the zombies to survive br br there was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie first and foremost lucio fulci the beloved godfather of gore from italy was sick so he couldn't really finish this film the way that he wanted to the film was then handed down to two lesser directors bruno mattei hell of the living dead and <UNK> <UNK> zombie 4 they did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good you see fulci himself didn't really have his heart and soul on this flick he was <UNK> with it he gave the flick over to the producers and basically said do whatever the hell you want with it and god love them they did br br and that is why ladies and <UNK> we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great fulci credited as its director the main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore there's no substance to it whatsoever after the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies now in some cases this can prove to be fun if 1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and 2 there's a lot of gore and guts involved br br here we get neither well there's some inspired moments in there like for example when some <UNK> get infected by the gas and they start attacking people that was cool there's also a scene involving a flying zombie head <UNK> by the way defies all logic and explanation and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and <UNK> off a poor girls legs but aside from that the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass br br endless upon endless scenes that don't do jack to move the already non existent plot along that was my main <UNK> with this flick the sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non existent i hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished i like my b movies but this one just really went even below that its closer to a z level flick if you ask me br br the zombie make up pure crap the zombies are all asian actors the movie was filmed in the <UNK> so you get a bunch of asian looking zombies but thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the <UNK> islands anyway its the look of the zombies that really sucks they all died with the same clothes on for some reason and what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up more like <UNK> on their faces one or two zombies had slightly more complex make up but it still wasn't good enough to impress its just a bunch of goo <UNK> <UNK> on the actors faces so not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap these are supposed to be dead folks <UNK> for those expecting the usual <UNK> in a fulci flick don't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else's flick and those two involved mattei and <UNK> didn't really put there heart and souls into it in fact when you see the extras on the dvd you will see that when <UNK> is asked about his <UNK> and his feelings on this here flick he doesn't even take it to seriously you can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they just had a job to do and they did it and that my friends is the last nail on this flick there's no love and no heart put into making this film therefore you get a half <UNK> crappy zombie flick br br only for <UNK> or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made everybody else don't even bother rating 1 out of 5
<START> what starts out as an interesting story quickly <UNK> into nothing don't bother watching to the end hoping for an explanation of what is stalking the <UNK> there is no ending no explanation no resolution <UNK> this could have been a good movie it they had purchased an entire script
<START> set in <UNK> <UNK> island feeding the masses tries to be a <UNK> look at the role of the media in government at best it could be applied to how the us try to control media during the iraq war but it ends up feeling hollow there's never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good worst the direction of the movie is atrocious focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond isn't this an odd way to hold the camera special effects are pretty bad at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city and it's laughable at best br br the film does have a couple bright spots namely the <UNK> for post zombie services including a <UNK> service and a party bus but it's far too little to make the film worthwhile br br for a better zombie film try hide and creep it has the same weak production value but there's much more wit humor and talent behind it
<START> i will <UNK> of with the plot alice having survived the previous <UNK> of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the <UNK> murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of <UNK> unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son this movie did start of really well as we see alice dreaming of being amanda <UNK> who get stuck in room and get raped by 100 <UNK> then she being rushed to hospital but then she not longer the pregnant lady but then she amanda giving birth to freddy again br br alice and dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then have gotten some new friends its' no long before freddy start to kill again i did like the first dead it okay not as good as the other deaths or dreams br br freddy himself didn't seem to be scary in this movie at all the nightmare were just boring really they were not scary or creepy at all br br acting in movies was okay for a <UNK> movie in the series but overall i think this movie was really dull still not worst movie of the series freddy dead is the worst br br 4 10
<START> the only time i have seen this movie was when i was 10 years old i have remembered it all of these years as i couldn't sleep for a week or more after seeing it it just absolutely <UNK> me i was on vacation with my aunts in <UNK> worth texas and i will never forget it now 48 years later my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it i very much enjoyed it but it gave me quite a scare <UNK>
<START> a number of posters have commented on the <UNK> conclusion this is always a problem with long complex dramas crime is essentially banal so the pay off is always anti climactic whilst detailed exposition <UNK> from the human drama the writer has used a number of clever devices to try and get round this but has not been entirely successful answers to precisely what happened and why may have been <UNK> but if so they are well buried the viewer inevitably feels a little cheated br br but in a sense this is <UNK> the drama was never about the crime or even the investigation it was about the impact of events on the lives of those involved the family the <UNK> the witnesses the press and as such it was gripping the writing was a significant cut above the run of the mill for prime time drama and the performances uniformly good in an ensemble piece it is <UNK> to focus on individuals but penelope <UNK> deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as the mother wife daughter and janet <UNK> was in cracking form as a hard bitten old cop br br one of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of race as the elephant in the room that no one is prepared to mention subtle powerful stuff
<START> this movie is just plain bad weak story weak directing and below average acting the thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising constantly for a well known internet <UNK> it is obvious some scenes are written to do just that advertising this movie is a slap in the face to anyone who <UNK> money for this br br do not watch this it not worth your time
<START> this tv film tells the story of <UNK> <UNK> suddenly returning to <UNK> hope to visit friends and family but unaware of her mother's death her sister runs the family home but is <UNK> to sell it and move away with her new husband <UNK> strongly objects to the idea and <UNK> to keep the family <UNK> as it were by getting a job and maintaining responsibility br br in comes handsome <UNK> and the two soon fall in love as you do and it's from this point that i sort of lost interest br br there is more to farrah fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like <UNK> and small <UNK> a great performance from the legendary charlie's angel br br <UNK> hope is the type of film that never <UNK> away from its cheap and cheerful tv image and you know there was a limit to the budget but it's not the worst film ever made the positive aspects are there you just have to find them
<START> i remember that show i still remember that kick ass fun song america's funniest people frankly it should've been titled <UNK> lame or unfunny or downright disgusting people dave couldn't save this show and neither could bob <UNK> or the replacement <UNK> for <UNK> that came later the <UNK> segments were hilarious and yes dave could make some good voice overs that were better than <UNK> but this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people <UNK> also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the <UNK> twins plus <UNK> was in it's prime before they started picking the <UNK> ugly as sin babies as the winner did i mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame but still the theme song rocks
<START> now i have seen a lot of movies in my day but out of every single one there have been a very <UNK> few that have been really good to me and i'm a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies almost all the acting is believable the graphics are decent for which you won't even be caring about as you watch the movie trust me <UNK> about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kids br br here's basically what this movie made me to it one made me laugh a lot two made me feel for the characters like you're suppose to and three it's a very uplifting story by the end of this movie you will feel good sure what anime out there hasn't featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil it's a formula that is used a lot but in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you'd see 5 years ago the appearance of it is not to be judged it's very touching the ending is original and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to if you however try comparing this to other movies like the never ending story or whatever it will diverse your opinion watch it as it is and you will enjoy it br br it has been a good long while since i've been impressed like this the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw <UNK> way back when it came out there is something about this movie i felt about <UNK> that really made me love it so don't over analyze or take this movie too seriously just enjoy it
<START> originally aired as an abc movie of the week this involves two young innocent female college students who are <UNK> into a prison camp in a little southern town they aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there what follows is rape torture <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> leading to a very disturbing conclusion br br the tv version was for its time grim no nudity and the <UNK> were pretty tame but the overall feeling of <UNK> wore one down the <UNK> version is even worse there's <UNK> nudity the violence is extreme and in one particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard uses her <UNK> there's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink you get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and <UNK> all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it the needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help br br i'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good but that actually makes the movie harder to watch a sick sleazy film not recommended
<START> this is a movie about making a movie such movies may be entertaining but they need some substance to do so it did not happen here i am afraid mr coppola did not <UNK> his father's skills unfortunately neither did his sister who can however make movies which one might watch br br i do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews br br let's see the lead male actor supposedly a director is as <UNK> as a frozen <UNK> and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes the plot is totally <UNK> in bits with perhaps one single connecting element the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than <UNK> rocks would that be enough br br i <UNK> every single moment i watched this movie a walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie it's as if a <UNK> <UNK> plot were directed by dick <UNK> br br brazil some other classic sf movies you must be really joking
<START> and <UNK> <UNK> buffs too will love her loud <UNK> <UNK> as the wicked witch <UNK> but this cartoon sequel to the wizard of oz is <UNK> of real imagination <UNK> fantasy and excitement with <UNK> action and cheaply repeating its footage like a bad music video little dorothy is <UNK> back to oz which has gone to ruin and meets old and new friends the <UNK> animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest walt disney and the less inspired shows from <UNK> <UNK> however many of the songs are good particularly <UNK> sweet <UNK> it's a far away land superbly performed by <UNK> minnelli you can count on minnelli for energy which is why the movie <UNK> up whenever dorothy is around much of it is <UNK> and i'm not even sure baby <UNK> will get a charge from it since it has been out of <UNK> for so long as a curiosity item just fair from
<START> this movie was very very strange and very very funny all of the actors are quite real and very odd the overall look of the film was different too sort of dreamy and <UNK> out which only added to the spacey <UNK> weird vibe of the whole thing br br it's not for everyone i mean it's not what you would call mainstream but that is what i liked about it it's unlike anything i have ever seen before unpredictable with a weird rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places the kids are so <UNK> goofy and <UNK> that you can't help but feel for them in other words these are far from <UNK> versions of teenagers br br all of which for me makes it a good thing
<START> i saw that when i was little and it was excellent <UNK> white as lisa and the <UNK> <UNK> where cute susan <UNK> as <UNK> and sandra dee <UNK> as <UNK> where <UNK> karen <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> was interesting <UNK> ross as little bunny <UNK> <UNK> was funny gregory <UNK> as <UNK> was brilliant whats <UNK> that <UNK> and <UNK> eat too much candy whats sad that little bunny <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> on the head then by a fairy will give little bunny <UNK> <UNK> few wishes then he turns into <UNK> this story is about when lisa <UNK> <UNK> go to the big rock candy mountains this show is excellent the kids will like this show new words songs and watching them playing
<START> this is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it just looks so horribly bad and indeed we couldn't take most of it there was a lot of fast <UNK> going on br br but then we came across a scene where robert englund <UNK> the female protagonist her name somehow slips my mind at this time <UNK> i've never watched a single scene from a film so many times i'm <UNK> forty or so and i've never laughed so hard in my life you see englund has this thing for showing off his <UNK> i last saw the film a couple months ago but i can't stop laughing as i type anyway the scene is a montage of shots englund ripping off the <UNK> of the girl englund riding a horse naked and some mysterious woman <UNK> a <UNK> head this is absolute genius you've got to see it for yourself
<START> i will say that at least the movie makes sense but it's bad the acting for the most part is not good i think only sky showed any promise and you feel awkward watching it all of the scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow like when <UNK> comes out to her parents there are a lot of corny details like the <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> shoulder the <UNK> on the girls' <UNK> and the god awful <UNK> at the sets and the music and clothes and everything real life has never been like this movie the boy says at one point i'm gay not corny and not aware even the commentary is awful i turned it off after <UNK> talks about how she was <UNK> out playing a lesbian
<START> in what is arguably the best <UNK> adventure film of all time four city guys confront <UNK> wrath in a story of survival the setting is backwoods georgia with its <UNK> mountains and wild rivers br br the director john <UNK> chose to use local people not actors to portray secondary characters these locals <UNK> the film with a depth of characterization <UNK> in film history no central casting actors could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces voices or actions i don't recall a film <UNK> the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful as much as anything else it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing br br another strength is the film's theme nature in the wild can be violent how appropriate that the setting should be the american south very few places in the u s are or have been as violent as redneck country in a story about <UNK> survival of the <UNK> the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature not separate from it br br deliverance is very much a product of its time when unlike today americans expressed concern over a <UNK> wilderness the film's magnificent scenery the sounds of birds <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> of the river <UNK> combined with the absence of civilization all convey an <UNK> message and that is another strength of the film br br at an entertainment level the tension gradually <UNK> as the plot proceeds not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme and then never lets up not until the final credits roll very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot br br finally the film's technical quality is <UNK> direction and editing are flawless cinematography is excellent dialogue is interesting and the acting is terrific burt reynolds has never been better ned beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job and jon voight should have been nominated for an oscar if there is a weak link in the film it is the music which strikes me as <UNK> br br overall deliverance almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like <UNK> adventure even for those who don't the gritty characterizations the acting and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film one of the finest in cinema history
<START> i have just watched the whole 6 episodes on dvd the acting throughout is excellent no question there was not quite enough action for me i must say no real suspense as such just plenty of first class character development nothing like <UNK> <UNK> in terms of <UNK> if you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you peter <UNK> as the lead <UNK> <UNK> is excellent br br the film portrayed the life of a <UNK> a man who should have been a loyal member of the british intelligence service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things as a child he <UNK> his father but his father was exposed time time again as a crook and a con man <UNK> betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to <UNK> those closest to him wife son mentor <UNK> is <UNK> damaged by his father's influence it has eaten his moral <UNK> away he has no real love or loyalty in him br br heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series very well done though
<START> i haven't seen henry fool but after watching fay grim i'm not sure i want to maybe hartley aims to be the anti thriller director he sure succeeded with this <UNK> based on the official description woman discovers that her dead husband's <UNK> contains material that could pose a threat to national security i expected a taut <UNK> drama instead i got flimsy structure goofy dialog <UNK> characterizations a convoluted plot and a tone that shifts so often it suggests that hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time i can hang for a long time with a frustrating hard to follow plot e g <UNK> because i figure that the loose ends eventually will come together even when they don't or they do but they leave lingering questions e g <UNK> sharp writing and acting can hold one's interest but half way through fay grim i reached a deadly realization i didn't know what was going on and i didn't care too bad because i really like parker posey reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to <UNK> from indifferent estranged wife and indifferent clueless mother to tough <UNK> international player capable of psychological <UNK> a <UNK> with terrorists there's also bad casting jeff goldblum can be very good but he's not capable of <UNK> <UNK> as a cia <UNK> he looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as i was watching him in it his cia sidekick is worse he looks like a <UNK> from the <UNK> of american idol are there really young cia agents with big <UNK> of hair <UNK> <UNK> over their <UNK> then there's the <UNK> question of the characters' ages goldblum was <UNK> when he made fay grim thomas jay ryan who plays henry fool was <UNK> neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages yet a key point in the story is that they served as cia agents in <UNK> back in the '70s <UNK> character would've been in his <UNK> then henry fool would've been a teenager was hartley being quirky or lazy the problems are too numerous to list
<START> <UNK> <UNK> made a very precise critics of this film in the <UNK> the <UNK> night www <UNK> net br br a critics which shows how france was behind all the situation <UNK> by the united nations in <UNK> br br the un soldiers were in a dangerous situation while the french soldiers were <UNK> welcomed by the <UNK> forces br br the day before ten un soldiers had been killed by the <UNK> forces br br that is why the un soldiers decided to protect their own lives by driving behind the french <UNK> br br by doing so they gave up the <UNK> which is unforgivable of course br br but we must keep in mind that the french soldiers organized this situation
<START> unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there's nothing to spoil about that movie even if b mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and <UNK> that made him a fun <UNK> director but for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it this film is just empty nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min no sex no blood it's suppose to be about snuff no actors no dialogs just as bad as an <UNK> v film it's even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics so rest in peace bruno you will stay in our minds forever anyway thanks to such unforgettable gems as zombi 3 <UNK> rats <UNK> <UNK> virus cruel jaws and few others so except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess <UNK> <UNK> new film pass on this one but if you don't know this nice <UNK> career track down his old films and have fun
<START> watching a <UNK> replay of about 8 various 1994 1997 spider man cartoons made me realize why i couldn't stomach it when it first came out br br i'm from the old school where the 1967 spider man cartoon was the best and still remains the best i won't get into the psychedelic version which is terrible give me traditional villains please br br the acting in the new stuff is lousy read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting paul soles where are you now this guy was the best at voice acting for spider man no one comes close watching secret wars a great idea for a cartoon mini series made me <UNK> dr doom sounds like a comedy version of bela lugosi in a scene with red skull and doc <UNK> red skull has no german accent while <UNK> is heavy russian the old marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting iron man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask captain america sounded <UNK> not like some teenage kid paul <UNK> as the thing in the 60s was the best thing ever the old voice actors were <UNK> and there will never be anyone like them ever hear mel <UNK> son no way can he <UNK> his dad br br the animation is clunky okay so they have all the fancy character <UNK> and nicely painted <UNK> sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic i really don't think any of these animators know what in <UNK> are br br the stories are badly written and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible why for example when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other in secret wars it was a lame excuse that got them in <UNK> i can see if the hero was dark unknown and mysterious like the <UNK> but why the thing and iron man can't hold their <UNK> with each other is ridiculous then the torch joins in this is just another of the later comic <UNK> to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because <UNK> wants to see that stuff give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off but hey what are you doing here and you don't tell me what to do are lame reasons another badly written scene is in the wedding where harry <UNK> <UNK> himself to spoil <UNK> wedding that whole scenario was awful br br last but certainly not least is what another critic calls juvenile violence meaning no punches at all in secret wars the lizard carefully <UNK> the <UNK> charge but the thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics he must simply <UNK> to <UNK> heavy things and <UNK> a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons sure these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12 that's why they can't have <UNK> because <UNK> and daddy don't believe in that type of violence but you can blow things up these cartoons will include that as a kid before political correctness came in fashion i saw cartoons <UNK> each other what's wrong with a punch to the chops is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and <UNK> new cartoons took out the punch i find this the most insulting of all when i watch the new stuff they've written out the <UNK> because we could all hurt ourselves br br kids enjoy these cartoons all you want i've seen enough br br 3 10 rating
<START> the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a slow moody but touching account of a tragedy that <UNK> a farm family the film is more or less an <UNK> of <UNK> stoic values and <UNK> of emotion the film will not be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it ok br br in the early moments of the film we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some <UNK> and maybe shoot a duck or two if they're lucky while climbing through a <UNK> wire fence the gun accidentally <UNK> and the younger boy <UNK> shoots his older brother these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him the gun through the fence the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence br br anyway once his brother is killed 12 <UNK> old arnold <UNK> into his own world he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he simply goes ahead and picks the <UNK> and tells his family about the accident later at no point during the funeral or <UNK> does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family seems to <UNK> him perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother an <UNK> uncle played by <UNK> forrest is <UNK> upset with arnold even though the older brother's death allows him to hit on the kid's girlfriend <UNK> parents don't seem to understand how to deal with their son they really don't even try to talk to him about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical <UNK> skill by <UNK> <UNK> after a while arnold even moves in with the old <UNK> br br nothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno <UNK> to inexplicably look up his <UNK> ex wife once he meets her he begins to emerge from his shell after <UNK> to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the family's turmoil with the accident from here on the film becomes a quick study in <UNK> and <UNK> br br the acting is <UNK> distant in most cases robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to channel paul <UNK> performance in <UNK> the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody pictures about common folk this one may be for you some even may be advised to bring some <UNK> 8 of 10 stars br br the <UNK>
<START> this ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's hippie mentality in a nut shell and <UNK> us in the process its an attempt to <UNK> absurd <UNK> of young innocent women with old age sex <UNK> and wash ups a naive young <UNK> played by the <UNK> like kay <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and sleeps with all the wrong guys and then one day she meets the ridiculous <UNK> already in old age hard <UNK> drinking and washed up as an actor and she decides that she is in love with him if you think that is superficial the whole film <UNK> such scenes she keeps saying how much she loves him and she only met him it wears thin and really quick i couldn't help but laugh throughout the film its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place a disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex i had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit a corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film avoid this if you can grade d
<START> this film was basically <UNK> <UNK> if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t v movie the film lacks what <UNK> <UNK> had which was good acting writing and basically everything else the film had some of the worst writing i've seen since wild wild west it definitely needed to be interesting i know <UNK> 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn't and feel flat on it's face
<START> it's hard for me to <UNK> the fair number of stars to this film but i settled on 8 because of its high production values and what was in 1968 an innovative approach to the war film remember too that i haven't seen it since 1969 but it did make a strong impression br br the long day's dying must be one of the most vivid <UNK> films ever made it achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in <UNK> europe in 1944 45 no film before this one showed war at the <UNK> squad level with so much brutal detail and all in a <UNK> <UNK> way that lets the actions speak for themselves there is no preaching no sentimentality no comic relief no complicated scenarios br br unfortunately there's no subtlety either partly because of their situation trying to stay alive the characters come across as flat familiar <UNK> as entertainment the film doesn't make it though it was clearly not intended to entertain it was intended to slug you over the head with the misery and horror of world war ii and modern war in general this was twenty years before platoon and thirty before saving private ryan both of which are far more watchable films here the flat and generally <UNK> characters the lack of an actual plot and the realistically unpleasant images including what may be the first on screen vomit in theatrical history make the film hard to sit through though it is only 95 minutes br br so 10 stars for production and realism 4 stars for the feeling you'll have when it's over a bonus star for having its heart in the right place average 8 br br like carl <UNK> underrated the <UNK> an equally downbeat but more interesting and thought provoking film the long day's dying seems not to be on dvd why not both films have been on cable a number of times
<START> after playing a <UNK> in written on the wind dorothy malone finally said good bye to her sweet sister wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play <UNK> with the best of them she and gloria <UNK> played the same sort of <UNK> and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role malone won a best supporting actress oscar br br the film she's in is not quite up to oscar standards but it is a strong enough melodrama under douglas <UNK> capable hands there's an almost <UNK> look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the <UNK> fireworks in a story that has rock hudson lauren bacall robert stack and dorothy malone as its <UNK> br br domestic <UNK> among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama with the accent on the strong supporting players stack and malone both of them <UNK> the opportunity with both hands and stack too should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives br br the <UNK> stars have less impressive work to do but do it with their usual skill and conviction hudson and bacall they play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding br br the use of color is particularly striking as it usually is in a sirk film and yet it doesn't <UNK> me from thinking of the film as a technicolor film noir in the vein of leave her to heaven br br well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast
<START> fantastic movie one to <UNK> all 5 senses is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information true hollywood conventions used like playing a list and very attractive actors as the <UNK> such as <UNK> <UNK> julia cook ned kelly's lover heath ledger ned and orlando bloom joe <UNK> <UNK> right hand man and unattractive sorry geoffrey rush actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force this also <UNK> a very <UNK> love story into the mix between ned ledger and julia cook <UNK> to <UNK> all the <UNK> females being especially <UNK> even from the first scene when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him sunshine and had a <UNK> in his eye as he looked down at me his hand on me shoulder it is very <UNK> and <UNK> viewers to side with ned kelly the underdog besides don't all <UNK> love an underdog
<START> really i think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film in fact the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining br br yes the script is a little convoluted but that's the genre the film has a <UNK> atmosphere centered around a femme fatale just like all the old noir classics this too has a screenplay that twists you around so that you don't always know how to make sense of it at first and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together that's the genre in general the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and in turn surprised without <UNK> the viewer br br sharon stone is also an easy target the truth is she looks great and she speaks her double <UNK> laden dialog in such a way as to <UNK> it up into something mysterious sexy and fun br br the direction is more than passable because let's face it you have to keep an audience interested in the did she or didn't she question for two hours in addition to a <UNK> script and a fun performance by stone this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a <UNK> atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time with straight industrial lines to go along with <UNK> sexy <UNK> the frame is always beautiful press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye br br the film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real particularly the sex <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> how shocking becomes treated more matter of <UNK> here and typically the sexuality of the film is used to better effect it is still <UNK> but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first i won't say that it isn't still somewhat of a gimmick because let's face it this film is supposed to be fun br br and a fun film it is it may be an easy target but if you watch it for what it is a <UNK> femme fatale driven <UNK> sexy did she or didn't she who <UNK> you're bound to enjoy it no pun intended
<START> this obscure de <UNK> delivers the goods and it is said the meek shall <UNK> the earth this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war they are homeless but cheerful in a societies too <UNK> and selfish to care for or acknowledge them <UNK> for the italian <UNK> de <UNK> chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a cinderella story i have not read the book it is based on so i cannot <UNK> if the <UNK> ex <UNK> is the <UNK> of the writer or <UNK> it begins with the words once upon a time to <UNK> the <UNK> of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere caricature sketches of the <UNK> that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this <UNK> a delight for all de <UNK> most accessible picture is also one of his best <UNK> neo realism he always <UNK> between that and pure good old film making he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i am a member of a <UNK> club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is <UNK> with the <UNK> and <UNK> of the experience as we put our <UNK> into the water <UNK> echo in the back of the conscious mind this movie is timeless because it <UNK> philosophical of <UNK> place in nature and <UNK> effect upon man's relationship with nature we see it in the bow fishing we see it in the home made <UNK> there is also city man's disdain and feeling of <UNK> to the rural <UNK> cracker the fact that the <UNK> from <UNK> ned beatty has bad teeth is meant to put him on the same level with the <UNK> who also have bad teeth ultimately the struggle of life and death <UNK> <UNK> man's <UNK> about the law this <UNK> trip ends too soon for the viewer but alas not soon enough for the characters
<START> warning may contain spoilers which will be more entertaining than this tripe br br <UNK> some good advise to anyone living in the u k whenever channel 5 has an old 80's comedy on late at night read a book instead i am currently in the process of recovering from a <UNK> due to reading some of the comments on this film on here i am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic all i can say is thank god the cold war never <UNK> or else we might as well have given the <UNK> our borders i found this film dire in the <UNK> <UNK> maybe it is just my british perception of what makes a film funny who knows but in all aspects this film is not just awful its teeth <UNK> terrible br br i've never been a fan of bill murray and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him don't get me wrong i loved <UNK> which was made only three years after this film but this just sums bill murray up really i can safely say that i haven't wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of operation <UNK> force over here though these two films have more in common than you would think for 1 thing they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end and 2nd they are both <UNK> with cheesy <UNK> throughout br br <UNK> one thing these guys are supposed to be in the u s army yet they are allowed to <UNK> around their camp willy <UNK> <UNK> female military police officers and subsequently <UNK> them silly in the <UNK> quarters talk about random this film is just terrible for this i'm afraid now don't get me wrong i'm no feminist <UNK> but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after <UNK> them letting them go free twice is just insulting to the female race the fact that one <UNK> haired fat <UNK> bum <UNK> and his hapless sidekick <UNK> can simply sweet talk themselves into into the <UNK> underwear to which they fall <UNK> in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrous br br then there is the training scenes where you get to meet the squad <UNK> who <UNK> threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff followed by the overweight bloke played by the late and great john candy who claims he joined the army to avoid paying 400 for anger management classes leading to loud mouthed murray paying tribute to the giant toe wtf <UNK> <UNK> who honestly couldn't <UNK> a <UNK> up in a <UNK> let alone his band of <UNK> all this scene serves to do is to <UNK> loads of fight scenes with people saying way to go ass <UNK> all the time etc etc br br the scenes then carry on showing the <UNK> tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the assault course leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle <UNK> a watch tower with bullets just like that yep told you this film was random he miraculously escapes <UNK> as well eventually leading up the the passing out parade where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours <UNK> me miracle thanks to some wise words from murray to which they then direct a <UNK> none military like dance routine in front of a <UNK> <UNK> in front of the rest of the <UNK> all of this to the immense pleasure of their two girlfriends on the stand who really should've been <UNK> them everyone laughs it off though this bit is nothing short of amazing though he then chooses them to guard a new multi million dollar prototype <UNK> vehicle in italy which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of <UNK> on the inside claiming this is exactly what this army needs <UNK> br br then there is the dire finale where murray and <UNK> decide to steal this top secret prototype military vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat <UNK> <UNK> girlfriends in germany to which the hapless captain john <UNK> then finds out and leads the squad of fresh <UNK> on a <UNK> mission for this vehicle to which they then take a wrong turn en route and end up in soviet held <UNK> where they are captured like we didn't see that coming thus begins a rescue attempt by <UNK> and murray birds in hand to which is where a big fight loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up with them coming back as national heroes <UNK> the russians by calling them <UNK> etc etc the end thats right no <UNK> martial nothing they only just stole a prototype military vehicle drove it into a <UNK> <UNK> country and almost caused an international incident which could've <UNK> <UNK> br br this film is honestly more fun that being <UNK> with a <UNK> illness i know its meant to be a comedy it got all the right actors for it but where in the hell is it have channel 5 cuts those bits out the only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking <UNK> and female mud wrestling like i said random not that it helps to <UNK> from the fact that this is an utterly crap film of course this film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year <UNK> sadly we have to watch it instead 1 star out of 10 total tripe my advice do something a little more useful with your time like <UNK> yourself
<START> audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching a full <UNK> beautiful full length technicolor film i can't say for sure but this might have been the first one 3 strip at any rate it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on dvd in fact just how good it looks is amazing br br kudos for that have to go out to director richard <UNK> director of photography <UNK> miller <UNK> international pictures and for the dvd mgm home entertainment all of them combined to give us one of the best looking films of the classic era age br br i thought the story was so so excellent in the first half <UNK> in the second it gave a nice message in the end even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it i can't say more without spoiling things br br marlene <UNK> never looked better i don't believe and certainly never played such a soft hearted character <UNK> <UNK> heart <UNK> charles boyer was the male star and <UNK> object of affection but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me people like joseph <UNK> as <UNK> john carradine as the sand <UNK> the most memorable to me at least was the dancer <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> wow there is a face and a dance you won't soon forget i've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films i've viewed just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the dvd looking at her imdb resume she was only in four movies but they were all well known films br br basil <UNK> the actor who really became famous for playing sherlock holmes also is in here as is c <UNK> smith another famous british actor of his day <UNK> by the way will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit the shop around the corner with jimmy stewart and margaret sullivan br br the beautiful direction photography and color and <UNK> dance are the things i'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not so good things all rolled into one had the last half hour been better although i admire the ending i would have rated it even higher it's definitely one film <UNK> want to add to their collection
<START> this film in my opinion is despite it's flaws which i maintain are few an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art br br what mr bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and <UNK> as a director of animated films he does not receive 1 <UNK> of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience if it were not for mr bakshi i don't believe animation would have survived the disney <UNK> what is more with the lord of the rings he has not only created a beautiful animated film but he has created an entirely new art form unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground br br most people will complain about the use of <UNK> in the film the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of <UNK> to full blown animation but i feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm no this is not disney animation no it's not live action no it's not cheating what it is is a new fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form something so fresh and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as the lord of the rings bakshi's <UNK> use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way in particular the darker of <UNK> creatures particularly the <UNK> are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish br br peter s <UNK> screenplay based very little as i understand it on an early draft by chris <UNK> is a very loyal adaptation of <UNK> works where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3 4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film but there are very few changes to the storyline there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled the <UNK> of <UNK> the gifts of <UNK> the <UNK> at the battle of the <UNK> but again with the time limitations he had already the longest animated feature in history these are certainly understandable though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel br br also there is the delightful one of my favorites score by leonard <UNK> who also scored barry <UNK> and star trek iv the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work it is <UNK> and <UNK> and dare i say perfect it stands on it's own as an <UNK> triumph but when coupled with the images of the film it enters a whole new world of <UNK> perfection so far from the typical <UNK> fare that it turns many people off br br the voice actors are wonderful of particular note is john hurt as <UNK> who just <UNK> the essence of <UNK> br br the character design is also wonderfully unique though not often to everyone's taste but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he she <UNK> not what you might have imagined and so <UNK> is realized with a distinctive native american feel and <UNK> appears in <UNK> inspired <UNK> this is perhaps not what you imagined but i can only applaud mr bakshi for showing us what he saw it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with <UNK> <UNK> in developing the character outfits for the film br br one <UNK> word the flight to the ford sequence in my opinion is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment and his <UNK> is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build bakshi's artistic ability and <UNK> incredible work <UNK> in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be <UNK> br br the recent dvd release 2001 by warner brothers is sorely lacking while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format the package is woefully short of extras how glorious it would have been to have had a director's commentary been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible <UNK> at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple <UNK> which occurred in the very final frames of the film this version is <UNK> and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score br br of course the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made we will never be able to see bakshi's interpretation of <UNK> of <UNK> of <UNK> of the cracks of doom of <UNK> battle with the witch king or <UNK> confrontation with him we will never be <UNK> with bakshi's image of <UNK> or the <UNK> or the paths of the dead it is a shame beyond all <UNK> that we will in the end have to accept peter jackson's <UNK> and <UNK> hollywood action film version of these later events in <UNK> masterpiece but i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all br br david
<START> while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike's later films this is a very good crime drama br br the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster <UNK> things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust its this <UNK> and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film it is a very very good one this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don't mind a no frantic pace br br a word of warning the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty there are also semi graphic depictions of gay sex if thats not your cup of tea proceed with caution br br 7 or 8 out of 10
<START> there is only one thing essential to <UNK> appreciation of the indian runner <UNK> your <UNK> <UNK> inside is there evidence of a y <UNK> okay you'll do br br this film has all the male <UNK> blood guns car chases fond women death multiple <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> violence <UNK> what have i left out oh yeah <UNK> br br as a woman i seriously hope sean penn regards this as a when i was a child ' kind of effort since he both wrote and directed the thing he's nearly solely responsible an uneven cast viggo <UNK> as usual <UNK> brilliantly how the <UNK> supposed to be done tries to save penn too late the lines and action are there even devoted skilled acting can't change those br br i found this movie <UNK> and silly as well as predictable the dialogue <UNK> along sandy dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a <UNK> <UNK> monologue without <UNK> authenticity then she dies after a bit so does the <UNK> father played by charles bronson their absence is hardly noticeable br br at <UNK> the <UNK> etc noted above appear to <UNK> things up and scare the audience into thinking something significant is occurring br br if you're male and under 25 you may adore this film plan to return to it at 35 think you'll still like it br br i don't think so
<START> an mgm <UNK> short subject br br the editor of the cole county <UNK> must decide what is the real important news for his readers an impending frost which may spell disaster to their <UNK> or the sensational shooting down of a notorious gangster on their small town main street br br this is an enjoyable little one <UNK> featuring a good performance by comic charles <UNK> sale today's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of uncredited james stewart as <UNK> nephew assistant slow talking somewhat goofy stewart shows many of the attributes which would make him a huge star in a very short time br br often overlooked or neglected today the one and two reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or <UNK> talents both in front behind the camera the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something like writing a <UNK> short story rather than a novel <UNK> to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect <UNK> to the <UNK> feature films
<START> i should say at the outset there are many many things i love about <UNK> <UNK> and yes i certainly consider it a <UNK> science fiction film for many reasons but the <UNK> it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion no less an authority than leonard <UNK> says <UNK> <UNK> is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre ambitious without a doubt intelligent depends on what part of the film you're talking about it certainly was the most <UNK> and highly budgeted science fiction flick to that point at a cost of nearly 2 million this was 1956 remember mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling eye popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before even <UNK> artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects <UNK> is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci fi movies yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here even the <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> is only a well rendered cartoon figure by the disney people unlikely to <UNK> anyone over the age of 8 when i see the various sets and take note of the art design models costumes etc i am reminded of nothing so much as 'the wizard of oz ' with its <UNK> <UNK> colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless <UNK> <UNK> is wonderful to look at the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> paintings of planets and space in the background and <UNK> designed <UNK> sand <UNK> and so forth to give the illusion of depth it's a bit like watching the most <UNK> produced stage play you'd ever see the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive <UNK> complex where shots showing the vast depth and <UNK> of this inner space are well done and credible but then we get to the actors darn it the performances are almost uniformly awful though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever <UNK> the level of adolescent locker room humor except for some <UNK> of barely adequate scientific <UNK> even the great actor walter <UNK> is reduced to giving such a hammy performance it's <UNK> at times a very young leslie <UNK> stars as the spaceship commander j j adams and doesn't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film he seems to <UNK> know thirty years ahead of time that his true <UNK> lay in comedy as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face <UNK> his lines every forced reaction whether it is anger or passion or <UNK> <UNK> looks right out of a high school play anne francis also very young <UNK> a little better as the supposedly innocent <UNK> whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up <UNK> <UNK> now there's a name for you unfortunately even at this early age anne francis seems about as <UNK> and naive as elizabeth taylor in <UNK> 8 ' there is a good story here buried somewhere beneath the crew <UNK> <UNK> comments about <UNK> and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl <UNK> <UNK> ' <UNK> cook <UNK> turns in a horrendous performance too i'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school based on shakespeare's 'the <UNK> ' the story of a dead race the <UNK> and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about <UNK> planet ' and for good reason for a few minutes here and there you can forget about the rest of the movie and be <UNK> by the disney <UNK> conception of the <UNK> underground complex is it enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings you'll have to decide that on your own oh and of course there's <UNK> the robot every 1950's ten year <UNK> idea of what a robot should look and talk like he's funny in places so <UNK> <UNK> to me is a very very mixed bag it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci fi films and tv shows that followed not least of which was <UNK> trek ' but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it's more than well staged comic book sci fi go back and watch it again
<START> a charming romantic comedy the plot is a little too complicated i tried to <UNK> it three times and i can't suffice to say it's worth seeing the movie is funny beautiful the plot is totally unrealistic but it works everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great it creates a sweet romantic feel through the entire film br br the acting is great robert downey jr and <UNK> shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it ryan <UNK> and mary stuart masterson are just ok but fine if you're a sucker for good sweet sentimental films like me catch this one also downey looks great in his underwear br br extra <UNK> the title song sung by johnny <UNK> and another great song after all sung by cher and peter <UNK>
<START> oh dear while chevy chase and the gang at snl set new <UNK> with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level fortunately chevy is barely in this at all and can't be blamed for this utter tripe it seriously is very very bad while meant to be a political comment on usa at the time of it's release 1974 it still remains neither funny or <UNK> observed the sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they're all drawn out to the point of complete boredom this is credited as <UNK> movie debut and i'm pleased to say that everything he did after this <UNK> it avoid even if curious
<START> i got a copy from the writer of this movie on <UNK> i have to say it is pathetic and just plain painful to watch the two cops act but i watched the movie as a joke and since it is a homage to <UNK> underground which i happened to have seen it is in my book as an awesome movie its quality and everything about it is pretty bad but its entertaining and something to talk about amongst your friends reminds me of troma but good stuff i recommend seeing this under two conditions if you are bored and need a good laugh or high otherwise just let it be recommended <UNK> for sure o and the killings are pretty funny like when the zombie rips the satan <UNK> dick off and stabs someone in the head with it
<START> quite simply this shouldn't have been made it's predictable and clichéd the on screen chemistry which made the first my girl so captivating is nowhere to be found here and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced the writing also leaves much to be desired some of the <UNK> lines such as <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> are just shocking where my girl <UNK> a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments like so many sequels my girl 2 tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably maybe i'm being hard on this film because of how great the first one was but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up surely this has to come close to son of the mask as being one of the worst sequels of all time in both cases the old saying rings true if it ain't broke don't fix it
<START> caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn't like it as it was not what they wanted to see the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a <UNK> if you're a fan of the genre br br it has strong suits in all <UNK> from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself br br an absolute diamond a film i still have on video to this day check it out
<START> men of honor true story about a proud and <UNK> black navy diver fabulous cuba gooding jr is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains and it's part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something truly special and pretty enjoyable splendid experience charismatic robert de niro is marvelous as rough fierce and <UNK> chief billy sunday role is practically written for him this film alongside with fantastic 15 minutes 2001 are two of the latest <UNK> that he's still one of the very finest actors of our time on the other hand men of honor includes a fine performance from cuba gooding jr who has been one of the most promising young black actors since <UNK> n the hood men of honor goes straight into the company of jerry maguire as good as it gets and instinct cuba gooding jr is a <UNK> and fantastic actor and i'm prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him men of honor has also quite an excellent story line and probably the most exciting diving sequences of the movie history this is a great fascinating movie and i can only recommend it
<START> we saw this on the shelf at the local video store saw coppola in the credits and got excited that was the one and only time this movie raised any interest i could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a <UNK> film that failed miserably or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably in general the entire production seemed incredibly <UNK> the sound in particular was absolutely dreadful especially in the scenes shot in the little bar the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable very disappointing
<START> this star <UNK> british spanish co production looks great what you can see of it i have three versions two vhs one dvd and all are terribly <UNK> so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other few films suffer as badly from pan and <UNK> as this one as director robert <UNK> seems to have been so <UNK> with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once <UNK> the middle another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church <UNK> at the beginning not in any of the copies i have there are some abrupt cuts of <UNK> firing their <UNK> one mexican officer is shot shaw and <UNK> celebrating and that's it we never find out why shaw has become a priest if he really is we never find out what happens to don carlos <UNK> although i suspect he was called home to star in <UNK> as his departure seems <UNK> and there is a strange flashback sequence where michael craig mysterious island is dancing around in a <UNK> hat and bad suit in the great old english music hall tradition to the 1960 hit battle of new orleans not sung by johnny <UNK> here but with some lyrics i've never heard before on the plus side the location is great a huge old ruined <UNK> with <UNK> style stairs leading nowhere some nice scenery chewing by robert shaw and good performances by stevens <UNK> <UNK> and telly <UNK> as telly <UNK> i didn't really like this film but i haven't exactly seen it i will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then
<START> rather than move <UNK> from beginning to end this story line of a gay couple <UNK> by aids <UNK> in time around their perfect day the film is organized as a life remembered in <UNK> <UNK> rather than in a <UNK> flow as one directly experienced br br the narration has its lyrical moments particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced the dialog unfortunately lacks such grace the script frequently <UNK> the actors to say <UNK> stupid or <UNK> things that seem utterly out of character at the moment on their second accidental encounter clearly smitten with each other sensitive phillip encourages a reluctant guy to tell him about his difficult week but the moment guy begins to open up phillip an english major <UNK> out you're not a crisis fairy are you later watching his <UNK> naked <UNK> body <UNK> across the bedroom toward him our young shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words the way you cut through space i can't even describe it but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought this kind of drivel continues through the aids <UNK> scenes <UNK> with lines like what made me think death would be all neat and tied up with <UNK> and you make <UNK> <UNK> look like nurse <UNK> br br the film often suffers from a <UNK> lack of subtlety unlikable characters are far more jarring and <UNK> <UNK> than they need to be <UNK> thoroughly annoying friends an arrogant trust <UNK> brat and a whining <UNK> <UNK> maintain a running <UNK> <UNK> about every one crossing their path such <UNK> could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary but sadly their remarks are merely unpleasant <UNK> by wit or insight it's hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his <UNK> <UNK> br br the plot may be what most appeals to and <UNK> with those who praise this film it does seriously explore 1980's us middle class gay life first encounters <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the complexity of open relationships <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> physical abuse <UNK> forgiveness <UNK> illness death and survival leads <UNK> and <UNK> give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time their <UNK> good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through <UNK> and <UNK> as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film's painful weaknesses the decision to chop the plot arc into <UNK> and present them in out of sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic <UNK> and in several cases left the sequence and thus the <UNK> of a given event unclear br br could i recommend the film to <UNK> for literary and technical quality absolutely not for easy going viewers in serious need of an aids survivor <UNK> or in the mood for a guilty pleasure <UNK> with a little eye candy thrown in maybe but better written <UNK> exploring the impact of aids on relationships of that era include philadelphia and the band played on longtime companion angels in america an early frost <UNK> <UNK> love <UNK> compassion and even jeffrey
<START> james stewart and margaret <UNK> play co workers in a <UNK> gift shop who don't really like each other not knowing they're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet br br a very charming romantic comedy very <UNK> played by it's two likable stars and a very eager to please supporting cast the story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence don't quite know how to explain it that films today just don't have this can obviously be compared to the recent you've got mail and the original wins in every way br br this is mandatory viewing each christmas i can't think of a better way to <UNK> a christmas feel than this little gem
<START> this was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that's where it ends it seemed like a lackluster set it off meets the west the plot barely made any sense there were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities there were too may unnecessary things going on that didn't <UNK> to the plot nor did it help further the story along there were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations the script should have made more sense as well as the directing i had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie but the casting was great in my opinion if you're only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you
<START> absolutely the worst film yet by burton who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs a miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many <UNK> aspects to this film this is the kind of movie where every time something happens you'll be sure to hear someone shout out he's lost his gun or whatever it is to let everybody know carter is really awful and so is <UNK> who can't play this straight and be convincing very nice effects and photography but poor music in the john williams mold by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> heston appears in a <UNK> scene to <UNK> out his most famous catch phrases from the first movie very poor results br br if anyone else out there also saw sleepy hollow they will probably have noticed as i have the <UNK> quality of <UNK> films i've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that burton was brought in as director in which case his judgement should be <UNK> but i think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip the evidence is there in the films in sleepy hollow he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie and the population of british character actors chris lee etc made you also think it was kind of a monster <UNK> film those are never scary as horror fans know the movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so <UNK> and no style had been developed to smooth the two together planet of the apes is much the same way and the result comes off more like total recall or tango and cash than like sci fi he's also fallen into the <UNK> of so many other big directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience word to burton if you're out there pick something and do it straight or use some style to <UNK> it all together as in mars attacks or <UNK> or you might as well <UNK> because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going
<START> the subject is certainly compelling a group of people take their love of <UNK> one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors kings <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is an interesting <UNK> that <UNK> into our collective need to escape from reality and the sometimes <UNK> of our existence something almost everyone can relate to the characters are the predictable mix of lord of the rings <UNK> and star trek <UNK> that's enough to get most people to watch however very quickly the film turns into an <UNK> view of <UNK> with an almost stereotypical <UNK> of the nose to viewers who don't get it the filmmakers seem to take the subject of <UNK> and this particular one <UNK> too seriously rather than once in awhile <UNK> the humor and fun in making a film about adults <UNK> up in medieval gear and <UNK> each other with <UNK> swords it's pretty hard for anyone who doesn't sit on their computer for 7 10 hours a day playing games or <UNK> the latest star <UNK> to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care however the filmmakers themselves seem not to care choosing to focus solely on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand moreover the characters themselves are not that compelling and you quickly become bored of them a big no no when you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes
<START> there is something in most of us especially guys that <UNK> some really working class small town real men <UNK> fare and sean penn serves it up for us with a <UNK> on top hey a lot of people use penn as a political <UNK> boy but i don't rate movies or actor directors based on politics or personality that is what right wing <UNK> like <UNK> faux movie reviewer debbie <UNK> does while <UNK> he is one of our best actors and a good director i think this picture was a simplistic piece of <UNK> dreck that he has <UNK> for since br br okay you have the <UNK> of this there is this good cop a small town <UNK> joe played against type by david morse who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars the bad guy stops gets out shoots at him so joe has to blast him dead there was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man's parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone so we know that joe the farmer forced off his land into a cop job is a good basic sort of guy then his brother frank shows up he is a sadistic amoral bully fresh out of the army and <UNK> where the war got his blood lust up some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and sean was trying to make some point about what our john wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what i saw was an amoral sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off then there is mom and dad <UNK> mason and charles bronson who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple then die off she by illness and he by shotgun suicide to advance the story for us both times frank the bad guy is away being a miserable <UNK> but good joe brings him back to <UNK> from jail so frank can <UNK> his life out by <UNK> bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife but joe has a nice wife played by italian actress <UNK> <UNK> who is mexican and sean uses this as an exercise in some <UNK> action <UNK> of <UNK> joe and his real <UNK> underneath his uniform and crew cut for me that was an utterly pointless <UNK> action subplot that sean uses to <UNK> his tough guy <UNK> by sucking up to <UNK> because <UNK> are so tough and cool br br but frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend's car robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then <UNK> the car and all those cool things that hell <UNK> do then there are the mandatory <UNK> film childhood flashbacks of young joey <UNK> moving the lawn and cowboy dressed <UNK> jumping on his back and wrestling him and <UNK> <UNK> so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them br br so the film <UNK> around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red <UNK> accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like <UNK> airplane and <UNK> <UNK> which were totally inappropriate except for the 60's era effect to win the hearts of old hippies the worst offense is that since the movie was inspired by a <UNK> song the highway <UNK> that song was not included br br so <UNK> brain dead wife goes into labor and joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and <UNK> some <UNK> drunken <UNK> <UNK> about how tough things are while good joey comes to drag him back to his wife the bartender is good <UNK> <UNK> played by dennis hopper so viggo frank <UNK> out for no particular reason and beats his pal <UNK> to death after good joe the cop leaves br br so joe has chase his bad brother down and i was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50's <UNK> on some lonely road at night and little <UNK> in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good joe the kid from the <UNK> flashback home movie sequence <UNK> such dreck then to top off this <UNK> <UNK> fest there is some <UNK> crap about the indian runner who is a <UNK> becomes the message ala marshall <UNK> see what i mean sean has done much better than this so don't be afraid to miss this one
<START> despite or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music to <UNK> the motivations and <UNK> of each of the major characters stereotypes are in and <UNK> and characterization are out in this not too subtle cinematic <UNK> br br one gets the sense that john <UNK> was <UNK> in post <UNK> literary theory because it was the flavor of the day and higher learning was the <UNK> result the low point of the movie is the peace <UNK> in which the symbols of the 1960s free love movement are <UNK> for what much more closely resembles a take back the night <UNK> with live <UNK> identity conscious musical acts in <UNK> perhaps in his <UNK> <UNK> the director was trying to <UNK> that identity politics is the new vietnam <UNK> how <UNK> rich of <UNK> <UNK> firing into the crowd is a nice touch if you're into <UNK> sort of political <UNK> br br i wish i could give this movie negative stars i can recommend it only to those interested in the 1990s as history a time when radical <UNK> brought the academic <UNK> of race class and gender to popular culture and <UNK> man hating a <UNK> and honorable political option where's <UNK> <UNK> when you need her
<START> maybe it wasn't that good as a whole but the second episode which was the first one i say was so memorable i still remember it today i became a fan of dick francis i would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries br br the cockney <UNK> of the sidekick <UNK> barnes is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing <UNK> bow <UNK> but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting br br sid <UNK> was one of <UNK> more interesting characters and the show actually <UNK> some of the difficulties with his hand interestingly electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less <UNK> for the user than the sort invented after world war ii
<START> i saw this movie when i was in israel for the summer my <UNK> is not <UNK> so the subtitles were very useful i didn't feel lost at any point in the movie you tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes br br this movie blew me away it depicts two of the most prominent <UNK> in the middle east today a homosexual relationship between an israeli and a palestinian it allows a person to enter both <UNK> of the conflict simultaneously the dilemma the emotions <UNK> the movie <UNK> in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one <UNK> side an absolute must see
<START> it's not often i feel compelled to give negative criticism of a film after all i often feel the <UNK> if you don't have anything good to say don't say it at all would be apt advice for the many <UNK> we listen to everyday who <UNK> at things we like if it's all the same to you the reader though i feel compelled to point out that with the lone exception of christopher walken in a returning role as gabriel this movie is <UNK> horrid i say this to you to warn you in advance that even if you are a fan of <UNK> deadpan delivery and style or liked the original prophecy that you will be sorely <UNK> if you buy it return it if you rent it make sure it's only ninety nine cents br br what's wrong with this movie a full list would take too long to read and would bore you to tears but a short summary would be the following the once rather <UNK> clear picture of the relationship between angels and <UNK> of the first film is ripped to <UNK> gabriel is turned from the rather morbid right hand of god he once was and in this role he is <UNK> funny in the first to little more than a thug for heaven since walken is so good at playing <UNK> we all remember frank white from king of new york he is still enjoyable but the supporting cast is an <UNK> and unconvincing mess of <UNK> and angels alike who couldn't buy a clue for 50 cents if you can figure out the plot you're a smarter man than i one gets the feeling we wander <UNK> from scene to scene just to move the film along to <UNK> next big line by the end of the movie you're actually wishing he'd blow his horn and make the walls of <UNK> fall on the people who made this un natural disaster br br bottom line it's an insult to our intelligence that they made a sequel to this film in the first place the original told the right story answered the questions that should have been and left alone the ones you were meant to <UNK> afterwards there are no compelling reasons to follow these characters that was in the first the priest who lost his faith the little girl who kept the big secret the teacher who <UNK> her children even <UNK> himself was more interesting by himself in the first film than all the other characters in the sequel put together i feel sorry for anybody who sees this film and not the first because they'll probably never want to watch the original and that's a real tragedy
<START> surreal film noir released soon after the real genre defining classics the <UNK> <UNK> double <UNK> and the <UNK> always rings twice welles films shouldn't be <UNK> against others he was playing by different rules in fact he was playing this starts where other femme fatale films leave off so the vaguely logical but interesting <UNK> is <UNK> with a display of <UNK> scenes typical rapid fire style dialog lots of hard boiled philosophy and unusual acting good hayworth presumably intentionally one dimensional to welles genre may have meant formula but he seemed to like using mysteries as backgrounds for his <UNK>
<START> whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in hollywood at all not even live there and those actors need to find another job the most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life and i only kept watching to see if it would get better which unfortunately for me it did not br br even at the end the credits gave me anxiety i guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly very slowly br br this movie is definitely a great how not to make a movie guide too bad i can't give a 0
<START> i had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at imdb and that's why i had avoided it today they showed vanilla sky on tv and as i had nothing better to do and as it turned out i would have had a hard time finding anything better to do vanilla sky is a frightening sad and touching movie actually one of the best i've seen in a while i was surprised by how i was affected watching it it's hard to explain but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey vanilla sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie or any media for that matter br br i really recommend everyone to watch this movie regardless of what you have heard about it
<START> i gave this a 1 there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for total mayhem everyone gets killed or nearly so i am tired of cross <UNK> and changing views i cannot give the plot away convoluted and insane if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back i wish reviews were more honest
<START> an actor's first film is usually something one can afford to miss it's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display and this film is no exception br br but worse than that even by 1982 standards this is so bad it's hysterically funny filmed entirely in the chicago area on an obviously small budget most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff wooden and cartoonish a cross between a high school play and bad community theater noise from nearby traffic often <UNK> out the dialog and the dialog is truly bad very <UNK> in a way that comes off as forced and <UNK> rather than natural and <UNK> scenes are contrived and choppy and even though the characters go through a span of years neither the children nor the adults age at all br br i do believe it's possible to make a christian film that's <UNK> to a large <UNK> audience but too often the creators of such films are so focused on 'the <UNK> or in this case their own <UNK> ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside i'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer director editor and cast member br br luckily michael madsen was much more interesting and believable to watch in his subsequent films careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one
<START> jean marc <UNK> being light the big blue <UNK> has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy i might be wrong but i don't think this movie's part of the dogma <UNK> <UNK> though it really looks like it i'm not really sure of what i think about this film all actors are good they deliver pretty good performances especially <UNK> arquette and jean marc <UNK> the story is somehow interesting but i don't know there's something about the movie that i don't like the sex scenes are way too long it goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap i don't know exactly where it stands sure it's not a bad movie but i won't suggest people to see it neither i'll tell them not to watch just do as you want if you feel curious and you're open minded give it a try you might like it

<START> i have seen many many films from china and hong kong this is the worst no the worst one was <UNK> <UNK> i watched <UNK> yesterday evening and thought that <UNK> zhang <UNK> other two films must be better this evening i was disappointed again i will not be watching <UNK> <UNK> tomorrow evening because i have just placed all three films in the bin whoever gave this film <UNK> ten out of ten needs to watch more cinema the photography was very poor it was very difficult to <UNK> between some of the characters because of the lack of close up work the storyline was so disjointed that i fast <UNK> it towards the end out of pure frustration i would not recommend this film to anyone give me zhang <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> any day these are true masters of chinese cinema not pretentious con men
<START> okay so i've seen a lot of really odd unusual movies in my day fear and loathing in las vegas comes to mind when i think of that well not anymore from here on out whenever someone asks me hey what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen <UNK> is what i'll say and i do not mean unusual in a good way br br from the very beginning of the movie it was obvious that this was going to be one of those <UNK> camera effect movies by that i mean little things like flashing images on the screen <UNK> and fast <UNK> people's words and scenes messing with the color on the screen flash <UNK> and flash backs constantly then you have the actual acting itself people randomly get violent shoot things people say the <UNK> things that just don't make much if any sense br br the movie is about a writer who starts to <UNK> real life with the book he's writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it you basically see this trip he goes on throughout the movie the thing is johnny <UNK> went on a similar trip in fear and loathing in las vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch not painful honestly i had a real hard time even finishing <UNK> it kind of hurt my brain a bit br br i can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of <UNK> blah blah blah point is this movie hurts your brain when you watch it it makes very little sense it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end the only thing you can be happy about is that it's over and you can say you actually sat through it so in closing if you want to see a movie that will have you saying what the heck over and over again both out loud and in your head go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this out br br mr hopkins while i applaud you as an actor and <UNK> your choice to take a stab at directing please do not ever make a movie like this again next time try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache
<START> this is john waters best film to date the characters are obvious and symbolic just as in his other films so there are no surprises or character changes i enjoyed the film because of the <UNK> and pace of the story it was good story telling with honest people
<START> man was i disappointed br br 1 adam arkin is more whiny than ross <UNK> from <UNK> br br 2 a great cast is wasted kenneth mars alan arkin ed <UNK> pat <UNK> louis <UNK> with this amateurish script br br 3 the movie suffers from horrible pacing it jumps around through in a <UNK> confusing manner br br 4 the story doesn't even make sense why does he want to break the football streak what about the stupid <UNK> music none of it is explained br br 5 it's not even funny it's like a bunch of <UNK> trying to do <UNK> saying <UNK> me <UNK> me i'm being funny this was a bad attempt at making another love at first bite br br i like larry cohen movies but man he failed here i couldn't wait for the credits to roll horribly disappointed

<START> this sci fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the <UNK> had butchered it after its opening in 1936 visually it is a wonder to behold but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress this gets very corny when the actors are given to <UNK> a lot of high minded messages at all times raymond massey and cedric <UNK> both great actors come off as quite a pair of fanatics ralph richardson is very good as the the boss a <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of world war ii was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time i'm sure glad that war didn't turn out as it did in the movie there are some visually stunning montage sequences <UNK> the leaps of time between the movie's different episodes although its not as entertaining as i hoped it would be this movie sticks in your mind long after you've seen it
<START> the saddest part of this is the fact that these are <UNK> minutes i'll never get back i knew this was terrible from the get go with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof see if they could get away with that in 2008 my 10 year old boy is really into baseball right now so we decided to rent it on a rainy day even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language bad bad movie this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears completely shameless and completely predictable i don't mind a predictable movie if it's done well but this one absolutely was not
<START> soldier isn't a great movie and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons but i liked soldier alot partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised me br br first the art direction is tight and well executed as far as science fiction backdrops go soldier was doing things with more design then 90 the genre the sets costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed i didn't love all of their future military style but i was impressed with the effort for me this made the movie worth the time it took to watch br br second i'm a kurt russell fan i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth the <UNK> executive and his john carpenter films soldier is essentially an action movie and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero it's not an award winning role but kurt <UNK> up convincing emotion with very little dialog br br third the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed this isn't iron monkey or even the matrix but once again it far <UNK> the average level of quality in the genre br br if you haven't seen it and you like sci fi action films pick it up if you pass at your rental <UNK> of choice just don't expect the next <UNK>
<START> don't let the name of this film <UNK> you in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the <UNK> action hero ever known to film when jake speed is not saving virgin girls from evil <UNK> which he is often not he's seriously relaxing perhaps this adds to his charm but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to chill out whenever he gets the chance furthermore unlike other daring <UNK> who usually have an impressive list of talents this man has none unless of course you call sleeping a talent anyhow this movie is basically worthless the writing is sub par and the action when there is some is very lame the machine guns on the <UNK> weren't bad but that's about it so if you're in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia then this piece is perfect for you it has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep but also his audience
<START> the legendary boris karloff ended his <UNK> career by making four <UNK> fright flick <UNK> in mexico this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch karloff gives a typically <UNK> and <UNK> performance as <UNK> <UNK> an elderly eccentric <UNK> who invites several of his petty greedy and <UNK> no count relatives to his creepy <UNK> castle for the reading of a will pretty soon the hateful guests are getting <UNK> off by lethal life sized toy people who <UNK> the place <UNK> mexican sex symbol <UNK> garcia of <UNK> <UNK> portrays the dashing police officer hero and <UNK> looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character the clunky plodding non direction trite by the numbers script ugly washed out cinematography ridiculous murder set pieces a gross fat <UNK> gets <UNK> right in the face by a <UNK> cannon overwrought string score morbid <UNK> doom atmosphere largely lousy acting karloff notably <UNK> cheesy mild gore poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this <UNK> awful <UNK> a certain <UNK> <UNK> and hence oddly amusing <UNK> charm a real campy hoot
<START> i just rented this today heard lots of good reviews beforehand wow what a pile of steaming poo this movie is does anyone know the address of the director so i can get my five dollars back finally someone <UNK> stop loss from the <UNK> iraq war movie <UNK> number one spot to be fair i don't think there are any good iraq war movies anyway but this was really bad br br i won't get into any technical inaccuracies there's a hundred reviews from other <UNK> vets that detail them all if the director bothered to <UNK> even the <UNK> e nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic maybe i guess the writer should be given the credit for this waste of a film he or she obviously <UNK> the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not <UNK> with the <UNK> of reality does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was was there a message seriously though wtf br br i'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really this film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that the plot sucks characters are shallow to say the least and the acting is poor at best it's ironic i suppose that this movie is supposed to be about explosive <UNK> <UNK> because it's the biggest bomb i've seen this year
<START> rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre sergio martino fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by <UNK> <UNK> this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film it's when everything has fallen into place that we can go <UNK> the film revolves around the death of a husband in an airplane explosion and the million dollars the wife receives from it there are those with great interest in that money one in particular being the dead man's mistress the wife is lisa <UNK> <UNK> and the mistress demanding half the money is lara <UNK> <UNK> she tells lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money lara says she'll use her lawyer <UNK> luis <UNK> to get that money so already the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of lisa who awaiting someone in tokyo george hilton portrays peter lynch peter works for a company that <UNK> those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means when on his watch lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room he is a possible suspect he decides to do a little investigating himself while also <UNK> inspector <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> agent <UNK> tom <UNK> on their quest to find a killer the killer strikes several times <UNK> anyone revolving around the missing million dollars <UNK> by the one responsible for the murder of lisa soon the film follows a journalist <UNK> <UNK> the delicious <UNK> anita <UNK> as she and peter meet for a dinner where she could try and <UNK> out anything that might break a story for her soon they fall deeply in love but it seems like anyone who is near peter is killed soon someone attacks <UNK> with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into <UNK> territory why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people br br this giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow the film never <UNK> which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer this film follows the path of <UNK> with knife <UNK> because of a certain pattern the killer has taken the throat and lower <UNK> the film's conclusion <UNK> up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying the film has some unique camera angles but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery
<START> now i hired this movie because brad <UNK> was in it he is an excellent actor brilliant in everything except this movie and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was and didn't bother with a good performance this movie is a unintentional comedy some of the lines just crack me up and them there are some lines that make no sense and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot oh btw the plot is bad but it one of those films that is <UNK> bad that its actually painful to watch i recommend this only for big brad <UNK> fans or fans of any of the other actors because the plot is pathetic
<START> david <UNK> the sopranos is perhaps the most over praised television show in recent memory not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion it's devoid of a soul as anyone reading likely knows already james gandolfini is tony soprano a big fat a hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b <UNK> of a wife and two <UNK> sh t <UNK> kids living in you guessed it the <UNK> of america that's new jersey by the way not only is tony a <UNK> <UNK> he's also an <UNK> murdering <UNK> with a crew of saturday night live skit worthy caricatures for <UNK> it's not the fact that tony is a piece of sh t mobster that <UNK> me and apparently only me allowing characters to be who and what they are without judgment is something american tv hardly allows but chase and his <UNK> of money <UNK> emmy <UNK> writers have not simply allowed us to observe tony and his crew as they behave nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action reaction reality of even obviously <UNK> organized crime a la the godfather instead chase <UNK> and <UNK> his characters' greedy violent and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that tony his wife and even his hair <UNK> psychologist do week after week or should i say month after month or is it year after year it seems like the show's <UNK> 13 episode seasons come out with the same <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> much has been made of the <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> to network structure with plot lines that go nowhere and characters that pop up and disappear like backyard <UNK> but if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure why does it always feel like i'm watching a soap opera tired mob clichés bored <UNK> self serving <UNK> characters and plots that go nowhere more than ever i can see why so many americans of italian <UNK> are p <UNK> at this show it's enough to make you want to <UNK> up with a good book <UNK> <UNK> springs to mind br br people on imdb love to claim that there's nothing good on television and therefore the sopranos is a breath of fresh air are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch the shield it's included in basic ya know how about the still good the west wing or the brilliantly acted if <UNK> written boston legal what about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades arrested development and <UNK> we forget that we live in an age of dvds nobody has to watch anything new i'd much rather shell out 40 for an over <UNK> <UNK> set of well pretty much anything than give hbo 10 a month or 80 a dvd set to continue to prove how much of a hack factory it can be br br you want good television watch homicide life on the street or murder one or <UNK> <UNK> or even <UNK> prior show northern exposure if you're already among the sopranos 's legion of brain washed fans and critics it's too late for you but if not leave tony and his worthless <UNK> where they all belong rotting with the <UNK> sleeping would be way too kind
<START> i saw this movie the other night i can't even begin to express how much this movie sucked the writing the voice acting even the <UNK> terrible terrible terrible it's like watching 24 hours of c span for the sake of comedy it just doesn't work it literally falls flat at about every spot possible br br also the movie's animation is very poor quality i know that this is an movie made by one person but to think that he could make <UNK> minutes worth of crap maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny br br this show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time <UNK> it really was that bad if you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh steer clear from this abomination my advice don't even buy it or look it up for that matter your brain will than you
<START> i don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said honestly i have only myself to be angry with i should have know better when i saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap but i loved war games so i <UNK> my <UNK> i will live to regret that decision the rest of my life from the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game i knew i was in for a ride though the land that good writing forgot the list of very very very bad plot lines dialog and acting is so long i would crash imdb if i tried to post it to those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me i am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung
<START> when this movie was first shown on television i had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about world war i as experienced by american soldiers unfortunately this is not it br br it should have been a good movie about wwi even though it was made for television it is obvious that a real effort was made to use appropriate equipment and props but the writing and directing are badly lacking even though the makers of this movie obviously borrowed <UNK> from quite a few well made war movies war movie clichés abound such as the arrogant general who apparently does not care a flip about the lives of his men when will hollywood realize that even though there have been plenty of bad <UNK> most combat unit <UNK> have seen plenty of combat themselves and are not naive about what the average <UNK> experiences the first part of this movie appeared to be paths of glory with american uniforms except that paths of glory was emotionally gripping later on there was <UNK> charge except <UNK> from <UNK> and even the capture of the american soldier by a ring of enemy soldiers from the thin red line but in the thin red line the soldier was alone when captured in this movie a ring forms around the new prisoner in the middle of a battle br br if this movie used a military <UNK> they ignored him even though the actors and i never could forget they were actors while watching mouthed military tactics i didn't see very much of it the american soldiers would stand up to be shot while the germans attacked and the infamous storm troopers who were apparently blind appeared to use no tactics whatsoever in their attack in the real war the tactics were what made storm troopers so effective but the <UNK> scene was the attack of the german <UNK> in this scene the german <UNK> <UNK> walked in a broad line towards the defending americans if that had been real they would never have gotten close enough to use their <UNK> before they had all been dropped by the <UNK> bullets br br okay so most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to the tactics shown but it is still disappointing but what really turned me off to this flick was the typical anti war anti military angle that movie makers seem to think is important true war is hell but most american soldiers even though they <UNK> and <UNK> tend to believe in what they are doing and can be rather <UNK> ho about it my grandfather served in world war i and even though he died four years before i was born i have been told how proud he was of his service
<START> i came into this movie really wanting to line it i thought the premise had a lot of potential and was <UNK> for an interesting movie don't get me wrong here i wasn't expecting citizen kane i was taking this for the b movie that it is that said it still fell short of the expectation the historical aspect of the story is <UNK> over and the ending left me a bit cold the acting in the movie was very wooden all in all i give it 4 for a great idea but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making <UNK> is it worth seeing i didn't wish for my two hours back but i don't know that i'd recommend it to others
<START> i was forced to see this because a i have an 11 year old girl and b we had shown her the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> drew movies from the 1930s which she thoroughly enjoyed personally i didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks but on the other hand it wasn't the nauseating piece of intelligence insulting fluff i feared it would be it was an <UNK> mildly entertaining movie although i'm pleased that they didn't try to <UNK> nancy to 21st century <UNK> <UNK> mars holds the title as the modern nancy drew i do think that they made her a little too bland that they didn't do enough to develop nancy drew the movie could have been titled jane <UNK> girl detective i have to blame the script i think each actor did a good job with what they had to work with i liked emma roberts in this role but they gave her a made for tv not theatrical release script
<START> i'm so glad i happened to see this video at the store i was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem i loved that the movie a love story of sorts wasn't about some beautiful twenty somethings rather it's a story of some beautiful sixty somethings who used used to be twenty somethings it's a good well written and wonderfully acted story with fabulous wwii band music thrown in as well it's also got a delightful surprise in it for scottish castle lovers it left me smiling and ready to watch it again which i did a couple more times before i turned it in i highly recommend it
<START> i guess i've seen worse films but that may be <UNK> i'm so jaded by how standard these bad horror movies are the killer monster thing is really really bad basically its a guy in some kind of green body suit there is much worse acting as far as b movie go but don't think for a second this was anything stellar hell no it actually did have a plot with substance but was still pretty stupid basically its just a bad low budget horror movie but at least its not as bad as titanic that movie sucks balls this one just sucks the blood looks really fake in this movie thats one complaint i have about all the horror of the new <UNK> low grade gore looks stupid a good gruesome death scene with really fake blood is so stupid at least there was a nice shower scene
<START> first of all i became <UNK> after watching this movie for five minutes cause of the <UNK> screenplay i don't think this movie has any purpose it's boring from the first minute to the last i don't understand why this movie scores so high i gave it 1 10 but actually it's not more <UNK> then 0 10
<START> take br br 1 a famous play br br 2 a director with now ideas of his own who is using br br 3 a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1 br br 4 an actor for the lead who has no feeling for the part he's playing and you'll get hamlet <UNK> von <UNK> br br i listened to the radio play of hamlet with <UNK> <UNK> as hamlet and i was so disappointed i hoped that the filmed version would be better that <UNK> would at least have a body language to <UNK> what he's saying nothing then the set the <UNK> design is not everyone's taste but usually i like it when there's just enough on the stage to make clear what's the setting and nothing more alas that's on a stage in a theatre it won't work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings that the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which <UNK> played the hamlet already let's say if that was the only thing to complain about i ask myself how <UNK> could get the part of hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play hamlet a second time if you've got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on hamlet don't watch this one unless you're a <UNK> or really hardcore or like to poke fun on <UNK> actors
<START> jack <UNK> life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him sad to say though that what his life was used for in film was some wartime propaganda that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of his character br br jack london who barely saw the age of 40 when he died wrote some of the best stories around he wrote on what he knew but he also wrote as does everyone else bringing the <UNK> of his own life experience with him some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism but this was world war ii and london was a big believer in the <UNK> <UNK> as it was called back in the day br br two thirds of the film covers his life as author we see his years as a <UNK> from where he got the inspiration for the sea wolf we see him up in the <UNK> in a <UNK> cabin with a dog that was no doubt his inspiration for the call of the wild london was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about right on paper for the world to enjoy ever since br br the final third dealt with his time as a war <UNK> covering the russo japanese war london was a <UNK> but his <UNK> did not <UNK> folks who were oriental like a few million others he saw the rising <UNK> of the chinese and japanese to our pacific coast as a threat to jobs for the white people he <UNK> strict <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> br br the film puts the <UNK> before the horse london is presented as a man who saw because he was on hand at the russo japanese war what <UNK> ambitions were and for that reason was as <UNK> as he was actually the kind of atrocities present in world war ii were not existent during the russo japanese conflict japan had her <UNK> ambitions but so did everyone else including the usa at that time but our <UNK> <UNK> caused by pressure from our west coast politicians was a big <UNK> factor to the <UNK> of relations with japan over a couple of generations london was part of the cause not a prophet crying in the wilderness br br this film was the first independent production of samuel <UNK> who later did some films with a bit more budget than jack london had he a bit more money <UNK> might have gotten james cagney or spencer tracy both who would have been right for the role instead they got michael <UNK> who was making his second film after lady of <UNK> <UNK> is fine in the part but certainly was no box office br br as london is covering the war he meets up with a captain <UNK> who is played by leonard strong an actor who <UNK> in <UNK> and played a ton of them in world war ii from the <UNK> point in <UNK> strong <UNK> in the best fu <UNK> tradition <UNK> <UNK> aims right up to taking on the usa eventually must have gone over great with the swing shift crowd br br a lot of course is left out of <UNK> life including a first wife playing the second and only wife in this film is susan <UNK> who only comes into the movie when it's half over i wish we'd have seen more of her <UNK> <UNK> london survived her husband by almost 40 years dying in 1955 br br <UNK> in fact met and married the leading lady of his life in jack london virginia <UNK> has a small role in jack london and they married for 30 years until <UNK> died in 1973 br br maybe one day we'll get a view of jack london that will be a lot better than this one
<START> producer joel <UNK> who also directed phone booth <UNK> and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into combat colin farrell <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back matthew davis jim paxton blue crush <UNK> gave a great supporting role and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wilson all the real girls <UNK> showed his true acting skills in the role that he played there was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires one army veteran <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using <UNK> <UNK> in all the wrong places on a human male body enjoyable and entertaining film to view
<START> i only saw <UNK> once almost 30 years ago but it has haunted me since br br one sequence particularly stays in mind and could only have been fashioned by a great director as michael <UNK> undoubtedly is br br the context the weight of history and a mighty army and fleet all lie on king <UNK> shoulders an act of <UNK> has <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> his great expedition to <UNK> he is told he must sacrifice his daughter <UNK> to apollo in order to gain the winds for the <UNK> of the thousand ships he initially <UNK> but comes around and tricks his wife <UNK> to bring their daughter to the greek camp in order to marry the greatest of all warriors <UNK> br br <UNK> and <UNK> arrive find out about the sacrifice and rage to the gods for protection and vengeance meanwhile the proud <UNK> discovers that his name has been used in this <UNK> <UNK> way he climbs a hill to tell <UNK> that he will protect her br br the shot the camera circles the two young people without looking directly at each other they <UNK> their fate and the weakness of men that <UNK> their loved ones and lust for war suddenly they <UNK> at each other and for one moment we feel both their power and beauty and the <UNK> except by the camera irony that in another time another place they perhaps could love each other and be married it is a sharp and sad <UNK> that lasts only for an instant br br what direction what camera what storytelling
<START> this movie is the second worst film that i have ever seen the first being ghost rider there is absolutely no plot climax conflict or any other major detail required in portraying a story this <UNK> is basically just another excuse for toby keith to show off his <UNK> side and the <UNK> guy he really <UNK> i completely wasted my time watching this film the best part would have to be the ending credits if i were ebert or <UNK> i would have cut my thumbs off and thrown them at the producers whoever in their right mind gave toby keith the chance to act in a feature film is obviously on the same mental level as him in conclusion do not waste your time watching this movie it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret
<START> i couldn't believe my eyes when i watched <UNK> yesterday on dutch television it starts very slowly the backgrounds of the <UNK> trials become clear step by step the germans have a funny english accent but then suddenly in the last few minutes of the first part of the series the audience gets to see the most shocking horrific footage i have ever seen br br it is important that people get to see such footage although i absolutely don't agree with people stating that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this kind of material but in this film it was completely ridiculous it was purely meant to improve the impact of an ordinary tv series it was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and unbelievably easy in <UNK> of trying to move us with well done scenes inspiring dialogue or interesting <UNK> the audience is being tortured with horrible images of skin and bones camp inmates it doesn't show any respect for the victims of the holocaust br br i'm very angry
<START> <UNK> this film stinks so does a lot of the acting but i br br don't care if there is a strong representation of what the 80's were br br like for a lot of us in the <UNK> anyways and what hip hop <UNK> br br nation and break dancing were really like great music great br br dancing it almost seems like a documentary of a time now past br br when hip hop was a way of life it's also interesting to see new br br york looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack some viewers br br may be too young to remember that it was a poor run down city br br during the 70's and 80's this is the best of all the hip hop break br br dancing movies that came out around that period of course the br br 80's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows and br br movies but those of us who lived through it will always remember br br it <UNK> for a time when music dancing and <UNK> were fresh <UNK>
<START> the first half hour or so of this movie i liked the obvious budding romance between ingrid bergman and mel <UNK> was cute to watch and i wanted to see the inevitable happen between them however once the action switched to the home of <UNK> fiancé it all completely fell apart instead of romance and charm we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film the <UNK> <UNK> son and the military <UNK> <UNK> for the <UNK> attention looked stupid sort of like a subplot from an old love boat episode how the charm and <UNK> of the first portion of the film can give way to <UNK> is beyond me this film is an obvious attempt by <UNK> to <UNK> the success he had with the rules of the game as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate just as in the other film i was not a huge fan of the rules of the game but <UNK> and her men had me <UNK> the artistry and nuances of the original film
<START> i can't believe i watched this expecting more it starts out ok this movie pushes the limits of reality way to far at least the first one was somewhat realistic it rips off the first movie and even mentions the joshua project anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie it does have one good message in it though watch out for big brother the movie just makes it seem like big brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality that was very <UNK> even the make up on the actors was completely bad some of the acting is pretty good some of the acting is really bad though the script was ok at some points and completely messed up at other parts this movie plays on <UNK> about every five minutes like i said i can't believe i watched it expecting more i think i am gonna pop in the original to get back to earth q
<START> cliffhanger is what appears to be <UNK> <UNK> last action movie before he became such an underrated actor it's about a mountain <UNK> that must help his friend after being held hostage by <UNK> that want them to find three <UNK> carrying money over 100 million dollars it has great action <UNK> edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies
<START> <UNK> notorious barbara stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power he tries to get her to read <UNK> she says books ain't never done her no good soon we find out her father is basically <UNK> her out to a local <UNK> and others finally she has had enough and <UNK> to the big city we follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank the dialogue is quite <UNK> for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted hollywood production code look for a cameo by a young john wayne as one of <UNK> willing victims part of the forbidden hollywood collection i watched the extended version the dvd has both versions plus red headed woman and <UNK> bridge an interesting movie and <UNK> for future femme fatale roles that stanwyck would play in the era of film noir b
<START> i originally saw this film years ago during <UNK> friday after dark series back when the cable box was built like a keyboard and it intrigued me even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted the performances of depardieu <UNK> are very enjoyable they have a good chemistry together <UNK> <UNK> makes a pink fur look breathtaking a movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct times at least not in the us since it seems to <UNK> things like violence robbery casual sex this movie proves that with a talented cast also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject it <UNK> me to find out patrick <UNK> committed suicide in the near future i ll will check him out with depardieu <UNK> <UNK> in get out your <UNK>
<START> i can't believe that in the <UNK> prior comments nobody mentioned that this film is a blatant rip off of born yesterday a man is hired to bring an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the <UNK> of a gangster hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after gangster is left in the <UNK> but born yesterday was an intelligent treatment whereas this is just so much fluff technicolor transfer to dvd is <UNK> natalie <UNK> would be rolling over in her grave check out the <UNK> recognize him but it's historically interesting to see the roots of rock <UNK> roll also interesting is <UNK> introduction to <UNK> a new format at the time
<START> the thing that stands out in my mind in this film sadly is the introduction where john berlin andy garcia is driving into town you see his <UNK> pass on a <UNK> road through a forest that looks like its loaded with <UNK> trees it's quite beautiful br br as to andy garcia playing a character with the last name of berlin well andy is just too hispanic latin for it to be passable maybe a <UNK> father married his spanish mother for this story who knows but i can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and <UNK> he stands out like a sore thumb especially with his accent that <UNK> up when he gets angry yeah i know big deal right he's still a good actor br br the title concerns a serial killer who <UNK> his victims jennifer all of the victims are blind and he <UNK> them the killer has taken a <UNK> but suddenly <UNK> when a blind witness don't ask appears helena robertson uma thurman thurman does a good job of playing a blind person to my surprise when i saw lance <UNK> playing sgt freddy ross i got worried <UNK> played in some pretty strange films especially of late i still can't forget him in the bloodbath movie <UNK> br br berlin movies into a small town from l a as a detective he begins investigating the jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local <UNK> his brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far fetched so did the irony of spoiler freddy's murder with the recording and name similarities i got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight <UNK> and the motive of the killer as simply deranged didn't pack much of a punch in retrospect this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little <UNK> over time or maybe were born looney <UNK> br br john <UNK> does a <UNK> job in his <UNK> of garcia albeit no cop would <UNK> be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out as to the ending it is a bit of a surprise but is highly <UNK> much like sgt <UNK> murder the killer chooses to walk after his running victim <UNK> instead to <UNK> i guess br br and there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it's ridiculous i won't ruin the very end because despite it's <UNK> it's a good surprise afterward though you'll probably say as i did boy was she lucky 4 10
<START> this movie about two italian brothers who came to germany with their family is just great br br it isn't an idealistic movie i would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place the characters are very nice but have also some dark sides what makes you believe that these are real persons great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time but that you can find happiness with fire and passion as the main character <UNK> would say
<START> it is said that david lynch's films and shorts won't appeal to everyone neither will <UNK> maybe more than ever i have a feeling that <UNK> as people come across it will be a true mark of 'i get <UNK> or <UNK> the <UNK> it's not <UNK> exactly but absurd to the point of no return it's also very very very stupid but in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it that the maker knows so well how childish and <UNK> this is and this self consciousness is a plus not a <UNK> br br it's just a bunch of <UNK> drawn shorts the kind that might not even make it on <UNK> and <UNK> animation show which i might add lynch here has a lot in common with both directors in their work centered on a <UNK> with an iq of 20 who has a constantly <UNK> with fear wife and a child who looks like a cross between the <UNK> man and or an alien the episodes include little situations like a <UNK> <UNK> a salesman who can <UNK> the <UNK> address watching over a sick brother in law <UNK> hallucinations and just <UNK> on the couch with noise all around all the while lynch is still <UNK> as he was constantly for better or worse during the period of five years he made on and off <UNK> empire br br for one thing he's going back to the roots of his very first short six figures getting sick six times in the usage of <UNK> as a means to an end this sometimes works excruciatingly well and sometimes not sometimes like with the episode with the sitting around the house doing nothing as teeth are bleeding and a fly <UNK> around the <UNK> sort of <UNK> and <UNK> without much of a good effect and even an episode like with the guy's friend coming over is funny more so for the <UNK> butt head comparison both laugh like idiots and are equally <UNK> by killing things like fish and sheep what ends up working is how lynch shows up front delirious <UNK> in the <UNK> ways imaginable and excessive violence br br in what comes closest to <UNK> in ants the guy <UNK> <UNK> bug <UNK> just called kill one of lynch's very cheap but fun <UNK> at societal conventions on himself and <UNK> ants in a musical chorus line <UNK> included and one of the most <UNK> funny things i've ever seen from the filmmaker is get the stick where we just see the guy <UNK> on by his son getting a stick <UNK> in his mouth soon the neck breaks eyes pop out and once said stick is removed he doesn't watch out for traffic <UNK> like a <UNK> cover other moments pop up like this in unexpected <UNK> and it's drawn as if on cheap paper with an <UNK> to shock with foul mouthed language mostly from the man as well as from the <UNK> who in one of lynch's voices for the characters is the deepest of all and a shaky quality that's reminiscent of the cream of the crop from early <UNK> br br all the same i'm still not sure if <UNK> is something i would put into someone's hands if they haven't seen much of lynch yet let alone anything by him there are some little points on society made via complete <UNK> that may or may not be in lynch's mind closer than we usually think to those in real life however in general there's not a whole lot that should be read into it which is why i'd say more than half who see it will hate it with a passion those who dig the bottom less <UNK> of animated comedy be prepared have a blast
<START> i had somewhat high hopes for this since i like tim roth i was not pleased with this film i liked the ang lee the hulk a few years back so i figured this would have more of a bang to it first i was very disappointed with john <UNK> performance here he looks as if his <UNK> were re shaped for this his performance was not convincing he was not as good as one would expect tim roth is cool as always here the <UNK> thing didn't really stick to the original story line i don't think i guess the best part of the film was the end it had some cool action the only problem with the original was that it was too long this one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times i remember some time ago when <UNK> had this movie really cheap for sale and i always wondered why now i know i was hoping to to get blown away but i was not
<START> i hate over long over talky french movies but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and <UNK> french movie of them all i saw it twice in the mid 70's and then it disappeared but i finally got to see it again in 1999 and fell in love all over again what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago if you haven't seen it don't miss your chance
<START> i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed the movie wasn't even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snake bite victim <UNK> l jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy it all seemed worn flat and overtly formulaic i'm shocked to say i actually think <UNK> was more fun it's easy to understand that soap realizes it's a piece of s it and plays along with it but what the film fails to <UNK> on is a script that has any scares of suspense it's the worst kind of lame movie it's <UNK>
<START> br br i saw once no man's land 1987 imdb link http us imdb com title <UNK> and found it ok the film is about a guy who steals only <UNK> gone in sixty seconds comes 13 years after and adds nothing to it in fact it has a lot of scenes that are worthless and the ending is very very bad br br the <UNK> has a <UNK> screen presence that should have been better used
<START> in this day and age of incredible special movie effects this one was a sore disappointment the actors seemed stiff and uninspired as was the dialogue westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days but movies like <UNK> prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one considering that it is hard to <UNK> that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing much less creating such a weak film as this one if you love and are looking for a good western keep looking
<START> as with all <UNK> aware films from the 1970s soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> means there s too many people to feed i was under the impression that <UNK> were caused by either war or failed economic <UNK> <UNK> s policy in the soviet union in the 1930s left millions dead because of <UNK> and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was <UNK> s rural policy in china which led over 30 million <UNK> deaths in the 1950s and let s not forget the great <UNK> in the horn of africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not <UNK> you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth hong kong and <UNK> have never suffered a <UNK> in modern times likewise the <UNK> of <UNK> towns around cities as seen here <UNK> t strictly down to <UNK> it s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside it s a <UNK> of industrial progress not of too many <UNK> so the image of the streets of new york city being too <UNK> to walk through and of having people sleep in <UNK> is somewhat laughable br br but don t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree <UNK> crap because i consider this to be the best <UNK> film of the br br 70s it plays on the <UNK> audience s knowledge of the world where <UNK> and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit <UNK> and fresh meat thorn <UNK> in <UNK> at having ice in his <UNK> <UNK> on a cigarette and delivers the classic line if i could afford it i d smoke two maybe three of these a day but it s the <UNK> of the <UNK> chamber that s memorable as thorn <UNK> at the images of wild animals flowers running water and snow covered mountains a world thorn s generation has never known this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew <UNK> roth

<START> if this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of indian film industry <UNK> raj then i am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards br br if you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of anil akshay saif and kareena then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film the film lacks in almost all <UNK> except cinematography and akshay kumar he has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations br br the first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film that itself was a clear <UNK> of the director's vision every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted anil <UNK> gimmick of attempting good english falls flat most of the times and saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie br br in short it's the biggest waste of <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i would say that even <UNK> <UNK> was a better enjoyable movie than this br br one cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and <UNK> the most <UNK> was the flashback sequence of <UNK> love story after the <UNK> script the weakest point of the movie is its music <UNK> <UNK> have given just some filler tunes to each song the songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically only one song <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is somehow good of all in the lot an opportunity wasted by <UNK> <UNK> br br regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just <UNK> this akshay and saif are on the road in the <UNK> area of a foreign location probably <UNK> in the next scene they are searching for kareena in <UNK> and then back in the hills with kareena in the <UNK> of their car i am still thinking who wrote this br br if you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts you can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are god are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved so no more words on this pathetic and <UNK> movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan br br dear anil kapoor akshay kumar if possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out as artists of such stature you have certain <UNK> towards your fans and viewers people still <UNK> for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively i think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it <UNK> the reputation of all associated with the movie the actors and the production house both

<START> there are two reasons why i did not give a 1 to this movie one reason are some of the actors like malcolm mcdowell and <UNK> walsh work who tried to play at their usually good level of acting however at many scenes they were somehow <UNK> by the bad scripting br br the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg which is quite different to most other such roles i've seen so far br br everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be boring scenes useless and boring dialogs bad script work and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors it could have been an interesting story though but they failed completely
<START> notice that all those that did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it <UNK> from the book br br i don't understand this type of criticism books and films are different media while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines films have about <UNK> minutes yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses visual audio as well as the imagination i don't care if a film is as good as or in fact has any resemblance to the book on which it is based who cares i judge it for what it is br br this tv movie was charming an old and <UNK> seen story prone to cliché it could easily have been embarrassing however <UNK> and reeves pull it off one reviewer found <UNK> far to old i would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film it is to her credit as an actress that she played a 23 24 year old amazingly well i also think it is about the best thing reeves ever did the story could have been stronger and i agree the screen play could have used <UNK> nonetheless it is well worth watching clearly not a powerful love story but rather a charming romance which will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good <UNK> evil and it is nice to see a love story without the obligatory f word the naked <UNK> or hours of spit <UNK> kissing br br lastly the musical score is excellent
<START> this isn't a film it's a <UNK> minute <UNK> christian <UNK> <UNK> over red state america's 1 sport high school football another of the long earnest messages to the converted who are then presumed to be fired up enough by the spirit to go abroad and <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> br br dialogue like you won the big one when you accepted christ loses any possible camp appeal by the disturbing intensity in director coach alex <UNK> <UNK> black eyes then there are the <UNK> br br two <UNK> <UNK> for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it which one do you think god blessed this <UNK> question is meant to <UNK> the <UNK> climax in the course of which coach asks his <UNK> back up <UNK> son do you think god could help you make that kick it's the kind of entertainment we could have expected would receive faith based funding ad <UNK> if only the <UNK> christian bush <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> around the world had convinced us all to become <UNK> after their example behold that poor giants coach in the apocalyptic finale <UNK> his team on crying who's with me while the <UNK> <UNK> on the other side were quietly going about doing the <UNK> work br br so do you think our terrified back up makes his kick to <UNK> those self <UNK> <UNK> well we all know <UNK> can't lose put it this way transfer the playing ground to the <UNK> of the middle east replace the christian <UNK> and this <UNK> nonsense can easily be <UNK> as a <UNK> vs <UNK> <UNK> which the <UNK> <UNK> of this garbage might want to think about a minute br br luckily they won't care nor need to like coach tells his team of earnest empty <UNK> <UNK> the answers are all right here in this book and the christian right will <UNK> this on their way to their rapture that final victory they have prepared their fields for
<START> if this movie had not been labeled a disney picture i probably would not have been so disappointed the nudity was unnecessary and did not add anything the same can be said for the toilet bowl scene this is one disney film that i will not let my four year old nephew watch
<START> you know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies well if you've always found the plot line of a porn to <UNK> your interest then this movie is for you it truly was like a porn without the sex or if that <UNK> is not to your liking imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park <UNK> this is the movie that you would make horrible acting bad camera work music done on a <UNK> keyboard this movie has it all and more for those who are <UNK> in the crowd this is a premiere piece for your collection br br all i can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie were people who <UNK> in it br br their movie career is over before it started
<START> this <UNK> son and eastern <UNK> are my favourite sammo hung films the fat dragon is <UNK> in this outing than he was in <UNK> but he's no less sure <UNK> as director or actor he is in fact at the top of his form and delivers a devastating brutal <UNK> that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate sweet love story also love and romance are not the director's <UNK> here but they serve as curious <UNK> to the action and <UNK> that viewers don't hit the fast forward button between the physical <UNK> br br the opening scene which features a funny light <UNK> duel sets a solid but <UNK> tone a sequence in which <UNK> <UNK> is chased by a car is beautifully staged and <UNK> with a sharp comic tone the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp superb direction and easily one of the best ever of its type the film's violence <UNK> slowly until finally when the climactic showdown comes we are subjected to some of the most brutal <UNK> ever seen in a sammo production the director actor's assault on billy <UNK> and a house filled with angry menacing opponents is a bone cracking physically <UNK> delight br br terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made br br great score too
<START> david burton richard chamberlain quite good is a lawyer more <UNK> at handling corporate <UNK> and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this <UNK> man <UNK> in darkness who is called on to take a case concerning a group of <UNK> charged with the murder of one of their own named billy we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an <UNK> tribe named charlie <UNK> <UNK> uses a death bone to stop his heart meanwhile revolving around david bizarre weather <UNK> effect sydney such as rain beating down <UNK> dirt and rock sized <UNK> during bright blue <UNK> with no sights of clouds such as the one that hits a school in central australia not to mention a <UNK> <UNK> which is split into groups as david <UNK> the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize one <UNK> named chris david <UNK> appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial he finds that it's quite possible after some strange <UNK> with charlie and conversations with chris that he very well might be linked to a spirit named <UNK> and that his dreams are actual <UNK> of possible horrors yet to come br br absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it's story <UNK> and is completely original and unpredictable with peter <UNK> in charge the film is visually <UNK> as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization but the film's most compelling angle is certainly david's journey to find that monumental truth that <UNK> him as he questions charlie and chris <UNK> at first to help his men get off from a crime they didn't commit and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything <UNK> that is occurring or might occur later
<START> to quote <UNK> that was my reaction exactly wow you're perfect this is the best movie i think i can even say it's become my favorite movie ever even wow i tell you what wow

<START> a lovely old fashioned thriller coming on like a cross between alfred hitchcock and david lynch red rock west follows the <UNK> of injured veteran unemployed oil worker mr n cage as his luck turns from bad to worse after he ends up with an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a one <UNK> town in the back of beyond it has been established right from the start that mr cage might be down but he is not out and he might be broke but he will not steal not even in his present dire circumstances consequently when he is mistaken by mr j t walsh for the man he has <UNK> to murder his wife mr cage calls on the wife to warn her of her husband's intentions in turn she in the person of miss l f boyle offers him even more money to murder mr walsh mr cage decides to leave whilst he is still in front but as he is driving out of town he hits a man in the road tempted as he might be to drive on he takes the man to hospital where it turns out he has been shot mr cage is <UNK> by the <UNK> who call the sheriff who turns out to be mr j t walsh events take a further complicated turn when escaping from custody mr cage <UNK> avoids being run over by the real hit man on his way to fulfill his <UNK> about now you might be forgiven for thinking enough already but as it happens on the screen it seems a completely logical turn of events the narrative flow of the movie at this point seeming <UNK> mr d hopper is <UNK> cast as the hired killer like mr cage a <UNK> veteran this little piece of <UNK> keeps mr cage alive long enough out think the murderous trio and survive a little more <UNK> but still <UNK> it is a tribute to everybody involved that what sounds on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is in fact a tense exceptionally well made picture with fine performances all round red rock west is a movie <UNK> movie within five minutes you know you are going somewhere you've been before on plenty of occasions but you'll be very happy during the trip
<START> red rock west was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's with a superb script by john and rick <UNK> that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film it was brilliantly directed by john <UNK> and featured a marvellous cast including nicolas cage dennis hopper lara flynn boyle and especially j t walsh in a memorable performance making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed the film never had much publicity on release in fact i first caught up with it on tv and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following br br nicolas cage is michael williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of red rock mistaken for a contract killer named <UNK> from dallas he is shocked to be offered 10 000 to murder the wife of bar owner wayne brown the excellent j t walsh he plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn <UNK> wife suzanne lara flynn boyle but then the plot <UNK> and there are so many twists turns and surprises and double <UNK> that cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he can't drag himself out of then just to <UNK> matters even further the real <UNK> turns up to carry out the contract killing played by everyone's favourite heavy dennis hopper when hopper discovers what has happened he goes after cage but no one could <UNK> the surprising events that follow br br some favourite lines from the film br br nicolas cage to lara flynn boyle i hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it's an awful lot of money br br j t walsh to cage michael williams well michael you're going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this br br boyle to cage you're not a killer cage that's right no but the guy i'm supposed to be just <UNK> into town so you gotta get out of here br br boyle to cage o k how you're going to explain <UNK> a hired killer and taking 10 000 from my husband br br an extraordinarily entertaining little thriller just 98 minutes with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals any film featuring j t walsh is o k in my book and red rock west was one of his best how sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was cut <UNK> short by a heart attack in 1998 the most prolific period for film noir was without any doubt the forties but red rock west is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my top ten list of all time favourite films i look forward to more like this from director john <UNK> 10 10 clive roberts br br
<START> i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didn't know about this website and i didn't realize that the paul michael <UNK> that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael <UNK> that i grow up watching on <UNK> and <UNK> television show for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can't tell you how many times i cried when <UNK> or <UNK> got hurt the episode where <UNK> kill <UNK> almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show what to you expect of a kid at age 12 now i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i'm so there just got to say happy birthday paul
<START> eddie murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this hbo stand up comedy show i love his impressions of mr t ed norton and ralph <UNK> of the <UNK> elvis <UNK> and michael jackson too the ice cream man <UNK> goo goo is also funny i saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984 i laughed so hard i almost fell off my chair i still think this is very funny br br eddie murphy when he was on saturday night live made me laugh so hard he is one of the best people to come out of saturday night live eddie murphy delirious is his best stand up performance next to eddie murphy raw br br i give eddie murphy delirious 2 thumbs up and 10 10 stars
<START> i honestly think that that was the best version of war of the worlds i've every seen it was funny but it was also educational i learned whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up br br and if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely watch it br br thank you
<START> this is the true story of how three british soldiers escaped from the german prisoner of war <UNK> camp <UNK> <UNK> iii during the second world war this is the same <UNK> camp that was the scene for the great escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re captured officers by the <UNK> and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name br br while the other <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> iii are busy working on their three massive <UNK> known as tom dick harry two <UNK> british prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden <UNK> horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence <UNK> the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom the idea to build their version of the <UNK> horse came to them while they were discussing <UNK> attempts for escape and <UNK> some <UNK> playing leap frog in the compound br br initially containing one and later with two <UNK> hidden inside the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position near the fence on a daily basis while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over the horse the <UNK> were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the <UNK> horse while <UNK> near the wire under the wire and into the woods br br the story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping <UNK> faced while traveling through germany and occupied europe after they emerged from the tunnel all three <UNK> who tried to escape actually hit home runs escaped successfully to their home base the wooden horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a <UNK> <UNK> the movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two <UNK> traveled in their escape made with far less a budget than the great escape the wooden horse is more realistic if not more exciting than the great escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the <UNK> to make good their escape br br the story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie the wooden horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the <UNK> eric williams and is by far the best <UNK> escape story ever made into a movie some of the actual <UNK> were used in the movie to <UNK> their existence as prisoners in <UNK> <UNK> iii i give this movie a well deserved ten
<START> ok so it's a low budget film i used the quotes because it was shot in hi 8 video the acting is universally horrid the makeup is laughable the blood looks like it came from <UNK> williams and i've seen more convincing <UNK> made from halloween <UNK> <UNK> and the lighting generally looks like they used someone's borrowed <UNK> pickup to shine <UNK> on the actors br br i might be able to forgive these low budget traits if there were some actual content if a movie made an attempt to tell a story but this collection of video footage can <UNK> of no plot no real characters and no momentum it's a self indulgent mess br br and don't worry no spoilers here 'cause there's absolutely nothing to spoil
<START> i am currently doing film studies at a s level and this is not a love song is a film we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple storyline but a complex back story if you scratch the surface you will find a thriller chase film of two men running through the countryside from <UNK> after committing a murder sounds quite <UNK> br br however you need to dig deeper to <UNK> the true feeling of the true genre as it is suggested it is a love story between two homosexual lovers filled with trust <UNK> and betrayal we are not told about this love directly through the film but the events that happen through out for example the way <UNK> acts towards spike almost screams this <UNK> love affair in our faces br br overall this film is a good example of why british films should not be <UNK> as rubbish just because they are done on a low budget br br a good film with an intricate story line however it is definitely an acquired taste and is possibly not suitable for the average fan of hollywood blockbusters
<START> although i agree that it's a good but not great movie for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned i still enjoy it one reason is the music i'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the <UNK> brothers <UNK> and pete in a well staged scene in the nightclub these guys were two of the best jazz <UNK> of their day and they manage to convincingly <UNK> the mind of jimmy stewart by playing an hysterical <UNK> <UNK> one <UNK> in each of stewart's ears the <UNK> really did play that well too though i suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them i don't know much about george <UNK> who gets the credit for the music other than that he seems to have worked with the three stooges on more than one occasion but the casting of the <UNK> brothers as jazz playing <UNK> was a real nice touch
<START> not to long after jeff <UNK> left the <UNK> for good he spoke of that night owen hart and him where good friends and both 2nd generation <UNK> jeff first remarks i was literally pushed thru the curtain as my lifeless friends body was <UNK> past me debra <UNK> steve <UNK> ex wife as well as steve <UNK> <UNK> ex wife br br as owen hart fell a video <UNK> the ring was <UNK> as a blue <UNK> owen hart <UNK> was played the fall and video of owen in the ring was never showed on tv there are a few news photos that got posted when they came back from the video <UNK> jim ross was talking over a all we had was a crowd shot he stated that owen hart as the blue <UNK> has fallen and doesn't look good <UNK> then came back from the ring his face was <UNK> he told jim that the situation was very critical <UNK> where working hard to revive him rock and <UNK> where going there match in a private room when another <UNK> came in and told them owen fell at first knowing owen <UNK> constantly being a <UNK> they thought it wasn't real but both later stated that the look of the <UNK> face said it all in fact as he fell as mentioned in other post he <UNK> for the <UNK> and ring <UNK> to move br br brother <UNK> hart was a plane heading to la to do a angle on the tonight show he couldn't get any of the plane phones to work one of the <UNK> got a message to call home something had happened when he landed in la eric <UNK> was there told him what had happened and put him on a <UNK> flight to kansas city to the <UNK> <UNK> even later with <UNK> widow martha went up to the top of the <UNK> where owen was standing police found no foul play <UNK> closed as a accident br br most of the information in <UNK> <UNK> book as well as the book by martha hart
<START> perhaps the funniest <UNK> at <UNK> movie ever especially for a look at comedy short <UNK> like <UNK> br br marion davies should get a <UNK> for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role plenty of cameos for film buffs
<START> as drunken millionaire playboy arthur bach dudley moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood as it turned out the role fit moore so perfectly it trapped him as an actor as well many <UNK> soon followed including this film's pale sequel yet that doesn't <UNK> the charm or appeal of this picture which is cleverly written and directed some of moore's drunk scenes are forced parts of the film are <UNK> but the cast performs with so much <UNK> it's a difficult movie to resist it has a very big heart and gives oscar winner john gielgud a sly <UNK> amusing role as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his relationship with arthur is delicious and they have a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> minnelli as a blue collar love interest is sassy in a low key and moore is <UNK> but <UNK> and lively he never <UNK> off the shadow of arthur but at least we have this document of a career high point to <UNK> from
<START> when i think <UNK> in <UNK> my mind often goes to sleazy italian spanish productions by directors such as jess franco and bruno mattei and while these films are often very sleazy they're also very <UNK> and once you've seen one you might as well have seen them all i have to admit that these types of films generally aren't my favourites but in fact the idea of women behind bars has been done very well on several occasions outside of italy and spain and roger <UNK> new world pictures is responsible for some of the best of them <UNK> heat is the directorial debut of oscar winning director jonathan <UNK> and it's a well done little flick with plenty of entertainment value naturally the film <UNK> on the story of a girl who is caught committing crime and sent to a <UNK> prison where she is introduced to a host of violent inmates this prison is ruled over by the stuff wheelchair bound <UNK> mcqueen and she takes <UNK> to a play put on by the girls leading them to plot an escape br br this film is much lighter on the sleaze than i'm used to in a women in prison flick but this is more than <UNK> for by some great action scenes and dialogue and that's what <UNK> <UNK> heat entertains throughout it does have to be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically follows a structure similar to many other women in prison films that came before it but that's not such a big problem the film never gets boring and is <UNK> with standout scenes including an escape attempt while out working in a field and a bank robbery the film is helped along by assured direction from the man who would go on to <UNK> the masterpiece the silence of the <UNK> and a great cast with plenty of <UNK> including best of all the legendary barbara steele in the role of the head prison warden overall <UNK> heat may not leave the viewer with much to think about by the end but it's a brilliantly entertaining little <UNK> flick and anyone that enjoys this type of film will surely want to track it down
<START> for the life of me i can't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this the plot is tired the acting is strained the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the f word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so <UNK> throw in another couple of <UNK> for good measure that's what the american public wants to <UNK> <UNK> was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part forget this c p rent <UNK> and have a good laugh
<START> the dinner party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time it is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actors portray their roles excellently the kitchen scene starring <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is magnificent the use of the <UNK> and milk really makes the scene additionally the doctor's office scene is well done the <UNK> scene is filled with enjoyable action though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable asia <UNK> performance in the <UNK> scene is incredible but who would expect anything less from her the closing scene is somewhat over used in adult films but is classic none the less i would highly recommend this film to all fans of adult films and those casual viewers run out to your video store and pick it up today
<START> this movie makes no sense at all there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous <UNK> vehicles through the characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever i will put my comments in the chat board but save your time and money this is stupid i can't stand when hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level but it is nice to see denzel w <UNK> over the man who comes in 3 <UNK> <UNK> foster mayor <UNK> and capt von <UNK> there is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice
<START> this movie is just boring br br it tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> but it is too much the dialogs are pretty bad some of the worst i have ever heard <UNK> <UNK> is not convincing i have almost never found him very convincing his father in the movie plays very badly the story is dumb the ending is stupid br br i think i have not dislike a movie so much since le <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> of the wolf from <UNK> <UNK> and i watch see about 80 100 movies a year but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors br br i had never commented here only rated and when i saw the rating and the comments i thought i had to write something down br br i guess we won't have problems to sell the dvd we were offered not such a bad movie in our large collection br br i am open minded i watch sf westerns drama comedies <UNK> horror fantasy movies but this movie was so boring that i felt like i had lost one hour and a half
<START> a true <UNK> in the french cinema this <UNK> work has no equivalent in the contemporary production one would rather have to look on the side of louis <UNK> le <UNK> <UNK> 1963 the fire within to find something not completely unlike <UNK> effort <UNK> and cynical having lost all his <UNK> the hero a computer scientist has got no more reason to live absolutely none estranged from the human race he seems to live his life as some kind of <UNK> studying his colleagues one of them catches his attention <UNK> <UNK> garcia plays the most <UNK> part of the decade then <UNK> will become some kind of prey all his <UNK> will rub off on this poor man the scene is the night club <UNK> the strange relationship the hero tells his victim that his life will always be <UNK> unless he well now the movie takes a more conventional turn so to speak <UNK> <UNK> maybe but just for a while br br the form is weird beyond comment there are two voices over one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as our hero one for the aforementioned hero the story takes place now in paris now in <UNK> guy de <UNK> town in a scene with his shrink the hero says the writer's madness was only the expression of his disgust for man and he draws a parallel between his despair and <UNK> one br br this depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience not for the very short <UNK> of x rated movies but because after watching it you may be feeling down in the <UNK>
<START> when you see the cover of the dvd you're convinced this is some class b cheesy <UNK> a film made for 1 000 in <UNK> backyard br br wrong br br this is quality material and really good it's a comedy and a clever one at that it also is very touching in spots with a nice spot of kindness the production values are very good this looks excellent the actors are known the film's direction and sets are great it's amazing who would have thought br br carrie ann moss playing against type is terrific as helen robinson the june <UNK> like wife billy connolly is great as the <UNK> good hearted zombie fido tim blake nelson mr <UNK> is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend <UNK> and henry <UNK> and dylan baker as <UNK> check are excellent too <UNK> ray as young timmy robinson shouldn't be overlooked either in fact he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone br br if i explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it you'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very very pleasant surprise you need a dark sense of humor though an appreciation of the absurd
<START> may contain spoilers br br i say that but anyone <UNK> enough to be reading this can probably figure out every plot turn right from the start br br this is not a movie that i liked i didn't hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence but it all felt too predictable on its <UNK> to the requisite happy ending there were funny bits along the way to be sure but few were original at least it didn't go for the <UNK> br br christina <UNK> looks fresh and ben affleck works hard their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature everyone else is a cardboard <UNK> including surprisingly james gandolfini who must have made this as a favor to someone br br all in all it's a harmless but not inspiring 90 minutes
<START> i saw this movie originally in the theater when i was 10 even at that age the <UNK> was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence br br in the past whenever i would see ed <UNK> jr or jeff goldblum i would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad until i was reminded of the existence of this movie today i was unsure why i felt that way apparently i <UNK> my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the <UNK> remained apparently i forgot that i saw this movie but <UNK> <UNK> the pieces of my soul that had been stolen <UNK> eaten by the creators of this <UNK> work br br i haven't been brave enough to try watching it as an adult i imagine that as part of the healing process that i should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that i can truly put it behind me some <UNK> therapy and or <UNK> might not be a bad idea either
<START> power rangers the moronic <UNK> television kids show from the 1990s has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created br br what exactly is the point of this show anyway other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children there is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway br br look at the costumes which look like <UNK> gone bad br br the <UNK> style hair <UNK> and fashions of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days br br avoid this show at all costs
<START> as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are <UNK> and <UNK> the dvds themselves we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from broken in disc form and yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation br br with regards to the latter the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non <UNK> transfer otherwise we get the film in its original 1 85 1 ratio <UNK> no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected indeed given <UNK> hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact br br the same is also true of the soundtrack here we are offered both <UNK> 0 and <UNK> 1 mixes and whilst i'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the original the fact that <UNK> had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior indeed though the <UNK> 1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience <UNK> to the manner in which it <UNK> the score both are equally fine and free of technical flaws br br as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them take a look at the <UNK> on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous <UNK> loads of <UNK> and various <UNK> indeed given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute <UNK> rather than <UNK> into a lengthy documentary there really is little to discuss the <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> for example is exactly what it claims to be and the same goes for the rest of pieces as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of <UNK> pre production production and post production and whilst it may have been <UNK> to find them in a more easily <UNK> overall <UNK> <UNK> in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view br br of the various pieces then it is perhaps only the <UNK> which need any kind of discussion then again there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks the one involving the actors is overly <UNK> and doesn't take the film too seriously <UNK> pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing and the technical ones are well extremely technical of course we also get some <UNK> with what's been covered elsewhere on the <UNK> but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces <UNK> their welcome indeed all in all a fine extras package
<START> as is nearly always the case when britain comes up with an entertaining and or successful sit com or <UNK> show the <UNK> will come along and <UNK> the format and produce their own grossly inferior version man about the house is of course no exception to that rule the <UNK> version <UNK> company was unwatchable <UNK> <UNK> that seem to run forever a prime example of <UNK> over non existent quality the original on the other hand is a <UNK> remembered gem that had the <UNK> like <UNK> towers to pull the plug at precisely the right time unlike the <UNK> episodes of <UNK> that <UNK> company came up with jo was cute there was brilliant chemistry between the <UNK> richard <UNK> made it all look so easy the scripts whilst not exactly oscar <UNK> standard were consistently funny and <UNK> was the most drop dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since the dead sea was merely feeling <UNK> <UNK> said
<START> probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life and i enjoyed it the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in <UNK> in 1974 to finally defeat the fascist government of <UNK> and to also <UNK> the wars in the <UNK> i e <UNK> <UNK> and guinea <UNK> cape <UNK> most of the events shown in the film reflect with <UNK> the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup of the <UNK> people who were very happy with this new development and the liberty the resistance of <UNK> men and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials including <UNK> who took over as the new president the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that <UNK> should develop itself <UNK> and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone even the most serious enemies were respected at the end
<START> despite some reviews being distinctly luke warm i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as <UNK> and <UNK> so what it is good to see a warm touching story of real love in these cynical times many in the audience were <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> their eyes you really believe that the young victoria and albert are <UNK> fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage i did feel though that sir john <UNK> who was desperate to control the young queen is perhaps played too like a <UNK> villain as it is <UNK> that he was in fact the real father of victoria as a result of an affair with her mother the <UNK> of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess trapped in the <UNK> palace with <UNK> and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england which <UNK> as never before under her long reign i believe word of mouth <UNK> will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie
<START> having read another review i thought this movie would actually be good i do enjoy the b movies but this couldn't even be <UNK> as such the photography is probably the only half way decent thing in the movie but the editing left much to be desired it was very choppy and <UNK> whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job the music was awful specially anything atmospheric or scene setting if the acting had been better they could have pulled the movie off unfortunately i've seen better acting in porn flicks if you want to see a b vampire movie check out <UNK> <UNK> you'll be much more entertained
<START> well then what is it i found <UNK> character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> my power and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut it's not that i don't get it it's not that i don't think that some of the ideas could've lead to something more this is a film with nothing but the notion that we're supposed to accept these ideas and that's what the movie has going for it that nicholson falls for turner is absurd but then again it is intended to be so this however does not strike me as a funny or b even remotely interesting this was a waste of my time so don't let the hype get the best of you it is a waste of your time with all that being said the opening church sequence is quite beautiful
<START> this anime series starts out great interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not everything is explained right away <UNK> a proverbial <UNK> before the viewer <UNK> the viewer to watch each <UNK> episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the sci fi thriller giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho <UNK> and quasi religious preachy exploitation if you want to hear you're ok it's good to be you after being <UNK> with negative <UNK> and the characters' negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good sci fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy
<START> maybe the greatest film ever about jazz br br it is jazz br br the opening shot continues to haunt my <UNK> br br lester of course is wonderful and out of this world br br jo jones is always a delight see the sound of jazz as well br br if you can find the music it's available on cd br br all lovers of jazz and film noir should study this tremendous jewel br br what shadows and light what music what a hat
<START> this is my first cg animated film that i've ever seen usually the look of other animated films made me <UNK> to see them not ice age i wanted to see it the moment i saw the trailer with <UNK> the hilarious <UNK> <UNK> br br ice age was <UNK> funny and overall fun film to watch the story is basically an animated version of three men and a baby set 20 000 years in the past the visuals were great simply beautiful it's one thing to create convincing <UNK> it's another thing altogether to create visually <UNK> stuff and ice age is great to look at with its stylized visuals blue sky studios is a company to look out for in the future
<START> some war movies succeed where others do not and that can be judged from a variety of angles the <UNK> angle one where you can feel the raw emotions the terror of being under attack the <UNK> amongst soldiers the <UNK> trials people face inside them when in combat etc are always movies i find compelling movies like <UNK> boot and a midnight clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film br br this film succeeds on that level as well it speaks of the highest honor and that honor is doing the right thing these 23 soldiers did the right thing they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly <UNK> with western thought but it is to the very end a true story of honor unforgettable movie based on the true story
<START> the plot of this film might not be extraordinary but what makes the film really special are its characters and the actors who play them  of course i won't go into the details of the plot of the movie but i would certainly like to say this  this film is not just for everyone the film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire if you're not alert even for a second you'll probably end up missing one of the subtle points the movie is full of such seemingly trivial but witty stuff like the <UNK> going on in the background at <UNK> the <UNK> on the <UNK> which i almost missed and it are these that make the movie hilarious throughout br br coming to the actors john cusack has played his multi <UNK> role very <UNK> what with him being the co writer and the producer too and he plays his character  <UNK> the killer with a heart  <UNK> <UNK> done a similar kind of role before in <UNK> <UNK> blank but his comic <UNK> in the movie is simply superb br br however the actress who steals all the show is <UNK> duff i have always been a huge fan of ms duff but to be honest i was a bit disappointed when i heard about the kind of role she's playing in the movie but after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor let's face it the kid's growing but yes so is her talent all those critics who <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> cannot act will be silent for a while <UNK> had to play a really complex character  tough on the outside yet a sweet child on the inside  and she's done complete justice to it she makes you laugh and she makes you cry  to cut the long story short 'cause i could go on raving about her for ever she's brilliant marisa tomei and joan cusack have done a good job too especially <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> however i was rather disappointed with ben kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lackluster br br in general war inc keeps you on your <UNK> throughout with its intelligent humor and ends with just the right amount of twists in the plot i would highly recommend this movie to all and more so to <UNK> duff fans p s i am really glad to hear the movie is going to break free of its limited release and release at other places soon
<START> when i first went to watch the shining i was expecting a decent film from what i had heard about it and i liked a lot of stanley kubrick's other work but when i started to watch it it was so much better than i thought it would be at times i seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and i couldn't take my eyes of the screen still there's something very disturbing about everything in the film now some people don't like kubrick's version of the shining since it doesn't entirely follow stephen king's book but in my opinion both kubrick's version the mini series and the book are all great jack nicholson gives an awesome performance if you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch the shining
<START> carlos <UNK> continually violently <UNK> screaming b <UNK> at women is like screaming n <UNK> at black people except it's worse remember the b word unlike the n word is the only <UNK> term that is still associated on a daily basis with violence b <UNK> is the last thing women hear before they are raped beaten or murdered this guy is <UNK> violence by <UNK> using the language of violence sounds like he may be a gay guy trying to cover by woman bashing so that he will sound like a <UNK> and how about all the nazi white guys in his audience giving the fascist <UNK> while their stupid little bimbo white women <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at their side clearly terrified to protest this <UNK> wave of woman hating <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bet <UNK> doesn't believe or support free speech for them come on carlos  do you want women to have the free speech to b <UNK> slap you as <UNK> and violently and big mouthed as you do or do you think free speech is only for men to crap on women
<START> there are movies like plan 9 that are so bad they have a charm about them there are some like <UNK> that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident and there are some like desperate living that you hate to admit you love <UNK> have none of these <UNK> the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable and from what i've been told the book is enjoyable br br how then could this movie be so <UNK> bad to begin with it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings then tell them to do their best kevin <UNK> <UNK> open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide <UNK> of america from being interesting in any way finally give the editing job to your brother in law because the meat <UNK> plant just laid him off he does have twenty years of cutting experience br br this movie now <UNK> the basement for me it is so bad it isn't even good for being bad
<START> this ambitious film suffers most from writer director paul thomas <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> highly derivative of much better material altman's <UNK> <UNK> network this <UNK> elephant takes far too long to get nowhere a couple of misguided <UNK> along the way an embarrassing musical <UNK> a biblical plague don't help matters neither does the uneven level of performances especially bad william h macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether <UNK> moore for her unconvincing angst and how many times must we see john c <UNK> sad sack <UNK> chicago and the hours will suffice tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his <UNK> foul mouthed holy roller was rather amusing speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with f bombs they lost their impact in no time don't even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying <UNK> by <UNK> mann her extended rendition of one a <UNK> number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film i should have <UNK> the <UNK> on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time i'd been pushed to the brink of hell one redeeming feature which i haven't seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown <UNK> <UNK> in the role of <UNK> the damaged coke fiend bent on self destruction her credibility <UNK> all others by far this film took itself way too seriously and just didn't know when to end
<START> the town of <UNK> <UNK> is a weird but wonderful place the characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works and it works very well most people will know others with a touch of some characters but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as <UNK> and edward the stranger hating owners of the local shop or the pen obsessed pauline who treats <UNK> <UNK> with much contempt that was only a few of the strange inhabitants the tv works consists of 3 series and a christmas special there are references to many horror films such as the wicker man a more recent addition to the range of works is a film the league of <UNK> apocalypse of which i will not say much but highly recommend all in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly <UNK> characters i would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it
<START> but a lousy film as <UNK> says this was christopher lee's attempt to make a serious horror film well it is serious too serious the plot is silly and slow something about old people <UNK> the bodies of young children to achieve <UNK> the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again i actually <UNK> off a few times the film is <UNK> dull the cast <UNK> through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee but this was probably a labor of love for both they often complained about horror movies being too violent well this has no violence avoid at all costs unless you have insomnia this will put you to sleep
<START> this film is terrible the characters are completely unbelievable and wildly inconsistent the plot is awful and some of the <UNK> scenes are cringe worthy and make for uncomfortable viewing br br in fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that in fact the writers probably never went to high school the acting in most cases was weak too although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot i am not sure that any actors could have made this film watchable br br having said that the sound track was ok and the cinematography was nice in places although the editing was poor
<START> i can see why this film was oscar nominated for best live action short as it was constructed masterfully even if you don't particularly like the blues though to me this sounded much more like jazz you can easily appreciate this film it is simply very well made though for the life of me i can't see why director <UNK> <UNK> only got to direct one film this one in other words the film is nominated and yet the director didn't get any sort of career boost as for the black performers i could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear as unfortunately most of white society have indifference or worse for blacks or that kind of music br br if you do watch this film if you aren't particularly enjoying the earlier portion skip ahead to about the 5 50 mark where it picks up considerably when the lady stopped singing and the performers began to <UNK> the pace improved quite a bit
<START> when i was a kid of 8 i always watched movies and television that i wasn't supposed to and this was one of them br br it's one of my favorite movies of all time and it has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life the acting is excellent they don't make comedies like this anymore these days movies that are actually funny and make you laugh without <UNK> to <UNK> or some type of vomit inducing body fluid as in those retarded judd <UNK> movies starring unfunny non actors like seth <UNK> <UNK> br br this movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the <UNK>
<START> i guess when beat street made a national appearance <UNK> came at the same time the problem with <UNK> is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet that was one of the reasons why beat street was better the only movie that could rival beat street seems to be <UNK> because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their <UNK> feelings br br the break dance scenes in beat street come just before the middle and at the end of the flick and i loved all of them almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes the <UNK> the <UNK> the head <UNK> the suicide sit the crazy legs the mortal the forward flip the figure four almost everything br br like the warriors beat street does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world but in a much less violent way than the former the only major fight scene in beat street was when <UNK> artist <UNK> which in the movie was <UNK> as <UNK> is chased by a rival gang member on the new york city subway tracks fighting each other on the third <UNK> and both dying by <UNK> on that <UNK> well although that chase scene ended <UNK> it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang <UNK> br br most of the gang stuff in the flick was <UNK> related to the hip hop culture and rap music a lot of rap music appeared in the flick because hip hop members used rap music as a <UNK> to the negative aspects of gang life even the theme song of the movie which closed the curtain to the flick was not just an homage to hip hop culture it also was an homage to the death of <UNK> br br by the way during the dance scene called <UNK> <UNK> i guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra <UNK> by actress <UNK> dawn chong was sheila e making a cameo appearance
<START> br br i saw the <UNK> fox in the theatre when i was nine years old i <UNK> my parents to take me back three times i began looking for it on video about five years ago finally <UNK> a copy on an online <UNK> site but i would love to see it either picked up by a new <UNK> and <UNK> i understand the original video run was small or have the rights purchased by the family channel disney etc and shown regularly it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of <UNK> in northern japan narrated by a wise old tree the excellent soundtrack <UNK> the film well it would be a good <UNK> today better than many of the weak offerings to children's movies today
<START> note these comments are for people who have seen the movie br br vanilla sky is a brilliant complex and thrilling movie that <UNK> explores exactly what the tag line says <UNK> maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie goers if one looks at it from a different angle br br considering the following br br now i have not <UNK> gone through the film scene by scene so i will have to further examine my <UNK> and i welcome your thoughts but give this a try and see if the movie doesn't fall into place where exactly does the <UNK> <UNK> occur br br now i'm not talking about the <UNK> as it is explained by the l e <UNK> since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a <UNK> inside of david <UNK> mind dream coma state but the true <UNK> between reality and dream br br it seems to me that the reality of the car crash the way that it is filmed no explosion for example is a likely <UNK> point and that any particular sequence containing an existential dream coma non reality feel to it whether it's shown <UNK> before or after the crash is actually a part of <UNK> personal journey toward self realization inside of his own mind br br in that respect then we are left with two questions at the very end if you know of more let me know is <UNK> actually <UNK> and where does he wake up br br if you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today's pop culture society br br
<START> do not watch this movie if you loved the classics such as tom <UNK> john schneider catherine bach <UNK> <UNK> james best denver <UNK> sonny <UNK> and ben jones this movie will <UNK> you badly first of all this movie starts out with bo and luke running <UNK> for jesse bo and luke would not do that ever on the real series this movie portrays <UNK> characters doing things that never would have happened in the series in the series uncle jesse was honest and law <UNK> in this movie he is a criminal who is making <UNK> and smoking <UNK> with the <UNK> of georgia plus if this was an <UNK> adding on to the dukes of hazzard reunion and the dukes of hazzard in hollywood i have one question how could uncle jesse be making <UNK> when he died before the dukes of hazzard in hollywood movie and how is boss <UNK> alive when he died before the reunion movie in 1997 movie and <UNK> ran hazzard it seems magical that these characters came back to life when they have been dead for 11 and 8 years if hollywood really wanted to make a good movie they should have brought back james best john schneider tom <UNK> ben jones and catherine bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting <UNK> movie if you want to see good dukes movies either buy the original series or go out to <UNK> com and buy the dvd set of 2 that includes the reunion and dukes of hazzard in hollywood movies they both star the original cast and are family friendly don't waste your time on a movie that isn't worth the cd it's written on
<START> <UNK> is a preposterous <UNK> acting showcase that adds up to very little like eyes wide shut <UNK> is an <UNK> series of episodes without any concern for <UNK> the camera <UNK> through <UNK> and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters where is the reason to care for these people the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who can't care for others except for john c <UNK> and philip seymour <UNK> characters and are self destructive <UNK> who are either falling to pieces or dying i was reminded of how much i disliked shine because of the <UNK> monster of a father played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there are so many unattractive unappealing characters here why would we want to spend time with them br br having said that there is nothing held back about <UNK> paul thomas <UNK> ideas are <UNK> onto his <UNK> with abandon there are two ideas in particular that bomb both happen in the last hour of this <UNK> minute film one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> folk songs sweet but <UNK> since we can't see what strings them all together the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous br br <UNK> has a lot of great acting particularly tom cruise who <UNK> a performance i didn't know he had in him and john c <UNK> plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory but it all adds up to nothing when the secret unexpected event happened a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said this is stupid my feeling is the majority of <UNK> will agree
<START> i was really stunned how much a film that's over 60 years old could impress me it is nearly two hours long there are absolutely no stars in it there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch what impressed me mostly was the realism of the film you could nearly feel the <UNK> of the ice because you could see that the <UNK> are real this is a relief in a cgi world like <UNK> i wondered how much work this must have been for van dyke i read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it now who wants to talk about <UNK> anymore it's a great film with a great message and i would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects
<START> who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn <UNK> to see his brother could possibly be good cinema i certainly didn't i thought i knew what to expect one of the most boring experiences of my life well i was as wrong as i haven't been wrong too often yet because this is one of the best most realistic and honest hollywood films i've ever seen br br giving a short resume of the straight story isn't very difficult it's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn <UNK> and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke that's already special on itself but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasn't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument in the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks not knowing if he will reach his goal seeing his brother again before it's too late br br i can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why i will not say that these people don't have a heart or things like that this movie hasn't got any flashy action scenes it is as slow as the lawn <UNK> the man is driving on and no you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either because there isn't any but why should you watch it then well the simple answer is the story i haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from hollywood and to make things even better from the disney <UNK> that's right the same studios that <UNK> us with sugar sweet nonsense makes it even more special i'm not ashamed to admit that i had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me br br some people will argue that the story is very shallow but i really don't agree with that perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn <UNK> and don't want to think any further if you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too so they won't make the same mistake if that isn't deep enough how much deeper does a story have to go for you then br br i would also like to add that this movie really had it all some beautiful landscapes finally an american movie that shows something else than the <UNK> of new york chicago or some other big city some very fine acting by richard farnsworth sissy <UNK> and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a david lynch movie i know now that i was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldn't be to my taste it's one of the very best movies i've seen in a long time this movie aimed for my heart and hit the <UNK> eye i give it the full 10 10
<START> i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies but all of them failed to meet my expectations until now burning paradise doesn't contain the flat humor most hk movies have nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film the story is not complex but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some intelligent space the only <UNK> intelligent martial arts film i have seen is <UNK> tiger but since hollywood is involved it is no true hk movie for me there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie from the first one which is one of the coolest i have ever seen yet so short to the last main scenes but mind there's also a lot of blood that flows people cut in half decapitated etc the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be <UNK> even though some shots must be pretty technical notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got <UNK> into a wall yep it's not tsui <UNK> or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film it's <UNK> <UNK> and i'm sure as hell going to check out more from this director ace
<START> the cast is ok the script is awkward at times and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is i found myself looking forward to doing the <UNK> the <UNK> bit is a cheesy statement on the war i guess we were supposed to not notice it we did its a house you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes the shower part huh what was that about literally it is i have a client ok you can use our shower yawn the angles are trying way to hard there was a set of woods suddenly its gone cause you can see right through then next it is deep and animals are dying in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions
<START> i'm gonna give it to ya straight this movie is amazing foreign gay films are so fast <UNK> american gay films in production quality acting and story while so many american indie gay films are grainy bad sound amateur acting trite story lines and a surprising lack of any nudity or <UNK> top quality foreign gay films have been popping up like this one from france the cinematography is beautiful thought out meaningful the story is adult and complex but not difficult for anyone to follow the acting is intense and professional both leads are fantastic as well as the entire cast the boys are more than just good looking and there's plenty of full frontal nudity you follow the entire year of these boys from their meeting to the end all the little nuances of a <UNK> the details of falling in and out of love are there beautifully performed it left me wanting more check it out
<START> oh man if you want to give your internal crow t robot a real <UNK> this is the movie to pop into the ol' vcr the potential for cut up lines in this film is just endless br br minor spoilers ahead hey do you really care if a film of this quality is spoiled <UNK> is a girl with a problem psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite sex parent but this girl seems to have one for her same sex one and i don't think there's a term for that it might be because her mother dana is played by <UNK> arquette whose cute <UNK> neo <UNK> sexuality and <UNK> figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters here dana is not only clueless to her daughter's conduct she seems to be competing for the gold <UNK> in the olympic indulgent mother competition br br it's possible that dana misses <UNK> murderous streak because truth be told <UNK> seems to have the criminal skills of a <UNK> it's only because the script <UNK> so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count br br a particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of carmen a mexican maid who is described by dana as around so long she's like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say i just fell off the <UNK> truck from <UNK> carmen is so wise to <UNK> scheming she might also wear a sign saying hey i'm the next victim sure enough <UNK> confronts carmen as carmen is making her way back from mass and <UNK> her with one of those slightly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that car <UNK> put next to your spare as a bad joke i rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire br br in another sequence arquette wears a flimsy dress to a <UNK> under <UNK> <UNK> talking to the owner cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny <UNK> talking to the <UNK> brother then cut to her wearing the first dress in the first location under <UNK> <UNK> but it's supposed to be later you get the picture we're talking really bad directing br br as for skin don't expect much although <UNK> does own a nice couple of <UNK> br br for those looking for a trash <UNK> 8 for anybody else 1 2
<START> i loved this movie i'll admit it this has to be the best straight to video movie i've seen well me and my friend decided just for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that we'd rent this movie we knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected plus more when that red neck gets <UNK> up against the tree by the sasquatch we literally watched that part about three to four times it was that amazing hysterically of course and why oh why does the main character have to roll that much like honestly we know that you're in danger rolling that much isn't gonna help all that much but really if this movie is in you're local video store rent it it is worth the money and it's not even that bad like it's bad but not incredibly bad overall complete amazing will be in store for you if you rent this movie
<START> i'm <UNK> yes that's right i'm really caught here no way did i find it awful but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky <UNK> the idea behind such a <UNK> minimal low budget indie production isn't bad but it's a confused <UNK> and in the end didn't do anything for me it's amateurish and simple it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of late <UNK> rapid filming style we have the documentary laced hand held camera moving everywhere despite never leaving the van and sometimes feeling <UNK> and <UNK> making certain details hard to figure out lately you kind of get use to it but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating keeping it still will help the context has little <UNK> which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads at a road side store they become involved in a minor accident which <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scared they flee and not too long that one light <UNK> appears behind them soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror spending most of the time playing out a drawn out <UNK> and relentless cat and mouse game br br as for being <UNK> i guess that depends some moments can make you <UNK> with its attention to pain desperation and demented brutality with good use of <UNK> sound fx that seem to be more <UNK> over the imagery and not forgetting the <UNK> background sound effects but also i found myself <UNK> too in <UNK> it can be <UNK> and intense with a real <UNK> rush but hardly believable the <UNK> of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe despite obviously they should be watch how blood runs <UNK> but it's not entirely convincing and can get dull the constant <UNK> car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive we get screaming <UNK> bleeding running <UNK> body <UNK> and so on quite unpleasant details followed too with little really to do it needed a much stronger script than the <UNK> forced one that was penned up too many cringe moments <UNK> from it and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in it was about set pieces waiting for next <UNK> encounter and it drew it out long enough helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern br br the performances jennifer <UNK> angela <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sandra <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> like with their <UNK> characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the <UNK> weaknesses in its character foundation <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out bug eyed intensity as the loony driver of the <UNK> was <UNK> yeah something her character's real motivation for <UNK> the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non existent i guess being psychotic was good enough now probably the most unnerving thing i came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack terrible <UNK> music to cheesy hard rock and an overwrought closing score it never felt overdone or got in the way but it did stick out like a sore thumb co directors greg <UNK> and ryan <UNK> try to get the most out of their slight resources but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite <UNK> maybe it was enjoyable to make but watching it just wasn't the case
<START> <UNK> refers to this as a mainly political movie a description of the revolutionary movement in italy but that seems more metaphor than reality well almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor the <UNK> of whom we see and about whom we learn very little might as well be <UNK> out with the old and in with the new br br <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> seems to stand for the usual traditional <UNK> values morally <UNK> <UNK> clean and <UNK> thoroughly <UNK> br br <UNK> the girlfriend of a revolutionary seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to <UNK> up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands i'm guessing here <UNK> the adolescent boy seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some <UNK> way <UNK> he's <UNK> of his father but <UNK> too he loves <UNK> or so we assume although he's not really old enough to have learned how to manage his <UNK> <UNK> but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final <UNK> his course between these <UNK> <UNK> could be described as media he's the man in between who knows the meaning of <UNK> who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming br br most of this is summed up during the <UNK> part of his <UNK> when he is asked to translate and comment on an <UNK> from <UNK> which <UNK> the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of <UNK> and free will br br that brings us by no particular course that i'm aware of to <UNK> <UNK> she brings to mind a new <UNK> cartoon of a few years ago two <UNK> are neck deep in the river staring at a <UNK> drinking from the bank and one <UNK> says to the other i hate her she's a good actress let me get that out of the way but so is everyone else in the film she carries with her in her speech and manner the rich <UNK> of outright <UNK> and it all comes from the actress too not from directorial aid <UNK> isn't nuts the way catherine <UNK> was nuts in <UNK> the walls don't turn to rubber and grow hands instead we see her animated sometimes too animated and she gives us shocking <UNK> when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a <UNK> <UNK> is threatening br br a critic described her as <UNK> but that's probably not the word he was searching for she's <UNK> beautiful with her <UNK> brown hair her wide white ready grin her <UNK> <UNK> and her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient egyptian <UNK> the sexy parts are pretty erotic not so much because one of them is explicit but because we've gotten to know the characters involved it's more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick actually there isn't that much sex there is only one scene of <UNK> <UNK> but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time at least real time for an <UNK> year old boy br br the young man who plays <UNK> is fine too which is a necessary thing because the film depends almost entirely on him and <UNK> they have to carry it and they do if it were not for their performances i'm not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is it could easily have been turned into a rather slow boring romance br br worth it
<START> aka <UNK> is still my name this sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on the outstanding european box office success of they call me <UNK> only this time joseph e <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> pictures wanted to capitalize on it in america as well too bad they didn't get very far since the hill spencer pictures have had only had <UNK> success here in the u s and this largely boring drawn out film doesn't help it out any br br <UNK> and <UNK> swear to their dying father harry carey jr that they will become successful <UNK> and take care of each other they later get involved with arms <UNK> who <UNK> guns out of a monastery and who <UNK> think they're a pair of federal agents it all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes especially the one where <UNK> and <UNK> are in a fancy french restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves and the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well br br the opening title music sung by gene roman sounds like a fair bobby <UNK> like early 70s pop song while the music <UNK> <UNK> throughout the movie are pretty good not sure if i'd want to buy the cd soundtrack of it but some others might br br the film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldn't have dragged on for so long it looks like a lot of scenery is being <UNK> up here in fact i lost interest in it about 2 <UNK> of the way through the dvd is also terrible with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great <UNK> heap in the sky br br a big step down from the previous film br br 4 out of 10
<START> i found this very touching as spike and <UNK> stay together all the way through this film not to say there isn't a few <UNK> along the way i thought the chase was put aside the relationship between the two was <UNK> i think i had already guessed that there were so gay intentions on the part of <UNK> my favourite scene had to be the bit where <UNK> and spike were stuck in the <UNK> and spike runs off i generally thought spike wasn't coming back i have to say that if it wasn't for our film studies teacher making us watch this i would have probably never seen it overall i thought this film was pretty good and i would recommend it to any person who is a fan of british made films
<START> this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value it gets quite hysterically funny at times but if you haven't spent any time on <UNK> side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it <UNK> br br the cast of characters <UNK> well together and are quite believable in their roles how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played she's a true lady and my favorite is <UNK> white <UNK> suit that she wears br br i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different
<START> there is no question as to who is in command of the training of <UNK> in this film major chick davis pat o'brien o'brien plays an officer who <UNK> to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his <UNK> the <UNK> but he is not so rigid as to be unfair or <UNK> in fact he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military he's tough when he has to be yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and <UNK> roles he <UNK> in other films his character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves o'brien seems natural in the role and plays it in fine fashion two things help this movie <UNK> performance and the spectacular special effects ending
<START> this movie documents the harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties much more fun than than <UNK> <UNK> though just as <UNK> this movie is a true gem of <UNK> one cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their <UNK> the sole purpose of middle class <UNK> is to document the <UNK> of the trash and the <UNK> here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and <UNK> <UNK> the characters' <UNK> for <UNK> of all that is glamorous <UNK> even more <UNK> of the characters themselves on part of the viewer creating a phenomenon of a phenomenon effect which makes this movie a piece of art
<START> if i could say it was better than <UNK> i at least felt my money was not totally wasted br br then i saw steven <UNK> on deadly ground br br this movie should see a <UNK> though on <UNK> <UNK> if santa claus <UNK> the martians could make tom <UNK> head explode one wonders what mayhem this movie could cause br br there is a very good reason why kurt thomas never had a movie career br br the writers of this dreck should be forced to wear <UNK> every day of their lives that say bitch slap me i was a writer on <UNK>
<START> this is one of the best bond games i have ever played because br br the missions are very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that you use are really good the cars in this game are really good the driving missions are fun to do this james bond game has a good story to it the voice over actors in this game are really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really cool also the graphics in this game pretty good br br overall score out of
<START> very heart warming and uplifting movie outstanding performance by <UNK> porter curly sue i saw this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it immensely i just caught it again on the <UNK> channel and curly sue touched my heart again
<START> i enjoyed this movie a lot i thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of <UNK> was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had met <UNK> she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness the way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible i'd recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the under laying meaning of the movie and plot
<START> <UNK> about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured i'd give it a chance because it just <UNK> to get better or at least have some redeeming qualities like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie or like really intelligent or very well filmed or something needless to say that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this may contain spoilers imdb you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see <UNK> bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings all the ratings with about 7 10 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie im still a big imdb fan but seriously <UNK> this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than <UNK> like a 3
<START> some unsuspecting films carry a message that <UNK> in the hours and days after viewing such is the case for <UNK> journey el <UNK> de carol a beautifully crafted 2002 film from spain based on the novel 'a <UNK> de <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who also adapted the book as a screenplay war and its consequences are not new subject matter for films but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters especially children who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre br br carol clara <UNK> is a 12 year old spanish american <UNK> from new york who with her <UNK> ill mother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> returns to her <UNK> home in 1938 at the height of the spanish civil war a home that has been left deserted by her father don <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> since his wife's death <UNK> father robert ben temple is a fighter pilot who has sided with the <UNK> against franco and is rarely with his family <UNK> has a past she left her lover <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to marry robert and <UNK> in turn married <UNK> cold sister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> carol is an independent girl who remains <UNK> to all but her grandfather don <UNK> until she meets others her age but not of her <UNK> <UNK> juan <UNK> <UNK> and his two friends at first <UNK> carol but as events develop carol and <UNK> are <UNK> by what feels like the first <UNK> of love when <UNK> dies of her illness carol must live with <UNK> and <UNK> and their daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother's best friend and teacher <UNK> the always <UNK> <UNK> maria <UNK> to understand the <UNK> between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side through a series of incidents carol and <UNK> learn the <UNK> of becoming adults facing more <UNK> in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime the ending though sad is uplifting as <UNK> journey to maturity is complete br br the film is shot in <UNK> and <UNK> and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer <UNK> f <UNK> and enhanced by the musical score by <UNK> <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> understands the fine line <UNK> pathos from <UNK> and in <UNK> to concentrate the story on the children involved he makes an even stronger statement about the <UNK> and cruelty of war the cast is exceptional the stars clearly are young clara <UNK> and juan <UNK> <UNK> but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles this is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date grady <UNK>
<START> my father dr gordon warner <UNK> major us marine <UNK> was in <UNK> and lost his leg to the japanese and also received the navy cross i was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical <UNK> of this film and i am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then as i read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real life my father is a fanatic of facts and figures and always wanted things to be seen as they were so i would like to believe he had something to do with that br br he currently lives in <UNK> japan married to my mother for over 40 years ironically she's japanese and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest <UNK> from the emperor of japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back <UNK> and <UNK> to japan since <UNK> banned them after wwii br br my father was once a marine but i know that once you are a marine you're always a marine and that is exactly what he is and i love and respect him very much br br i would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have a copy of it and i'd love to give it to my father for his <UNK> birthday this year
<START> i had some expectation for the movie since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif well i was <UNK> to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for <UNK> franchise because i hated <UNK> 2 but if <UNK> 2 is compared to tashan i would say <UNK> 2 is very realistic br br when i saw the credits at the beginning i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way well the very first scene itself <UNK> ed me off then the major <UNK> of the movie is the action sequences me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights it was like akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns <UNK> you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are br br the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story it reminded me of some of the early 80's movies br br well the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena who looked really hot in this one and for that i give a rating of 2 out of 10 br br guys please please don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie well you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes br br thats all
<START> finally i thought someone is going to do justice to h g <UNK> classic not another version set in the wrong locale or era but one based firmly on the book well it definitely follows the book pretty closely and that is the only plus to this mess br br this is <UNK> <UNK> yes 3 hours long the book is only around 150 pages br br if timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say if you can do any better i would say yes i could and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life br br i paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa do not make the same mistake as me
<START> i've seen some crappy movies in my life but this one must be among the very worst <UNK> bottom 100 material imo that is br br we follow two couples the <UNK> billy bob <UNK> as <UNK> earl and natasha richardson as <UNK> and the <UNK> patrick <UNK> as roy and <UNK> <UNK> as candy in one car on a <UNK> to reno br br apparently <UNK> isn't too happy with his sex life so he <UNK> on his wife with candy who's <UNK> trying to have a baby roy meanwhile isn't too sure if his <UNK> is ok so he's getting it checked by a doctor br br now i had read the back of the dvd but my girlfriend didn't and she <UNK> out after about 20 minutes <UNK> yeah she's gonna end up pregnant but her husband can't have any <UNK> spot on as this movie is <UNK> predictable as well as boring and annoying meaningless offensive terrible br br an example of how much this movie stinks the two couples set out in their big car towards <UNK> when they are stopped by 2 police officers as they didn't stop at a stop sign the guys know each other and finally <UNK> the two officers with a case of beer not only is this scene pointless and not important or even relevant for the movie it takes about 5 minutes it's just talk and talk and talk without ever going somewhere br br i still have to <UNK> thinking about the ending though apparently roy isn't having problems down there so he is the father of the child how many times does that happen in the movies try something new the cheated wife ultimately <UNK> her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after <UNK> br br best scene of the movie is right at the end with a couple of shots of the grand canyon why couldn't they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes br br one would expect more from this cast although <UNK> really tries but you can't really blame them writers shame on you br br 1 10
<START> <UNK> who <UNK> about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for jean de <UNK> hello this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form i would also like to remind these <UNK> that if you are going to <UNK> the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point this film is clearly made for people who don't appreciate the so called american humour which seems to me just a pile of <UNK> crap the point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more <UNK> that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off br br <UNK>
<START> classic drama action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of it's time 1954 the production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love unique <UNK> into the american <UNK> west <UNK> is very educational and entertaining this movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many <UNK> during this particular time and place were very crooked corrupt much like most developing countries today the action sequences could have been more realistic though but still this movie really covers most of the <UNK> not for an audience who wants only pure <UNK> type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy
<START> in a way corridors of time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal being seen by thousands but it fails at making them laugh br br les <UNK> has had its success because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel forget about <UNK> back to the future here comes the old france the middle age knight and its nearly <UNK> way of life full of pride funny thanks to the ancient words he uses <UNK> can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor then comes the sequel br br nobody had <UNK> the tremendous success of les <UNK> the first and it's no use being a movie expert to realize that the corridors of time has been made for money br br the general story begins after the end of les <UNK> and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time <UNK> that would have needed some second <UNK> explanation it's no use trying to get back the jewelry <UNK> has stolen don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode where do you think he found the money selling the jewelry and that's only one of many holes <UNK> tries to avoid and fails br br let's have a look at the characters <UNK> doesn't change he's just a little more boring regarding <UNK> that's another story <UNK> <UNK> decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the <UNK> role and muriel robin tries to imitate her in a way that i found so pitiful i nearly felt pain for her and <UNK> doesn't realize that a cast of <UNK> isn't enough to make a good comedy br br forget about the time travels about the digital effects concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail <UNK> to write it 10 times br br the main interest of this film is the landscapes a movie for youngsters let's say up to 13 years old
<START> when you put this dvd into your player and hit play you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc <UNK> this moment make sure you have some <UNK> or something preferably <UNK> so you can fall asleep because you're going to have a massive headache once this movie starts br br starring a bunch of big <UNK> girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit i thought i'd be in for a good time sure the opening sequence was a wee bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a scream ripoff by the way my sole chuckle was from julie <UNK> final comment in this scene but then i knew there was trouble the opening sequence had a terrible rock song during this terrible rock song i looked over the dvd chapter titles and saw things that said topless in the backyard and better than sex i knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be br br and that's the sad truth the only good thing about this movie is the attractive cast other than that it's a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an innovative concept about murder <UNK> which ends up being fake anyway so the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you don't care for any of the characters i mean when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman can you really feel any sympathy towards her when she's in fear for her life the scream influence is prevalent throughout with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes we're also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad lloyd kaufman the only other cool part of the movie about an abortion or something uh yeah this isn't a so bad it's good movie it's just bad br br someone compared this to a troma film but you know most any film that comes from full moon or its <UNK> as this film proves is horrible not horrible in a troma sense i've seen many troma films and i can honestly say they all offer something anything that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later however this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it beware
<START> i just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what others thought of it i'm left wondering if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same film this is potentially a very good story but it fails to hit the mark the script is very weak the plot has so many holes that it would make a great <UNK> net for the fishing scenes the characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that i found myself asking the question how did we get here at least a half dozen times during the movie br br there was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members this is probably related to lindsay <UNK> antics during the filming it was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job but didn't commit to their roles br br this is not a movie worth seeing go for a walk play a board game take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that's worth it
<START> an old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat he wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind is he just getting old the movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on there is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words the whole movie speaks for itself you knew what was going on and i liked it br br the other part that i liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter those were pretty but the only thing i didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear he could have tied the <UNK> a little <UNK> but other than that it was a pretty deep movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> singer and <UNK> in the early <UNK> he tried his hand on movies as well but this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all it also ended the acting career of dutch actress <UNK> van <UNK> who went on being a football wife a tv <UNK> and program maker i actually did see this in an almost empty theatre because i used to be a fan of the band of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i so regret spending money on it it looks cheap it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way some people think it's so bad it's funny i am not one of them i just found it an incredible waste of time and money
<START> this film is the <UNK> of everything that is bad about modern film unnecessary slow motion unnecessary flipping jumping <UNK> unnecessary characters unnecessary dialogue basically <UNK> is that a word well it's just been invented by i robot br br what happened to <UNK> i e the car garage the skin <UNK> the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card <UNK> at the coffee shop br br what happened to showing respect for women i e smith's character does nothing but <UNK> the doctor for the better part of the film and yet she still wants him where is the tension i'll tell you where good looks and not admiration or common ground br br what happened to a detective that <UNK> smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself complaining to other people and when they said something that <UNK> a thought he was off this is such a lame way to get the story from point b c d etc it was ok once but not several times in a row speaking of several times in a row what was the i'm <UNK> and not listening to you joke twice in one scene br br what happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes <UNK> <UNK> the kid is in the movie for a total of two scenes we know that a he <UNK> women and b he knows smith so of course we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm br br what happened to hero's let's just forget that there are people women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and <UNK> save the only person <UNK> my view that i have an <UNK> with and why did he have to <UNK> his bike through the air showing off while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot br br don't get me wrong i'm all for spectacle but i'm also all for a shred of realism and meaning br br i have to say i've never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time so thanks alex br br i pray for the swing of the social <UNK> back to simpler techniques simpler stories and simpler everything else in films but mainly simpler techniques br br big budget action films you so have to die
<START> not since <UNK> have i considered turning off the movie half way through but then with this one i was only 15 minutes in when i considered unfortunately i did make it all the way through make sure that you do not br br it's not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual it's that it's not any of those things yet it so desperately wants to be all of them instead it's boring trite ordinary predictable and <UNK> poorly executed shot on video high school special effects no sense of even basic visual storytelling dialog barely <UNK> not that it's worth hearing though br br this movie is proof for the argument that even the straight to video <UNK> need to draw a line in the sand somewhere
<START> without a doubt one of the worst movies i've seen in recent years the story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with it's tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions oh no the cops are on to us they know who we are what do we do let's rob one more bank then we're outta here what every character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who's gonna end up dead
<START> the charm of otto <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> film noir is that it has ambiguous intentions <UNK> the gloomy essence of the central character who is still <UNK> by living in the shadow of his criminal father dana <UNK> driven <UNK> cop is shown as an <UNK> irrational and destructive who maybe can change because he <UNK> found a good woman to look after him the troubled man <UNK> himself with his own <UNK> impression of <UNK> the <UNK> mood <UNK> <UNK> into the latter half of the story by screenwriter ben <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> tense performance as preminger <UNK> the film in a <UNK> <UNK> substance of style we don't just see and hear the city at night we feel it because preminger lets us see and hear even the most <UNK> and distant factors of it br br dana andrews <UNK> a complex character <UNK> through his <UNK> of violence and the hatred that always <UNK> him as the plot develops he is secretly <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> yet he is <UNK> by the <UNK> acts that can be seen in the vintage noir <UNK> visceral facial expressions before he <UNK> them br br this reflection of a specific phase in the development of the genre is an engrossing <UNK> and shady film noir that is set in the double dealing climate of the underworld where the hero is so estranged that he is always <UNK> with rage and even though he loses his rational resistance <UNK> principle and <UNK> limits he's still a good cop preminger just <UNK> at telling a social conscience drama about a <UNK> community within the <UNK> <UNK> rather keeping the thriller riding on <UNK> shoulders as an existential journey of personal <UNK> about a man with an <UNK> <UNK> who is becoming <UNK> though with the ever <UNK> influences of the law on his side and an <UNK> perception of right and wrong br br the production companies in the early 1950s <UNK> out on the social problem picture and rather made low budget low risk thrillers such as this apparently in an attempt to <UNK> the <UNK> of conservative critics and social <UNK> but there is an <UNK> matter of <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> approach he <UNK> each scene with a sense of everyday drama as a backdrop for the plot each supporting character must pull their own weight by doing something interesting but none of them are cartoons or depressing comic <UNK> to him every character thinks they're the star as per the straight from the shoulder self <UNK> of karl malden as a <UNK> police inspector and a veteran waitress at a lunch counter it is those who are the stars andrews and gene tierney both <UNK> by their <UNK> attempts to <UNK> their emotional intensity who don't want to be
<START> this is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a stephen king story two <UNK> <UNK> one seasoned <UNK> <UNK> and one not so accomplished julie <UNK> begin to believe that a serial killer michael h moss may actually be a vampire stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally but by way of a black <UNK> he seeks his victims the gore actually gets gruesome as the film <UNK> its stupid finale keep in mind that mr king had nothing to do with this film i do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night
<START> i saw this movie on comedy central a few times this movie was pretty good it's an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis who is arranged to marry the king of <UNK> so that the u s can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east some good jokes including <UNK> i also just loved the ending theme it gave me great political spirit ten out of ten was my rating for this movie
<START> this is the most <UNK> sort of traditional ghost story not even <UNK> to any great extent by the use of irish locations if the great m r james had ever come up with a tale this thin doesn't james in fact have a story called a thin ghost he wouldn't have bothered to have it published br br orson welles appears in the limp <UNK> as a favour to a <UNK> of old friends this film's producers his presence and the one movie industry in joke would have earned this will <UNK> the <UNK> its oscar nomination this is yet more proof if any more were needed that the academy awards have never been any guarantee of merit
<START> where would one start a review of the film <UNK> james <UNK> god rest his soul made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since <UNK> man his beautiful story <UNK> around a drug squad cop <UNK> which is a name <UNK> with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor said cop <UNK> deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking and discovers a gang war to rival that of police academy 1 and i mean the one where jones is <UNK> <UNK> by his new partner but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hear br br <UNK> grasp of effects both visual and <UNK> is <UNK> the slight pause between action on screen and from the <UNK> adds to the drama that is <UNK> a real gritty like underground thriller also kudos to his brilliant use of makeup such as the <UNK> convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i feel the world of film is much less from <UNK> passing his memory will <UNK> on and on and on <UNK> with every passing mention of his <UNK> production <UNK> his insightful director's commentary released a coke hit up the nose of any <UNK> film goer truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets captured in all the beauty of a <UNK> punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a <UNK> br br but i ask you why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap i'll tell you why because thats life in santa <UNK> baby its not all drive <UNK> and <UNK> constructed <UNK> <UNK> oh no there are some folk who must <UNK> the soft <UNK> <UNK> of street life in la to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a school for special children's production of double dragon the play br br the only <UNK> i have with this film is that there was never a sequel made come on steven spielberg come on george lucas come on guy that made revenge of the <UNK> 1 through 23 how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man james <UNK> br br he discovered eva longoria you know oh yeah that he did br br <UNK>
<START> i watched the <UNK> version of this film and realised about 30 minutes into it that i was never getting my time back i <UNK> to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve the martial arts would look realistic eventually the special fx would actually look special i was so wrong i love horror i am a complete gore <UNK> i number some of the eighties splatter flicks amongst the <UNK> of the film world this however was not made in the eighties if this film had come out in the early eighties the <UNK> could be forgiven for looking so bad it wasn't so it hasn't got that <UNK> the dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines i was <UNK> at the writing rather than <UNK> at torture i don't like hostel never have i thought it was over rated over hyped and i felt nothing for the protagonists however it shines as a <UNK> to greatness next to this garbage the back of the cover for live feed promised a twist you would never see coming i'm still waiting for the twist that was promised
<START> i wanted to like <UNK> the plot reminded me of grand canyon which i liked 4 different lives stories that come together at the end but <UNK> took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end little did i know it would be another <UNK> 1 1 2 hours thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre i almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene my dvd player still hasn't forgiven me and i don't blame it one bit it was a unique movie but a bad boring and pointless movie
<START> i really liked this movie it was cute i enjoyed it but if you didn't that is your fault emma roberts played a good nancy drew even though she isn't quite like the books the old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times but she looks good on them to me the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich i mean it looks like they got all the clothes <UNK> at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together all of the outfits were tacky especially when they wore the penny <UNK> with their regular outfits i do not want to make the movie look bad because it definitely wasn't just go to the theater and watch it you will enjoy it
<START> in spite of sterling work by the supporting actors and an intelligent script by alan <UNK> this film suffers from a fatal flaw the lack of charm of the central character actor one of the characters describes richard e <UNK> character as a whining little turd and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly there is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and upper class <UNK> friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him he is rude arrogant selfish self destructive and thoroughly annoying the part called for an actor who can make you love him even when he is being a <UNK> a ewan <UNK> for example br br all of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted thanks to this irritating and thoroughly unlikeable performance all i wanted to do was shake him and tell him to get over himself
<START> superman ii the richard <UNK> cut should be a <UNK> dream come true at long last footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the <UNK> page would finally come to life a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored it seems like a winning situation and then you start watching this <UNK> of footage and you realize this <UNK> dream is a very real nightmare of <UNK> and incompetence while it's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project and it is only a very few times br br you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home <UNK> computer graphics but then we start seeing new footage <UNK> from superman the movie for the trial and that first bit of <UNK> fades away hey this is pretty neat things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from <UNK> <UNK> with new effects for this project and it doesn't convince at all and from this point on it never ever lets up it's probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was you'll believe a man can fly it's difficult to believe anything shown on screen here the best effects in this are from the original productions br br another issue with this re cut a lot of it just doesn't make sense the only reason any of it really works is because we've all seen the theatrical version of superman ii a movie that does make sense <UNK> superman ii fills in the holes of this <UNK> part of this could be because <UNK> didn't get to complete shooting the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible what we end up with is an <UNK> of footage that makes superman iv look <UNK> and coherent br br after viewing this one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using <UNK> material michael <UNK> and his team were extremely <UNK> towards anything filmed by lester the best scenes in the <UNK> cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence not ironically both were filmed by <UNK> but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re edited in such a <UNK> fashion that it now makes lester seem like a ham <UNK> know nothing while lester <UNK> the <UNK> material lester here is thrown under the bus br br so is there anything good in this release well marlon brando is in it and that's neat to see in fact watching any of the material shot by <UNK> is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman the movie but that only highlights the problems of this release any of the major scenes really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section instead they are shoe <UNK> into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions br br watch the opening scene at the daily planet why are we looking at jackie <UNK> back as he calls for lois and clark at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on i was initially confused by this because i expected to see lois the entire <UNK> is filled with questionable choices like this br br battle scenes are a mess too with no <UNK> between cuts it's just random action of course the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> they should have used more of <UNK> footage but probably had too much pride to admit that br br the <UNK> <UNK> to the military missile as well as noted elsewhere the missile shown in the <UNK> cut bears the <UNK> <UNK> 10 while we all know it's the <UNK> 101 a blind man in <UNK> knows that the producers of this <UNK> who tried so hard to honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is <UNK> of the quality of the entire production for all the supposed care that was put into this the final product has an air of <UNK> to it that is <UNK> br br the entire affair would probably be easier to <UNK> if <UNK> didn't make this a separate release here in the states as it is we're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a play all option it's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but after that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent <UNK> for dust and little else i know after my experience of watching this i had new respect for <UNK> version it's by no means perfect but lester realized the <UNK> that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so while this new re cut will most likely only be remembered as a <UNK> in that films history
<START> this was incredible meaning that it was hard to believe that the forgotten tribe would make this astounding <UNK> twice a year and that the filmmakers cooper and <UNK> didn't stage some of the scenes and shots but what shots they are the cinematography under mostly extreme conditions is brilliant and the score of iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added <UNK> br br i had the pleasure of seeing this and <UNK> <UNK> on the same weekend which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science
<START> by some happy coincidence the same year that jimmy stewart and kim novak made alfred hitchcock's haunting masterpiece vertigo they also made this light comedy perhaps the two actors needed to do it after <UNK> the <UNK> of the hitchcock film at any rate this a great companion piece to vertigo as it again explores a very un likely but powerful romance in fact the film can be seen as the flip side of vertigo with it's happy ending here again novak <UNK> a transformation in vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she <UNK> from witch to mortal stewart is again <UNK> and for awhile tormented by his love for her unlike vertigo the two come together in bell book and candle a perfect <UNK> for the <UNK> movie again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein the cast is terrific lemmon hilarious as <UNK> <UNK> brother and elsa <UNK> giving a classic performance as the aunt ernie <UNK> as the alcoholic cult writer and of course <UNK> <UNK> playing <UNK> <UNK> are all great the scene with stewart drinking the <UNK> is comedy at it's best anyone who has seen vertigo or even if you haven't should see this memorable light comedy
<START> i saw this movie a long time ago luckily it was for free i have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater i don't remember a whole bunch of it but i do remember i was incredibly bored the plot made no sense and when i came out of the theater the only thing i could say was at least now i know what the worst movie i ever saw was i just was incredibly bothered by one thing if they can make the <UNK> as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive why can't they turn it down to a comfortable <UNK> instead of being all hot and <UNK> how stupid do they think we are
<START> imagine the plight of richard a painter whose real passion is flying when we first meet him he is seen <UNK> a building in london wearing his home made wings he has ripped his <UNK> and other works at the height of his despair and fashions a flying device for his jump when he falls into the protective police <UNK> he doesn't suffer a scratch but it lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service richard whose relationship with anne apparently ended badly decides to <UNK> to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large <UNK> he plans to use to <UNK> his own plane br br richard ends up trying to help jane <UNK> reluctantly she is a young woman suffering from a l s or lou <UNK> disease and is confined to a <UNK> wheel chair jane is extremely intelligent but has a dark side and a <UNK> <UNK> she uses a hand held device to speak sometimes as her speech is not clear what jane loves to do is to lose her virginity at any cost jane and richard clash as they meet but a mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with one another br br jane who watches porn on her computer has a notion for finding someone like richard gere in american <UNK> who will for a <UNK> have sex with her when richard takes her to london they find the right man for the job his <UNK> is <UNK> but they agree since they have no money richard decides to rob a big bank unfortunately things don't go according to plan when jane realizes that she can't go through with what she had wanted at the end richard takes jane for a ride in his <UNK> built plane for the thrill of her life something that brings them closer as they find an <UNK> with one another br br peter <UNK> directed this quirky film which presents an unusual situation jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in mainstream films and yet she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and what she is trying to accomplish mr <UNK> shows an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> material he wrote for the film the movie doesn't try to be cute or give a <UNK> picture of a young woman <UNK> with an <UNK> disease br br helena bonham carter is the main reason for watching the film she makes a wonderful jane on the other hand kenneth branagh doesn't seem too well suited for this type of comedy somehow he has problems of his own in the way he <UNK> richard <UNK> jones has some good moments as anne <UNK> former love br br the theory of flight shows a good director no doubt peter <UNK> will go to bigger and better things
<START> with the runaway success of god's army every mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now in the case of the recent the other side of heaven this wasn't at all a bad thing that film while not great was quite good the <UNK> ward however is not br br telling the story of a young divorced mormon guy thrust back into single life the writing and shooting style of the <UNK> ward is in many ways very similar to the 80s comedy <UNK> <UNK> day off however the similarities end there while <UNK> <UNK> was funny original and well acted as far as stupid comedies like this ever are the <UNK> ward is completely the opposite it tries very hard to be funny however 90 of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you've probably heard a million times before the other 10 seem to be thrown in to fill out the time and the acting while not awful is <UNK> at best br br in addition if you're not either a mormon yourself or very very familiar with mormon culture you won't get hardly anything at all whereas god's army and the other side of heaven were appealing to a broad range of viewers both inside and outside of the mormon church this film is most definitely one big inside joke and even if you get it it's just not that funny
<START> this is a great movie for all generation <UNK> what a different world the america of 1972 was compared to our psychotic 21st century you can get a sense of what an 1972 america gone by was like by watching this movie i found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now just think back then there were only 4 or 5 tv stations to choose from there was no aids muslim terrorists road rage <UNK> bird <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc etc the vietnam war was just over there will still be 7 years before star wars comes out the personal computer and internet would still be <UNK> years away br br when this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it so it began <UNK> small <UNK> <UNK> around the country being shown on movie <UNK> this was the days before <UNK> of course the <UNK> of a church who would would be interested in showing a thief in the night to his <UNK> would obtain a copy of the film then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room members of the <UNK> would invite <UNK> friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week br br if you can get past the limited production values of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value then i think you will enjoy the film more of course i am speaking as a gen <UNK> br br if i had a time machine i would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century <UNK> we have now
<START> how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and life <UNK> it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were hoping maybe even <UNK> it wouldn't br br <UNK> this is the film's greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on you br br i saw this in a film theory class at <UNK> back in the mid <UNK> it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for
<START> note to all directors long is not necessarily good this movie is incredibly long however not good the scenes were drawn out way way way way way too long the sex scenes were unnecessary and often too long the movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional but alas it became so <UNK> long that i can only give it a 2 of 10 it is way below average br br some other problems also exist in this marathon br br 1 ralph <UNK> plays a whole family tree the guy who played the great grandfather looks nothing like him but the grandfather father and the son who gives us constant <UNK> voice over are all ralph <UNK> with different facial hair and the same basic bull headed personality no one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last even though photos of them are being <UNK> at every turn this one is minor but if the movie hadn't been 3 weeks long it wouldn't have been so annoying br br 2 the fact that no news from germany was even <UNK> for the longest time about jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed the uncle in france would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave br br 3 the love stories in this movie are totally wrong you are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short suddenly people are in love and almost instantly married then having children then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships this again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie but with time spent nothing was given to us br br 4 the ending was just bad i don't want to spoil it for anyone but you won't like it either unless you are sadistic br br the director writer should be tortured with having to watch this <UNK> garbage on a weekly basis i mean endless loop <UNK> they are the same thing br br i wonder if robert redford did anything for this movie i mean i think <UNK> <UNK> must be <UNK> his directing career after him long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie a short description of 'the horse <UNK> and sunshine br br sunshine perfect title if you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave
<START> for long time i haven't seen such a good fantasy movie magic fights here are even better than in lotr even considering that it's a 1987 movie and haven't computer special effects this movie have good plot good acting and interesting ideas recommend everybody to see it
<START> this <UNK> comedy drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979 i remember opening the movie section of the l a times and looking at a 2 page <UNK> for chapter two filled with glowing <UNK> like better than 'the goodbye <UNK> and neil simon does it again what does neil simon do he takes an <UNK> situation <UNK> too soon after the death of a beloved <UNK> and makes it rusty unpleasant and worst of all unfunny james <UNK> plays neil er that is george a writer who can't seem to get back into life after losing his wife enter spirited <UNK> mason real life mrs simon soon to be ex mrs simon who attempts to love george despite his <UNK> and general melancholy mason is very appealing here and <UNK> saved the day were it not for <UNK> indifference not to mention a sub plot concerning painfully thin blonde valerie <UNK> which brings the proceedings to a <UNK> halt i liked <UNK> <UNK> at the end i am wonderful i am nuts about me but i saw no happy ending for these two people and time proved me right from
<START> okay let me break it down for you guys it's horrible br br if roger <UNK> did such a fancy job on the first cruel intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this i'm sorry but this movie is stupid true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic this movie a <UNK> a lot of bad acting note the shower scene kissing cousins what kind of line is that <UNK> when wet can we say duh m this movie had effort i'll give you that but it was too stupid they even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually wasn't funny it was pathetic not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look absolutely nothing like the original cast it's as if they made them look different on purpose or something i like watching it when i'm really really really board which doesn't happen occasionally for those of you who did like it okay what were you thinking could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous sarah michelle <UNK> a movie is gold if it has sarah michelle <UNK> in it duh but this movie doesn't no offense amy adams oh yeah since when does <UNK> have a heart ugh
<START> spoilers within br br it appears that von <UNK> was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film <UNK> <UNK> 1995 br br the direction seemed carefully controlled and visually i felt it was highly appealing especially where the visual narrative was concerned the title sequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern times <UNK> the deaths of various characters in the past br br to <UNK> two points that many people have been confused by br br firstly lena did not sleep with <UNK> although this may have seemed implied it was not the intent von <UNK> told me so herself and she is a very nice lady by the way br br secondly the time frame of events was in fact historically accurate the actual dates are shown on the close up of the <UNK> and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film there is evidence showing that <UNK> was annoyed about having done this and had planned to eventually <UNK> those he had set free br br overall what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much <UNK> <UNK> era it seems a shame that it has taken such a long time for various reasons for this film to hit our screens br br more of the same please <UNK>
<START> i was hooked from beginning to end great horror comes from disturbing imagery and <UNK> shocks that are created not to make you jump but to make you go what the f <UNK> did i just see all the other <UNK> gave short <UNK> of what the film is about so i won't rehash what has already been said i was telling other people about this movie days after i had seen it just because it still haunted me i even had a bad dream after seeing it and i am a true horror fan not easily <UNK> by tripe like the grudge or even silent hill what gave me the bad dreams was the <UNK> i felt about what i would do if i were in that cell with those guys what would my personal horror be my <UNK> took me there and it was not pleasant that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you the best part of this movie is that it is subtle it's not about <UNK> that jump out at you alien <UNK> or tons of gore it's the opposite the horror you create in your own mind the irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an <UNK> force that <UNK> it's power over them simply the men ask for the one thing they desire and they get it but not in the way they imagined so on the one hand they get what they wish for from an occult book but may ultimately wish they hadn't sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be
<START> i saw this film at a store in the cheap section i actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago i thought what the <UNK> and bought it basically because the plot sounded interesting and claire danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes this was also before i became a huge kate beckinsale fan br br so it's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in <UNK> get <UNK> for <UNK> which they are innocent of and then are sent to a thailand prison the film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence br br both claire danes and kate beckinsale give great performances and the plot of this film <UNK> itself up <UNK> and raises some nice moral discussion questions br br i think this is a solid good film but there could have been some <UNK> it could have been longer it would've helped to <UNK> these characters and more insight into the politics of <UNK> justice system would've helped br br nevertheless other than that it's a good film with some great performances br br p s for all you pop culture <UNK> be on the <UNK> for a two minute role by paul walker i didn't even notice him the first time i saw the film
<START> dark remains is a low budget american horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 awards br br the plot seems to involve 2 separate <UNK> first a woman commits suicide by <UNK> her <UNK> whilst bathing second the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat <UNK> the <UNK> couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains it later <UNK> that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted br br as the movie goes on the 2 separate <UNK> of story eventually <UNK> as one might reasonably expect however the execution is <UNK> and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings unfortunately the movie is simply not <UNK> enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once br br just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong and fast and the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found here br br i believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor br br the characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site the badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue without creating opportunities for character driven situations and without adding depth to any of them br br the direction is uninspired the inspiration from j horror movies such as <UNK> the grudge and one missed call is evident unfortunately the directors of dark remains did not pay close attention to the style of j horror j horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation a ghost on a <UNK> camera walking towards it for example and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning there is no humour or tongue in cheek element in these movies everything is played so straight and without <UNK> or limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it the foreboding <UNK> set up the suspense and <UNK> the horror has psychological impact very much unlike the jump scares used in hollywood movies br br the directors of dark remains made a brave attempt to avoid hollywood clichés and also successfully avoided using cgi the homage to j horror could have been well intended unfortunately the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed scares on the screen the make up effects of the ghosts weren't too bad given the low budget but their actions just <UNK> logic i was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie br br i couldn't give away the ending even if i wanted to i simply couldn't understand it all i could <UNK> was that it was something of an anti climax br br what remains the answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom the movie is a chore to sit through thankfully the pain ends after an hour and a half however most would probably switch off long before the end br br there are only 2 positive things i could find in this movie the successful <UNK> of scare clichés and the absence of the f word in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find this is what the 2 stars are for br br those who like supernatural or psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as the legend of hell house the <UNK> or the j horror sub genre br br if you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra low budget r rated horror movie about ghosts watch death of a ghost hunter it may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it is surely a lot better than dark remains and does have a few genuine surprises in store br br i advise everyone to avoid dark remains like the plague
<START> this is probably one of brian de palma's best known movies but it isn't his best body double the fury and carrie are better movies but this movie is better than blow out and obsession de palma is very influenced by hitchcock and this movie is a take off on psycho angie dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair and after her psychiatrist played by michael caine turns down an offer dickinson meets a man in a art gallery and she winds up sleeping with him after this point it's best you don't know what happens but there is a murder and nancy allen is a call girl who gets a look at the killer dennis <UNK> is the detective on the case who really doesn't trust allen and she has to find the killer herself it's a pretty good movie but isn't one of de palma's best
<START> lost is one of a kind its so enchanting and full of suspense thrill and emotions all at the same time i have never seen any tv series like this before it is full of jungle thrills and has a good screenplay the actors have <UNK> life on an island in such a natural way that i feel lost in the island myself while watching it it is an excellent piece of work narrated in a very intelligent form the series is like a movie depicting the life of the survivors lost on a deserted island i am tempted to watch one episode after the other and i highly recommend this series for all the tv show lovers watch it to see the magic of being lost in nowhere
<START> i thought king <UNK> mines was beautifully done my only <UNK> was alison <UNK> her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors i thought patrick <UNK> was an excellent choice for alan <UNK> it was nice seeing a seasoned rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired fair skinned actors like val kilmer brad pitt etc he was an excellent choice and i enjoyed every minute of this movie this version cannot be compared with the 1950's version with stewart <UNK> it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie i thought both <UNK> were believable but the two <UNK> have to be kept separated i am looking forward to seeing this once more and i hope patrick <UNK> will again look to these type of roles
<START> never viewed this film and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors in the period that this film was made people in america were different there was no tv or all the modern things we have today except the radio and the starting out of great films being made in hollywood sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today ann shirley murder my sweet <UNK> played a young orphan gal who was called <UNK> top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks who were like two wise <UNK> and watched over ann shirley it was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened the entire town found out about it within minutes it is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living today it seems very corn ball and stupid but believe me this was the way people were in america during the <UNK> 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family films
<START> this was one of those films that got a ton of play on the <UNK> in the early 1970's usually on the <UNK> movie or one time on the 7 30 <UNK> channel 6 big movie and still another on creature double feature when local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming mostly gone today in favor of <UNK> time it was of the time a couple of low rent <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> frankie ray and robert ball are in a platoon of soldiers half a dozen guys in army <UNK> <UNK> who are sent on field <UNK> to look into some strange radiation and wind up <UNK> <UNK> they first go into bronson canyon to what would be later the famous <UNK> on batman and encounter the remains of a dead <UNK> monster later in the cave they're chased by a living <UNK> creature basically a guy in black suit and paper <UNK> head with <UNK> things on it and <UNK> <UNK> ball eyes two of them complete <UNK> ray and ball are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being examined by space <UNK> dr <UNK> <UNK> kidding and professor <UNK> who are stunningly beautiful and even <UNK> in their skimpy bikini uniforms we were too young at the time to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this examination scene would more than suggest turns out that the two <UNK> and their <UNK> monster are stranded on earth with a ship that's well hidden and are trying to return to their world br br the film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when eric von <UNK> and his crew from frankie and <UNK> films were the height of b film drive in comedy so it only seemed a natural to jump on the <UNK> for some quick bucks br br for some reason i only thought i'd imagined seeing this film to start with no i really saw it and when it was released on restored dvd i was assured in my memory the comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid but whatever the budget is non existent which is a minor miracle when you think about it that it even got made and we can talk about a restored version here and now over 40 years later the payoff is the girls who want to learn about love and kissing and the <UNK> is the <UNK> which all of us were get the girls and love wins out it's just goofy and silly and for the locations has nostalgic significance
<START> this film sat on my <UNK> for weeks before i watched it i <UNK> a self indulgent <UNK> flick about relationships gone bad i was wrong this was an engrossing <UNK> into the screwed up <UNK> of new <UNK> br br the format is the same as max <UNK> la <UNK> based on a play by arthur <UNK> who is given an inspired by credit it starts from one person a prostitute standing on a street corner in brooklyn she is picked up by a home <UNK> who has sex with her on the hood of a car but can't come he refuses to pay her when he's off <UNK> she answers his cell phone and takes a message she runs away with his keys br br then the story switches to the <UNK> who pays a professional call on a rich bored new york woman who plays with him until he is <UNK> then she pulls away she tells him how desperate and unhappy she is he tells her how beautiful she is and lucky as he is leaving she asks if he would have sex with her she sits on top of him <UNK> up and down this time he comes the he leaves br br the woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their trendy friends <UNK> robert is talking business wife ellen is bored and switches the subject to sex and how often men and women think about it husband switches conversation to desert later after the guests leave ellen tries to <UNK> robert into sex robert wants none of it and puts on a jazz record ellen turns on the radio robert turns up the music ellen turns on the tv robert turns on another tv <UNK> ensues ellen goes up on the roof robert joins her ellen <UNK> that she needs to experience more men men other than robert robert says that he too needs to experience men br br we next follow robert as he visits an artist martin played by steve <UNK> i wish <UNK> could have more roles like this where he is a sexy smart totally <UNK> guy robert <UNK> <UNK> work much more than it deserves promises to get it into a show martin is excited until it turns out that robert is speaking out of his <UNK> it is all a <UNK> dance robert tries to kiss martin on the lips and martin pulls back saying that he is not gay robert <UNK> that he's not gay either martin <UNK> both admit that the <UNK> are bad robert is about to leave when martin allows robert to kiss him they make out and robert goes down on martin br br next we follow martin as he <UNK> for an art show at a manhattan gallery he is smitten by the <UNK> anna played by rosario dawson i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1000 words and they make love to each other br br we next follow anna who is sitting at a lunch stand her boyfriend nick adrian <UNK> enters bearing flowers she is cold toward him he tries to figure out why he <UNK> out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in san francisco she <UNK> out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex <UNK> while in san francisco and had sex with her the latter revelation turns out to be a lie the two of them make out in the <UNK> but she decides that they must break up nick is <UNK> br br and we follow nick who <UNK> his troubles to an older woman who he meets on a park <UNK> joey carol kane joey is sort of weird and child like but is a good audience for nick who needs a sympathetic ear the two of them go to <UNK> island at night and look at the stars nick falls under <UNK> spell despite the age difference between them they go back to <UNK> apartment and nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman she is on top of him doesn't want to let him go but he manages to escape br br this is by the way the best carol kane role since she played <UNK> wife in taxi <UNK> phone rings and it is a man calling the psychic friends network and joey is one of the psychic friends although she is still hurting from nick she gradually gets into her psychic <UNK> the man is at his office late at night and wants to have phone sex with her although that is not <UNK> business joey goes along and <UNK> the man to come she wants to keep talking although the man want to get off the phone and finds out that he has <UNK> a lot of money from his company and will be found out tomorrow his life is ruined joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend that she cares about him and she does care about him br br but the man packs a gun into his <UNK> and goes off to seek a prostitute on the brooklyn <UNK> and we come back to the beginning to the same prostitute who started out la <UNK> she wants to give him 75 000 in cash if she will kill him he tried to kill himself but couldn't do it the prostitute does not want to do it but he insists holding her hand holding the gun inside his mouth telling her where to aim eventually the gun goes off and we see the prostitute walking down the street and arriving at the corner where she normally does business the <UNK> who didn't pay her earlier in the movie drives up rolls down the window they look at each other the end
<START> i don't know what would be so great about this movie even worse why should anyone bother seeing this one first of all there is no story one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it <UNK> some sort of strong feeling laughter cry fear but in my opinion this movie does not do that either br br you are just watching images for 2 <UNK> there are more useful things to do br br i guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above but is this worth 2 <UNK> of your valuable time and 7 <UNK> of your money for me the answer is no
<START> i must say that i really had no idea that i was going to sit down and watch this movie i guess it was the fact that i had nothing better to do between class but for once a tv movie caught my interest more importantly helen hunt caught my eye i really wasn't a big fan of hers prior to this film sure i liked <UNK> and as good as it gets but something about this movie really did it for me i would now see myself as a huge fan this movie comes with high marks from me give it a chance it won't let you down
<START> the film begins with a bunch of kids in <UNK> school and focuses on a kid named <UNK> who has apparently worked hard to earn his <UNK> <UNK> and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon <UNK> meets up with the dead end kids the kids in this film are little <UNK> but they are much less <UNK> than they'd been in other previous films and down deep they are well meaning <UNK> however in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are <UNK> insurance fraud through <UNK> and see <UNK> as a convenient <UNK> after all he'd been to <UNK> school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed so when <UNK> is about ready to be sent back to the big house it's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks br br the dead end kids appeared in several warner brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good particularly angels with dirty faces however after the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they went on to <UNK> studios and the films to put it <UNK> were very weak and formulaic with <UNK> hall and leo <UNK> being pretty much the whole show and the group being <UNK> the <UNK> boys because angels wash their faces had the excellent writing and production values and hall and <UNK> were not constantly <UNK> for the camera it's a pretty good film and almost earns a score of 7 it's real close in fact while this isn't a great film <UNK> it's sure a lot of fun to watch so i will give it a 7 sure it was a tad hokey particularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and reagan ignores the bill of rights but it was also quite entertaining the dead end kids are doing their best performances and ronald reagan and ann sheridan provided excellent support sure this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charming so if you can suspend disbelief it works well
<START> a recent viewing of that's entertainment has given me the urge to watch many of the classic mgm musicals from the forties and fifties anchors aweigh is certainly a lesser film than on the town the songs aren't as good nor is the chemistry between the characters but the film beautifully <UNK> classical favorites such as <UNK> and the scene at the hollywood bowl with sinatra and kelly <UNK> from the woods above it at the top and then running down the steps while dozens of <UNK> play on the piano is the best scene in the film even though the scene in which kelly dances with jerry mouse is more famous classical music <UNK> will no doubt identify the music the <UNK> are playing sinatra then <UNK> i fall in love too easily before having his <UNK> about whom he loves the color is beautiful hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and <UNK> free air can you imagine hollywood in the <UNK> let alone the mid 1940s and the piano music is absolutely glorious mgm certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these
<START> this movie is nothing short of a dark gritty masterpiece i may be bias as the apartheid era is an area i've always felt for but i'd say it ranks right up with cry freedom and cry the beloved country sadly up until a few days ago i'd never even heard of this movie inside is one of the most underrated films of all time probably because it was a small film company i'd never even heard of it before eric <UNK> one of my favorite actors anyway is believable and dramatic <UNK> <UNK> plays his <UNK> role well do not look for humor in this film there is none it is real savage and gritty to the last and to the sensitive i'd say bring a box of <UNK> but movies as great as this make you wonder why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of
<START> dvd has become the equivalent of the old late night double bill circuit the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like the border there were great expectations for this back in 1982  a script co written by the wild <UNK> <UNK> green jack nicholson in the days when he could still act without <UNK> and a great supporting cast harvey keitel warren <UNK> valerie <UNK> tony richardson directing although he was pretty much a spent force by then  but now it doesn't even turn up on tv the material certainly offers a rich <UNK> of possibilities for comment on the 80s american dreams of capitalism and <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> border <UNK> turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people <UNK> to <UNK> his wife's relentless <UNK> until he <UNK> his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business unfortunately he never really gets his hands dirty barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface the film feels always watered down as if too many <UNK> and too many <UNK> have left it <UNK> and sadly the recent dvd release is a missed opportunity to <UNK> the original <UNK> ending where nicholson goes over the edge and <UNK> the border <UNK> station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured <UNK> in the film's trailers br br while that probably wasn't too convincing considering how low key <UNK> crisis of conscience is in the film it had to be better than the crude <UNK> climax where the film <UNK> logic and even basic rules of continuity at one point he's holding characters at <UNK> then he's somewhere else and they're free trying to kill him one character goes from injured at his house to <UNK> around like a <UNK> on the banks of the <UNK> <UNK> while valerie <UNK> character gets dumber on an <UNK> level the villains of the piece are <UNK> of with absurd ease and one impressive car stunt in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely what makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and <UNK> that the sudden <UNK> into melodrama is all the more jarring unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> beautiful title song across the borderline says it all much more <UNK> but if you want to know the film's real crime it's completely wasting the great warren <UNK> in a nothing bit part when even he can't make an impression you know <UNK> really wrong all in all all too easy to remember why i found this so forgettable at the time
<START> recently a friend and i were discussing educational and <UNK> influences when we were growing up in the 1950's versus today she mentioned samuel taylor <UNK> who in <UNK> wrote the <UNK> of the ancient <UNK> both of us had been required to <UNK> parts of the epic poem in high school and in english literature <UNK> in college my friend said its messages even might be called <UNK> within today's context br br we tried <UNK> it and only remembered bits and pieces i have problems remembering dr seuss i said i'd get two copies of the poem so each could read it that was easy enough but i was extremely surprised to find it had been made into a film we looked forward to watching the film to see how it had been interpreted after all the <UNK> of the ancient <UNK> isn't exactly light reading after each had read the poem we watched the film together br br we considered the film a remarkable achievement especially considering it was made in the 1970's before computers before the so called ken burns effect and before special effects too often began <UNK> for a lack of substance particularly noteworthy are the 19th and 20th century <UNK> <UNK> from lesser known artists such as willy <UNK> the early hollywood designer br br the film is narrated by sir michael redgrave whom had taught the poem when he was a <UNK> adding a tone of authority and credibility in remaining true to the poem br br its <UNK> is in the layers of subtle messages conveyed without <UNK> or becoming an oppressive and obvious morality tale we found it such a refreshing change from today's <UNK> your <UNK> and <UNK> them over the <UNK> mentality most of today's morality messages in film are two dimensional extreme violence murder and mayhem mark the bad the bad are really really bad and good are super heroes it is as if human character lacked any nuance the <UNK> of the ancient <UNK> is a celebration of the individual of character of an appreciation for celebrating all the <UNK> life has to offer within the larger context of humanity i e man's capacity to give to others br br proud of ourselves for having found this unknown gem we then learned it had won the top award in its category five out of six times at name international film festivals another surprise was learning the film's director <UNK> <UNK> is a recognized authority on early animation and <UNK> six award winning books about film br br this film's message is just as relevant today if not more so than when <UNK> penned the original epic poem and when <UNK> <UNK> translated it to film if i still was teaching high school which i did for five years i'd grab this one and show it to all my students there's a level of <UNK> here that naturally leads to discussion about the big and important issues all of us face whether in <UNK> 1978 or today in fact as long as humanity has a spiritual <UNK> br br highly recommended
<START> the story would never win awards but that's not what it's about the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes who needs a story with fighting like that really it's worth watching for that reason alone if you can handle the gore of which there is a lot none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at i gave it a 7
<START> it is a pleasure to see such creativity on tv again this show is poetic artistic and good fun the characters relate well and the writing is not bad i think it will improve as they get their legs definitely worth a look br br the girls steal the show so far in this series chuck is adorable as is <UNK> the two aunts are a delight i sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magic br br well that's all the news that is fit to print go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way this is like dr seuss for adults
<START> very slow paced but <UNK> structured and ultimately very touching a nice very true to life look at a small florida beach town in the dead of winter i've been there and this is absolutely accurate br br it's also the debut feature of actress ashley judd and she makes a big impression here it's hard to believe this film is 12 years old i remember seeing it in theaters and i recently rented ruby again except for the 80's looking clothes it has held up very nicely <UNK> is so <UNK> and touching here that it's hard to think of her subsequent career without <UNK> boy talk about failing to fulfill your early promise anyone seeing ashley here in ruby in paradise would assume this elegant natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting instead she has become the go to girl for dumb action films and slasher movies very disappointing but at least we have this lovely performance <UNK> to showcase her early promise br br as some other <UNK> say this is not for everyone as it's very slow paced this is not an action film nor is it really a romance the director victor <UNK> <UNK> gold another excellent character study treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail in that way i think this is one of the most moving and <UNK> coming of age stories about young women that i can recall it's not about <UNK> sexual awakening or how she lost her virginity but about her life choices and her growing maturity br br a lovely film if you take the time to watch it i think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls or boys for that matter and give them a chance to think about and discuss it br br particular kudos to director <UNK> who also wrote the script which is so realistic and nicely detailed that i assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female written novel or <UNK> but in fact it's mr <UNK> original work rated 8 out of 10
<START> paulie sounds like the most <UNK> <UNK> and sentimental garbage you could ever find yet it's actually much better than you might expect the <UNK> of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film but actually in most other <UNK> the film is charming br br in case you're wondering paulie is a parrot bought for a little girl with speech difficulties paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons and eventually becomes a super intelligent <UNK> himself however paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from n y c to l a to be re united with her br br so why does this awful sounding film succeed relatively well firstly it boasts some interesting and impressive <UNK> effects secondly and far more significantly it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving often <UNK> story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline <UNK> it has several surprisingly strong performances including jay <UNK> as a <UNK> crook gena rowlands as a kind old lady and cheech <UNK> yes the <UNK> smoking cheech <UNK> as a musical immigrant it might not be a classic but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages
<START> in this documentary we meet roger the rich manager of a factory in china that makes <UNK> and other <UNK> sold and <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> in new orleans roger claims the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides but interviews with four of them tell quite another story the girls' bleak lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> itself filmmaker david <UNK> should be <UNK> for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a chinese factory compound and for landing a revealing on camera interview with the head of the u s company that <UNK> and sells the <UNK> the movie is <UNK> told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind those <UNK> made in china <UNK>
<START> well i'm <UNK> a woody allen film that i walked out of after half an hour i'm aware of the moral <UNK> of commenting on a film of which i've seen less than half but i hope you'll understand why basically it became apparent very early on that we were going to be <UNK> from the screen with a script that set out its <UNK> as if with bullet points a cast that were all trying to be characters from hannah and her sisters with the exception of chloe <UNK> and were badly directed into doing so and a camera that sat around <UNK> only for there to be nothing to film but chat and the actor delivering it drama none it's partially pre narrated but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation br br maybe i did leave too early in this case but by then i'd decided against another hour and a half of one liner allen <UNK> the script has its funny moments  i went almost entirely on the back of will <UNK> <UNK> in the trailer trailer hooked again <UNK>  but there's little pace to let them fly off <UNK> as is best worse than this there's no <UNK> saying this film's wooden makes a forest look like a <UNK> the opening <UNK> bound discussion being the most <UNK> case in point the only thing that should be done by numbers is <UNK> reviewing  2 10
<START> you know this is gonna be a cheesy movie when br br 1 it was made it the 50's 2 it's in black and white 3 it has no name actors 4 screaming makes up for the lack of special effects br br well not to be <UNK> this movie brilliantly <UNK> all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic <UNK> br br okay <UNK> but i am gonna discuss special effects here or lack of them br br did you catch the underwater scenes it looks like it was poorly filmed through an <UNK> note the cape <UNK> in the <UNK> br br and the repeated re use of stock footage exterior house shots the bridges scenes great enhanced the k r a f <UNK> of this film not since plan 9 have i seen such creative usage of stock footage br br and hey where there was a lack of special effects not to worry screaming does take the place of special effects in this movie as well yes this movie even cleverly used that old hack trick br br grab the popcorn set your brain on <UNK> several <UNK> <UNK> definitely helps sit back and wonder why the heck did they put this on film again br br <UNK> br br
<START> emma is a true romance if you love the <UNK> stuff charged with wit and <UNK> you will love this movie its true to the novel which is very important with a few twists added for pleasure <UNK> is not one of my <UNK> <UNK> but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in <UNK> she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to br br jeremy northam as the hero how shocked are you i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck what the right role can do for you he looks so good as the sensible regal mr k that i am literally looking at him in a new light he makes and excellent romantic lead the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful br br ewan <UNK> greta <UNK> brings in the rest a good cast a good movie if you are a fan of jane austen see this movie along with pride and prejudice and most importantly buy the books it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary
<START> i discovered this movie on <UNK> and i thought it would be interesting for tiny love stories some of the stories really dragged on in this movie the fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses were talking about their own real sex lives including kathy baker and alicia <UNK> i have to admit i want to start seeing some more romantic views of first sexual encounters again like in strike 1998 when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> started asking about her presumed first time and <UNK> asked was it beautiful br br some might think re <UNK> and flashbacks would improve this movie i think it would make things even worse it doesn't necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention but somehow i just expected more
<START> the movie was disappointing the book was powerful the views and the learning of little tree were <UNK> portrayed in the book the movie just <UNK> along and finally <UNK> away still a nice tale for kids
<START> have just seen the australian premiere of shower <UNK> at the sydney film festival the program notes said it was a perfect delight <UNK> made touching amusing dramatic and <UNK> meaningful i couldn't agree more i just hope the rest of the festival films come up to this standard of entertainment and i look forward to seeing more chinese films planned to be shown in sydney in the coming months
<START> kudos to director and cast for such a realistic film the <UNK> lack of <UNK> and desperation drew me into the film and kept me there i was truly impressed by how dates and information were <UNK> within the film ie <UNK> letters etc it kept the film moving at such a fast pace i didn't feel the urge to fast forward once personally i thought all the principles did a tremendous job it was great to see <UNK> and <UNK> in such difficult roles it made me want to cry at times val kilmer didn't surprise me his performances of this nature usually leave me in awe overall this is a brilliant film not to be missed
<START> that's right you heard me i am a huge fan of james <UNK> i own 10 of his books and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer in my opinion the screenwriter should be shot br br what right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre if i ever thought that harry potter was butchered then michael o'hara has proved me wrong br br i can only pray that the next screenwriter who <UNK> this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice to michael o'hara and russell <UNK> don't quit your day job
<START> this film is a wonderfully simplistic work enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time the performances from miranda otto oh how she deserves so much more recognition and george del <UNK> are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch as the two tortured souls come to understand each other the supporting cast of workers at the dead letter office are wonderful bit parts in them <UNK> as is <UNK> long suffering boyfriend who i couldn't help but feel slightly sorry for there's one particular scene i could watch over and over and i have it's such a shame that films like these don't get recognition and therefore bring them <UNK> into the public eye for more people to enjoy i cried i laughed and i <UNK> i'd recommend this film to anyone
<START> bette midler is <UNK> in this concert she gives her all every time she is on stage whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or <UNK> our eyes at the <UNK> of one of her tremendous <UNK> bette midler moves her audience if you can't see it live which is the best way to see bette then this is the next best thing an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and <UNK> over the years but never lost its power her more <UNK> correct version of stay with me never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever i will treasure this concert for a very long time
<START> it is hard to describe bug in words it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood it follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything i have seen lately in a hollywood release as its characters react to the chain of events in different ways and as the events <UNK> different paths for the characters to follow the audience is merely an <UNK> the almost <UNK> narrative flow of thought to thought the very <UNK> in the script will have you glued to the screen waiting <UNK> to see how it all works out in the end and as far as the <UNK> elements there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy to bright and beautiful and then to tragic all within the span of about a minute and it works br br this movie is pure magic it reminds one why independent film is perhaps the <UNK> star the film industry currently has perhaps with more movies of bug's quality people will start to take notice
<START> sydney lumet although one of the oldest active directors still got game a few years ago he shot find me guilty a proof to everyone that <UNK> <UNK> can actually act if he gets the opportunity and the right director if he had retired after this movie a true masterpiece in my eyes no one could have blamed him but he's still going strong his next movie already announced for 2009 br br but let's stay with this movie right here the cast list is incredible their performance top notch the little nuances in their performances the real dialogue and or situations that <UNK> throughout the movie are just amazing the time structure of the movie that keeps your <UNK> the whole time <UNK> time lines so <UNK> that the editing seems natural flawless the story is <UNK> by that although even in a normal time structure it would've been at least a good movie drama thriller i can only highly recommend it the rest is up to you o
<START> woody allen's second movie set in london <UNK> <UNK> card murderer is killing prostitutes in london aspiring journalist sondra <UNK> scarlett johansson gets a tip that he may be lord peter <UNK> hugh jackman she starts to romance him but quickly falls in love she's helped by stage magician sid <UNK> woody allen who doesn't like what he sees br br i like this better than the over rated match point from last year it was shorter and moved much more quickly the plot is old but i was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end it's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines all from allen of course it's not one of allen's best but it's far better than his worst br br the acting is for the most part very good allen is bad but he's played this character a million times before and it's gotten tiresome but johansson and jackman are just great they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances also allen surprisingly works on their sex appeal there is a sequence where they're both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies the only real <UNK> is that allen still seems unsure on how to shot london he's not as off as he was on match point though maybe he'll just get better as he goes along br br worth seeing i give it an 8
<START> a country boy aussie rules player <UNK> goes to the city the night before an all important <UNK> trial match where he is to be picked up by his cousin and then things go wrong br br his no <UNK> cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local <UNK> shark drug dealer tiny who looks like any gangster anywhere but is <UNK> australian needless to say <UNK> becomes <UNK> in the chaos and it isn't long before thoughts of <UNK> match are <UNK> to the back of his mind as the <UNK> frantic events unravel br br accomplished western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country boy <UNK> and successfully plays a part well below his age best support comes from john <UNK> as tiny and an entertaining role by david <UNK> as one of the cops following the events roll is fast paced often funny and a very worthwhile use of an hour
<START> the wife of a stage producer in london hopes to fix up the american song and dance man starring in her husband's latest show with an <UNK> an american girl who makes her living <UNK> fashions in society circles unfortunately the couple has already met on their own with the girl thinking the guy is actually the show producer married to her friend the fact he's not wearing a wedding ring should have <UNK> any <UNK> <UNK> fred astaire ginger rogers musical is eventually dragged back down to the earth by dwight taylor and allan scott's idiotic script which is full of juvenile behavior astaire and rogers don't just <UNK> <UNK> they meet ridiculously he's tap dancing like a madman in the hotel <UNK> above hers and she complains audiences of <UNK> probably didn't care how these two were going to get together as long as they did so and happily seen today the central characters appear to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms he <UNK> her with flowers after telling his friend he wants to remain fancy free in the love department and she gives him the brush off nothing that a little dancing couldn't cure this glamorous <UNK> are as deliberately unreal as are the london and <UNK> settings but we watch simply because the leads are fred and ginger it's a fantasy for have <UNK> ones who don't mind the <UNK> down plot the musical moments do break up the <UNK> of the contrived scenario yet fail to <UNK> the surrounding silliness from
<START> well would firstly like to <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> is a part of a <UNK> <UNK> and roughly translated it means to protect <UNK> on the other hand refers to the color of the police uniform which is <UNK> br br also the <UNK> film industry is rather full of purely commercial <UNK> any <UNK> or <UNK> movie would stand testament to that statement br br now <UNK> <UNK> is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack certainly very stunning in the final scene especially love the ending which is certainly unexpected the gore is rather too much at times but certainly this is a great movie
<START> <UNK> seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers this film opens with incest and <UNK> meaningless casual incest at that that's <UNK> big problem he prefers <UNK> tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful technical skill isn't enough he's just a bit perverse for the sake of <UNK>
<START> after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler <UNK> las vegas a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas midler who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's proves that she is still one of the most <UNK> live performers in the business from her opening number her classic friends where she <UNK> from the wings <UNK> a beautiful prop cloud bette <UNK> the stage with style and charisma from a rap <UNK> number called i look good she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she <UNK> her way through a variety of musical <UNK> the section of the show where she <UNK> <UNK> goes on a little too long but she does manage to <UNK> her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it but her ad <UNK> until she remembers it is hysterical bette also treats us to <UNK> turn from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club she brings the house down near the end with stay with me baby from the rose and her only 1 hit record wind beneath my wings from <UNK> it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans it's a must
<START> <UNK> <UNK> of this film are likely bitter from some seriously <UNK> love this is a great film for anyone capable of understanding johnny <UNK> song or any song from that era bobby <UNK> beyond the sea or stan <UNK> the girl from <UNK> et al br br i measure films by how many times i have to watch them before i'm satisfied chances are had me back a few good times br br i also watch the <UNK> between the cast i thought they worked well together br br open your heart and let the comedic magic of film transport you br br <UNK>
<START> i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and <UNK> remembering <UNK> and <UNK> for it but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary it backed off and went somewhere else the dripping water throughout the house the black rain the <UNK> dreams taking the wrong turn in raw <UNK> were dropped before they could work up to a scream br br what a disappointment <UNK> nearly <UNK> mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief something i found myself <UNK> as the film wore on what could have been eerie <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in the background were instead a <UNK> seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head the ideas that modern people can <UNK> ancient gods that the <UNK> peoples believe red haired white men were the first priests and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension the dream time br br spoiler in the final scene it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell is there a big wave so what how big a <UNK> yeah okay that's devastating but not apocalyptic is it the end of the world from a wave the last wave <UNK> have to be a pretty darn big wave why was the world that bad a place it didn't seem so awful in this movie actually i didn't think the wave came off since the shadow left <UNK> face that had been cast by the wave was it only <UNK> apocalypse heck that happens every day to people who lose it it wasn't of any interest if it was only him br br the most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of <UNK> potential was in charlie's apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for <UNK> <UNK> wife charlie keeps asking him who are you and it becomes truly disturbing after a while unfortunately the movie never followed suit
<START> i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end after you've already invested an hour into it and that's what happened with this film i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that <UNK> wrote its source story i haven't gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends fortunately i didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it <UNK> such a waste of excellent acting the wife in particular was so perfect but milo <UNK> as a jew now that was funny i haven't <UNK> into its making but it played like the director lost his <UNK> or died 3 4 of the way through the film before that point a story and characters were developing there were a number of neat plot points and there wasn't too much time wasted but <UNK> that last 1 2 hour if that wasn't the <UNK> most worthless denouement i've ever witnessed i don't know what is i just hate it when one's faith is so destroyed like that it feels like an act of violence
<START> i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv br br the one scene that always stands out for me that is is the one with the myrna loy and the <UNK> <UNK> where she gives him very explicit <UNK> on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says did you get that that's yellow blue green and white
<START> in the <UNK> film series book the films of gene kelly anchors aweigh is described as a <UNK> of a musical i sure can't do better than that it's such an important film in both the careers of gene kelly and frank sinatra kathryn grayson didn't do too badly with this either br br louis b <UNK> had <UNK> gene kelly out to columbia where harry <UNK> had an inspiration to let kelly <UNK> his own numbers and because of it cover girl became a classic so if <UNK> didn't learn a lesson producer joe <UNK> did and allowed kelly artistic control when anchors aweigh was finished fred astaire at last had a dancing rival for <UNK> of cinema dance br br the main number everyone talks about with gene kelly here is the dance with jerry mouse originally kelly wanted to do the number with walt disney's mickey mouse but disney wasn't <UNK> mickey out to nobody mickey would have to wait until who framed roger rabbit to do an outside film not to worry because mgm had it's own animated <UNK> one half the team of tom and jerry br br kelly as dancer always <UNK> to do something new and different on screen as did fred astaire for the next dozen years these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren't up to snuff it was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity kelly for mgm astaire for mgm and any number of other studios in anchors aweigh kelly got sinatra to dance a bit in fact frank sinatra always gave credit to gene kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both burt <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> for their help in <UNK> him is oscar for from here to eternity br br when frank sinatra had half of his contract bought from rko by mgm he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own he'd become friends with the <UNK> team of <UNK> <UNK> and sammy <UNK> in his autobiography sammy <UNK> tells about how sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film louis b <UNK> gave in and the team wrote some really fine <UNK> for him to sing one of my favorite sinatra numbers comes from anchors aweigh i fall in love too easily frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty hollywood bowl it's sinatra at his best br br with <UNK> <UNK> and later with jimmy van <UNK> sammy <UNK> richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in frank sinatra's mouth than any other person they were lifetime friends and <UNK> always credited sinatra with this <UNK> boost in his career br br on a bet <UNK> and <UNK> said they could write a song just using a <UNK> scale they proved it in anchors aweigh when kathryn grayson put her soprano to work on all of a sudden my heart sings she also did some classical numbers br br here singing in fact is the basis of the plot two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with kathryn grayson and her <UNK> nephew dean <UNK> trying to fix her up with sinatra kelly says he can get her an audition with jose iturbi they spend the film trying to accomplish just that br br my only disappointment in anchors aweigh was that pamela <UNK> who plays the waitress <UNK> never got a number herself she had gotten rave reviews from her performance as meg <UNK> in <UNK> on broadway and that's what brought her to hollywood i have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in <UNK> <UNK> it might still be br br anchors aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren't made any more all that creative talent was under contract to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if you had to pay market value for it the cost might <UNK> some third world country's debt br br but the film results would be extraordinary
<START> i don't understand why the other comments focus on <UNK> he has never been a very interesting film actor br br the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit alfred <UNK> and patrick <UNK> make an unusual comic duo definitely not stock types although one can't say their characters are well developed that doesn't make them any less funny br br the version i saw was on <UNK> and had subtitles for the spanish dialog so that was certainly not a problem the use of spanish gives it more authenticity br br a very underrated movie judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting
<START> let me start off by saying that i didn't watch this movie at first with high expectations it was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies and mtv was <UNK> on the front cover so i was not expecting much what i was expecting was a tear <UNK> overly dramatic but at least effective br br i was wrong br br firstly let me start off that i had never read the book nor watched any other versions of the movie br br the acting was my main <UNK> with the film by god is it awful the main girl is pretty mediocre but when compared to the rest of the cast she's <UNK> streep the main hero heath is just plain awful he can sing decent sounding clichéd songs but that's about it his acting broke the <UNK> moments by being so bad at points that i just burst into laughter the <UNK> girl was pretty <UNK> too and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that couldn't display emotion whatsoever and when he tried to it failed miserably neil patrick harris was the only decent actor playing edward although it's obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what i've seen him do oh and the father wasn't half bad to my memory but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time i can hardly remember br br the story itself was not very good more <UNK> than you can imagine predictable story until the ending which i barely understood extremely one sided characters with no real depth to them overall just not interesting or compelling nothing we've never seen before done much better and nothing worth watching here br br the ending is suppose to be a <UNK> it did nothing of the sort the ending isn't built up at all it almost feels like an <UNK> in fact i had to ask my friends why the ending actually happened which when they explained it to me i must have had a look on my face of wait when did they say that what never a good sign the editing was probably the worst i've seen though i do understand the fade ins fade outs are done because this was originally made for tv but that's really no excuse br br overall the movie is just garbage i'm a sensitive guy i cried during two episodes of the simpsons i never cried during this crap not even close really this movie is not worth your time if you really want to see a <UNK> look elsewhere
<START> the closing song by johnny rivers was the only great thing about this movie unfortunately that is all the positive i can say about this western movie i have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western i am not sure if the movie was a tribute to <UNK> along or just a spoof the hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic not realistic at all a lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic but the shooting scenes were a joke a previous <UNK> thought this movie was great and in the comments took a cheap shot at president bush this was not a <UNK> or <UNK> western it was just a bad western movie to be sold <UNK> i wonder if it made any money at times i thought i was watching a movie made by college movie students if that was the case then it was a great movie
<START> jodie foster <UNK> <UNK> the former lead singer of the <UNK> all girl rock group the <UNK> in her remarkably able acting debut marilyn <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are uniformly believable splendid and touching as the titular <UNK> who are a tight <UNK> <UNK> of troubled <UNK> loyal adolescent girls with <UNK> <UNK> self absorbed parents who do their best to grow up and <UNK> for themselves in the <UNK> san <UNK> valley california <UNK> the girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex drugs alcohol commitment and so on at a tender young age when they're not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially <UNK> consequences of said decisions foster giving one of her most <UNK> affecting and underrated performances to date is basically the <UNK> <UNK> mother who <UNK> over the well being of both herself and the others she's especially concerned about the good hearted but reckless and self destructive <UNK> whose <UNK> <UNK> lifestyle makes her likely to meet an <UNK> end br br this picture offers a poignant insightful often <UNK> credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath <UNK> neatly <UNK> surface and the tragic net result of such families tough <UNK> but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and <UNK> of growing up on their own because their parents are either too <UNK> or even nonexistent adrian fatal attraction <UNK> ladder <UNK> direction is both <UNK> and <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> script is somewhat messy and rambling but overall still accurate in its frank gritty <UNK> depiction of your average <UNK> kid's nerve <UNK> chaotic <UNK> and unpredictable everyday life leon <UNK> soft <UNK> almost <UNK> cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily <UNK> sense of <UNK> and innocence <UNK> <UNK> arranged the excellent score which makes particularly effective use of donna <UNK> <UNK> on the radio the top notch cast includes sally <UNK> as <UNK> neurotic insecure <UNK> mother scott <UNK> as a sweet <UNK> dude randy quaid as <UNK> rich older boyfriend british 60's pop singer adam faith as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rock <UNK> father and lois smith as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mother appearing in brief bits are robert <UNK> mike <UNK> fast times at <UNK> high as one of <UNK> <UNK> ex boyfriends and a <UNK> <UNK> wearing laura dern as an obnoxious party <UNK> <UNK> authentic engrossing and deeply moving <UNK> grim ultimate fate is very heart breaking <UNK> is quite simply one of the most <UNK> and under appreciated teen movies made about early 80's <UNK>
<START> if i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have i see some <UNK> at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year etc etc excuse me are you <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap br br i read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes i totally understand that i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once br br do not watch this movie do something else useful with your life do the <UNK> walk the dog hell anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod
<START> this is a great example of a rather simple film noir story that is handled exceptionally well thanks to excellent direction by otto preminger as well as some lovely acting performances dana andrews stars as a hot headed detective who all too often uses his <UNK> instead of his brains soon after the film begins andrews is being <UNK> for this and is warned that if this continues he'll be off the force a bit later while investigating a crime he's attacked by a suspect and andrews is forced to fight to protect himself this time he does not use excessive force but the <UNK> is killed andrews <UNK> and assumes they won't believe him so he tries to cover up the death though instead an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crime br br there's a lot more to the film than this including a plot involving a slimy villain gary <UNK> and a love interest for andrews gene tierney all in all this is one of the better examples of the genre with great gritty dialog superb lighting and a simple yet very effective story this is the way noir was meant to be
<START> absolutely wonderful drama and <UNK> is top notch i highly recommend this movie her performance in my opinion was academy award material the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format whether it be tape or dvd they are ignoring a very good movie but universal has little regard for its library on dvd which is sad if you get the chance to see this somewhere not sure why it is rarely even run on cable see it i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film and too many reviewers spend hours writing about the story which is available anywhere br br a 10
<START> no need to detail what others have written in other reviews here goes the summary br br much of the <UNK> animation work is downright gorgeous the colors are superb would love to have it done in <UNK> as a <UNK> br br the story and execution is a total <UNK> it was quite difficult to stay awake at times br br if you are a student of the fine arts medieval <UNK> early religion and so forth have at it this is a film for you br br if you want an engaging entertaining movie look elsewhere this is a failure as anything other than an artistic statement br br <UNK> didn't have <UNK> by the way
<START> dreadful acting a <UNK> <UNK> attempt to slam those on the left side of the <UNK> br br women are <UNK> and <UNK> around men tom <UNK> shows his acting range from a to b
<START> warning there might be spoilers ahead if you care br br okay the basic premise of this <UNK> texas film is college kids <UNK> evil magic book scary stuff in practice it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on a bunch of frat boys along with <UNK> girlfriends <UNK> is setting up a charity haunted house the project is being <UNK> over by a thoroughly <UNK> character whose main purpose seems to be <UNK> physically <UNK> as many cast members as possible i had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity he's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone including his girlfriend and his buddy regardless the kids are visited by local character <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> champion <UNK> jack an elderly <UNK> who is described as the santa claus of halloween and who drops off a load of props for the house including an ominous book that figured <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> prologue where a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> get turned into stir <UNK> needless to say some damn fool starts messing with the book and eventually most of the <UNK> monsters turn into real ones and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive there's some good stuff in this film but not much everything is shot well and the makeup effects are decent on the other hand the performers either <UNK> or <UNK> drastically much of the plot makes little sense outside of a this happens so that can happen series there is hardly any musical score to speak of just <UNK> of songs throughout the film and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere that last problem is the most telling two thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters tom is a nice guy dating <UNK> the control freak but he used to date jill who is now dating dan the jerk but she's started a relationship <UNK> the girl who wears too many <UNK> <UNK> dan is a really big jerk gary likes to play jokes and steve lily like to have a lot of sex stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on to the point where the lesbian sex scene calm down it's pretty tame left me looking for the fast forward button that leaves us with half an hour of lo <UNK> scares a <UNK> ending and a deep <UNK> dislike of ol' <UNK> jack who i blame for the whole mess unless you can get this on some sort of deep <UNK> rental and really have seen everything else in the store put it back on the shelf and keep looking
<START> i'm grateful to <UNK> <UNK> and his crew in <UNK> the once <UNK> <UNK> film <UNK> <UNK> is hopefully the <UNK> of a <UNK> in this <UNK> that claims more <UNK> than <UNK> the <UNK> and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the <UNK> downside the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist the other item that i didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the period costume of the same character and above all his bright red <UNK> car that i suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s <UNK> without those small yet glaring details <UNK> would've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this film sure beats <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which provided a different view of the <UNK> during the second world war <UNK> there are some parts where the cinematography <UNK> back to spielberg's the color purple and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of <UNK> me <UNK>
<START> sergio <UNK> the case of the <UNK> tail is a <UNK> giallo from the early 70's <UNK> of the genre an explosion on an <UNK> results in one million dollars in insurance money for a <UNK> but <UNK> wife the money is subsequently <UNK> by a black clad assassin and a series of brutal murders follow br br <UNK> tail plays the mystery element written by giallo <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fairly straight but being a giallo the murders themselves are memorable and well staged in fact the violence in this movie is very strong in places a scene with a broken bottle being particularly graphic the emphasis on the violence no doubt <UNK> the giallo genre to move into more and more extreme territory but like the best films in the genre the brutality is <UNK> by a good score and attractive photography the music by bruno <UNK> is at times reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> avant garde work in the bird with the crystal <UNK> but is also strong in its own right the photography is helped by the nice use of foreign locales in this case london and <UNK> where martino manages to get in respectively the houses of <UNK> and the <UNK> there is also some inventive camera work too the most effective being the use of slow motion in a sequence where a woman runs towards the door where the maniac is <UNK> outside in this particular scene martino has the killer hack through the door with a knife in a manner influenced by <UNK> <UNK> crystal <UNK> however it also has the killer attempt to flick the <UNK> open with the blade of a knife which is something repeated later by <UNK> in <UNK> so <UNK> film is influential in its own right br br this is a good solid giallo that both genre and non genre fans can appreciate the performances are good and the production values are fine although the plane explosion is shall we say somewhat low budget the dvd release by <UNK> is nice it has both the english and italian language <UNK> which is a real bonus however it is worth pointing out that at times you need to be a fast reader to fully appreciate the english <UNK> option this applies to both the movie and the documentary in the extras this is a minor point though the dvd release is a worthy addition to any giallo collection
<START> unfortunately in cases such as these there are so many <UNK> stories as everyone tries to cast blame on to others that it is a near <UNK> to get a clear picture of what really happened this movie is a victim of such circumstances the writers too many of them have decided to take all of the stories and give them to the audience to let them decide which version of the truth they like the best as in the real life case there is no clear answer no conclusion and the audience is left with a general <UNK> of being <UNK> like coffee without the <UNK> or sex without the climax <UNK> with no <UNK> are generally frustrating and makes you wonder why someone didn't do research before they put it out there at least <UNK> your movie as a fiction if that is what it amounts to and this does br br that is not to say there are not some great performances here kilmer as holmes does an outstanding role bringing some humanity to what is otherwise an <UNK> character kilmer and the real life lovers and friends who <UNK> on the film let the audience see a selfish troubled human being who though his faults were many and large was loved and cared for by many people except himself <UNK> as <UNK> wife only gives a <UNK> of the dramatic actress she can be but it is very noticeable and unforgettable <UNK> <UNK> character was not as emotionally complex as she could have been and needed to show more inner conflict to give <UNK> to what ultimately happened between dawn and holmes she turned him in 6 months after they <UNK> to florida <UNK> apple <UNK> performance is at time annoying at times touching but shows none of the <UNK> the real <UNK> must have possessed the other characters fade in to the <UNK> which is a pity lucas is a great performer who could have sunk his teeth in to this role had it been fleshed out for him even dylan mcdermott was surprisingly capable in his role of drug dealing biker br br the fault of this movie does not lie with this cast but with the writing too many <UNK> spoil the soup and this <UNK> filled with so much promise ultimately leaves you hungry the story and characters may have been less than sympathetic but in what movie of this <UNK> are they not so other movies such as <UNK> <UNK> cowboy starring matt dillon who was reportedly asked to take this role and refused worked with similar subject matter and <UNK> it to such a degree that you felt a <UNK> with the main character by the end of the movie despite what he had done van <UNK> could have given james cox and his crew a few lessons had someone bothered to try and find the truth this would have been an intriguing story as it is you will find the accompanying <UNK> documentary more <UNK> in the 2 disc dvd and much more informative you will realize from the dvd that holmes was not a bad guy but not a very good one either as are most people
<START> i have not read the novel or anything other by kurt <UNK> but i am now <UNK> to start this grips you from the very first frame and does not let go until the end credits start rolling taking you places you don't expect the plot is interesting throughout the pacing is spot on nothing lasts too long and this does a perfect job of <UNK> between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we've seen it is well told and well thought out i've never watched a film that i feel i could particularly compare this to it is intense and exciting as well as funny and sad the acting is excellent nolte absolutely shines goodman again proves that he doesn't have to go for laughs and lee and arkin are <UNK> i could go on really no role is treated to a less than stellar performance the editing and cinematography are marvelous and all of the visuals are great with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones i am going to go for other movies directed by keith gordon as well as the other two apparently related to this through the author of the books there is one scene of sexuality and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this i recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it it is not pleasant 8 10
<START> a sexually obsessed chef leads a <UNK> life one as a happily married man with a ten year <UNK> child the other as a sex fiend the bulk of the documentary like film follows him for five <UNK> days and is told in flashback with <UNK> kinski as a <UNK> sex <UNK> listening to his story and intelligently <UNK> him <UNK> role is very <UNK> and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes if she had i would have rated this movie a big fat f as it is it rates an f <UNK> that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage diary of a sex addict falls into the category of films that once one has seen it one wishes that one hadn't
<START> what a shame that alan clarke has to be associated with this tripe that doesn't rule it out however get a group of <UNK> and some <UNK> together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter great wasted night stuff al hunter homes in on a well <UNK> theme of the late 80s that <UNK> were well <UNK> and not really interested in the football itself often with respectable jobs estate agent but how clarke can convince us that any of the two bit actors <UNK> from other tv productions of low quality <UNK> hill or soon to go on to poor quality drama <UNK> can for a <UNK> make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable are we really to believe that the <UNK> on whom of course the drama is based would ever go to another town to fight with just six <UNK> br br the <UNK> would crowd out tube stations and the like with hundreds andy <UNK> <UNK> needs to be read before even <UNK> a story of this nature the acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs <UNK> is so camp it is unbelievable most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of mr <UNK> a true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick go for it
<START> i've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time and while this isn't the worst of the bunch it's certainly in the lower half the script starts off ok a young doctor goes to a hospital as an <UNK> hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife cute huh the movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients turns out that there's a demon on the basement that's <UNK> people's souls it's the job of the 1 doctor 1 nurse and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient <UNK> do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects at this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid i was begging for it to be over there was still an hour to go it looked like a half an hour tales from the crypt episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap fest from tiny <UNK> doing his best john <UNK> the green mile <UNK> to tracy <UNK> playing the stereotypical <UNK> nurse <UNK> this movie fails in every possible level i gave this 2 stars for only two reason 1 his fiancé is pretty hot she <UNK> the pain a little towards the end and 2 the movie actually looks ok a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal mart quality home cameras br br in the end avoid this turd even if you have the blockbuster movie pass which i do and i still felt cheated as a bonus drinking game you and your buddies take a shot every time matt <UNK> dr james bishop shakes his head while talking you'll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie
<START> you know you're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles generally it means that they tried and <UNK> to hide the turkey in various <UNK> such a turkey is the brain machine which has seven different titles br br its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves or something like that its filled with b level tv actors sitting in <UNK> room with lawn <UNK> trying to act a script that makes almost no sense br br its a turkey of the <UNK> kind avoid it
<START> review may contain some spoilers i'll make this review short and sweet i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman how bad could it be right well it's pretty bad justin timberlake plays <UNK> a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at <UNK> police force ll cool j is deed a cop within the force on a special force team called f r a t first response assault tactics he's teamed with an on the edge bad cop named <UNK> dylan mcdermott in the opening scene we see <UNK> deed taking on some bank robbers but at night they are <UNK> a couple of guys doing drugs i don't want to give to much away but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs <UNK> who works for <UNK> morgan freeman goes to a trial involving deeds <UNK> he suspect foul play and with the help of <UNK> does some investigate that turns ugly wallace kevin spacey who is all within the f r a t team joins with <UNK> to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice br br you can tell from the beginning that freeman and <UNK> performance are pretty lackluster the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me ll cool j is terrible in this film he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion he was much better in movies like deep blue sea any given sunday the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film the ending is far from satisfying br br don't waste your time with this film i'm putting it on ebay this weekend
<START> i thought that the <UNK> of horror film making had been reached with book of shadows i was wrong this film makes that look like the <UNK> <UNK> compared to this piece of shameless <UNK> <UNK> matter that has the <UNK> to call itself a movie i'd write more but i'm still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend <UNK> renting it <UNK> br br and were these people english and where is the forest i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> the whole <UNK> thing looked like a national trust <UNK> plantation those angels looked like <UNK> <UNK> turned most of them were did my research i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces br br p s i love and admire tom <UNK> but he cannot act
<START> just as the new bsg wasn't what fans of the original series were expecting caprica may not deliver what fans of the new bsg were expecting for the most part it is a very interesting if not somewhat self involved show or at least the pilot is br br if you're looking for the big cgi thrills of the new bsg you'll be sorely disappointed if you liked the drama you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with br br the storyline does examine on how the <UNK> were developed why <UNK> hates them and the origins of a <UNK> society the writers also manage to tackle humans <UNK> god s ' and the creation or re creation of <UNK> life it will be interesting to see how this plays out br br i found it to <UNK> along in some parts and too preachy in others but all in all it was promising a small part of me wishes or hopes there might be some minor <UNK> of bsg in there aside from the back story i mentioned but that would probably <UNK> the storyline too much like bsg i'll have to wait and see if caprica grows on me but it's way too early to tell br br it would really easy to <UNK> this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series but i'm willing to give it a chance overall i thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before <UNK> in the proverbial <UNK>
<START> 2 stars out of a possible 10 and that is being overly generous br br i thought with a cast of james woods cathy bates randy quaid lou <UNK> jr and henry thomas how could it miss i was wrong br br i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week end he <UNK> out this piece of <UNK> i'd long suspected sam s of being kind of nuts this film based on his play <UNK> it br br this is the kind of artsy b s that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly <UNK> however for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie br br you haven't seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this bunch <UNK> is crazy ma is crazy the son is crazy and the daughter is oh yeah crazy they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor <UNK> especially the teenage daughter br br in addition to the above as if that weren't enough the plot and it's so thin you could read <UNK> it has a hole in it the size of <UNK> br br ma is <UNK> to sell their <UNK> farm as it turns out so is <UNK> now i don't claim to be a real estate expert but the last time i checked property <UNK> owned must have both of the owners <UNK> in order to be sold if only one of them owned the property then the other could not <UNK> sell it so it would be pointless for that person to do so mr shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and therefore his plot does not work br br not that anything else was really working anyway br br the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity and i can't imagine why anyone would want to
<START> i saw the latter half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on dvd recently i watched several of the reality series on <UNK> about <UNK> etc none of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does based on real reality pulling no punches bleak happy tragic and <UNK> this is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life fine acting on the part of both rip torn and <UNK> ferrell add to an well done script the opening credit states that it was done though <UNK> <UNK> through the national <UNK> for the <UNK> if this is the kind of product <UNK> could go to i would be happy to see more i highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the film
<START> this movie is one of my favourites it is a genre mixture with ingredients of the action horror romantic <UNK> some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards this minor flaw is easily ignored there is so much to discover in this story the romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts the visuals are beautiful too the action is great which is no surprise it is <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> of the world's best action movies the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way somehow this movie is being able to balance the different <UNK> and keeps being good absolutely recommended
<START> this film can't make up its mind whether its message is humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and <UNK> or don't ever go in the water again a <UNK> nolan is out to <UNK> a killer whale a very bad thing but when he accidentally accidentally mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate the cow and i use the word in all senses who is obviously a sick psycho bitch and the <UNK> villain of the piece throws herself against the <UNK> trying to chew herself to bits in the most <UNK> and hideous not to mention <UNK> method of killing herself i doubt it was her first when her unborn <UNK> <UNK> from her hideous self inflicted wounds her mate goes mental with revenge and <UNK> to hurt kill and <UNK> every human who even so much as talks to nolan obviously as among humans total <UNK> date other total <UNK> br br the film <UNK> of half thought out anti human message the poor poor whale the evil men must suffer and die and yet it does not succeed in <UNK> nolan at all it's true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel but at the first <UNK> of the first whale he grows a heart and as the film progresses he grows more and more compassionate to the <UNK> pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel a little better br br the films final journey in which nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north reminds me of <UNK> eerie man whale connection and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion where these two husbands might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident it's clear nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss however it never goes there the whale character has no compassion or respect for anyone br br the final scene loses this focus and becomes jaws like where the sea monster finally kills everybody and nolan and no doubt through an <UNK> fails to <UNK> up the whale <UNK> tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier i love animals and i <UNK> <UNK> and what is more i love <UNK> <UNK> but if this film's goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and <UNK> it completely failed nolan shows compassion and growth and feels for others and all the whale thinks about is killing and <UNK> br br the only message one can walk away with is if you see an <UNK> whale ever anywhere run the other way cause if you step on his <UNK> the wrong way he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you
<START> this cute animated short features two comic icons betty <UNK> and henry br br henry is the bald slightly <UNK> boy from the comics who never speaks br br well here he does speak br br he wants to get a puppy from betty <UNK> pet store and when he is left to mind the store some hilarious <UNK> ensue br br betty sings a song about pets henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey but everything works out in the end
<START> i don't think i've ever felt this let down by a film before after loving guy <UNK> two previous films i don't count swept away he was <UNK> blind i was so looking forward to seeing this br br the reviews were poor then again i don't trust the press anyway more worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker so it was with some <UNK> i handed over my <UNK> 80 yesterday afternoon br br i'm not even going to try to explain this film mainly because i haven't got a clue what was going on and at one point i was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who didn't get it br br unfortunately i think ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself far too seriously it seems it wasn't good enough for him to make films with good plots laughs snappy dialogue and good characters it's almost as if he had a <UNK> of films he wanted to rip off here are some of the ones i noticed br br the matrix fight club kill bill the usual suspects vanilla sky br br i think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors jason <UNK> and ray liotta were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing direction that let the film down br br so a big big thumbs down from me
<START> for domestic audiences i can see how they would applaud this movie for <UNK> with no <UNK> interests it did not make much sense the germans were portrayed as <UNK> and the russians as heroes the supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction how a young woman could <UNK> the lieutenant from just <UNK> him was nonsense how she could as mentioned at the end of the movie never marry just because of this <UNK> was beyond me i mentioned the germans were portrayed as idiots and that was <UNK> in the chase into the <UNK> several hundred german troops advanced pushing the russians into the <UNK> so the russians <UNK> and the germans stopped at the edge of the <UNK> and just stood there listening i suppose they did not want to get their boots wet but i am sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the <UNK> but that would have ended the story also the germans entered the <UNK> where the russians were hiding in the <UNK> and did not bother to fire into the roof at the worst some soldier would have tossed a <UNK> into the <UNK> and not <UNK> a ladder to <UNK> in br br i did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end i wonder why you knew this small band would <UNK> and they was nothing heart <UNK> in that
<START> this is definitely one of the <UNK> 70's movies out there and it's most notable for kicking off a decade of bigfoot <UNK> it is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie especially when the dark moody first half is replaced by a musical <UNK> of all things as another user pointed out one of the songs is dedicated to a character travis <UNK> who <UNK> around in a <UNK> for a while then leaves never to be seen again although it's painfully dated now <UNK> still a fun scary movie to show to kids and anyone who enjoys either bigfoot <UNK> or 70's <UNK> culture is bound to get a kick out of this my favorite part a guy gets so scared that he jumps <UNK> through a door and the narrator explains he went unconscious from shock uh i'd say breaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious but whatever br br 4 10 stars or 7 10 if you like bad <UNK>
<START> they probably could have <UNK> some of the beginning i'm not sure why this starts out in the asian part of turkey if it was because starting in the <UNK> they could have gotten closer starting in modern day <UNK> br br one the cameras and <UNK> get to the <UNK> tribe it's the beginning of an amazing 48 day journey 50 000 people with about 250 000 <UNK> <UNK> cattle and horses make this amazing trek across what seems to be a very fast moving <UNK> river they use <UNK> that are kept <UNK> by <UNK> goat <UNK> you can see where the head and legs were removed the other bank of the river was very <UNK> i'm guessing about a 60 degree rise br br just watching that was incredible but there was much more to come to get to the <UNK> they also had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow if not more being able to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in and of itself but they and all of the animals <UNK> this mountain <UNK> yes <UNK> br br the one <UNK> to this documentary were some of the inter titles with poor attempts at humor br br if you want to see a documentary from the silent era or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only face but <UNK> this is just an incredible document of a little known group of people facing all kinds of challenges
<START> john wayne albert <UNK> compete for oil rights on indian territory and for the attention of martha scott in this republic pictures film shot out of <UNK> usa br br an interesting western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting with wayne <UNK> playing the old and new <UNK> of the west it's based on a story by <UNK> <UNK> who co writes the script along with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> hill albert <UNK> directs in the <UNK> way that <UNK> his career a pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse the light hearted approach to the romantic <UNK> doesn't sit quite right and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by <UNK> being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work but hey stunt men deserve their moment of glory always solid support comes from george <UNK> hayes and wayne as usual has much screen charisma particularly when <UNK> off his pistol but in spite of its better than usual republic budget it remains a film of interest only to 1940s wayne <UNK> 4 10
<START> i admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it and they are not <UNK> as a must see and it is a must see just don't expect to see something <UNK> br br the <UNK> <UNK> are interesting in many parts of the film but there's just too much <UNK> and it doesn't stick in the end br br some of the good things are the <UNK> of <UNK> blue most of david lynch's some of hitchcock's and perhaps a couple more i missed i just remembered <UNK> and i usually don't miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the air br br other than being repetitive which makes it too long the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of <UNK> some <UNK> fed by our unconscious hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory br br i really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of mr zizek to revive <UNK> theory which has been <UNK> for too long specially in north america again it's way over the top and i believe not to be a completely waste of time for i do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood
<START> i just picked up the dvd release of this movie while on holiday in <UNK> where it has been released with english subtitles br br the film is beautifully photographed and <UNK> acted the <UNK> portraying <UNK> the lead character has an astonishingly open face which mirrors with painful accuracy the tragic events which unfold around him br br early on in the film we see that the father whom <UNK> loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought up when the brutal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the boy and suggests it was his own father br br the climactic scene where <UNK> refuses to show any respect to the <UNK> simply standing his ground and repeating <UNK> as he is brutally <UNK> in front of his classmates is a scene you are not likely to forget br br the films only weak point is the rather clichéd <UNK> <UNK> teacher who uses every <UNK> <UNK> trick in the book other than this i feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy
<START> the show is average it doesn't make me laugh particularly however i think <UNK> really brings it down she doesn't look natural she has these three ways to talk all robotic she talks quietly with no <UNK> she talks normally with no <UNK> or she does that thing where she starts talking normally and starts yelling gradually however her yelling is like let's pretend i'm yelling because i shouldn't be too loud on the set br br she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing it's annoying you can't really get her personality because she doesn't really produce emotion and doesn't get upset she has this husband who's doing all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her very dry and plain acting
<START> until now the worst movie i had ever seen was ben arthur you really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one the review <UNK> for this movie have been <UNK> positive through a relentless and <UNK> push by some of the people involved in making it evidence for which is fairly easy to <UNK> online at least the people who made ben arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs instead of <UNK> promoting it so <UNK> like me would buy it br br everything about this movie is terrible the script the story the casting the acting the direction the photography the editing the music what else goes into a movie whatever it is here it's as bad as it gets if it weren't so unpleasant it would be ridiculous i kept watching it thinking it must get better because i hadn't yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliable br br it does not take a lot of money to make a great movie nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad my favorite example of a <UNK> budget masterpiece is gus van <UNK> amazing <UNK> <UNK> but there are many others <UNK> <UNK> cut or <UNK> bad not because the people who made it had no money but because they had gigantic <UNK> and no talent for anything at all except self promotion
<START> when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film yet having read the content i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie the effect surprised me totally i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me a <UNK> to <UNK> is without any doubt one of the movies that now <UNK> a real surprise i have received from cinema here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema br br first the entire content is particularly educational it has something to offer to the modern audience pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions is there a need for christ in our times does love still matter what for is there faith what is the <UNK> of burden and suffering in life is there really someone by my side i can always trust the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us br br second the movie is exceptionally <UNK> the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions is it better for kyle david <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> paul to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home is it better for john ken howard to leave ellen barbara <UNK> his sick wife and start a new happy life with julia donna <UNK> a woman he falls in love with in fact ellen no longer <UNK> him yet he decides to <UNK> his wife eternal <UNK> had john's rebellious brother phil d david <UNK> better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life <UNK> <UNK> to god in the park is a psychological <UNK> of universal aspect of humanity these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where when or how they live br br third the movie is a great portrayal of family not very popular nowadays there are problems yet there is always something more powerful that gets these people together this something is love and trust i know that it may seem a bit idealistic not all families can rely on <UNK> and it may not be as simple as that nevertheless it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one br br fourth the entire film focuses on people's mutual help if we want to live happy lives in our society we must understand one thing we have to help one another alexander <UNK> davis is an example of such attitude at the beginning of the movie we see him talk to john about praying later he helps his brother alexander is a kinda angel that is sent to john and his family isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another br br fifth the artistic features are also worth attention performances barbara <UNK> gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role she does a perfect job consider for instance the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband picture the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves <UNK> while the sunshine love <UNK> everywhere i interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow this can always be <UNK> by light and joy br br a <UNK> to <UNK> is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love what <UNK> is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe at the end i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do br br kyle to his uncle phil yes he john <UNK> lives according to the bible but nobody forces you to do so yet according to what rules do you live
<START> while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot <UNK> perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age the movie was made as it is now 2002 an official five years ago after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings and science fiction <UNK> like star wars as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as <UNK> or <UNK> the odyssey br br my <UNK> basically is that i couldn't relate i am just about the same age of the children a young adult and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle aged man if that is the character available but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence i didn't find myself saying <UNK> i would have done the same thing ' it did not open the doors to my imagination even without comparing it to high budget films or other tv movies standing alone certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish teenager bitter after divorce image changing into the we're a big happy family let's never separate again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run even the characters themselves could have <UNK> improvement a typical set of one or the other stereotypes there was the ever present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious accompanied by mr perfect image of combining <UNK> good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude and lastly the smart <UNK> little brother we find to be so common these days while i know the personalities pushed the story along i think that adding more <UNK> as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable and believable as far as character movie br br i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design that made it worth finishing to the end for me don't get me wrong all movies are worth seeing for yourself and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many but i think that with a little more depth to the script and a little more i cannot believe i am saying this <UNK> i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical
<START> i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my <UNK> called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i <UNK> along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason <UNK> antics br br overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess the movie was quite short though around 85 min but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent happy ending the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason <UNK> kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace br br overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's <UNK> alright it would be more of a fair fight if females <UNK> this movie and gave there thoughts about it
<START> this movie is <UNK> <UNK> a straight 11 10 on the <UNK> scale the <UNK> of the accents as well as the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> pants are just <UNK> <UNK> although the real scotland may be just as colourful if you ever go there don't expect to be given much of a the chance to dance out <UNK> with the locals also don't attempt to <UNK> local opinion through the otherwise fine art of <UNK> br br there are a couple of <UNK> singing and dancing scenes but the plot is far too cheesy and linear and the dialogue is often too weak i also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a <UNK> 18 <UNK> century scottish village in the <UNK> rather than gay new york city maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left <UNK> maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump br br watch it for the fine alternative reality view of what a christopher <UNK> day parade in scotland would look like on <UNK> other than that i'd only recommend it to hollywood <UNK> <UNK>
<START> don't waste time reading my review go out and see this astonishingly good episode which may very well be the best columbo ever written ruth gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murders her son in law to avenge his murder of her daughter columbo is his usual <UNK> <UNK> and far <UNK> than he seems self and this particular installment features fantastic chemistry between gordon and falk ironically this was not written by <UNK> creators <UNK> or link yet is possibly the <UNK> most thoroughly original and twist laden columbo plot ever utterly satisfying in nearly every department and <UNK> with <UNK> and witty dialogue and thinking truly unexpected and inventive climax tops all 10 10 seek this one out on netflix
<START> if you want to see intelligent philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential watch waking life which is brilliant what the do we know is all over the place in its focus poorly directed poorly written poorly acted utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying it wasn't thought provoking or entertaining in the slightest the inclusion of that rambling freak <UNK> in this film is reason enough to avoid it isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman <UNK> some 2 000 year old <UNK> god or something what a <UNK> that old chick is and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was the people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again
<START> the school nerd marty simon <UNK> is sexually <UNK> by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion set by them also where his face is <UNK> by acid years later all the <UNK> get invited back to the high school since closed for a reunion what they didn't know is that marty is <UNK> them back to kill them then a storm starts they're locked in the school and marty starts to take revenge br br pretty silly the murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school but that's about it the <UNK> inflicted on <UNK> are more than cruel he's stripped has his head <UNK> in a toilet and gets burnt and are just uncomfortable to watch considering <UNK> committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity there is full frontal of <UNK> surprising for any movie but one girl decides to take a bath alone after they know a killer is wandering around after them and then there's the couple that has to have sex this is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can <UNK> himself to them it ends with a twist which had me <UNK> and rolling my eyes then another twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the tv the acting is bearable not good but bearable caroline <UNK> is in this too she's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress br br this gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere otherwise it's run of the mill and forgettable <UNK> tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves
<START> i'd waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it there are a lot of great things to the film for a start the acting its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work this and the constantly gripping and interesting script with a nice sorta <UNK> feel to it give the film a real solid <UNK> add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner it has my favorite kind of gore too supernatural and <UNK> also the characters of marcus the angry <UNK> <UNK> and daisy his mentally retarded lover <UNK> are genuinely <UNK> and unnerving at times and give a far out anything goes sense of morbid grown up <UNK> which works well with the frequent <UNK> overtones this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce my only <UNK> was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone but it still works so on the whole i'd really recommend this to serious horror buffs
<START> it's not so much that spontaneous <UNK> had little potential indeed the under explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and for at least the opening half this tobe hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy <UNK> horror can but somewhere between brad <UNK> on again off again performance and the overly intricate plot this would be thriller loses its way br br <UNK> featured here before his built in horror fan base had <UNK> is average guy sam of course average guys don't stay average for long in horror movies so after a well done origin outline we see <UNK> various body parts start to <UNK> soon he's <UNK> other people too much to the <UNK> of gal pal lisa played <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> br br while the title of the film implies a fire happy monster on the loose director hooper <UNK> to make sam an unwilling killer this approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack but it also <UNK> us from truly <UNK> the human <UNK> we're left wondering whether this would have worked better as a straight up villain versus everyone effort ala nightmare on elm street br br spontaneous <UNK> is a pretty <UNK> effort when all is said and done it will carry added appeal for <UNK> fans and those who can't get enough 1990s horror be it good bad or in between but only on a slow night
<START> the <UNK> year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and <UNK> known historical <UNK> in british history on the one hand her story lacks the <UNK> of earlier <UNK> thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that <UNK> because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking <UNK> director jean marc <UNK> who has only until recently remained in the <UNK> shadows of the industry here takes victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy it's a story that feels extremely humble considering its <UNK> background and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that <UNK> it from the usual fare br br taking a very direct and focused approach that <UNK> in on a brief five or so year period between her <UNK> and marriage to albert the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a <UNK> <UNK> of such a <UNK> entire life <UNK> instead <UNK> to show one of the lesser known <UNK> of victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more <UNK> known <UNK> the result is a feature that may <UNK> historians thanks to its relatively <UNK> regards to facts and the like yet never to let document get in the way of <UNK> a compelling story writer julian <UNK> sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly <UNK> yet convincing portrayal <UNK> takes this and runs making sure to fully <UNK> on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching br br a major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early <UNK> regal britain to life with a <UNK> realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume designs sets hair styles lighting and photography <UNK> the <UNK> background inherent to victoria's story without ever over <UNK> it indeed while watching <UNK> interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the <UNK> that <UNK> the visual element and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate <UNK> script <UNK> the works of <UNK> and <UNK> into victoria and <UNK> story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with but also <UNK> to the work with an <UNK> and <UNK> that echoes composer <UNK> <UNK> original work just as well br br yet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and <UNK> costumes that <UNK> every scene the single most important factor <UNK> indeed to most period <UNK> the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally <UNK> ensemble of <UNK> both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that between the sweet budding romance of victoria emily blunt and albert rupert friend and the somewhat <UNK> struggles of her <UNK> and the like <UNK> by a terrific mark strong and paul <UNK> the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to <UNK> screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these <UNK> br br in the end it's hard to fault a work such as the young victoria it's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a <UNK> restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable <UNK> never seems to be <UNK> for <UNK> nor does he seem content at making a run of the mill <UNK> piece for <UNK> somewhere within this gray middle ground lies the young victoria sure to <UNK> to genre fans and those a little more <UNK> by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human br br a review by jamie robert ward http www <UNK> net
<START> this i think is one of the best pictures ever made it's so pure and beautiful it really touched me i'm glad david lynch proved that a film doesn't necessarily need <UNK> a <UNK> complicated plot or flashy images way to go dave i'd like to see <UNK> do that
<START> during a kurt <UNK> celebration in brooklyn where do we go from here was finally <UNK> for a screening it is amazing that a motion picture from any era that has <UNK> gershwin <UNK> can possibly be missing from the screens the score stands tall and a cd of the material with gershwin and <UNK> only <UNK> its merits which are considerable yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them <UNK> is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy and fred macmurray cannot quite grasp the material then too the <UNK> segment is <UNK> written but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies joan leslie and june <UNK> both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work as a world war ii <UNK> to our country's history albeit in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits
<START> this movie was exactly what i expected not great but also not that bad either in my opinion <UNK> movies aren't scary enough so that's why i already knew i was going to be bored throughout the entire film sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room but nothing we all haven't already seen i guess i didn't like it because i thought there were too many twists and turns happening it got old and repetitive i also didn't understand if all the things cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not there is no explanation for any of the events that occurred the movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about what i did like was the special effects other than that there wasn't much enjoyment from it maybe its just me but i thought this was below average
<START> well what can i say br br what the <UNK> do we know has achieved the nearly impossible leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as the <UNK> the <UNK> master <UNK> and so fourth it will go down in history as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety and that ladies and gentlemen is impressive indeed for i have seen many a bad movie br br this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two <UNK> parts <UNK> between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti <UNK> to survive and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly <UNK> their new <UNK> pseudo philosophy basically if you start your day off <UNK> to the likes of <UNK> and kenny g this movie is for you if you have a sense of humor a crowd of people who know how to have fun and a <UNK> portion of good <UNK> then this movie is for you as well otherwise stay away take my word for it br br the first thing that struck me about what the <UNK> do you know is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap <UNK> on camera complete with pink heart effects computer generated <UNK> across the screen and other <UNK> silliness who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me i guess this is what too much kenny g does to you the movie was <UNK> with cheesy <UNK> the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via over the counter video editing <UNK> but never would because it's just way too ridiculous br br the script was obviously written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever not only were all the characters and conversations <UNK> and contrived beyond belief but the writers felt like they had to <UNK> every relevant piece of information or rather <UNK> which is what most of this movie was all about all the way down your throat well given the target audience that may not have been too bad of an idea the main character for example spends half the movie popping <UNK> apparently though it was deemed not convincing enough so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout which refer to her anti anxiety <UNK> specifically just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her <UNK> pain and suffering with little white <UNK> she takes whenever she feels down the acting well i've seen better acting in ed wood movies and no this is not an exaggeration heck the little play i was in when i was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this it really did br br the story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads a strange mix of <UNK> scientists <UNK> doctors and self <UNK> <UNK> go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an explanation for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by <UNK> in the experience of life reality you see is a <UNK> field of a bunch of different possibilities and is only set in stone once you the <UNK> chose to notice it what happens when more than one <UNK> <UNK> they didn't say but then again who cares listen to <UNK> <UNK> observe and you shall be god and nobody gives a damn about such silly and <UNK> things as critical thinking logic etc all reason is immediately <UNK> as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a <UNK> shift and go down the rabbit hole furthermore the <UNK> <UNK> principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities parallel <UNK> and such br br speaking of rabbit holes the <UNK> <UNK> the movie all of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes i'm not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing but one thing i'm certain of is that it somehow involves <UNK> sex actually the movie is extremely anti sex throughout sex is presented as dirty ugly and anti <UNK> br br in any case the talking heads talk the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic <UNK> and proceeds to walk around with an even <UNK> look in her <UNK> over eyes than she started with br br i want 2 hours of my life back br br here's a couple of random quotes which i happened to remember br br what i think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me and that which i used to consider real is <UNK> a lot less real than the unreal some talking head on the <UNK> of quantum physics br br what does it take for one man to have an <UNK> it takes just one thought nothing changes on the outside all the changes are within an yet he has an <UNK> some self <UNK> <UNK> head of her own school of enlightenment br br while looking at herself in the mirror i hate you i hate you you're fat you're ugly i have you main character the fat and ugly photographer
<START> i <UNK> seeing this movie and i understand why it was not a big hit in theatres october sky feels and looks oh so familiar and it is all plot <UNK> and emotions have been explored before in other films and possibly even better but despite it's <UNK> and resistance to all <UNK> hollywood this movie is winning and likeable at every turn br br <UNK> is the inspiration for this journey of the heart mind and soul just as the characters from steven <UNK> musical <UNK> we roll along stood <UNK> <UNK> their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation what do you call it you call it a miracle <UNK> has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale while jaded <UNK> of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event homer <UNK> sees <UNK> as his ticket out of a life in the mines br br masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy homer and his pals seem fresh and new especially affecting are subplots concerning <UNK> <UNK> young school teacher remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship also remarkable is the father son <UNK> that anchors the film perfectly played all around even <UNK> mom gets her moment without cliche or <UNK> her ultimatum to her husband is both <UNK> and <UNK> myrtle beach says it all br br a major video chain i despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll <UNK> your money for once i agree with them you'll never look at the october sky quite the same again br br
<START> there is a bit of a spoiler below which could ruin the surprise of the one unexpected and truly funny scene in this film there is also information about the first film in this series br br i caught this film on dvd which someone gave as a gift to my roommate it came as a set together with the first film in the blind dead series br br this movie was certainly much worse than the first la <UNK> del terror <UNK> in addition many of the features of the first movie were changed significantly to boot the movie was dubbed in english the first was subtitled which i tend to find distracting br br the concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the knights <UNK> was involved in <UNK> and secret <UNK> upon discovery of these crimes the local <UNK> put the <UNK> to death in such a manner that their eyes can no longer be used thus <UNK> them from returning from hell to exact their revenge we then jump to modern times where because of some event the <UNK> <UNK> from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villagers whose <UNK> messed them up in the first place of course since the undead knights have no eyes they can only find their victims when they make some sort of noise br br the <UNK> were a <UNK> order from about the <UNK> century coming out of the <UNK> they were only around for about 150 years before they were <UNK> in the early <UNK> by the <UNK> and others because they were <UNK> there were always rumors about their <UNK> particularly for <UNK> also because of the way the society was organized you didn't necessarily have church officials <UNK> things which meant they didn't have an inside man when things <UNK> up and because of the nature of their trials they were tortured into <UNK> the order was strongest in france but did exist in <UNK> and spain where the movies take place br br where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin breast shots here of course this is a horror film after all and then once the knights come back to life they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood in this sequel this all disappears you still have the same scene <UNK> not the same footage of them <UNK> the virgin but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that thus when they come back they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death which i have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience there's also a time problem in the first film the dating is much closer to the <UNK> where here they are now saying it is the 500 <UNK> of the <UNK> burning these guys at the stake which would date it around <UNK> and the way that the <UNK> lose their eyes is much less interesting as well in the first they have them <UNK> out by <UNK> now they are simply burned out and in quite a ridiculous manner br br oh yeah and maybe it was just me but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie <UNK> in this film despite having died not really a problem since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a <UNK> but odd none the less br br the highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the <UNK> the child's father had already been <UNK> by this rich man into making an attempt to get the <UNK> so he walks out and tells her to find her father it comes somewhat out of the blue and is easily the funniest scene in the film of course why the child doesn't die at this point is beyond me and disappointed for horror fans br br i couldn't possibly recommend this film to anyone it isn't so bad that it becomes funny so it just ends up being a mediocre horror film the bulk of the film has several people <UNK> up in a church each making various attempts to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded when the film ends you are not surprised at the outcome at all in fact quite disappointed if you are into the novelty of seeing a spanish horror film see the first movie which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected <UNK>
<START> warning review contains slight spoilers br br there's a parallel universe out there where gone in 60 seconds is a dark edgy controversial independent movie unfortunately in this dimension gone is a flashy vacuous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> starring nicolas cage br br for reasons not really worth getting into he and his large number of <UNK> have four days to steal fifty expensive cars only one of which has an alarm this crew consists of the guy with the funny shaped ears who's <UNK> to be the new superman a guy who <UNK> electricity in the x files an ex professional <UNK> and two token black men br br their enemies are cops rival car thieves and <UNK> from cracker his <UNK> accent suitably <UNK> and <UNK> for american audiences who are now used to that sort of thing since daphne in <UNK> there's also angelina jolie who gets no character save to be a <UNK> to men's sexual desires she and cage are supposed to be old flames which is odd as they never have anything approaching a normal conversation in all of the film's overlong <UNK> running time br br in fact characterisation is so poor that whenever anyone has a moment a <UNK> plays in the background to <UNK> the emotion it's no spoiler to reveal that <UNK> jones who <UNK> his famous paul <UNK> hand ball <UNK> and is quite menacing when silent only gets one line not because his inability to speak is integral to the plot but because his <UNK> <UNK> up of the film's dubious morality after appearing mute the whole way through is funny allegedly after he struggles through it in his not quite acting but it'll do london <UNK> cage <UNK> i always thought you were from long island my <UNK> as you might imagine were well and truly <UNK> br br in fact humour is the most undeveloped aspect from the <UNK> comedy policeman to the two token black characters this sees the biggest aspect of hollywood take hold why is it that a black man cannot appear in a major motion picture without being constantly aware of his skin tone and endlessly refer to it the younger man who like the elder <UNK> talks for the whole duration <UNK> us black people don't like the cold we're <UNK> people he then goes on to express an urge to smoke a joint and watch roots he is of course <UNK> the image of black people but how funny is that his older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself and thereby his colour in third person my black ass this my black ass that does anyone know any black people who actually speak like that thought not br br the film's soundtrack is played almost non stop and with increasing volume some of the tracks especially apollo <UNK> don't stop the rock so loud they're actually more <UNK> than the sound effects and dialogue the <UNK> system even <UNK> the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different films running together no background music concept here it's the <UNK> equivalent of trying to watch a film while someone at the back of the cinema has their <UNK> turned up full blast keep that music down young man br br this isn't the worst film in the world and in many ways i enjoyed it it's just that it's predictable lazy and witless with minimal effort in its construction apparently box office expectations are considerably down for this movie after being force fed junk for several years it appears the general public are starting to wake up to the fact
<START> what more could i say the americans totally hated it because the u s cut was so bad although you could <UNK> the underlying <UNK> in it br br talking about the u s theatrical release along with the newly released <UNK> ray disc version it's faster and <UNK> than hk cut the background <UNK> were all changed from the dark grim hk <UNK> to hip hop <UNK> and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out though the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor's voice and tone but the problem is <UNK> <UNK> black mask the movie was designed and meant to be dark grim super disturbing and totally gruesome very unfortunately the u s release just <UNK> the cream they wanted which in return completely changed the movie's <UNK> hk release was rated 18 to be even more comical and amateurish br br now let's talk about the original hk release this movie is like a hidden gem a prototype for the whole matrix tide and era the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit old school among hk movies however the style the movie created was a unique blend of <UNK> and pop culture with all the leather black costumes and <UNK> this movie features a batman like superhero in a black mask against a run of the mill gang of <UNK> super soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss yes it sounds like <UNK> of a retarded child but it works it's so impressive that the whole movie's gonna give you nightmares featuring <UNK> fighting a bloodbath battle in leather <UNK> in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg 13 rating but without jet li and liu <UNK> <UNK> and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship and did i happen to mention <UNK> <UNK> her <UNK> kick was totally cool even <UNK> than the villain boss because she didn't use a <UNK> for all the fighting did i mention she was also smoking hot anyway there are a lot of things to like about the movie br br however the movie also suffered from a lot of problems first off it's a mediocre script made at its best potential which means this production team deserved a better screen writer there are a lot <UNK> in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far fetched and don't totally make senses to the audiences us version was even worse because all the character developments were cut anyway you can't ask too much out of a comic inspired action movie also this movie is entirely <UNK> for children i won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old it's <UNK> with disturbing <UNK> including blood gore <UNK> <UNK> costumes extreme brutal violence and so on along with the style of the movie it can be called a wet dream for heavy metal rock music fans and action fans the u s cut was <UNK> but if you want to see it see the hk release for what it is 7 10 status inspiring hidden <UNK> adult
<START> a mix of comedy romance music action and horror a <UNK> this is one of the reasons people rave about hong kong cinema if you're looking for something totally original look no further entertainment at it's peak
<START> i like silent films but this was a little too moronic as much as i wish i could say that it was worth the hour i stood up i can't i don't think any version of the movie even comes close to the book and don't try it out on kids they might freak and the lady who played <UNK> how old was she <UNK> i know the labor laws were different back then but come on people
<START> if you want to learn the <UNK> of quantum <UNK> spend your 9 on a used <UNK> not this movie i'm a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy <UNK> aid for <UNK> to <UNK> br br i don't think the directors really got any point across but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several 1 science can explain everything we do meaning that our lives are <UNK> 2 science can't be used to explain everything we do meaning that we have free will 3 science is like really cool brother 4 we are god 5 the world exists only in our minds 6 sarah norman is a tough role to follow and 7 here put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really <UNK> stuff
<START> there has never been anything like it that's for sure this episodic seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole and as such it is not a movie about <UNK> gary <UNK> cross dressing sensation it is very self <UNK> a film about how the filmmaker <UNK> to <UNK> gary for harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular <UNK> of guilt and <UNK> he's trying to <UNK> for his sins yes gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired through <UNK> commentary and convention <UNK> such hollywood narrative <UNK> as the best friend and the <UNK> happy ending two different ones with a telling <UNK> in the glover version and turning them to his own very personal uses so while <UNK> it remains a movie about gender and difference the structure <UNK> that it is also a movie about movies but on an almost <UNK> level of complexity there is just so much going on in telling and re telling this story harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row and he doesn't miss the opportunity to make something of it immensely moving and as profound as camp ever gets
<START> there was nothing about this movie that i liked it was so obviously low budget with bad lighting and camera work almost like blair witch project only it wasn't supposed to be that way there wasn't really much to the plot and the movie just drug on and on i actually fast <UNK> through the last 1 3 of the movies but that did not help matters much it looked like it might be good from the box but i must say again nothing about this movie even <UNK> good no good actors the special effects were so fake the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible on my own personal scale i give this movie a 0 of 10 <UNK>
<START> a guy thing tries to capture the feeling of there's something about mary or meet the parents but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting room rejects of those two films thankfully i rented it on a 5 day rental because i couldn't sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time br br the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for paul's <UNK> the <UNK> at the save mart was great but the script writing is absolutely horrible the dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight gag is stuck in for no good reason plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need br br don't get me wrong slapstick humor is great when it's <UNK> done as in the other films i mentioned but this movie simply misses the mark too bad as i love julia stiles ten things i hate about you was great but even that couldn't help me sit through this terrible movie save your dollars and go rent there's something about mary one more time
<START> i have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour i was really confused about who was who for example bill <UNK> character had long hair and was wearing a jacket then when all the males arrived at camp it turned out there was a character who looked like bill <UNK> but wasn't i said where's bill <UNK> then there was a guy with his girlfriend he said she was 21 this was supposed to be a 20 year reunion of the camp director's alan arkin most memorable later on this same girl was <UNK> and talking about her camp experiences that made no sense she would have been one years old that said the movie turned out to be pretty good kevin <UNK> was the nice guy who was always being <UNK> one guy was a complete <UNK> and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend alan arkin was interesting as an old style camp director who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth the best part was that none of the grown up <UNK> were <UNK> in life none of them had very great careers this seemed very real life the movie was compared to the big chill in some ways it wasn't as exciting as the big chill but it was a lot more realistic so even though the beginning is not promising the movie ended up turning into a pretty good one
<START> this movie is being shown over and over on cable lately so br br there is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight over either luke wilson or the equally vapid <UNK> in this movie the female actresses are very cute and that's the only reason to watch this movie i suppose it is <UNK> that <UNK> even <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> friend is around but well that is what we get br br neither of the female leads would ever ever talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes what we get is them <UNK> and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in friday the 13th 4 dead
<START> william <UNK> was to have directed this adaptation of moss <UNK> hit broadway play with music <UNK> poster <UNK> but his own military <UNK> <UNK> and it went to a most unlikely <UNK> george <UNK> the women's director has a sure touch on the many documentary like sequences of air <UNK> training and he <UNK> it with more <UNK> humanity than the genre generally allowed particularly in wartime sure the gee <UNK> and entirely white save for one <UNK> chinese american <UNK> bunch of <UNK> are <UNK> and more wholesome than in real life and the <UNK> about home and mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick but it's efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring notable too for the all military male cast several of whom didn't <UNK> for years <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> o'brien martin <UNK> red buttons in drag as an andrews sister peter <UNK> hayes karl malden kevin mccarthy gary <UNK> lee j <UNK> and don taylor also for a very early glimpse of judy <UNK> who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as <UNK> worried sick brooklyn <UNK> too bad its rights are in a <UNK> and the only print anyone knows of is <UNK> evidently after <UNK> century fox released it to considerable success the rights <UNK> to the army and if there's a good <UNK> print out there it probably lies somewhere in the <UNK> of the <UNK> it's <UNK> and corny in spots but it also captures the <UNK> of military training and the <UNK> of war vividly and it deserves to be more widely seen
<START> this film is really terrible terrible as in it is a waste of <UNK> minutes of your life special effects are so terrible the acting wasn't convincing br br its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about blood surfing blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a <UNK> foot crocodile <UNK> there holiday the sharks don't look real the crocodile is even worse and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time br br a pointless terrible film thats not worth seeing
<START> for those that were interested in knowing how exactly humanity came to be <UNK> in big red <UNK> that make me <UNK> <UNK> there is the duo of the second renaissance shorts i'm not exactly sure why they are split into two parts especially since they're credited as one on the dvd and are these shorts viewed on any other format but the dvd but they're informative even if they have a few gaps br br what really makes this first part stand out from the second part and the rest of the animations as well is the parallels it shows between robot <UNK> and civil rights graphic <UNK> to slavery <UNK> concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the million man march and <UNK> god complex in fact god is never really <UNK> by these shorts instead replaced by man's own image br br as far as the shorts go in the collection the second renaissance part i is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion it's a <UNK> and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become the architect of its own destruction some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature but then again that's basically what most of the matrix series has done and it's been a driving force behind its success br br <UNK>
<START> sean you know i think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world but i can't <UNK> you for this comedy just isn't your strong suit br br however it wasn't all your fault some of the stuff was just too hard to understand alfred lynch did a decent job but you gotta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning br br once again sean i apologize
<START> the one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested as often they did a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive in screens claude <UNK> is actually an <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> who worked in films for years this one's quite hard to find anymore i'd love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day but don't remember particularly impressed way back when chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to u s theatres and video but oh that one sheet still a gem of my later horror collection
<START> pet sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a stephen king novel mary <UNK> does a great job with this film and manages to bring across king's creepy story pretty well most people may avoid this but they should check it out
<START> i went to see this movie twice within a week and can only sum it up in one word which i normally don't use lightly wonderful in my view the best movie ever made who deserves oscars and other awards if not this swedish crew who have created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film when everything that is said and left <UNK> throughout the story is drawn together just as the character of daniel <UNK> evokes so many sentiments and long repressed feelings within the people around him the movie does the same to its viewers you walk out with your head <UNK> and your heart feeling full great stuff next time you ask yourself what is the meaning of life perhaps think about how you feel after a <UNK> experience like as it is in heaven happy content <UNK> to say it with virginia <UNK> mrs <UNK> such moments are enough
<START> when i read the summary of the movie something like what happens when a man gets powers of a god and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength i though that was clever and original concept casting was promising too carrey freeman aniston how can movie with a good idea and good actors not to mention costs of filming can be bad it can idea is good but script and story itself is terrible bruce nolan is let's be honest a pretty mediocre journalist with not exactly great stories like a story of a giant cookie what a faux <UNK> and the <UNK> report is complete fiasco he's a man with a job he completely deserves he's not a good journalist he's a comedian considering his <UNK> with a nice home sugar sweet girlfriend and oh horror dog who is not house trained yes as soon as bruce at the beginning of the movie starts addressing god in a god why do you hate me manner average viewer must think why what's wrong with your life bruce bruce is not and definitely not the man with real problems in life most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity most people have really big problems worth of attention most people are more worth of attention that bruce who doesn't seem too human after all doesn't look even realistic too goofy and neurotic but god still <UNK> to him why though morgan freeman looks nice as a god i can't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie and what does bruce do when god gives him his powers god in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference no wait a smart kid would probably use his god powers better than bruce what does bruce do pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere parts the red soup lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street answers <UNK> via e mail and make all of them come true no more bruce please what bruce did could actually end the world but in the movie that doesn't happen because this is nice family little movie and doesn't make any sense at all not a hint of sarcasm of real humor of <UNK> of some dirty humor at least nothing just carrey playing silly which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor aniston here is understated she plays pale undeveloped character of <UNK> girlfriend grace and stays completely forgettable in this movie nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them when grace says <UNK> for bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic but completely false these two are not meant to be together i would give three stars but i doubt movie deserves a one bad script lame dialogs lack of real humor <UNK> and any sophistication as well as undeveloped characters and understated <UNK> and <UNK> roles total lack of <UNK> and sarcasm it all makes movie hardly worth but ok there were few funny moments and freeman is always nice to see in any movie so lets leave three stars
<START> savage island 2003 is a lame movie it's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting not only that the storyline and script was wretched i don't know why this movie was made i have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry this one made my blood <UNK> the situations were inane at best if i made a movie like this it would have been a short really because those <UNK> <UNK> wouldn't have been in the picture br br don't be fooled by the cover on the d v d i am an avid watcher of bad cinema but this movie is virtually unwatchable i don't mind movies being shot on d v but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable not some tired <UNK> of superior horror films sans wrong turn br br i have to not recommend this waste of <UNK> if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by br br movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1
<START> i think that most of the folks who have posted comments on this movie don't understand how to watch a movie and or have little sense of <UNK> first to <UNK> a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works together modern sensibilities demand great drama no i don't mean great setting of characters and plots but they seem to demand emotional <UNK> that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic this is a subtle movie its beauty lies in its subtlety not to be confused with simplicity neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie it is a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining <UNK> politics human weakness <UNK> you name it the world it's set in would be alien and not understood today a world where if you have it you have to <UNK> it now and <UNK> even if you only think you have it br br many people today don't understand that victorian society wasn't really victorian as people understand that term today br br this movie helps set the record straight
<START> i can't recommend this film as a date movie gary <UNK> semi <UNK> account of life lived on a south east london estate is a violent <UNK> account of one of <UNK> circles of hell frankly at the centre of it is ray <UNK> who has done this sort of character before but never as well the film opens with him <UNK> drinks at a pub bar that's all and you are already <UNK> with a sense of the frustration self loathing and <UNK> that he <UNK> in many different ways throughout the course of the movie it's an acting <UNK> br br of course the <UNK> and <UNK> need a foil in a drama such as this and <UNK> is matched by kathy burke as his long suffering wife who <UNK> and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour charlie <UNK> miles does an able turn as the <UNK> lighting <UNK> son billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for gary <UNK> directs close up on the actors <UNK> the <UNK> of their <UNK> flat <UNK> 4 10
<START> this video was my first exposure to eddie izzard we had several friends over one night and for some reason or another had channel <UNK> to hbo during the course of the evening someone by the name of eddie izzard was on i tried not to laugh too <UNK> at the first few jokes i didn't want to be held responsible for the rest of the <UNK> enjoyment of something that was obviously killing me after holding in my laughs for more than was <UNK> i let go as did the others of us we were not stoned by the way nor talking of insurance and <UNK> we were <UNK> after that the story lines the plot the bizarre yet ingenious connections throughout the sketches are nothing short of brilliance i have since been addicted to every eddie izzard piece of comedy i can get my hands on his work is sheer genius his comedy appears <UNK> he seems more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out at your house and rambling on about this or that it's <UNK> funny he gives you the impression that the joke is between you and himself the only true <UNK> of humor after all if you are disappointed in this video you have no sense of the <UNK> in humor or humour as they say in the uk
<START> well when watching this film late one night i was simple amazed by it's greatness fantastic script great acting costumes and special effects and the plot twists wow in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself br br great i would recommend this film to anyone especially if i don t like them much br br terrific
<START> 20 out of 10 this is a truly wonderful story about a wartime <UNK> and a <UNK> carpenter tom <UNK> the boy william <UNK> is <UNK> with tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious issues when he <UNK> his bed on the first night william is illiterate and frightened but somehow the two find <UNK> in each others loneliness it <UNK> that william has a talent as an artist and we see <UNK> talent as a <UNK> in an amusing rendition of <UNK> william is <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> a young jewish <UNK> also from london and along with both tom and <UNK> he finally learns to read and write and to feel a part of this small close <UNK> community just as he is <UNK> down william is <UNK> back to london by his mother and it is here we see why he is so screwed up his mother is clearly mentally sick and when tom doesn't hear from william he travels to london to look for him he finally finds him holding his dead baby sister where he has been tied up in a <UNK> after a period in hospital tom realises he must kidnap him and take him home with him the climax is a bitter sweet ending when william is told he is to be adopted by tom while at the same time learning his best friend <UNK> has been killed in an air raid in london for me one of the most moving scenes was when tom was talking to a official from the home office br br i love <UNK> <UNK> for what it's worth i think he loves me <UNK> br br it just doesn't get better that that does it
<START> there's so many negative reviews about stay away joe in here i just can't stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen here's a side you haven't heard yet br br elvis <UNK> movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason they are perfect films for a pure <UNK> because i don't have to think when i watch them that means i don't have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with i can just kick off my shoes grab a beer sit back switch off my brains and enjoy all the general <UNK> and catchy easy going rock <UNK> roll tunes from the <UNK> decade of them all br br in my books stay away joe definitely falls into the so bad it's good category now if you're like me and appreciate the trash value this is the ultimate 1960's camp experience it's so bad that it's almost <UNK> to watch and just when you think that it can't possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways in the end you're so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just don't know whether to laugh or cry in a nutshell i love it because it's so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this i still give it 1 out of 10 though once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie classic
<START> if john waters had written and directed house of 1000 corpses after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object the result would probably be something like the blood shed it's mildly entertaining for the first half hour but then it <UNK> into a sort of <UNK> <UNK> of constant screaming and people doing things to each others <UNK> with electric <UNK> knives <UNK> and <UNK> susan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is incredibly annoying and terry west elvis <UNK> is almost as bad in whatever it is he's doing in front of the camera br br maybe the best thing about the blood shed is that it won't take most viewers very long to forget about it
<START> the production quality cast premise authentic new england <UNK> <UNK> locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 3 4 star <UNK> item unfortunately all we got was a passable 2 star decent flick mostly memorable for what it tried to do bring an art house style film mainstream the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself and if well done will satisfy most <UNK> jane fonda was unable to hide her <UNK> enough to make her character believable i wondered why she wasn't doing a post <UNK> at <UNK> instead of working in a dead end factory job in <UNK> robert <UNK> character was just a bit too contrived an illiterate nice guy loser who turns out to actually be with a little help from jane's character a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edison br br this genre has been more successfully handled by <UNK> fool in the mid 90s and this year's 2003 about <UNK> i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post <UNK> and <UNK> a couple of screens at the multi cinema <UNK> for those efforts br br i'll give it an a for effort
<START> as i am always looking for something new and unique i watched this film online i thought that it would be just another b rate movie but i was amazed at the acting by the two main characters all of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed the plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story br br this movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp dumb and dumber or blood and guts this is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough <UNK> to keep it interesting br br i would prefer this movie to many a rate movies i have seen even a great number with high box office <UNK> br br i highly recommend this movie
<START> it is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels the script the acting the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling the costumes sets and pseudo medieval language are also utterly awful in an odd way i actually enjoyed this film once i had accepted that it wasn't going to be any good it seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise albeit not very believable but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films let's just hope that the lord of the rings is a bit better oh and david <UNK> <UNK> makes him look like he man it does
<START> mainly because <UNK> on 2 boasts an outrageous forty <UNK> worth of material literally taken straight out of the first <UNK> on and when you consider that the sequel only runs for <UNK> minutes that leaves you with <UNK> original <UNK> worth of film ho hum i found that deeply irritating as if viewers simply wouldn't remember the same stuff not to mention dull having to watch it all over again br br ok that complaint aside the <UNK> for <UNK> on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie which frankly over <UNK> minutes simply doesn't go far enough to making any kind of sense of the <UNK> highly convoluted storyline br br there are however some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been had it had some time to develop and some of the questions raised by the original some but not all are answered br br so in conclusion if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story go for it but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast forward button for forty minutes
<START> michael <UNK> <UNK> scottish period piece bears little connection to the sir walter scott novel of the same name br br the film opens in the scottish <UNK> with robert roy <UNK> and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of his <UNK> james <UNK> cattle the scene then switches to a sword fighting contest attended by <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shirts soft colored <UNK> <UNK> make up and conventional gestures br br <UNK> lives under the protection of a local lord named marquis of <UNK> when he enters an ill advised trade <UNK> with <UNK> he <UNK> leaves himself exposed to the <UNK> plots of <UNK> evil <UNK> the unfolding of their <UNK> is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie though it takes a <UNK> turn with a violent rape when rob roy is finally compelled to rebel against the english soldiers the action becomes well understood ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade br br liam neeson <UNK> <UNK> and passion to his character he is intelligent fair and <UNK> he carries his height with grace as the scottish <UNK> of a small community he is a loving father a passionate lover and a noble husband driven to desperate acts by <UNK> villains he'd rather die than tell a lie or <UNK> a trust br br oscar winner jessica lange gives the film class as the strong <UNK> devoted wife a proud <UNK> woman brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat <UNK> lines are filled with dignity and integrity 'i will think on you dead until my husband makes you so and then i will think on you no more ' br br john hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make <UNK> something more than a greedy marquis ruthless with money and <UNK> by the english <UNK> fashion for <UNK> he is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service honor in his view seems a quaint notion he has two <UNK> ruin the reputation of his rival the duke of <UNK> and to hunt down the fugitive <UNK> he sends his soldiers to burn the <UNK> homes to kill their people and their <UNK> br br tim <UNK> perfect <UNK> to the hero is <UNK> and strangely an <UNK> <UNK> he is a <UNK> british aristocrat a nasty <UNK> <UNK> wonderfully evil ravishing and murdering his way through the scottish <UNK> his name is <UNK> cunningham he turns out to be a liar a thief and a murderer he <UNK> himself as <UNK> a bastard abroad seeking his fortune and the <UNK> of great men and therefore can't care about anyone else love is a dung hill and i am but a <UNK> that climbs upon it to crow he even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he <UNK> for a girl br br cunningham seems pathetic he smiles <UNK> and <UNK> words with affected <UNK> but not terribly <UNK> until a muscular <UNK> insults him and we discover that he's a cool head and an expert with a sword he really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a best supporting actor nomination br br and while brian cox is suitably <UNK> as <UNK> andrew <UNK> is <UNK> rival the powerful local aristocrat the duke of <UNK> one of the few <UNK> men <UNK> meets outside his own family br br set in 18th century scotland and with an atmospheric musical score <UNK> <UNK> is really a love story between a man and his wife a <UNK> human story <UNK> <UNK> by mel <UNK> <UNK> ' that does tell essentially the same story of <UNK> <UNK> of overbearing english <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie just now not when it was released and <UNK> as best picture of the year here in israel and to <UNK> everything right now i will just say this is not a good film br br this is <UNK> <UNK> second feature film and i have to admit that his first and the tv drama he made before this picture are much better further more this is his first attempt at directing a drama the early works were comedies and were funny and effective br br the first thing you have to know if you'll ever see this film israel of the 21st century hates the <UNK> and the values it represented since the <UNK> of the state of israel the real situation of the <UNK> is very dire and some of them disappear one by one the <UNK> <UNK> word for collective was a sort of village for members only where the values of <UNK> and <UNK> were the dogma for everyday life with the change in social values with time it seems now that the <UNK> was a place where the human spirit was repressed locked within the dogma rules with no ticket out the entrance of <UNK> values and way of life in the 90's and so far made it very hard on the <UNK> to survive the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that br br but i regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the <UNK> once it was a dream of every young couple to live in a <UNK> and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment but the film shows the opposite that the <UNK> with it's <UNK> dogma was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people with crazy ideas that <UNK> the freedom of each individual within the collective this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism your <UNK> is the most important thing you must place yourself in the center and no one else but you is the matter this is the philosophy the film stands for and that's just it's first sin br br if you disagree with me on the political side i'm sure you will agree that the acting the tone of the film it's script and it's direction are the four sins that follow the film has no real visual text and none of it's shots is something to remember it is also very delicate a <UNK> that is no more than artsy <UNK> attempt to <UNK> emotions which do not surface not in the film and not with the viewer it brings nothing but boredom br br can someone please explain why this film won so many <UNK> maybe because it shows that israel is in line with the rest of the world hating <UNK> and human values or maybe it shows that israel is a delicate place not giving in to <UNK> and <UNK> that we are basically very human and good people capable of emotions especially when they are fake ones just like capitalism expects us to be or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of israeli cinema in recent years a lie that <UNK> the justification of the existence of the jewish state no matter what the answer is it's not a good one not for the world not for human values and not for the jews
<START> tim gary daniels wants desperately to break into serious television <UNK> when a job he <UNK> for goes awry he is fired his beautiful but empty girlfriend elizabeth <UNK> says <UNK> too coming home tim is <UNK> to discover his house has an <UNK> visitor christopher lloyd from the planet mars calling him uncle martin tim soon tries to help his new friend <UNK> life on earth but martin gets in trouble wherever he goes from the bathroom to the <UNK> room and more lovely <UNK> <UNK> hannah finally sees an opportunity to make time with tim but the course of true love does not run smooth in this case either soon everyone in television is stalking tim hoping for a story about a true alien what's a man to do for those who loved the old television show of the same name with bill <UNK> and ray <UNK> this film is not worthy to tie the proverbial boots its truly undeniably awful with no plot and a <UNK> on supposed special effects which fall flat too daniels is okay as the <UNK> but lloyd is simply terrible as the alien overacting up a storm the rest of the cast is adequate as are the costumes set and production details even if your children see the cover and beg for this film convince them to pick out another flick at the video store be assured kids and adults will find this movie a <UNK> bore so <UNK> for a night at the museum or around the world in 80 days instead
<START> i couldn't believe this terrible movie was actually made at all with the worst actors you could find the worst script written mark frost <UNK> mitchell and by far the worst waste of time in viewing i won't <UNK> the story as it's really not worth it but i will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story as to the story it is very hard to believe that this <UNK> crazy <UNK> could actually do what she did that in reality the wife couldn't defend herself against a little <UNK> of a thing that the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all that the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the <UNK> blank to shut up and the final result of the film is an insult to justice movie <UNK> and the male species the theme of this mess is let women do as they wish kill whom they want defend the killer and get away with it while the guy <UNK> in jail the innocent victim hard to believe that <UNK> mitchell the director and a man would even want to make this <UNK> br br as to the acting jordan <UNK> the killer is awful a loony <UNK> who does <UNK> during her murder trial is this allowed in court she bored me to the <UNK> one more look of her <UNK> her eyes and <UNK> how innocent she was and i'd throw up she's not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife the husband played on one level by vincent <UNK> just seems to look and act stupid most of the time he was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him the worst by far was holland taylor as the defense <UNK> she over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice if she would cross examine me anytime i'd have told her to go take a <UNK> everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do so br br i wish i could give this film a zero rating however we are forced to start with 1 too bad let's not have anymore painful watching films like this lifetime can do better then this i know it br br this is a <UNK> made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake as soon as i saw the bimbo jordan <UNK> i knew i'd seen it before and didn't like it or her i not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like <UNK> mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick <UNK> anyone see that her his message is that sickness pays being ill and going around killing people is okay with this director writer totally making the male species idiots well this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful we're not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie which in this person's mind deserves to be <UNK> br br and again this loser is shown why can't you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo jordan <UNK> again and again get her off tv films and out of sight she's just terrible in every sense of the word <UNK>
<START> this movie is just bad bad bad bad now that i've gotten that out of the way i feel better this movie is poor from beginning to end the story is lame the 3 d segment is really bad freddy is at his cartoon character worst thank god they killed him off and who wants to see <UNK> and tom arnold cameos br br the only good thing in the movie is the little bit of <UNK> that we're given on freddy we see he once had a family and we get to see his abusive alcoholic father alice cooper br br other than that all bad there are some quality actors in here lisa zane and <UNK> <UNK> and they do their best but the end result is just so bad the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i can't ever get back
<START> well let me just say something about these actors they really were a good decision and from experience having actors really brings the dialogue to life if you walk into this even fifteen minutes late you'll be in for a shock the movie will have already began you don't want to miss the first few jokes assuming you came to not miss any jokes br br wow i have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending not to be harsh i mean i loved it but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped but i'm getting ahead of myself lets start with the very start of it when it began the plot outline goes like this there is this man and not to give away any spoilers spoiler alert he hasn't had any sex ever they use this plot device to set the story moving and there are intentionally or not it could go either way some funny situations had by the main characters some containing irony and jokes and awkward situations you know br br the director uses the <UNK> in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog some music and jokes to make a funny movie designed as a comedy where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between i went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what i already knew about it and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy ten stars
<START> some have praised atlantis the lost empire as a disney adventure for adults i don't think so at least not for thinking adults br br this script suggests a beginning as a live action movie that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore the crack staff of many older adventure movies has been done well before think the dirty dozen but atlantis represents one of the worse films in that <UNK> the characters are weak even the background that each member <UNK> out seems stock and awkward at best an <UNK> medicine man a <UNK> mechanic whose father always wanted sons if we have not at least seen these before we have seen mix and match quirks before the story about how one companion <UNK> played by don <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> went from flower stores to <UNK> totally unconvincing br br only the main character milo <UNK> a young atlantis obsessed academic voiced by michael j fox has any depth to him <UNK> search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him the opening scene shows a much younger milo <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> as his grandfather places his <UNK> helmet on his head br br and while the characters were thin at best the best part about atlantis was the voice talent perhaps <UNK> depth is no <UNK> than <UNK> charm commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner although rourke is a pretty stock military type garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery <UNK> vocal performance is the high point i'm sorry to say leonard <UNK> dying king is nothing more than obligatory additionally don <UNK> as the <UNK> expert <UNK> <UNK> was also notable for one or two well done funny lines but i've always liked father <UNK> <UNK> anyway br br also well done was the computer animation the background animation that is the character animation has not been this bad for disney since the <UNK> that drove don <UNK> out the door the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even <UNK> aside from landscapes buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress br br the plot was the worst some say hackneyed or trite i'm not so sure about that any <UNK> plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint so the treatment is the thing and atlantis obviously lacks that br br i cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section the plot was bad the <UNK> bridges snap like <UNK> and the ending does not make sense to add to that the script and the animation is <UNK> with annoying <UNK> br br spoilers br br 1 right at the beginning when milo reveals that <UNK> or <UNK> symbols have been wrongly <UNK> and the coast of ireland should read the coast of <UNK> we begin to have problems the writers of the script would need to know the british take for <UNK> or <UNK> as ireland and completely ignore the older latin term <UNK> but more than this they need to know of the <UNK> conspiracy to call the <UNK> island <UNK> and the <UNK> island <UNK> br br by making it the matter of a <UNK> <UNK> letter the writers have doomed themselves to <UNK> a <UNK> version of english and a post roman date on the script since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its <UNK> cave and without visible clues and less technology than milo had made the <UNK> far less <UNK> br br 2 the <UNK> <UNK> could not be written before the sinking of atlantis or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying in the king's eye it must have been written after the sinking but without even the technology that <UNK> expedition had how the heck did anybody get by the <UNK> so how could it know more about anything after that and why would it be written in <UNK> br br automatic writing and <UNK> or <UNK> travel can explain these things however <UNK> and <UNK> travel do not require the shepard to write in <UNK> so it's got to be some sort automatic writing since <UNK> left in atlantis can read it must be the spirits of the crystal <UNK> messages to the surface this would have made more sense but could also have been explained within the movie milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life appeared in dreams etc this needed to be explored in the movie br br 3 the <UNK> should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages no one expects that the original <UNK> europeans would be able to <UNK> in europe anymore than <UNK> would understand that hard c s or their day became french <UNK> s <UNK> like sh s no less br br 4 current <UNK> were alive before the <UNK> when apparently they could read yet now are unable to read what they used to or operate similar <UNK> br br 5 the mass <UNK> points out a crucial flaw in the movie nothing seems to have happened to this culture it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival no one wants to <UNK> poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of <UNK> school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into <UNK> br br 5 <UNK> can be <UNK> for not knowing how to read or operate the <UNK> if she was so young when the <UNK> of stupidity set in but any of it hardly qualifies her father for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> almost single <UNK> wiped his people from existence killed a bunch in the <UNK> <UNK> progress not a lot killed here but he <UNK> a massive slide in culture and progress until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody if they weren't boiled in <UNK> first because the giant robots weren't there to protect them br br a <UNK> of blue electricity should have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when <UNK> tried joining her father's image to the circle of great kings of atlantis br br 6 even though milo was the only one who could read <UNK> rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of <UNK> and find a page on a crystal which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized <UNK> or <UNK> of the sun <UNK> br br 7 if <UNK> grandfather had told rourke about it it still does not explain what how rourke would have suffered from <UNK> reading it as part of the book ripping out the page which was dog <UNK> in <UNK> hand even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently only was there to tip off the viewer that something was not quite right unless the word crystal would have set <UNK> off in <UNK> head that somebody would try to steal it milo would have suspected nothing it's just thick headed <UNK> br br 8 the <UNK> double cross was not a character change we learned that <UNK> sweet audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning however the change of heart falls flat it was a change and needed to be better motivated hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with br br 9 <UNK> little bit that the <UNK> flows up over the <UNK> instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from it's <UNK> it will not flow over the protective <UNK> until it fills up all lower areas br br 10 the ending stinks and makes no sense other than to <UNK> political correctness with it's <UNK> restored atlantis is no longer a weak power needing <UNK> the giant robot <UNK> and the sky <UNK> shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might the technology is superior to <UNK> and definitely to early 20th century in the end milo needs to teach the <UNK> to read for what the whole idea is to leave their little quiet <UNK> culture alone not to send it into <UNK> br br end spoilers br br perhaps the lost world plot and the turn of the century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to <UNK> the failures i find with the film agree with this idea but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well and pulp stories is part of the crap they can't sell adults anymore anyway we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well <UNK> of the lost <UNK> lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness br br 4 out of 10 the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot it <UNK> ever lower
<START> i personally hated this movie because it was predictable the characters were stereotypical and the whole idea was a rip off of the cutting edge and <UNK> kelly br br the main character is a <UNK> girl who gets <UNK> of to a place where she doesn't belong the whole place hates her and to make things worse there is a hot guy that seemingly doesn't like her well duh the whole damn school can't stand you amazingly she finds a way to fit in and make everyone to like her plus gets the guy to fall head over heels in love with her then comes the choice where she must choose between figure <UNK> and hockey she chooses hockey then she goes to the figure <UNK> <UNK> and gets to be on the olympic team no real surprise there br br this whole movie was so damn predictable you knew what was going to happen before you even saw it this was so awful i nearly <UNK> and by the time i was finished watching it i had an awful headache and the urge to shoot myself for watching such crap don't watch this unless you are under ten or actually like crappy <UNK> movies
<START> despite some mildly thought provoking <UNK> in the script and the film's overall curiosity value fury of the <UNK> emerges as a dull uninteresting <UNK> into <UNK> saved only by the <UNK> presence of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the players including the hammy naschy are a complete write off though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolf frankenstein dr <UNK> themes to flesh out a dozen movies the plot is so <UNK> developed the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so <UNK> ridiculous at least in the english version that any <UNK> interest in the turgid proceedings is soon <UNK> br br <UNK> direction seems jerky even amateurish his staging is clumsy and <UNK> he is not helped by <UNK> over bright lighting even promising sets are so <UNK> photographed that the director's few attempts to give the audience a fright are <UNK> far in advance br br other credits fall into a similar pattern of <UNK> though the <UNK> over <UNK> music score and the laughably crude totally primitive special effects deserve special <UNK>
<START> a great concept gone wrong poor acting even worse writing after watching the first two episodes i was wondering why it ever made it to season two the characters are forgettable the writing is poor the sets are just ok the special effects are simply sad so much better has been made in the same time frame where is the money going on this one the first episode starts out interesting then goes downhill fast the <UNK> of the whole show is just silly now don't get me wrong i am a huge sci fi fan and <UNK> but this show simply doesn't cut it as i said in the beginning i am truly surprised it made it to season two so much better has been canceled after only one season jake 2 0 for example this show was just bad
<START> i have to say the first i watched this film was about 6 years ago and i actually enjoyed it then i bought the dvd recently and upon a second viewing i wondered why i liked it the acting was awful and as usual we have the <UNK> typical <UNK> in their fake costumes the acting was awful at best tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson but i've no idea what jessica lange was thinking br br the plot line was good but the execution was just poor i'm tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films braveheart was even worse though which is this films only saving grace but seriously people didn't speak like that in those days why do all the actors have to have <UNK> accents just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes i notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans and to be honest i can see why they'd like it i know they have an <UNK> for men in <UNK> however if you are thinking of buying the dvd i'd say spend your money on something else like a better film
<START> one can only imagine the film mr welles might have finished without the <UNK> of the studio this film is a flawed welles but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps america's best motion picture director of all times br br we can see the <UNK> it took on orson welles the filming of this movie the story has a lot of holes in it perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didn't trust the director br br it is curious by reading some of the opinions <UNK> to imdb that compare orson welles with the <UNK> brothers roman polanski even woody allen when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself no one was more original and creative in the history of american cinema than mr welles lucky are we to still have his legacy either in <UNK> looks such as the one the film forum in new york just ended or his films either on tape or dvd form br br rita hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here if she was a beauty with her red hair as a blonde she is just too stunning for words everett <UNK> and glenn <UNK> made an excellent contribution to the movie br br the only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to orson welles body of work was his own appearance in it had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret michael o'hara a different film might have been achieved altogether orson welles has to be credited for being perhaps a <UNK> in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street the visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work the vision and the talent he gave us
<START> a handful of <UNK> actors are <UNK> by a <UNK> creature this creature appears in about thirty seconds of <UNK> stop motion animation but oh how you will long for that <UNK> when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production <UNK> waving around an inner tube with teeth no time for terror when this movie is <UNK> halfway through by these comic relief boat rental <UNK> who suddenly become the lead characters but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness that's no fun
<START> originally i rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer and i was not disappointed that way except the plot <UNK> with the soccer scenes as a dad i suppose i was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of <UNK> but i have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays as uncomfortable as i feel with the topic in a way this emotion was a <UNK> right into the main premise of the film that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices this dilemma is introduced by a young british born teen girl <UNK> jess of east indian <UNK> who dreams of playing professional soccer the <UNK> marriage of her older sister in a traditional <UNK> marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore in a nice way her hopes and fears for her future br br the multi cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore <UNK> frustration with her parents expectations for her again no different in substance than most child parent relationships br br in summary the soccer scenes are great lots to learn in <UNK> and while i didn't need the storyline something was needed to keep the movie going
<START> this movie was made for tv so taking that into account i'm not going to rip into it as hard as i would a feature film the script is sub par but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots whether it means to be or not the acting is mostly over the top but that is true for many lower budget movies br br the aspect of this movie that i really hated though was that 90 95 of it is shot on film but in random places there will be 5 10 seconds where the footage is shot on video you can tell because there is less contrast the colors are less vivid and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second i'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film i assume this is why anyway but it is <UNK> and really makes the film look <UNK> than it had to look br br anyway i've definitely seen worse movies but i definitely wouldn't say that i enjoyed this movie and i can't recommend that anyone see it
<START> this documentary by <UNK> cooper is absolutely amazing i saw it tonight on turner classic movie channel i think i will see if i can order a copy of it on dvd the film footage doesn't look all <UNK> and choppy like you might think from <UNK> b w silent film set in iran in <UNK> the <UNK> tribe people in the documentary leave their desert home and cross a raging river men women children animals then up and over a snowy mountain pass all <UNK> it is sink or swim and climb or die in search of grass for their animals they have <UNK> <UNK> dogs horses <UNK> in one scene a man is carrying a <UNK> who is too sick to climb the mountain the children in the documentary all look happy and healthy they had such a hard life i wonder if the <UNK> <UNK> of iran still live like this makes you appreciate modern life in usa
<START> loosely based on the james j corbett biography the <UNK> of the crowd gentleman jim is a wonderfully <UNK> picture that perfectly <UNK> not only the rise of the <UNK> <UNK> that was corbett but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the <UNK> br br the story follows corbett a perfectly casted errol flynn from his humble <UNK> as a bank <UNK> in san <UNK> thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the <UNK> <UNK> champion of the world john l sullivan <UNK> <UNK> delightfully by ward bond not all the fights are in the ring tho and it's all the spin off vignettes in <UNK> life that makes this a grand entertaining picture there are class issues to overcome here perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a <UNK> or two and corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as <UNK> as his reputation does along with the quite wonderful corbett family and all their stoic humorous support <UNK> journey is as enthralling as it is <UNK> yet as <UNK> and as bold as he is he is a very likable character and it's a character that <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> he got of gentleman jim br br the film never <UNK> for one moment and it's a testament to director <UNK> walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture thank you <UNK> smith the fight sequences stand up really well and they perfectly show just how corbett became the <UNK> he was his brand of dancing rings round <UNK> fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history as the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between sullivan and corbett puts all the brutality into context and it's here where <UNK> and <UNK> becomes the outright winner and as far as this viewer goes it will do for me to be sure to be sure 9 10 for a truly wonderful picture
<START> simply great movie no doubt about it great story and superb performances be it amitabh akshay <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> hindi film industry is going shameless with <UNK> and co this movie is totally <UNK> free and therefore bound to fail in <UNK> addicted our indian society but the message and concept this movie carries are absolutely superb <UNK> <UNK> boring copy cat could have been avoided and <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> could have been used as musician i think <UNK> shah should have given little bit <UNK> touch particularly in music also <UNK> <UNK> is worst musician around and he thinks himself <UNK> but this is not the movie where is presence was required he looks only good with govinda style songs i felt some nice serious music with couple of good <UNK> or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable
<START> this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast and many memorable scenes the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents the spanish characters in the film are played by a frenchman boyer a <UNK> <UNK> a greek <UNK> and a hungarian lorre and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat despite these <UNK> the performances are all very good especially those of <UNK> and lorre but the scene in which boyer <UNK> and lorre meet and talk in wildly different accents is a real hoot and i guess seeing as how they were alone that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway it seems pretty weird that the brothers warner couldn't find any spanish speaking actors in los angeles of course hollywood has often had an any old accent will do policy my other favorite is greta garbo swedish as <UNK> <UNK> dutch who falls in love with a russian soldier played by a mexican <UNK> <UNK> maybe they should have got <UNK> for <UNK> agent he would have been great in <UNK> role or at least in <UNK> which would have saved greatly on the dark make up budget
<START> its a gem movie if anyone who hasn't seen movie <UNK> he cant understand what is going on there a <UNK> call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police don't know <UNK> him but these <UNK> do br br biggest advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time pass of songs and what u cant forget is the cool <UNK> which seems to come in very long time but u cant understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i haven't seen movie complete due to a brain <UNK> so <UNK> tell me <UNK> end if it have
<START> this movie shows us once again how genius the japanese directors are and were this movie could be seen as a sort of a silent movie <UNK> well <UNK>
<START> br br ok well i rented this movie while i was bed ridden <UNK> up on pain killers and let me say it didn't help the film any br br the film is about a man who buys a car as he is going through a <UNK> crisis he loves the car more than anything around him one day his wife decides to borrow the car since i don't want to spoil not that there was anything to spoil i shall let your imagination figure out the zany and i use that word lightly antics that follow br br i had to fight to stay awake through this <UNK> a minute sleeper of a film and i would like to say that if you are <UNK> to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous please don't it's a waste of the film it was <UNK> on br br then again i could be wrong
<START> this sequel is thoroughly uneven incoherent and rambling in plot if there really is one and tries too damned hard to be modern ridiculous out of period and character 21 st century style songs <UNK> and cute yawn there are too many <UNK> <UNK> jokes with animals the actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot even glenn close and she is normally very good <UNK> through this film <UNK> herself as the original de <UNK> and the lead from sunset <UNK> it's a film that isn't even good to look at this is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel even basic instinct 2 had a plot characterisation and acceptable acting this doesn't it is bad
<START> this film is amazing and i would recommend to child and adult alike the animation is beautiful the characters are rich and interesting and the story is captivating far better than anything the american studios were producing at the time however there is a couple of <UNK> to this statement it's a shame that disney bought the studio <UNK> back <UNK> and then <UNK> to butcher it my main point being disney re dubbed the film despite the original english version being very impressive the new cast with van der <UNK> et al ruined it and took away much of the <UNK> of the characters e g <UNK> and <UNK> went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers the original music score is also far better than the disney <UNK> it begs the question why did disney make such changes it seems to me is that by having van der <UNK> et al being cast then disney can draw in more money which is fair enough but in the process they <UNK> they film it is still a beautiful film and i would still recommend it to anyone my main <UNK> is that disney ruined a film from childhood which i loved and still love i am lucky enough to have an original japanese <UNK> with the original english dub which i am now going to guard with my life
<START> if this movie proves only one thing it's that keaton is was and always will be a comic at heart even when <UNK> bullets heading for the electric chair and getting at the wrong end of an information line in prison br br but johnny dangerously goes on to prove even more in the '80s the <UNK> boys <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were the <UNK> in the world of genre spoofs but there were several <UNK> to the throne this time amy fast times at <UNK> high <UNK> tries her hand with an amazing amount of television writers behind the script go and check br br this slap happy slapstick spoof of the 1930's cops and gag <UNK> movies throws just about every cliche for a loop and even adds a few cliches that didn't exist way back when br br and not only is the ever <UNK> keaton on hand as the johnny of the title but so are such funny guys and dolls as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> boyle dunne <UNK> <UNK> and just about every other actor in hollywood that happened to walk into the immediate <UNK> you'd be surprised by how many faces you'll recognize i know i was br br and the jokes well when they start out they come at you fast and furious like a machine gun there are too many to count in the beginning topped off with a crazy theme song by weird al <UNK> but you have to watch for when they <UNK> and they have to <UNK> a little too often br br everyone tries they seem to be having fun and i was laughing a good amount of the time in the end though there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could have been funnier not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy br br but for a slow night when there's nothing good on tv pop in johnny and be ready for some dangerously serious laughter br br eight stars check out johnny dangerously don't be a <UNK>
<START> there is indeed much to complain about this movie version of <UNK> mystical play farrell looks good in his title role but his line <UNK> frankly stink this also suffers in large part from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection the sets look phony br br there are two great strengths in this show however although the dialogue <UNK> limp the visual performances are perfect rose <UNK> as julie is little remembered today mostly for rose <UNK> in which joseph <UNK> cut down the <UNK> east of <UNK> to simply shots of her credit <UNK> stylish visual direction of the original her great beauty and simple although <UNK> performance help <UNK> some of the damage to the earth bound sections of this movie br br however one of <UNK> themes is the mystical power of love and it is the handling of the <UNK> sections that make this great from the arrival of the <UNK> train to the journey to 'the hot <UNK> h b <UNK> performance here is as always perfect br br so we have here a flawed but very interesting version i think that <UNK> 1934 version is better as well as the <UNK> scenes in the henry king version of <UNK> the watered down musical remake but i still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance
<START> this movie is maybe one of the most boring movies of 2000 that i have seen especially the music fails to create suspense when people suddenly disappear also aspects such as martial law are not treated with the necessary seriousness the story itself has problems the un could never take power over the world since the united states alone would not allow it but nations such as china russia japan etc would not either this would also play against someone trying to take over the world as <UNK> <UNK> does this reminds me of james bond movies only that those have more action naturally the movie is made for christians and only for christians and they may enjoy it since i cannot count myself a christian i find the whole idea ludicrous this prophecy furthermore seems to be if believed to be true dangerously close to other <UNK> by <UNK> for the end of the world why fear such a possibility when we can make life as good as possible here on earth without
<START> four prisoners share a single cell the <UNK> <UNK> marcus <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> idiot <UNK> buddy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches <UNK> and his little sister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the intelligent <UNK> who murdered his wife and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping after a brick falls from the wall of the cell the men discover the hidden <UNK> written by a <UNK> of <UNK> obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s is this <UNK> the secret to their escape or is there something much more sinister behind it br br i was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience i have with eric <UNK> was the dreadful one missed call 2008 which i consider to be the worst <UNK> released film i've ever seen however much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to <UNK> awful script because as i remember <UNK> direction wasn't the worst part about the film unless he chose to include the baby anyway <UNK> was a good way to get my respect back it's a french film obviously something i like and it takes place in prison which is my second favourite horror setting after <UNK> so that's two points for him before the film even starts luckily <UNK> had me once the film ended as well <UNK> is a rather deep rather complex rather compelling story of obsession and desperation the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality while it's not a terrifying film in the traditional sense the <UNK> of its power makes it pretty damn frightening the period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film i've seen in quite some time and i would <UNK> recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore br br final verdict 8 5 10 quite a bit of respect earned back by <UNK> br br note paramount picked up the rights to make an american remake surprise surprise it's due out in 2009 i'm not sure why to be honest as this doesn't seem like something that would be a big <UNK> here in the states but i've been surprised before br br <UNK> la france br br <UNK>
<START> this has got to be one of the worst <UNK> i've ever seen and i've seen a few it is slow boring amateurish not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot the actors do not act i can't blame them they have been given a script of such utter <UNK> all they can do is <UNK> through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in <UNK> br br there is not one moment in this film that rings true not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved the nicholas cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a <UNK> of compassion for him through all his <UNK> i have no doubt that i was seeing a suffering man up there but it was nicholas cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career
<START> having seen triumph of the will i can only say this movie is ghastly even <UNK> against the historically low standards of the time naturally it's all totally <UNK> and <UNK> this is what one would expect of 1930's german propaganda unfortunately the quality of the presentation itself is hackneyed and cheap it's also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary germans must've left the theater holding their <UNK> in a genre renowned for its base appeal lack of originality and <UNK> wrong <UNK> this film doesn't even qualify as bad it would have to improve significantly to <UNK> that status
<START> contrary to some people's <UNK> the women depicted in the film are not geisha they are <UNK> prostitutes living outside the most famous pleasure <UNK> and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of <UNK> era women i can't say the stories were particularly <UNK> but their charm lies in just how typical they are the themes are universal and everyday love friendship and sacrifice br br i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse the actors especially the 4 women who played the main <UNK> were a thrill to watch i'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories it's a great example of both
<START> only reason i have seen 101 <UNK> was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars i must admit that i was less than impressed with this film in this sequel cruella devil by the way <UNK> close pulls off this role very well is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour she likes all sort of animals and locks all her <UNK> away from that point we only wait until she starts having <UNK> soon enough she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world of course for herself and from fine <UNK> fur apart from <UNK> close i found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny that is fair enough as its target market is i assume children under 12 quite a good entertainment for children and families but didn't do much for me out of
<START> there are no spoilers in this review there's nothing to spoil br br no plot nothing most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some <UNK> stretch but this didn't even do that clips three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips ok so perhaps they were short on production time but they'd have been better off skipping this episode entirely what a waste of time br br i'm not sure how this got made in fact <UNK> is usually much better at <UNK> <UNK> but somehow this got through br br thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode
<START> the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is with a plot that makes your average middle school writer look good and acting which is almost as good it gets my bottom score one of tom hanks very early films where he obviously didn't have the pleasure to be real <UNK> the best special effect of the movie consists of a guy dressed up in an incredibly fake rubber monster <UNK>
<START> has there ever been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives the center of it is the romance of james stewart and margaret <UNK> who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other <UNK> as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including you've got mail the recent update of shop they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of <UNK> <UNK> rich <UNK> of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near tragic frank morgan casually and <UNK> <UNK> for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of
<START> the national gallery of art showed the long thought lost original uncut version of this film on july 10 2005 it <UNK> vital scenes cut by censors upon its release the character of the <UNK> a moral <UNK> <UNK> individual in the original <UNK> release of 1933 is here presented as a <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> her to use men to claw her way to the top also the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form a wonderful film of seduction and power hopefully there will a <UNK> of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities look for it
<START> i just don't see how a <UNK> new <UNK> film directed by jim <UNK> and featuring the acting talents of andrew stevens and a puppet could be bad it just <UNK> the mind doesn't it br br well let's make no mistake about it <UNK> strikes back is indeed a bad film <UNK> is a puppet who has been around for many centuries for reasons not fully explained until the end of the film he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son the mom's problem her main problem at least is that she has a balloon <UNK> due on her <UNK> in two weeks to the not so tiny tune of 20 000 <UNK> she can't come up with the money because she just got fired ok just is the key word in that sentence what the was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck maybe it would've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it ya think br br <UNK> has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess but there isn't a limit on the number of wishes you can make <UNK> gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall <UNK> was <UNK> it from the annoying <UNK> also uses his <UNK> skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating a baseball is hit so hard that it <UNK> the earth several times sadly those dumb parents watching the game don't think it's at all strange hmm br br anyway i'd like to wrap this up because this has already <UNK> away enough of my <UNK> as it is you'll be truly moved by the scene where leslie anne down playing the mother kicks a dog which is <UNK> at her your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills <UNK> down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be <UNK> during the summer <UNK> strikes back 's credits promised another film to follow entitled i believe <UNK> hangs ten to date the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force <UNK> 1 10
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was going to get up and leave at tape 4 but i stuck it out i now consider myself a <UNK> afghanistan come on guys who's the idiot who forgot to hide the <UNK> <UNK> i thought the lead actor george <UNK> was particularly inept apart from the bad acting and over <UNK> camera shake i thought using the events of 9 11 as a reason to make <UNK> the lunatic <UNK> all over a screen near you <UNK> and <UNK> to the victims of 9 11 using a phone call from <UNK> wife sarah supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day was appalling the camera shake didn't make me feel sick that cold hearted stunt did
<START> i gave this movie a 5 out of pure pity my intention is not to burst anyone's bubble because i've seen as i've <UNK> through other comments that this movie is quite appreciated by many well it is not worth any <UNK> and i say this because i've seen the original anime <UNK> and this movie <UNK> it deeply perhaps if you see <UNK> alone you could like it it is enjoyable due to the well choreographed battles based on fantasy more than on martial arts and i agree that their beauty is deeply enhanced but the story is nothing like the original one now i understand that when one transforms an anime manga into a movie one must make certain changes i was not expecting to see the <UNK> characters from the anime although they have a well established role and some are truly profound and well designed but i certainly did not expect to see immense and wrongly placed changes that basically ruin the entire story characters who are dramatically and <UNK> <UNK> transformed in something the public might love more perhaps for instance <UNK> who in the anime is a sweet innocent girl completely and utterly in love with <UNK> becomes a vengeful clan leader in the movie i liked the fact that the woman becomes strong and <UNK> the limitations <UNK> on her by the era we are talking about japan <UNK> century but her mood changes are unbelievable and badly written <UNK> which is one of my favourite characters in the film but who is not known for her childish and sensitive nature becomes a pathetic little girl who is not only not <UNK> in love like in the anime but is more or less worthless in the plot i could go on and on like how they made <UNK> the worst and most dangerous character in the anime exceptionally weak and unattractive or how <UNK> the leading character seems completely misplaced and confused not to mention again weak the music is beautiful and the image is astounding which was expected of a japanese movie and i appreciate it for that but do not watch this if you've seen and enjoyed <UNK> because it is just hopeless <UNK> although based on fantasy with elements of horror and largely exaggerated is splendid and has so much more depth in its characters storyline historical value and it is may i say heartbreaking <UNK> was a waste of time and i could not believe it kept on going after what was supposed to be the climax alas it pains me deeply to judge a movie so <UNK> but i advise you against it please watch the anime or at least watch the movie first and then <UNK> your image of what <UNK> really is by watching the anime otherwise you will have a <UNK> when you realize how they've <UNK> it
<START> lord alan cunningham antonio de <UNK> is a <UNK> seen early on trying to escape an insane asylum with this castle slowly <UNK> to ruin likes to kill various <UNK> who resemble his deceased wife evelyn a woman who betrayed him for another man with those red locks this <UNK> is quite wealthy and his bachelor status can be quite <UNK> he however is <UNK> by his obsession with his late wife's memory specifically her adultery he saw her naked with the lover while the memory of evelyn is almost <UNK> his whole existence alan tries his best to find true love and believes he has with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who spends most of the film naked that's probably her lone <UNK> since she isn't a very good actress who agrees to marry him after a very short <UNK> which should probably throw up <UNK> right away there's a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what he is worth br br the only real person alan can <UNK> in is his doctor from the hospital dr richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stuart there are other key characters in this film that <UNK> around alan <UNK> cousin george rod <UNK> seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victims i mean dates while holding onto hope of getting his <UNK> estate some day albert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brother is a witness to <UNK> slaughter and instead of turning him into the police <UNK> him for cash aunt agatha joan c davis wheelchair bound lives at the castle estate and is often seen <UNK> around behind <UNK> doors we later find that she is having a love affair with albert br br all that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of evelyn haunting alan someone is killing off members of the cast family that <UNK> around alan and the body of evelyn is indeed missing br br the ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after alan and <UNK> are married where is <UNK> body and will alan go over the edge i have to be honest and say i just didn't really care much for this film it's badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place it looks great on the new dvd and the rising from the grave sequence is cool but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable you really have a hard time caring for alan because he is a psychotic who is <UNK> on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity he can be quite <UNK> who commits the crime really isn't that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off there aren't but a choice few who could be doing it what happens to alan doesn't really make your throat <UNK> because you can make the argument he's just getting what he deserves those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to alan as i pointed out before aren't that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances or <UNK> they'd have that would benefit them with the collapse of <UNK> sanity then everything just comes off less than stellar i thought the editing was choppy and <UNK> but the acting from the entire cast is really below par some <UNK> help and there is a <UNK> of gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some
<START> there are two points i need to make clear right at the beginning first of all we all know what this year's <UNK> were really all about this year it was the <UNK> way of showing people that they are no racist and never have been they wanted to clear all <UNK> notions about themselves secondly it's kinda pointless to make remarks about the show because really what difference will it make but it's fun to write about it this is the year i became fed up with the <UNK> i will never watch the show again every year they do something wrong before <UNK> wins for <UNK> when they real winner should of been ralph <UNK> for sunshine if you haven't seen this movie yet watch it and you'll agree eyes wide shut when released <UNK> no nominations and as far as this year goes well the bad choices were all over the place <UNK> <UNK> gets no best director nomination are you joking a beautiful mind is up for best make up training day gets nominated the movie was awful and it seemed like washington didn't even turn in a performance all he proved was he knows how to use four letter words that's what h won the award for take away the language and i bet he was almost playing himself i liked <UNK> park i really did but why 7 nominations and how on earth could they not give it too altman i mean c'mon if there just giving the award to people to clear up any bad feelings what about altman the man has been in the <UNK> eye for <UNK> years now and no oscar there were many many things that bothered me about this year's <UNK> but i'll live with it as long as i never have to watch another show again the <UNK> and the only one of the show was when woody allen made his first appearance ever to the award show that will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the show
<START> alright i have to admit that i have never seen <UNK> and only one or two episodes of the mary tyler moore show even though i don't know anything about this duo of comedic talent i still liked this movie a lot br br mary goes back to work rose tries her luck at being a comedian <UNK> struggles with a photography career and meredith what exactly does she do again these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way when the two long time friends reunite it only makes the film better br br i was surprised about how good the writing was the little jokes thrown in by mary and <UNK> were funny the script itself was very well put together br br i had seen moore and <UNK> in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie they never seem to let me down during the run of this movie <UNK> <UNK> and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great the rest of the cast like <UNK> <UNK> and everybody else also works well together br br being that this is a reunion you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this from a non fan i still enjoyed this little get together good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good the newer version of the <UNK> theme song doesn't hurt either
<START> a guy thing may not be a classic but it sure is a good funny comedy the plot focuses on paul jason lee who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and <UNK> julia stiles lying naked in his bed before he can figure out what happened he rushes <UNK> out of his apartment because his <UNK> karen <UNK> blair is coming after that as you could imagine chaos ensues br br almost every single scene in a guy thing delivers loud laughs the funniest moments come from when paul <UNK> what could happen if he tells karen <UNK> blair is a truly talented comedian and the worst thing about this film is that she goes underused although she turns out to be more funny than <UNK> character who actually isn't that interesting of course not every comedy is perfect br br as i said a guy thing is no classic but it's not bad either 7 10
<START> okay if you have a couple hours to waste or if you just really hate your life i would say watch this movie if anything it's good for a few laughs not only do you have <UNK> topless natives but also special effects so bad they are probably <UNK> in most states <UNK> the rating of <UNK> is pretty humorous too once you see the native porn <UNK> i wouldn't give this movie to my retarded nephew you couldn't even show this to <UNK> prisoners without <UNK> the <UNK> convention the plot is <UNK> and cliché and dumb and stupid the acting is horrible and the ending is so painful to watch i actually began <UNK> salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my tv screen
<START> i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie it was winter time in <UNK> around the year 1990 a friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment winters in <UNK> can be a bit brutal and most people stay <UNK> drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television i had found this movie outside of a <UNK> store laying in a <UNK> and right away new it was a treasure it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever we spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish we watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect it is a true gem the laughs will come <UNK> and the memories last forever if you see this movie for rent in a video store steal it you won't regret it
<START> kurt russell is elvis plain and simple his dedication to this role resulted in what i think is the best movie bio ever if you're an elvis fan see it if you can br br the made for television film was made two years after <UNK> death br br one piece of advice there are two versions one at <UNK> minutes and one at <UNK> minutes the only one to watch is the longer one the shorter one has more than one hour of footage edited out it just does not work because the scenes in it are often <UNK> on the scenes that were cut br br this masterpiece takes you from elvis childhood through his <UNK> as <UNK> greatest star shelley winters and bing russell <UNK> real dad are excellent as <UNK> parents and pat <UNK> delivers a very competent <UNK> tom parker br br long live the king
<START> with all of the violence on tv and in the local news it is refreshing to have a show that has no violence or adult language yet is still entertaining my children look forward to watching with us every week each of us have a favorite chef and favorite judges we all enjoy <UNK> brown we enjoy learning about the background of the main <UNK> unique <UNK> and <UNK> we play along at home to guess who the winner will be br br it is a great hour of entertainment as well as <UNK> best of all in our <UNK> <UNK> life it is an hour the family spends together
<START> house of evil aka dance of death of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great boris karloff and directed by jack hill and juan <UNK> unlike snake people 1971 the incredible invasion also 1971 and the fear chamber 1972 which were all released after <UNK> death in 1969 house of evil was released in 1968 when karloff was still alive house of evil is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies which are without doubt all rather crappy but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are i personally prefer the fear chamber and house of evil over the other two simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies the lack of logic <UNK> the unintentional fun factor br br the odd story i don't know if i can really call it a <UNK> is set somewhere in europe in the 19th century after some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out <UNK> <UNK> karloff an enthusiastic <UNK> player invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion which is full of eerie toys his <UNK> includes lucy <UNK> <UNK> who is engaged to one of the police <UNK> investigating the murders br br i won't give away more of the story but i can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie there are some very funny moments especially some things <UNK> character says boris karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the horror genre who ever lived and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness and although or because his role is due to a poor script and and directing in no way scary it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor just like in the movie's <UNK> snake people and the fear chamber the female lead is once again played by <UNK> br br most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish the cinematography is terrible and the locations and <UNK> are beneath contempt the storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense it is the poor story and dialogue however that makes this movie so entertaining to watch house of evil may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie but it is certainly as unintentionally funny as it is bad fans of ed <UNK> movies should be very amused i personally found it hilarious crappy but entertaining nevertheless and definitely worth watching since there's boris karloff in it and due to the fun factor 3 10
<START> after i watched this movie i came to imdb and read some of the reviews which compared it to lost in translation <UNK> when i read that i immediately could see the reviewers point br br this movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme interestingly the format of the movie is nearly identical but the pacing is incredibly different 10 items rushes the viewer through the 1 day time line of the movie whereas the better planned lost in seems to stretch out over a few long days br br i'm sure some people will see this because it has morgan freeman and will be disappointed it seems his better roles now a days are supporting roles in big blockbusters rather than leading roles in sub <UNK> limited release movies and indie films
<START> here is proof of why mary pickford was america's sweetheart ' in this rather complex drama mary plays the young daughter of a <UNK> that dare to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the hill <UNK> ' the scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful she is even willing to take a bath that mary could pull this role off at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her <UNK> stature <UNK> br br tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges she does so with <UNK> not seen in many <UNK> of the time tess packs a <UNK> and is not shy about fighting with anyone why she agrees to help the hill <UNK> daughter is beyond me but she sacrifices her own happiness in order to keep a deep secret <UNK> close ups are wonderful br br danish born jean <UNK> is simply wonderful as the villain the scene in which he <UNK> a small baby is enough to make you throw <UNK> or whatever at the movie screen if forrest robinson who plays daddy <UNK> had worn a beard he would have been a match for the model used in those world war i <UNK> posters of uncle sam  wants you br br although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure <UNK> ' the film highlights choices available to us all involving making someone else happy and what it is to be a real christian recommended
<START> <UNK> of a geisha is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more like a camp drag queen satire than anything to do with real people br br the first half of the film <UNK> keeps <UNK> that <UNK> are neither prostitutes nor <UNK> that they are the <UNK> of traditional japanese beauty but other than one breathtaking dance the rest of the movie <UNK> into pretty baby in <UNK> territory or at least <UNK> and esther in the <UNK> story as all the women's efforts at art and <UNK> are about entertaining much much older drunken <UNK> men maybe it is japanese culture that is being <UNK> and not just to the american <UNK> after world war ii br br perhaps it's the strain of speaking in english but <UNK> zhang shows barely little of the great <UNK> she demonstrated in house of flying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fu and hero <UNK> <UNK> michelle <UNK> occasionally gets to project a <UNK> of her assured performance in <UNK> tiger hidden dragon <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> long only li <UNK> shows any real life otherwise i kept <UNK> charles <UNK> in various roles or even cillian murphy as in <UNK> theater particularly as the plot dragged down in cat fight after cat fight br br the supposed love story has zero chemistry mostly due to the age differences and i mostly felt sorry for ken <UNK> and hoped his hollywood pay check <UNK> for his loss of dignity as the mysterious <UNK> i remember more emotion in portrait of <UNK> as the young girl is anxious to grow up into jennifer jones to please joseph <UNK> br br we see brief glimpses of reality when the <UNK> pose with regular women as <UNK> <UNK> and as an <UNK> <UNK> zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful <UNK> dying operation the finale has little sense of <UNK> br br the score includes many chopped up traditional <UNK> with <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> ma and <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> instead of traditional <UNK> that are beautiful to listen to in <UNK> to the lovely cinematography as long as one completely ignores the plot and stiff acting br br as my mind <UNK> i wondered how the great japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story which probably would have been more <UNK> but a lot more emotional
<START> br br what is left of planet earth is populated by a few poor and starving <UNK> tag survivors they must eat bugs and insects or whatever after a poison war or something has nearly wiped out all human civilization in these dark times one of the few people on earth still able to live in comfort we will call him the all knowing big boss has a great quest to prevent some secret <UNK> <UNK> from being released into the air it seems that the all knowing big boss is the last person on earth that knows that these <UNK> even exist the <UNK> are located far away from any living soul and they are highly <UNK> by many layers of deadly defense systems br br the all knowing big boss wants the secret <UNK> to remain in their secret <UNK> <UNK> so he makes a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the <UNK> <UNK> from all of the protective systems and secret location sending people to the location of secret <UNK> makes them no longer a secret sending people to <UNK> all of the protective systems makes it possible for the <UNK> to be easily released into the air how about letting sleeping dogs lie br br the one pleasant feature of <UNK> is the <UNK> and elegant vivian wu as the <UNK> macho action team members drop off with <UNK> paced predictable timing engaging vivian <UNK> charm makes acceptable the plot idea of her old <UNK> wanting her so much she is an object of love an object of desire a very believable concept br br fans of vivian wu may want to check out an outstanding b movie she is in from a couple years back called dinner rush dinner rush is highly recommended <UNK> is not
<START> i have just seen this movie and have not read the book the good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject evolution <UNK> and your part in the world br br however the movie's <UNK> is easily broken and there is very little <UNK> between the viewer and the characters it is very clear that the book <UNK> a lot in this movie version the events that were suppose to show <UNK> taking place are almost <UNK> a lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene <UNK> a coincidence and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose br br enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to do you recall the enlightenment with keanu reeves in little <UNK> well this is nothing like that br br most scenes are poorly executed there are a lot of scenes that really don't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere br br the better actors in this movie namely hector <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> cannot save it the first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie and because they were paid more but this does not work most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all br br <UNK> does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy as always but the script does not help him at all the scene where he first tries to convince john matthew settle to join him is just bad script the execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is <UNK> bad executed the flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented br br overall this movie is a big <UNK> of time read the book i have not read it but it is probably a billion times better than this it has to be br br it is so bad that i had to write my first comment in imdb
<START> the writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable basic elements such as character development were <UNK> over at best inconsistencies also <UNK> their ugly heads a massive mansion in the middle of the rural irish countryside characters just showing up in the gardens during a <UNK> night at very convenient times i might add all in all it wasn't bad i rated it a 4 based mostly on the story and talent of alison elliott
<START> not even bob hope <UNK> by a raft of fine character actors can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy as his <UNK> timing has little which which to work the plot involves a hollywood film star named don <UNK> hope and his attempt to <UNK> military service at the beginning of world war ii followed by his <UNK> by mistake in a confused attempt to court a <UNK> daughter dorothy <UNK> <UNK> agent played by <UNK> <UNK> and his assistant portrayed by eddie <UNK> <UNK> with him and the three are involved in various <UNK> regarding training <UNK> filmed in the <UNK> california hills paramount budgeted <UNK> for this effort <UNK> some of its top <UNK> but direction by the usually reliable david butler was <UNK> and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario a shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for <UNK> by <UNK> is still born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence oddly <UNK> <UNK> is given the best lines and this veteran master of the <UNK> does very well by them dorothy <UNK> looks lovely and acts nicely as well and it is ever a delight to see and hear clarence <UNK> as her father whose voice is unique on screen or radio but there is little they can do to save this film cursed as it is with an error in script assignment
<START> bad plot bad dialogue bad acting idiotic directing the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the <UNK> script and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by <UNK> <UNK> trust me because i stuck this turkey out to the end it was so <UNK> bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourth rate spoof of <UNK> for hitler br br the girl who played <UNK> <UNK> was the only faint spark of interest and that was only because she could sing better than the original br br if you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better then watch beyond the valley of the dolls
<START> it is an almost ideal romantic anime must see for all ages but the english dubbed version is not too good perhaps the 1999 version will be better
<START> i almost made a fool of myself when i was going to start this review by saying this movie reminded me of billy elliot but then i looked up the resume of screenwriter lee hall only to find out that he was the guy who wrote billy elliot so it's mr hall who's making a fool of himself not me br br am i being a bit cruel on him no because lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters from britain don't have he has his foot in the door he has previously written a successful british movie that won awards and made money at the box office and what does he do next he gives the audience more of the same br br young jimmy <UNK> lives on some kitchen sink estate he is <UNK> at school and no one loves him the only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer no actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer he has a macho <UNK> of a father who thinks ballet dancers are a bunch of <UNK> while his <UNK> says ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet i remember seeing the <UNK> ballet <UNK> ballet is a main talking point on a run down british <UNK> estate those days not come to think of it neither is left wing politics which seems to be the sole <UNK> of middle class do <UNK> who live in nice big houses so right away everything about this set up feels ridiculously false br br another major criticism is that this is a film that has no clue who it's trying to appeal to i have often <UNK> channel 4 for <UNK> movies at totally inappropriate times the land that time forgot at 6 am for example but they showed this at 2 am and for once they've got it spot on considering the story involves politics ballet dancing <UNK> i hate it lung cancer and poverty there's no way this can be deemed suitable for a family audience but since the main protagonist is an 11 year old child and features angels and ballet dancers don't blame me if i seem obsessed with the subject there was no need to refer to them there's not much here for an intelligent adult audience either br br of course if lee hall had been told at the script development stage by the producers that he should write a story featuring a <UNK> and an angel and had <UNK> refused saying that he wanted to write about other themes and stories then i will <UNK> but throughout the movie you do get the feeling that once the film was completed it was going to be <UNK> to the exact same audience who enjoyed billy elliot
<START> for persons of a certain age w w ii was the defining time of their lives and whatever followed could never compare as the movie opens a recently widowed but still lively woman <UNK> <UNK> hears a street musician <UNK> attempting to play the classic song stardust br br this recalls her memories of when she played in an almost all girl band that entertained between bomb <UNK> during the war the drummer patrick ian <UNK> happily avoided the draft and enjoyed the ladies br br patrick and <UNK> character meet and decide to reunite the band which takes them on a series of mini adventures despite ups and downs the band does reunite and makes a successful <UNK> br br the movie is <UNK> written and understated with superb performances from all involved the characters are well developed and all people who have not quit living despite their years and there's all that glorious old swing music br br this isn't the <UNK> of steven spielberg but a serious movie nevertheless the war affected everyone and that lesson is not forgotten in a movie that isn't afraid to entertain as it teaches
<START> having seen cube i've been a fan of vincenzo <UNK> work natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline and hardly <UNK> it our like a wet <UNK> for all the storyline he can <UNK> instead he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways so much in fact that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape or in the case of nothing a large empty <UNK> where there is nothing the <UNK> had me hooked instantly it seemed so simple take two characters who no one likes and send them to a world where there is nothing natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist in fact the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film there's nothing there but also <UNK> there br br it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film <UNK> to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so therefore upon watching the film i laughed every now and again whereas someone who the <UNK> <UNK> may find themselves utterly confused br br if i may take a minute to give the film some praise where the film excels on is the concept it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing and to put two characters there not two brilliant minded characters who will <UNK> and work out their surroundings but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are another strong point is the film's cinematography though at first this may not seem it where each wall north earth south west up and down is just a white plane a perception of depth becomes <UNK> it is hard to determine where things are placed in the <UNK> en scene the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens but for the most part the camera is placed so that two characters or an object and a character are placed in the <UNK> and background allowing a sense of depth to be realised br br however this film does lack in certain areas the film is relatively short but even so after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot we can also argue that the acting is once again questionable these two characters are in a sense unlikeable therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters however on a flip side of that the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough but there is something lacking br br even so i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science fiction horror film it is much more of a comedy than that it is indeed worth watching though purely for the concept itself
<START> obviously made to show famous 1950s stripper misty <UNK> acting talents too bad she can't act br br boring little tale about sweet innocent sally down <UNK> being drugged and forced into white slavery prostitution then she meets likable tommy cole who instantly falls in love with her he wants to help her escape but can he you really won't care br br there's no real skin here <UNK> just <UNK> down slowly to her underwear twice the rest is just a boring little tale <UNK> of bad acting atrocious comedy never thought prostitution was funny but what do i know and terrible post dubbed dialogue i admit there was a twist at the end i didn't see coming but that's not enough to sit through this also <UNK> attempts at acting are hysterical a real bomb avoid
<START> i saw this film at the toronto international film festival not as <UNK> as it sounds this is a three part documentary each episode is 50 minutes featuring <UNK> superstar <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> zizek zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring themes of sexuality fantasy morality and <UNK> it was directed by sophie <UNK> of the multi talented <UNK> clan she's sister to actors ralph and joseph br br i enjoyed this quite a bit although i think it will be even more enjoyable on dvd since there is such a <UNK> of ideas to be <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit <UNK> by the end of two and a half hours it didn't help that an ill advised coffee and possession of a <UNK> led me to some <UNK> for the last hour or so br br my only real issue with this is that zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with <UNK> themes he spends quite a bit of time on the films of hitchcock and david lynch not exactly masters of subtlety i would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films although that's really just me saying i'd like to see part four and five and six br br zizek is very funny and part of the humour was watching him present what <UNK> to a lecture while <UNK> himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he's discussing so for instance we see him in a <UNK> on his way to <UNK> bay from hitchcock's the birds or sitting in the basement of the bates motel from psycho which is not to say that his theories are not provocative even when i found myself <UNK> with him it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films which is exactly what he's trying to accomplish
<START> now days most people don't watch classic movies such as this most of friends only watch movies from the <UNK> to present thats kinda <UNK> br br most old movies like this are masterpieces unique in their own way only because back when these movies were being thought of and made thats when ideas were fresh now people strain just to think of new ideas br br anyway to the movie for true fans of classic horror this is for you the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor and stumbles on to three other strange <UNK> with past residents of the same house br br i won't say anymore for i will ruin the movie more than i already have but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is and would never mind watching it again
<START> and yet another run of south park comes to an end this wasn't as strong an episode as i'd hoped for but night of the living homeless was a stronger <UNK> then <UNK> cup <UNK> bloody mary or <UNK> day it still can't hold a candle to <UNK> <UNK> christmas and <UNK> but few episodes can br br night of the living homeless is a spoof of the zombie genre done in a way only south park would think of instead of flesh eating zombies the <UNK> are homeless that request change and seem to survive off of it br br randy and other residents are locked in the community center though this time on the roof where they can <UNK> the scene a particularly funny moment is when one member finds out his home is gone and becomes homeless leaving randy no choice but to shoot him br br meanwhile the four boys set out to solve the problem with the whole story behind the homeless <UNK> trying to convey a message but being seriously uninspired south park is at it's best a lot of the times when it is being ridiculous matt and <UNK> played it safe this week and didn't really critique the homeless problem just <UNK> it br br the shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless this is the first time a suicide on south park goes wrong and we watch the poor man miss his brain and then attempt to shoot himself many times while he painfully dies another inspired south park moment br br overall the episode was funny but it was kept from being great by <UNK> any real commentary on the homeless and sticking straight with the zombie <UNK> the ending is somewhat funny but nothing new br br now we must wait until october for the next <UNK> of episodes it's a long <UNK> but south park must be <UNK> for it's run the show seemed to be running out of steam last season but now it's back in full form
<START> this movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed the book by rebecca west was written in <UNK> soon after wwi when shell shock and trauma induced <UNK> were not clichés as the reviewers call it many books and movies later it is difficult to go back in time and live as the characters lived the realities of the time the war and the horror of the experience of the first war to use lethal gas the british class system the wife thought all important the hopeless <UNK> and the lover from the past still seen with the eyes of love being as young and as beautiful as she was 20 years ago br br alan bates as the <UNK> soldier who will die if he isn't allowed to see margaret the girl of his youthful dreams builds on the devotion his character showed in far from the <UNK> crowd having seen that performance it is possible to sense his strong romantic <UNK> to the girl who didn't live up to the family's and <UNK> expectations margaret says we <UNK> and as you <UNK> away you turned your face away from me so we know that the <UNK> was something that he <UNK> that it brought him shame but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with margaret i haven't seen all his films but in the ones i've seen he <UNK> a strong <UNK> which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldier br br i didn't even recognize ann margaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated not having read the book i wondered whether the child who died was the result of acting on a borderline incestuous feeling between jenny and chris though jenny does state that she is a cousin the way kitty keeps jenny in the <UNK> in the hair <UNK> scene the fact that kitty says she always <UNK> her hair in that room seems more a way for kitty to keep the <UNK> of anger hot than the <UNK> of the room to the sun or sentiment about a lost child and the statement she made that she wished chris hadn't felt it necessary to <UNK> the room exactly as it was when the child was alive made her seem <UNK> toward the memory of the child also jenny is shown as living in the house in a <UNK> role as high society would have done to a fallen member at the time br br having recently been the <UNK> of the intense fantasy of a lover non <UNK> keeping with the <UNK> of the time from 50 years ago i <UNK> to <UNK> and her husband's dilemma i too was cast aside because i wasn't good enough for his family and upon his <UNK> of me via the internet i was <UNK> with helping him deal with his still very horrifying vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didn't believe he loved my husband like <UNK> was very understanding but the strain was very real the lover was finally able to <UNK> his real life situation with his fantasy of loving only me br br i thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the <UNK> of the war experience that was happening in <UNK> mind i thought of mrs <UNK> with the wwi soldier who acts out very violent memories and commits suicide versus <UNK> joy in his fantasy of margaret in contrast the <UNK> of the soldier in mrs <UNK> seems overwrought br br showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to chris <UNK> what a major problem the whole group faced everyone seems to get their life back but was it the right choice
<START> generally i like horror movies but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand we sat down to watch it ready to be scared and ended up <UNK> food everywhere we were laughing so much the concept isn't that bad but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky i don't know the worst thing about the movie is the actors the camera work was poor the special effects are actually not bad if i am being generous but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small <UNK> of badly <UNK> elm they were wooden beyond measure especially a <UNK> young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent he looked more like a public school boy in fact there was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was <UNK> for <UNK> as a <UNK> lady <UNK> on top of him and later his <UNK> sized <UNK> were hysterical but then i remembered it wasn't supposed to be a comedy i'm desperately <UNK> my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts but there simply isn't let's hope ten was the lucky number and they don't do another one i'm not sure my <UNK> could take it
<START> hello <UNK> i recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of arthur <UNK> i have to admit i was very impressed by this film as a fan of black and white films generally <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> hill mob and tommy <UNK> who is apparently a distant relative this film <UNK> in that it provided good old fashioned british humour i notice that there are some on here who have <UNK> <UNK> performance however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films now if you can get hold of this film i would recommend you get hold of it shame these films generally aren't shown on sunday <UNK> anymore i am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by arnold <UNK> private <UNK> in <UNK> army i thank you
<START> an awful film it must have been up against some real <UNK> to be nominated for the golden globe they've taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and <UNK> it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it's simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this <UNK> dull script i suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version it's <UNK> <UNK> off in the end with a summary of the <UNK> life we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd <UNK> the rest of the film with same <UNK>
<START> this little appreciated movie is one of my favorites i can watch it over and over <UNK> and <UNK> are masterful but <UNK> julia steals the show a tongue in cheek <UNK> humorous <UNK> <UNK> with just the right tone for this <UNK> spoof of this <UNK> told story br br generally <UNK> and <UNK> moon over <UNK> allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen two thumbs up
<START> crude some times crass to me that's the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> latest work page 3 he has no point of view just shallow funny <UNK> at stereotypes what is the movie about is it about <UNK> a clan of people so called page 3 types who are so busy <UNK> and <UNK> their <UNK> in life that they have no time for anything else and you are either in it or out of it is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents <UNK> <UNK> forgets that there is a main newspaper and page 3 is just a <UNK> perhaps an entertainer for checking out who's who and what's what don't mix the two and then there is power play that would happen in every walk of life so what have you told at the end of it all nothing just a few crude jokes strung together in an otherwise direction less movie
<START> and that's how the greatest comedy of tv started it has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season because that's where friends is based on quotes extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts let's say a big thanks to rachel ross monica joey chandler and <UNK> in our first meet we see how rachel <UNK> a guy in the church how understand <UNK> search for the perfect guy there is no perfect guy why all you women are obsessed with that and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian till we meet joey <UNK> and chandler in the next episodes enjoy friends
<START> surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of disney's straight to video throw away sequels like the previous sequel the lion king 2 i was glad that disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation the plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an <UNK> string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull to break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences which much like the jokes range from entertaining to a quick trip to the <UNK> for the most part the mst3k like moments are bland and full of <UNK> potential and really don't add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hour long flashback the new characters are at least likable and the old characters are out doing their thing so i can't fault them there overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice <UNK> filler between the more serious lion king titles
<START> the biggest national lampoon hit remains animal house and rightly so it was funny <UNK> and good natured br br the exact opposite of every other national lampoon film including class reunion br br please do not be fooled by the inclusion of stephen <UNK> <UNK> from animal house or by the fact that john hughes wrote this <UNK> mess this reunion is about as hilarious as root <UNK> and twice as painful br br one star and that's being generous then again i always thought most of my old classmates were demons vampires and serial killers too
<START> br br one would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role to be a funny movie this is not the case here i laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie and that wasn't even during the final comedy scene which one would also expect to be the funniest this is one you can watch when it comes to tv don't spend any other money renting it
<START> pleasant <UNK> and charming the best part is the swing numbers especially the rendition of my buddy partial though it may have been the acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film
<START> this movie is supposed to be taking place in and around seattle the why is <UNK> <UNK> p r o v i n c i a l park shown <UNK> parks are in canada and not the united states the inspector uses a palm pilot complete with <UNK> to <UNK> that someone has <UNK> into the computer of the <UNK> shop i did not know that this was possible using a <UNK> <UNK> device a woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced we learn half way into the movie that this woman works in the district <UNK> office then in the <UNK> center a guard actually <UNK> <UNK> through a door and keeps his back to the <UNK> this would never happen in a real <UNK> setting the director really messed on this one this doesn't happen in real life the acting is adequate the plot is good the cinematography is good however the many errors found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote
<START> studio <UNK> aka the possessed in the uk is another sub par slasher that has the appearance of a straight to dvd movie br br whilst many of the straight to dvd movies are fast paced or unintentionally hilarious in the so bad it's good sense studio <UNK> is a <UNK> failure br br at the time of writing every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review every one of these people have hit the nail on the head br br the two people at the time of writing who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously obviously they've seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror br br the only really positive point i can make about this movie is that it does fare better than the choke and one of them two extremely mediocre slasher movies that i would not wish on my worst enemy br br the plot of this movie must have been done hundreds if not thousands of times the movie only has a slight twist and one that is badly handled to the usual expectations a depressed singer commits suicide soon after her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends the said possessed friend goes on a killing spree the rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up you'll just have to see it for yourself providing your interest has not yet <UNK> to the point of <UNK> of course br br the acting in the movie is very poor for the most part the actress who played <UNK> was an exception to this her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen she helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts unfortunately some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie br br the direction was equally poor the villains did not seem the least bit menacing every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension atmosphere was non existent and the camera work was incredibly basic some of the special effects if you can call them that reminded me of the tv series ghost stories unfortunately for the producers of this movie ghost stories had intelligently written scripts believable performances and made superb use of camera angles maybe if the producers had watched that tv series closely they'd have picked up some more techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie br br the music is completely <UNK> to the tone of the movie it's just rock music and not the best examples of this type either don't get me started on that awful song played at the beginning br br some aspects of the movie particularly dialogue are unintentionally funny unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up or should it be down to the so bad it's good level br br overall studio <UNK> is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects i recommend this only to those who are fans of straight to dvd movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made
<START> i am a great fan of martin <UNK> on whose book this film is based unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen the novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the <UNK> of traditional plot line and character development it is an hilarious examination of human greed excess and <UNK> by one of the most moral of contemporary british writers the director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel in his hands the film screams along at <UNK> speed <UNK> in every known trick shot and <UNK> camera angle possible it is like ken <UNK> on acid and suffers from that older director's self <UNK> <UNK> up to a hundred not even the brief glimpse of gorgeous actor christian <UNK> penis was enough to save this wretched film for me abysmal
<START> this movie is really goofy i saw it as an 11 year old and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12 i really didn't care for it but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of such as 1 does money buy happiness 2 should i lie to my parents about things i think they wouldn't <UNK> of 3 does money buy friendships 4 is money everything 5 shouldn't i tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me granted these are very unrealistic situations but i do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children maybe they should watch this video as well in order to show scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt
<START> me and my girlfriend <UNK> watched this together and we'll both comment br br both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with <UNK> work a lot of <UNK> works are somewhat dark and dreary including oliver twist but this movie changed all that it was fun colourful both visually and <UNK> and the characters were more lighthearted br br travis normally i don't care a lot for musical and dance movies but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively and the choreography was awesome br br <UNK> that's really saying a lot coming from travis i can't <UNK> enough how really good the dance numbers were you can tell for example that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfection br br travis three actors really stood out imo nancy <UNK> w bill sykes oliver reed and <UNK> <UNK> jack wild man that oliver reed can really do a good villain that one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail <UNK> gave me chills down the back awesome and that kid jack wild was a perfect <UNK> <UNK> and nancy was fantastic man i felt bad when she got killed she can sing too kudos to the casting department on their choices there i hated the oliver twist kid tho he was just too whiny and <UNK> for my taste i kept wishing bill <UNK> would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene and they shouldn't have had him sing either br br <UNK> acting was truly superb in addition to the three stars travis mentioned i felt ron moody fagin did a tremendous job he was so funny and at the same time lightly sinister too the supporting actors were great too harry <UNK> carried his mr <UNK> role extremely well and he has a wonderful singing voice i saw mr <UNK> perform in another movie entitled <UNK> where he played an opera singer with pleasing results the talented harry <UNK> should have been in a lot more movies br br travis as i mentioned earlier the story isn't quite true to the book but imo it was more <UNK> this movie was not boring either as some musicals seem to be and the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters the tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too long br br <UNK> any musical movie which travis watches completely has to be a rare find and this one is indeed a rare find it is a very easy to watch production which carries the viewer smoothly and <UNK> through to the end in a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces this was a refreshing <UNK> br br our combined rating for this was 8 5 of 10 we'll round up to 9 in this case br br travis i rated this a 7 mainly because the oliver twist kid mark l irritated me and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears otherwise it was an outstanding movie br br <UNK> my rating is a 10 movies don't get much better than this and you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was a masterpiece br br please don't miss this one even if you normally don't like musicals it really is a rare treat
