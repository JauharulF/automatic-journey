<START> i love just about everything the late al <UNK> directed in his long and varied career but the possession of nurse <UNK> stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade z like horror of the blood monsters and dracula vs frankenstein this film is actually scary am i saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch nurse <UNK> no of course not but this <UNK> of elements from the exorcist ruby and carrie is one of those nice eerie little horror movies common to the seventies you can't put your finger on what's so spooky about it but the film <UNK> with atmosphere and what an ending don't worry i won't spoil it for you <UNK> and producer sam <UNK> really nailed it with this one and it doesn't matter whether nurse <UNK> was a <UNK> success or a happy accident jill <UNK> is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader bill roy who shines in his brief role geoffrey land is okay as her <UNK> doctor boyfriend there are some elements here profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive in flicks after all but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing nurse <UNK> was a poverty row production and it shows at times sets special effects etc still the film has heart mostly decent acting and direction and some genuine chills sam <UNK> also saw fit to use harry theme music for the late <UNK> early '60s television series one step beyond in this film which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere the dvd contains two significantly different cuts of the movie the early version features a lot of t a that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff as well as the theatrical trailer the tv spot and a great commentary by <UNK> does anybody know whatever happened to bill roy by the way next to john carradine he's the best actor i've ever seen in an al <UNK> film and he plays the cult leader like he means it
<START> it has past almost 25 years since i saw this movie i would consider this film as an all time classic in a drama category anthony queen gives one of the most wonderful performances ever in a matter of minutes he takes you from laugh to tears this movie represents a splendid picture of how humanity changed after the ii world war how a great part of that generation and the <UNK> lost its innocence it has taken me long time to find this film by its name the <UNK> hour this type of films are not a but they are for sure a treasure for some i am very surprise why this movie is not used for the media in a <UNK> way in order for more people to enjoy this picture
<START> i actually first watched one dark night in the theater wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper i loved it then i still love it the storyline revolves around two people first of all one woman learns that her father has <UNK> after his death she then has feelings herself about the strange powers of her father even in his death the he's buried in plays host to the other main person a high school girl doing anything to get in with a group of girls that just want to torment her dare her to stay in the all night to join their group they go back in the night to scare her find scares for themselves the cast is led by meg <UNK> with supporting roles by adam west and one of my personal favorites elizabeth daily aka e g daily check this one out if you love 80's movies cheesy horror movies you won't be
<START> this movie is still alive and kicking today thanks to the presence of alan <UNK> this is good in one way because the movie has some interesting things to say but bad in another because everyone who watches it expecting that tough guy <UNK> is going to <UNK> through his usual <UNK> is going to be mighty disappointed without <UNK> or introduction <UNK> is suddenly introduced in the third reel true his role is a key one but it's small and likely to get lost in the <UNK> there are many key roles in former <UNK> martin <UNK> screenplay which hits out at all political <UNK> and quite <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> candidates it's the lovely and extremely talented joan <UNK> who ties the various <UNK> of the wide ranging story together unlike the usual hollywood production the plot actually proceeds in a series of jumps much like the films later turned out by the french new wave though easier to follow here especially if you are aware that the film's original title was paper bullets nonetheless some of the film's narrative and character switches are a little <UNK> particularly in the role played by jack <UNK> who has wisely elected to act the part in a strangely non <UNK> way one of jack's best acting jobs ever but no one is likely to notice alas
<START> i saw this movie on the base movie theater while in the air force so my affection for it might be influenced by the reaction of the <UNK> audience in <UNK> at the theater that night but i do think that this movie was one of the first popular kung fu movies and helped to begin the trend in the early 70's it's worth seeing
<START> this film makes about as much sense as an or a <UNK> knows <UNK> episode an old copy of <UNK> <UNK> circa <UNK> would provide more insight into modern life or the relationship between a father and a daughter than this weird <UNK> br br i was surprised with diane keaton she appears to <UNK> through the film given the film's title i realize that hers was a supporting role but even martin short managed a distinct supporting character br br i can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy but this film is the <UNK> version of an imaginary world i'm frightened to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy
<START> although <UNK> could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of it <UNK> into a stereotypical frankenstein <UNK> putting across the by now monotonous lesson that there were some <UNK> man was not meant to enter or study br br scientist rock hudson is <UNK> with ways to prevent babies from dying after success with a dog he immediately jumps to humans <UNK> medical <UNK> and any sense of <UNK> with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital <UNK> his experiment works too well with some decidedly unpleasant side effects br br although barbara <UNK> is reasonably good in her role and some of the animal training is spectacular the film suffers from being too <UNK> even though a message at the prologue <UNK> viewers that this represents contemporary technology the scientific work depicted looks far fetched even for the twenty first century let alone the mid 1970s furthermore the scene where <UNK> is able to find a cure for the side effects of simply by <UNK> a question into a computer is laughable
<START> this is both an entertaining and a touching version of the classic tale also quite intelligent not of the <UNK> tarzan you <UNK> school at all br br it's the famous story of a child <UNK> to <UNK> in the jungle by apes a titled british couple the wife pregnant is stranded in the african <UNK> after a <UNK> after the parents' deaths the baby is raised in the jungle by apes twenty years later this young man i e tarzan <UNK> a wounded <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> him back to health the <UNK> discovers evidence that his <UNK> is the young lord <UNK> and returns him to his <UNK> estate in scotland where he must <UNK> to <UNK> society br br the movie is sort of divided into two parts in the first half we see tarzan in his jungle environment not being an expert i am unaware as to the realism of its depiction of ape community life but it is certainly entertaining for me the more moving section is the second half when tarzan must meet his real family develop language skills and <UNK> to <UNK> british society all the while <UNK> jane <UNK> <UNK> he is portrayed as a <UNK> <UNK> whether in the wild or in elegant <UNK> <UNK> by contrast the upper <UNK> is depicted as often far more <UNK> than the jungle tarzan left br br christopher <UNK> is fantastic in his sympathetic portrayal of tarzan in both the jungle and <UNK> <UNK> he conveys a real sense of his confusion and conflict torn as he is between the two very different worlds his original ape family and his new human one sir ralph richardson one of the old british legends is brilliant as always in the role of <UNK> grandfather the sixth earl of <UNK> br br the film focuses more on <UNK> struggles in adapting to civilization and his inner conflict than on his jungle exploits this unusual take on the old classic makes it both the typical dramatic adventure but also above all a moving personal story i wasn't surprised to note here that its director is the same individual hugh hudson who also directed <UNK> of fire another brilliant movie
<START> this movie is based on the true story of <UNK> housewife lucille <UNK> who got breast cancer after the birth of her <UNK> child realizing that the state would take the children away from her <UNK> alcoholic husband she devoted the last year of her life traveling around the state to find new homes for each of the children a terrific script which still holds up 20 years after it was first made the grown children many of whom had not seen each other since their mother died in the late 50's were reunited on that's incredible prior to the film's airing in 1983 barbara stanwyck won the emmy for best actress in a tv movie or mini series but during her acceptance speech she went out of her way to single ann <UNK> out for her moving performance
<START> i've been waiting years for the dead to come out on video having pretty much worn my vhs copy to <UNK> this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays it takes place on the feast of the <UNK> <UNK> night and is a simple poignant <UNK> of characters attending a dinner prepared by three <UNK> women central to the story is a fairly <UNK> couple a wife who once <UNK> loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife but feels incapable all of the performances are stunning and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully of course its source material is james <UNK> short story of the same title and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact john <UNK> long career as one of hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film which was scripted by his son tony huston stars his daughter <UNK> huston and is dedicated to his wife thank you to lions gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a <UNK> subtle yet incredibly moving holiday film this is a true gem
<START> victor silent film masterpiece the phantom <UNK> has recently been released on dvd with a new soundtrack recorded by the duo <UNK> american <UNK> stephen and <UNK> <UNK> artist peter has <UNK> an extraordinary collection of sounds to <UNK> and <UNK> the original film footage from <UNK> an ominous <UNK> sound introduces each act and a <UNK> of <UNK> guitar <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and flows as the grim drama unfolds br br as impressive as the new soundtrack is the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and <UNK> fairy tale according to this tale the last person to die before the stroke of midnight on new year's eve is condemned to spend a year behind the <UNK> of the eponymous phantom <UNK> collecting the souls of the dead this is the fate of the anti hero of the film david <UNK> who is moved to painful <UNK> of his life following his <UNK> death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the <UNK> br br this film is often referred to as a horror film and although this is a fitting label the real horror here <UNK> not in the supernatural elements but rather in the depiction of human suffering at the hands of others gives a remarkable performance as the drunken <UNK> and menacing <UNK> in life and the wretched frightened <UNK> looking back from the land of the dead and <UNK> from his past deeds br br striking imagery <UNK> throughout the phantom <UNK> and more than <UNK> for the inevitably limited dialogue the ill <UNK> of midnight is <UNK> illustrated through the image of a clock face <UNK> alone in the <UNK> night sky like a second moon equally <UNK> the dead are depicted through <UNK> semi transparent imagery and the scenes of the phantom <UNK> riding over land and sea remain chilling to watch br br film deserves its place as one of the most <UNK> silent films of all time and the new soundtrack by is a superb <UNK> of its themes this is a must see
<START> i recently started to watch this show in <UNK> and find it a bit hit and miss some episodes are silly doug is upset about some trivial juvenile thing and acts stupid etc br br still others are quite amusing and sometimes touching these include those episodes that face up to the <UNK> of the characters for instance the juvenile overweight <UNK> guy marries sexy wife theme is found in several sitcoms carrie also has something about her looks wise not just a run of the mill sexy girl but carrie has an edge she might be nice on the eyes but has a few too many personality traits not too far different than her father br br and she readily admits to it for instance one episode revolves at her lack of desire to be nice to co workers i personally find her b <UNK> sexy but you have to be the right sort of person to be able to live with that <UNK> doug is a good match and deep down see likes the simple things too maybe not as much as doug whose <UNK> is watching tv and eating a big <UNK> next to his big screen t v but no culture gal she this lack of an sensitive side is one reason the two don't have children br br of course the simple pleasures of a guy is nothing to <UNK> at either and adds to the charm of the show they live an ordinary working class sort of life in queens it is realistic in that sense and overall amusing and pleasant sitcom fare <UNK> if you just want to relax it gets a little tired at the end so it's probably good it is ending it had a good run see also <UNK>
<START> these cartoon writers are <UNK> with their corny and fun <UNK> the first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates <UNK> <UNK> prison no <UNK> is good <UNK> inside the prison the first sign we see is welcome have a seat they then show an electric chair br br corny gives way to clever however as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars with pen in hand he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it in no time he has <UNK> crossed the united states <UNK> up through canada and is in the northern part of that country it's there we see the canadian royal <UNK> police and of course our hero <UNK> known here as sgt he has the assignment of catching the at large criminal from <UNK> <UNK> so with his <UNK> little blue horse he goes out in the heavy snow to track down the wanted wolf br br from that point we get the normal story <UNK> always being a step ahead of the wolf no matter what the latter does and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny sight gags <UNK> even pops out of an <UNK> egg on top of a mountain there is nowhere the wolf can go or do plastic surgery to escape the <UNK> sgt nobody by the way in the history of cartoons perhaps has more exaggerated reactions either than this wolf each time he sees his nemesis his screams facial and body stretched out in horror each time is a big part of the sight gags br br you'd think this one joke cartoon would get monotonous but it doesn't it's more good stuff from <UNK> <UNK> and the gang just one of 24 cartoons in the complete theatrical collection dvd with wonderful looking restored visuals
<START> muscular <UNK> thin females in <UNK> lots of beer drinking yet it's too long to be a beer commercial oh okay there's some plot about a big shark like monster that's killing people and stuff but it's nothing you haven't seen before
<START> silver city 2 outta 5 stars as a huge fan of john work for many years now i feel safe in saying that this is the worst movie he has ever done that said the movie isn't exactly terrible just very uninspired <UNK> throws in familiar elements from his previous movies corrupt politics illegal <UNK> the selling out of youthful ideals but fails to bring them together in any new or meaningful way even the dialogue usually strong point is disappointing this time around sounding clichéd and forced in almost every scene the movie looks and sounds like episodes from a tv series that didn't make it past its third episode there are tons of big stars on hand and they try their best to make their bit parts come alive but the material just isn't there this time around while filming a campaign spot a <UNK> hopeful a poor and obvious george w bush stand in <UNK> a dead body out of a lake an investigator is hired to try and warn away people who may have deliberately set this up to <UNK> the candidate but he soon finds out that there are deeper and darker and more clichéd secrets to be discovered <UNK> has made similarly themed movies so much better in the past lone star <UNK> return of the <UNK> seven men with guns it's a shame that he went to the well one time too many and came up with <UNK> water one good line delivered by richard dreyfuss danny you're a loser that's already been established beyond doubt so just try and be a good one okay
<START> one of the things that i like about <UNK> anderson is that he has the guts to take talent that most people push to the side or have pushed to the side and makes them stars case in point a washed up burt reynolds delivers a great performance in this film and if proving adam <UNK> can be a great actor punch drunk love wasn't enough here comes mark like you've never seen before br br i think many people pass up boogie nights cause they are anti porn or just flat out hate the adult industry and can't overlook that aspect of this film but underneath that is a great story about characters losing everything and battle to regain themselves there is a beautiful film and it's too bad that enough people see that
<START> there are too many people on this board who have obviously missed the subtle wit of this series br br this show is great because it's a hilarious parody of itself guys who are self <UNK> <UNK> are given a fair chance to convince us of their seduction abilities until they hit the field just to expose their complete lack of game on national tv  it's absolutely hilarious and the guys who are actually skilled are extremely compelling to watch as they effortlessly seduce the pretentious women that frequent these trendy <UNK> br br it <UNK> unique charisma when deserved and <UNK> <UNK> when deserved either way it's always entertaining because unlike other dating shows it perfectly captures the authentic <UNK> and excitement of a pickup i highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor
<START> and quite frankly that just sums it up br br it is a small computer animated series that is filmed just like an animal br br the animation is almost flawless i thought the long <UNK> swimming dinosaurs eyes looked fake br br however some of the model shots didn't look quite that realistic br br and i thought that park made a better t rex br br if this is the type of thing we see on a normal british tv series then i cannot wait to see what they can accomplish in the movies br br i give this 10 10 stars br br and the making of video was also great the dinosaur on the <UNK> board was br br
<START> san 1 out of 10 so you want to make a serial killer movie but your budget is non existent your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are joe <UNK> martin <UNK> younger brother and a <UNK> in really bad movies and todd bridges from different <UNK> there are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film the <UNK> brothers have no clue br br first of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make bridges and <UNK> look like oscar caliber <UNK> really how hard is it to play a priest or an overbearing mother certainly a city the size of san francisco has a few professional actors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit clearly chris <UNK> and bonnie <UNK> who play these roles have other talents such as <UNK> or waitress they ought to be fine <UNK> br br joe <UNK> as the killer yes the serial killer is simply known as the killer is also pretty awful in a mentally ill method kind of way but i am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as his character is written with zero style or personality a boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie br br in addition the <UNK> brothers seem to have originally planned this as an abc family movie of the week there is no nudity or violence to speak of and the r rating clearly is for the adult style pacing this move <UNK> like an 85 year old woman driving with <UNK> <UNK> and her turn <UNK> on the only occasional horror comes from lighting face with a <UNK> that makes it look like his lower jaw was removed br br i wasn't expecting a great film when i rented san but i wasn't expecting mind numbing boredom either
<START> to call x m a science fiction classic is due more to its release date 1950 its <UNK> ability to capitalize on the publicity for destination moon and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as sea <UNK> mike nelson dad and <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie itself is bad enough to be good fodder for mst3k and is best viewed with commentary from joel and the robots this is the type of movie best suited to added <UNK> from the mst3k characters something preachy slow paced poorly scripted and full of painfully bad acting while unintentionally funny stuff like plan 9 from outer space don't lend themselves to satirical commentary because the movie constantly <UNK> the <UNK> really bad and dull movies like x m are ideal so add some stars to the rating if you are watching the mst3k version br br the basic story has the crew taking an <UNK> right turn at the moon and ending up on mars what they find on that planet are the <UNK> of a human like civilization <UNK> by an atomic war only one martian is shown in close up a normal looking woman who is blind or at least has no <UNK> in her eyes the men look like the <UNK> in the old <UNK> cartoons they <UNK> around the <UNK> and throw <UNK> at the crew with amazing accuracy especially if they are supposed to be blind of course none of this is ever explained as doing so would require some sign of logical analysis from the writers of the screenplay br br the scenes on mars are presented in something called <UNK> color to <UNK> them from the rest of the b w movie if this has you thinking wizard of oz you will be disappointed because it is just black and white stuff with a slight brown <UNK> added to the print in post production br br in keeping with the moronic <UNK> of the movie the icy female scientist <UNK> up her fuel <UNK> both coming and going her failure to measure up to the men causes her feminine side to surface and she and mike nelson <UNK> <UNK> to each other as they face their doom insert sound of <UNK> here br br the real stars of the movie are the <UNK> at the command center so much so that mst3k was inspired to specially <UNK> these <UNK> heroes the <UNK> squad of are featured for the first 10 minutes of the movie then take stations about 12 <UNK> behind the <UNK> and <UNK> equipment in the command center later they are called upon to ask the moronic questions needed by the mission director to <UNK> on the movie's already too obvious message br br the dvd has an extremely low audio level is not <UNK> and is accompanied by a trailer although you will be thankful that it is only <UNK> minutes it is still about 60 minutes too long as any 30 minute episode of the twilight zone has several times more content than this entire movie br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i think that this movie is actually entertaining although it lacks some features essential for this <UNK> films first of all when doug and <UNK> start their mission they take off with f and during the combat scenes they are <UNK> f the second thing i dislike of this film is the ever repeating f 16 rolling to its right to escape from <UNK> why and <UNK> haven't been shown in any movie yet third of all once you see the f 16 almost empty of <UNK> it appears again plenty of <UNK> the models used to <UNK> the destroyed aircraft ain't good either however i think that using as <UNK> planes was really good far better than the f 5 shown in top gun but this movie isn't as good as that masterpiece br br a funny movie i love planes and i've seen it more than 3 times
<START> this movie is simply awesome it is so hilarious although the <UNK> and other montages are played out the comedy is awesome himself and brandon are hilarious there will be moments when you can't breath you're laughing so hard plus there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh this is one of the funniest comedies i've ever seen
<START> <UNK> has made a terrible historical movie it shows the poor resources of the spanish cinema in the movie an script shows just as a faced to worried only for sex but sex with others not with her the technical mistakes begin with the wedding ring that shows <UNK> of nobody noticed that then the voice in off seems as a documentary actors and actress in the movie sometimes laughs take a look to the sequence when arrives to the <UNK> which want to keep her isolated the <UNK> are almost broken when in the age of the movie they have been recently built crowds are just four people lights are bad placed compared with <UNK> <UNK> the french movie for the oscars it has no sense to speak about a bad movie like la
<START> i was going to use 'the german <UNK> as a summary but that was already taken lol it sums up <UNK> nicely provided you're not alien to reading subtitles <UNK> fits in <UNK> with the scream urban legend pack it's a teen horror set in a medical school where the students are going missing then turning up as experiment subjects in the <UNK> lab cue one <UNK> student investigating herself and <UNK> a giant conspiracy br br provided you're watching the original german language film i can't comment on the dub having not seen the english edition <UNK> is <UNK> written and cleverly plotted so that the tension never really lets up in comparison to it's american counterparts the mystery is <UNK> much faster meaning that instead of being a slasher right up until the final reveal <UNK> <UNK> during it's running time from a slasher come body horror movie into a smart and exciting thriller it's a gripping ride from start to finish br br hats off to the actors involved as well <UNK> <UNK> proves once more that she's an intelligent smart actress who can make any role come to life her central performance as paula is a great foundation for the movie to build from the spooky and their teachers pets are equally good a truly foreboding presence at all times br br it's also astounding that the movie doesn't drag much the pace is fast and <UNK> very similar to the earlier urban legend meaning that there's always something going on to keep your attention high if there's one downside it could be that some will find <UNK> too gruesome for them but if you <UNK> through the first <UNK> admittedly graphic <UNK> sequences the latter half with it's exciting thriller overtones will reward you i recommend <UNK> to anyone who enjoys a good teen horror but is a bit jaded with the american take on the matter
<START> this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it to make little like it which made it even <UNK> even some of the names were unrealistic the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie the most <UNK> one was danny <UNK> a horror movie actor who is always dirty the other actors were pretty much clean as far as i'm concerned
<START> a ghost story on a typical turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects brothers had made their first shots on a tv show a couple of years ago as far as i know that was kind of a turkish x files they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects this time it seems they had what they needed and used them well this movie will make you laugh that's for sure and as well it might have you scared it has a nice plot and some young bright actors in it if you are a high school student in turkey you will find so many things about you here there are many clues in the movie about its story and ending some you understand at the moment some will make sense <UNK> the dialogs were written very cleverly so these make the movie one of the best movies made in the last years do not forget this movie is the first of its kind in the turkish film industry
<START> not sure i've ever seen a black comedy from before but this is quite good actually the humor is suitably low key and deadpan to go with some of the gruesome activity and are fed up with working for their boss because he's always putting them down in fact he mentions that they weren't bright enough to <UNK> before <UNK> at one point they do what they have to to start their own butcher shop and when a <UNK> is accidentally locked in the <UNK> overnight while <UNK> a light they hit upon something that makes their butcher shop far more popular than their old <UNK> in fact he's the one they sold their first to and it's partly his fault since he served them at a <UNK> dinner at his house and the guests <UNK> about it and showed up at and the next day is somewhat horrified what has done but it doesn't stop there has <UNK> above his sad little existence to be someone of some popularity which is new for him and he doesn't want to let go of that so the <UNK> continues to fill up with all manner of <UNK> and at one point a small <UNK> from the park <UNK> though because ex boss thinks something is wrong is also haunted by his twin brother who lived in a <UNK> for years in a coma and whom wanted the plug pulled on so he could get inheritance money to help open the shop when was taken off the he was <UNK> much to horror and has a love interest too in <UNK> who works at the cemetery neither nor are well <UNK> individuals and so things start to spiral out of control the deadpan humor really makes this and while this isn't exactly laugh out loud material it certainly is amusing it is somewhat creepy though considering the cuts of meat and body parts casually lying around especially since these two take it all so matter of fact if you're a fan of black comedies this is recommended i liked it quite well myself 8 out of 10
<START> did you ever watch a really bad movie and get mad about it even a movie you didn't have high expectations for well i just rented the movie dead line this is the us video title for now i have seen a lot of bad movies and watched a lot of b titles but this is in another league all its own it was put out on the asylum label and anyone that <UNK> a lot of direct to video horror films knows this label when you rent one of there's you know what your getting a lot of <UNK> acting low budget horror but usually still pretty good not this one the acting by the three leads was beyond bad even fast <UNK> couldn't help the tag line on the front of the box says in the tradition of <UNK> body double the nerve to compare this to that classic movie the only true comment is the screams you will hear are real <UNK> you will be the one screaming if you rent this
<START> man this would have been a bad episode of the original series i can't believe they actually spent money on this one i caught the second half of this on tv and having never seen this one before thought i would watch it boy what a waste of time more cheese than <UNK> br br
<START> i've never saw the first three but i know they're all better than this trash it's about some kid who throws a party wow sounds amazing sarcasm is it <UNK> it starts off with a kid laying in bed and he's getting woke up by his mom so the kid pretends to be sick so he doesn't have to go to school he goes to his <UNK> house and rounds up some people and throws a party i didn't laugh at all while watching this trash i can't imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking man <UNK> is <UNK> be big <UNK> makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie i watched this knowing it would be bad but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of this just disgusted me two thumbs down
<START> i saw this dvd on sale and bought it without a second thought despite not even having known it was out since this is one of my favorite books of all time as soon as i got home i <UNK> to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed while it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book the similarities end there the characters are changed ie seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas gene seems to be somewhat of a <UNK> scenes are misplaced or altogether changed ie many characters are missing and famous lines thought are missing the movie does attempt to portray some feeling that the previous one lacked but it is done in a lackluster way that makes for a flat boring movie it is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book such a classic and this movie takes those things and utterly destroys them in its <UNK>
<START> this short was the first short released by paramount famous studios and was one of several done by the studio showing <UNK> engaged directly against the enemy most often the japanese while warner brothers disney and to a lesser extent other studios did shorts often depicting germans as <UNK> the majority of famous studios efforts focused on the japanese given pearl harbor and <UNK> naval ties this is quite understandable this is an average short red white <UNK> blue and <UNK> for britain have aged better but it's still worth watching recommended
<START> enhanced by the <UNK> cinematography of <UNK> godard beau <UNK> golden door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a <UNK> family from their primitive home in <UNK> to <UNK> island in new york at the turn of the century it is a surreal enigmatic often strange but ultimately deeply rewarding experience <UNK> <UNK> and symbolic imagery with gritty realism the latest film by <UNK> is like an <UNK> painting a cinematic <UNK> rendering of what the <UNK> process may have been like for our parents and grandparents magical mystery tour came about as a result of his visit to the museum on <UNK> island the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw and his research into the harsh <UNK> and <UNK> used during the admission of immigrants br br guided by letters he read of immigrants sent to relatives who remained at home <UNK> with those <UNK> immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal to <UNK> <UNK> vincenzo <UNK> and his older son <UNK> <UNK> america is a distant dream that they know nothing about after climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign they are rewarded when they are shown post cards by younger son <UNK> a deaf mute that depict the new world as a land where they can <UNK> in rivers of milk sit under a money tree or <UNK> giant <UNK> and <UNK> br br after <UNK> of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits <UNK> his two sons and his elderly mother <UNK> set out on their adventure with more hope than <UNK> but the <UNK> soon shifts the other way as they board the boat and settle into their crowded third class <UNK> <UNK> the most talked about scene in the film takes place using an <UNK> camera that shows masses of people standing as the ship pulls away the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and those waving goodbye from the <UNK> and the way they are separated implies they are being torn <UNK> from everything familiar br br aboard the ship is a mysterious english woman named lucy charlotte <UNK> does not reveal her past or the reason she is traveling to america but she seems to stand for the <UNK> of the modern world they are entering though they eye each other <UNK> lucy becomes interested in <UNK> and asks him to marry her in order to allow her to enter the country the voyage is <UNK> with a violent storm <UNK> the ship shot in almost complete darkness passengers in <UNK> are tossed against the side of the boat and afterward bodies lie <UNK> and twisted on the floor as if in a macabre the <UNK> of passage through <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> island does not become any easier and attacks the way illiterate <UNK> in the name of <UNK> <UNK> society are forced to put <UNK> together perform <UNK> tasks and <UNK> <UNK> medical <UNK> to prove they are fit br br a marriage ceremony feels like an <UNK> block and the young women look <UNK> when they are matched with overweight middle aged men this is the only way they can enter the golden door however since single women are rejected unless they have partners ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution through the fog the can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no statue of liberty asking for the tired and the poor the <UNK> masses yearning to breathe free in their imagination however the river is still flowing waiting for them to jump in though the ending is ambiguous and one door opens on to a blank wall another door <UNK> a <UNK> of the soul and the passage we must all take from the old world to the new
<START> this was an interesting study in societal sexuality as well as the dark interests of man br br while i can't say the wife was a strong character she was the wrong choice for the part in my opinion she was a rich kid in search of escaping her <UNK> life she was a rebel in fact and never fully <UNK> for her husband a lawyer <UNK> it's obvious he married her for her money and to cover his sexual desires which is taboo <UNK> played his part to a <UNK> his <UNK> with the young man and very subtle undertones of <UNK> the young man was gay to the <UNK> when he did marilyn <UNK> that should have told the wife everything he was perfectly cast as well he has hustler written all over him br br i was not crazy about the ending as i knew what was coming overall though the acting from <UNK> was great <UNK> was good walker was okay but i had <UNK> for a gay themed movie it was average but not blatant at least it's worth viewing if you don't have truly <UNK> deeply lying around for a spin
<START> i haven't read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on but who knows maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health it isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health but a book can be very relaxing and certainly <UNK> the active part of your brain more so than this movie you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i've read on one hand but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire i get the feeling that she writes really good novels the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and <UNK> vampire history br br still stuart <UNK> voice over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad <UNK> vampire narrative ever did and you can tell that queen of the limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline while interview decided to go with <UNK> and <UNK> queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places the costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an <UNK> soundtrack br br however i'll give credit where credit is due the soundtrack is excellent and disturbed had me down with the sickness <UNK> my <UNK> like <UNK> br br the film opens with a very cool <UNK> rock zoom <UNK> montage but after the first ten minutes or so the directing <UNK> quickly it's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects unfortunately queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress where are the yellow contacts where's the pale blue make up scene after scene i <UNK> my head <UNK> about the days of <UNK> lot and fright night when low budget was done right br br there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage props to <UNK> and may her soul forever rest in peace she might have become a renowned actress had her life not been taken from us so <UNK> for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing did i mention that the soundtrack was good let's see what else can i say it wasn't too long the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second rate vampire movies out there the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything br br br br <UNK> com
<START> this movie has too many things going on another reviewer comments on the disjointed episodic nature of the film as <UNK> the director's memories that's fine if that is how it was written and performed instead what we get is straight forward narrative some of the time that jumps around under and over leaves us <UNK> in some instances <UNK> the flow with unnecessary <UNK> in other instances and otherwise simply doesn't work br br there are also some plot details that just don't work for example why drag a body onto a beach in an urban area in broad daylight as opposed to night time why leave your flat sheet on the body why would an artist who knew the joe character for a brief time decide to leave him everything even if it wasn't much this sub plot was poorly developed to make that point work for that matter why even have the man be an <UNK> or an artist other than to provide the money and the gratuitous nude posing scenes he could just as easily have been a photographer or a opera composer for that matter how does someone rate an apartment in an opera house particularly without some clear connection to the opera the <UNK> are also both too obvious and to unclear and unexplained why would the guys take everything in the warehouse and disappear if tim was a 10 year old school mate in a town as small as how could joe lose track of him for 8 years especially if they knew each other well enough that one would recommend the other for a job br br some of the other subplots like the mother and her boyfriend s and the sister wanting to escape felt like padding there's some good ideas that might have made a feature with full development or could have been interesting shorts as completed this movie made little sense and offers even less
<START> i must warn you there are some spoilers in it but to start it off i got spanish judges on <UNK> i think it was mention it was the last copy but as i see it wasn't back ordered but either way i have it i thought it was good i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor matthew <UNK> i'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the <UNK> although it is kind of low budget getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending man what a good actor br br the story it about a con artist known as jack matthew <UNK> who claims to have <UNK> called the spanish judges if you don't know what spanish judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read i won't even say what they are i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was he needs protection so he hires a couple who are also crooks max and jamie vincent <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece mark <UNK> junior he has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from mars as she said so they mainly jack call her mars girl everything starts out fine but then it turns to one big game a game that involves some lust lies and betrayal br br there was some over acting in it matt and <UNK> as well as <UNK> were not one of them there were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well some of the score was actually good the theme they used for the beginning and the end before the credits was a good song choice that's my opinion the fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent but what can you do one more comment on matt damn he plays a smooth slick con man br br i know this is a review but i need to make a <UNK> towards <UNK> one of the reviewers <UNK> <UNK> is not a newcomer according to this site she has been acting since 1983 to me and hopefully to others she is well known as charlie <UNK> italian love interest in both the hot shots movies but good review br br although i think it's one of the rare films i've seen and it's really good which is why i gave it 10 stars above i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it br br 8 10
<START> while the songs and dance numbers in general aren't as strong as many would have them be the film's storyline and message are still there and ring out <UNK> above the simple 70s style musical numbers br br keeping in mind that this film was made after the hollywood musical had nearly died out with few exceptions being rock musicals the audiences that went to see it new didn't appreciate the fact that it was a brave attempt at something that hadn't been done to date audiences that see it today will tend to judge it against the films and musicals of today and perhaps the huge all star casts of musicals gone past but to do that to this film or any for that matter is an injustice to the film itself br br there are some good musical moments in the film the first is that of bobby van mr van took his role of harry <UNK> just after closing a 2 year tony nominated for best actor run of the broadway revival no no <UNK> he is a song and dance man from way back and honestly the only one in the cast that was truly talented and experienced for musicals he never misses a step in his question me an answer and rightly so he was totally at home as harry other pleasant numbers are done by olivia <UNK> when she <UNK> the new <UNK> and while the lyrics are weak james shows his strong voice in the family song as well as a nicely done staging of the full piece br br view the film for what it is a fantasy about a place where you never grow old hidden in the ice and snow covered mountains of <UNK> found by a group of unsuspecting modern day people wrapped up in the <UNK> of any modern culture take this and compare it to reality and you get a film that falls short of a goal but take this film for the message of love and peace and <UNK> and <UNK> love and you get a warm and refreshing message and a positive one at that br br to some this film may seem corny to others a welcomed release from the <UNK> pace of reality to the first try to not judge and just enjoy the message to the second you have discovered the secret of <UNK> la
<START> first off this is the worst movie i've ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way it's boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effects br br worse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun <UNK> in a sense of japanese <UNK> and everyone <UNK> the japanese in their hour of need particularly the <UNK> the most noble characters choose going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime minister br br if this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to <UNK> the problem is stop making movies like this
<START> this movie starts out with this creepy song that gave me some chills like the song used in nightmare on it immediately sets the mood the sequence that follows also shows what to expect we are made aware that a ghost is present the mystery concerning this ghost is what keeps this movie together but the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to make sense of it the ideas behind the plot are quite interesting only the way it is told to us is far too abstract i understand that the director believed that he had to maintain the mystery as long as possible the problem is that when certain matters get revealed you never get a satisfying explanation the motives of the important characters are left out and some questions raised in the movie don't get answered at all since we don't learn enough about the characters it becomes hard to care for them and as a consequence you will loose interest only some scares and a twist save this movie from becoming a total failure the twist is interesting but no real shocker the experienced viewer will see it coming some reviewers complain that this movie is too much like <UNK> and is not original at all well it is true that some of the effects and scares are borrowed from that movie but there is a main difference the suspense in <UNK> mainly was based on this one twist where the viewer finds out how the characters get killed in the <UNK> like twist is used as a creepy effect to <UNK> another crazy twist heavily depends on a complex structured plot and twist that doesn't contain enough scares to hold your interest simply put this isn't a scary movie
<START> this is the epitome of bad 80's film making unless you are a pre <UNK> girl riding on a big name like madonna a story line that physically <UNK> one's intelligence and humour that is most suited for a <UNK> school if there was ever any doubt i think this turd of a movie clearly displays <UNK> absolute lack of acting talent and made me feel highly embarrassed on her behalf the only thing i can't believe is that they ever let the director near another movie again madonna spends most of the movie <UNK> around like an <UNK> <UNK> doll and talking like a baby it is painfully obvious that the only reason this movie was ever made was due to the fact that madonna was a big name in pop music at the time do not be <UNK> into seeing this awful attempt to cash in on pop stardom stay away at all costs
<START> great cast great acting great music each character in this movie had their own stories and personalities and it's vivid a great movie not to be missed
<START> in a way you have to respect it's clearly meant as a tribute to the big bug movies of the fifties and while the special effects look terrible at least the film doesn't feature cgi however on the other hand you can't respect the film too much because it's a load of rubbish the acting is terrible the special effects as mentioned are impossible to take seriously and once you've seen one giant spider being blown up you've seen them all so it gets boring rather quickly the plot follows a bunch of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower they go to the only house in the area which just happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used to use as a circus attraction <UNK> around the same time the meteor shower has caused more giant <UNK> to rise from underground all the characters in this film are poor caricatures none of them have anything even resembling a third dimension and they will soon begin to thoroughly bore you you've got to feel for director brett <UNK> as he clearly didn't have much to work with for this film but that doesn't make worth a damn and overall there are better giant bug films than this and therefore doesn't get the seal of <UNK> from me
<START> wow we watched this film in the hopes that it would have at least some decent rock climbing scenes we were disappointed there but it was still a great movie it was <UNK> cheesy it was great i haven't laughed so hard at a movie in a long time if you are into rock climbing and you enjoy cheesy movies then this one is absolutely for you
<START> last night i got to see an early preview <UNK> of <UNK> nation because i love everything that christina <UNK> does i was very excited at first but as the movie continued i started to wonder where it was going based on a true story it is simply about christina <UNK> character and her struggle with depression drugs friends and family as you can probably tell from the title in my opinion this movie moved too fast and it was way too dramatic i would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes and the movie moved through her life extremely fast and this left no room for us to connect with christina <UNK> character christina <UNK> performance was fantastic as always but jessica lange stood out throughout the whole movie and i believe this movie's success will be all because of her and christina <UNK> i would rate this 4 out of 10 and i would suggest you rent this one or read the books by elizabeth they are good and definitely worth checking out
<START> the detective story is not typical for the matrix universe it is a film noir <UNK> private eye story with a strong narrator and a very rich feel rich in terms of its visual appeal the <UNK> scenes the it all <UNK> the eye br br but what about the story it is interesting even if it feels a little out of place the agents hire a detective to track down <UNK> he finds out that they tried the approach before but with <UNK> consequences for the hired detectives still he tries to locate her and eventually succeeds through alice in wonderland references and <UNK> and chat rooms then things begin to get interesting br br all in all this is a perfectly satisfying short animated movie br br 8 10
<START> i would like to say something different about this movie i saw comments how beautiful is russia and the views from russia have been great hey guys this is not russia it's <UNK> more specific the capital <UNK> so this is not russia it's my country about the movie well in <UNK> maybe except the grey zone all movies from american directors are in one word awful like this one of course it's a shame that patrick <UNK> has to play in such a low budget movies most of the actors are but really this movie has no plot twist has no energy what can i say weak and boring movie a cliché not more hey people remember it's not russia in reality it's <UNK>
<START> all those who are into the pc culture are <UNK> at the <UNK> christian view of this film claiming it contains racist and or religious <UNK> br br those who don't care about this but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are <UNK> at the lack of such here br br those who <UNK> both of these are <UNK> that this production was let loose on the general public as <UNK> in comments here br br what is an interesting premise which isn't original but is a combination of ghost and from beyond is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film yet done with gusto what the crew and actors lacked in sensibility professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat <UNK> by the intensity they display br br it isn't nearly as bad as many here think and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense and it is enough below mediocrity to <UNK> laughs and <UNK> however it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout and is close to on par with a corman produced entry of his earliest period of work or the material of <UNK> or sam <UNK> if you get it for 2 or less as did i you won't feel disappointed but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made
<START> the main achievement of this film is that though <UNK> the film still manages to <UNK> out a <UNK> of war portrayals that leave a lasting <UNK> with whoever may view it and whoever was present at this time though good films may have the ability of their subjects which is often a hard thing to do great films have the ability of their subjects which is what this film does br br instead of <UNK> a context of <UNK> the film depicts the japanese in the sick <UNK> of the <UNK> war front in <UNK> 1945 making signs for <UNK> or war but rather making signs of the feelings death destruction victory and sickness of war with the bloody hands of the defeated far different and superior to films such as apocalypse now and full metal jacket both which needed a satirical <UNK> of <UNK> and the american and using all races as one struggle which is fine yet not as grand as a film that uses one race and view which would look fascist if created in america to convey the horror of war and show what it is really like br br the only way the main character makes it through this movie to the end is by being sick <UNK> <UNK> hence through this character through his sickness his saving face we see the end of wwii in the <UNK> in <UNK> of 1945 and the way in which the americans japanese and came together in bloody acts of <UNK> where you live to die br br the film is <UNK> influenced by a <UNK> way of <UNK> portrayal which is original and <UNK> to a viewer whether then or now for the <UNK> techniques it employs conveys all the horrors of war in <UNK> form whether a showcase for <UNK> or like <UNK> zero by <UNK> <UNK> a story emerges from the environment and the conditions associated with it br br the film's opening with the two way discussion between the two japanese soldiers <UNK> and the events through this opening we feel that the struggle is human against human and human with human it shows that they relied on each other to face the enemy in the past battles but now in this opening or of the experiences of the japanese in the <UNK> new information is <UNK> to the main character <UNK> giving a of a cannibal <UNK> on one another if they wish to survive br br the jungle is gritty wet and thick and the sky is not <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> we <UNK> with the though <UNK> and <UNK> as sick as the land around them <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> everywhere every now and then one can not tell if they are bodies rocks or corn apparently there is no difference here all is dead and sick all is dying all they have <UNK> to feed upon are rare monkeys and dead bodies of fallen <UNK> and or <UNK> enemies br br often <UNK> meets a fallen other near death though crushed in spirit and <UNK> his some offer up their bodies for him to eat but he refuses he still like <UNK> as in giants and toys will not into the death of dignity and japanese morals for this is all he really has to hold up for his survival a dignity of self hence when is <UNK> a soldier for <UNK> he shoots him because of it <UNK> may be used to the killing but to the sickness of killing and <UNK> he can't <UNK> he is neither a good man or a bad man he wishes to survive but will not go the extra mile beyond simple straight war killing his self <UNK> dead on the battlefield he isn't happy here to <UNK> and wipe the weak for his survival br br the sickness he <UNK> he sees everywhere in everyone and sadly he lacks the <UNK> <UNK> of thinking either thinking entirely about others since he can't give up his body for them since of his <UNK> or thinking entirely about himself since he sees the sickness in everyone though still killing them even if they do no harm seen in his attack on the two in the <UNK> he can't see anyone no one can see anyone the only see an <UNK> from and an to health the heart of survival instincts br br often an arm appears pointing to the left of the screen towards what must be hope for there in that far lies their freedom yet it is <UNK> by american soldiers leaving the japanese to slowly die in this dirt even a church tower appears <UNK> the light off an unseen sun but on closer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wildly about it religion too is an air of poison br br the japanese title of the film gives more evidence to the themes or feelings of the film the <UNK> to fate the <UNK> of existence under leaders and lives controlled by others its proper translation has a subject of heavy debate among historians as non <UNK> translate it as slave and slavery while many <UNK> argue that was not a slave system but a servant class system that does not meet the <UNK> for slavery a way to typically to escape wrenching poverty this <UNK> upon the war theme and symbolism of br br isn't it important at the time period to ask ourselves what the purpose is of what will become our won history should we be comfortable of letting it without conscious effort for change is it not who we are fighting that age old history question but rather why are we fighting fires on the plain is with <UNK> and mickey curtis based on a novel by <UNK> in japanese with subtitles
<START> the basic premise of is fairly simple several medical students put themselves at the point of death in order to find out exactly what the brain does during the fact it sounds like something a mob of bored students would do for a joke but it forms the basis of some very creepy <UNK> in today's world where hollywood has to mine foreign <UNK> for the ideas to make a horror film is one of those rare gems that show hollywood can make something different when it tries hard enough br br what <UNK> from a lot of films based on this premise that would come out today is that it does not <UNK> to being condescending or arrogant <UNK> that people go to films to be entertained not to in this kind of supernatural thriller the difference this restraint makes is really incredible what's even more incredible is that julia roberts appears without being annoying or <UNK> that she can only play julia roberts the theory of obscurity that performing artists do their best work with the smallest audience is in force here br br the subplots concerning what the characters find during their loss of pretty much everything that makes them alive and how it comes back to <UNK> on their present time are done surprisingly well the moments when william <UNK> character finds his personal <UNK> collection coming back to haunt him are especially intriguing that william baldwin seems so perfectly cast in the role says a lot either about the script or the direction i am not sure which br br <UNK> sutherland on the other hand really shines as the lead one really feels for him as the mystery of what past experience is <UNK> on the present and why unfolds as kevin <UNK> character goes to find an old school <UNK> whose life he made hell and tell her how sorry he is it becomes <UNK> what the film is about we can try to change the past as much as we like but it's what we do with the present that matters most br br another good aspect of is how it achieves an atmosphere without the use of expensive elaborate visual effects quite unusually for what is essentially a horror film did not <UNK> its budget in places where it did not need to much of what we see during the more surreal sequences is a case of professional pretending simple trick photography or stock footage sometimes the <UNK> things are the best br br if there is a problem with the film it's that it feels about ten minutes too short the ending seems more <UNK> than <UNK> as if someone in the studio asked the director to wrap the film up so they can bring it out at a certain market time of course many films have been left with sore spots for this very reason so shouldn't really need to be any different the hundred and fifteen minutes we do get is highly satisfactory though not overly brilliant br br i gave a seven out of ten it works well as a date flick or a kind of late night popcorn film that aside it makes a good reminder that low budget horror shows weren't always sad pieces of garbage
<START> yes this film is another remake yes this film can be considered a chick flick and yes this film is not perfect the women is however a clever modern update on the social <UNK> of all women with an impressive cast of a including meg ryan debra messing <UNK> <UNK> and bette midler br br the film revolves around four main characters mary ryan her best friend editor in chief <UNK> <UNK> alex <UNK> <UNK> smith and edie debra messing and the out of this world female creature who is responsible for most of the film's drama named crystal eva <UNK> mary is trying to deal with her cheating husband who's never actually seen in the film by following the advice of both her friends and her mother <UNK> <UNK> br br aside from mary there's <UNK> who's torn between her social life and her professional life she has decisions to make that test her moral and <UNK> values then there's writer alex who's a lesbian with a lot of <UNK> but knows her way with words and finally edie with four girls and another baby on the way who loves children and has a heart of gold with a hidden secret revealed at the end br br together the women live for revenge rely on each other and give each other life lessons but it's the cameos by bette midler <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> carrie fisher and <UNK> that show the cruel and usual behavior of women <UNK> plays <UNK> mother she's tough silver <UNK> experienced and yet feels she could have become what her daughter does later there's fisher who shows how to blackmail and test the boundaries of <UNK> morals and betrayal the <UNK> girl that shows no mercy for what she says and whom she says it to <UNK> who plays <UNK> sassy <UNK> she knows her place when and where she's needed and how to deliver a good one liner finally there's midler who plays <UNK> miller a crazy <UNK> but wise hollywood agent she's the one character who gives <UNK> mary an <UNK> on who she truly is by discovering what do i want despite <UNK> scene stealing performance and memorable quotes she was underused br br but back to the film together the women show the audience what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what you want until the time comes when you answer that very own question it <UNK> <UNK> what it means to be a woman fierce ruthless bad ass tacky smart sly clever shy proud <UNK> self conscious <UNK> beautiful strong independent and also what it is that women want why are women the way they are it's funny modern and by all means not a masterpiece but the bottom line is it's worth the money and time to see veteran and younger actresses teach us all about women
<START> two hands is an entertaining funny story about australian <UNK> the screenplay <UNK> the world of fast money and deadly acts with the of fate and <UNK> in a subtle way we are asked to <UNK> the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes the forces of fate and <UNK> take jimmy the main character into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and ultimately an understanding of a more personally promising world br br the clueless jimmy portrayed with <UNK> by heath ledger is a kid who grew up without opportunity the high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his <UNK> senses the love and help of friends <UNK> him to a higher <UNK> br br the film is well directed and well acted the band of criminals <UNK> between likable and despicable keeping us interested in their crazy antics all through the film
<START> all the hype all the adds i was <UNK> that i missed this on the big screen where this film worked was in the little details in everything else it failed arnold has done so many better performances in the past few years i thought the days of <UNK> and last action hero were gone from our lives sadly this film <UNK> to the lowest common <UNK> and <UNK> arnold to a <UNK> <UNK> face muscle that just knows how to shoot guns and blow things up in a cliche last moment and at one other time that was predictable from the start we see a <UNK> of the actor that has <UNK> he is more than what he got paid for early in his career i was <UNK> with the film as it never broke new ground or went anywhere but where you expected it to
<START> ok where do i start i saw a screening a couple weeks ago and i was shocked how bad this movie is sure if you just love beverly <UNK> and green <UNK> bad acting and you think they are the best tv shows on air then you will definitely love this movie me personally i really like <UNK> work and he is very talented but comedy is not his <UNK> some people are natural in comedy and i am sure he is great funny to work with personally but comedy he can not pull it off on the big screen it was a cute movie but would i pay 12 00 to see it h ll no now that i have seen it i would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money george buddy i love you but please don't do any more comedies this script is lacking a lot great concept but just didn't do it

<START> my suggestion this movie was really intended to be a comedy wasn't it if not the producers directors actors hair should really choose another career now the <UNK> of my <UNK> requires a minimum of 10 lines how in the world can i add any more to this hmm let me see oh yes the beginning of the movie was quite hilarious with the crash landing scene too bad that the plane didn't hit the <UNK> truck a bunch of martians would have <UNK> out from the <UNK> obviously hiding and decided to take over the world planet and make a better movie now that would have been a great beginning br br t
<START> i thought that eastwood's most unusual role was that in the bridges of madison county but that was until i saw the <UNK> he manages to pull it off giving a very good performance and so does the rest of the cast the direction is imaginative given that the film was made in 1971 and had there not been some plot holes which the director seems to struggle to cover up at times we would be talking about an excellent film it remains powerful nonetheless br br 8
<START> first off i just watched a movie on showtime called survival island it says it was a 2006 movie with billy zane and since i like him and couldn't sleep i thought i would check it out looked interesting watched it and decided to look up on the imdb who was this new face juan <UNK> <UNK> pace and <UNK> i could not believe it this movie has been <UNK> three and will be a new movie it is playing again in 1 <UNK> and 30 mins on showtime channel again and this date is may 28 and or florida time you can check your showtime <UNK> by title and see it i wont get into details so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water taking it all off you see her naked body when she runs back out of the water you see her <UNK> on funny there are a lot of other mess ups too i can't believe by coincidence i decided to look up this movie go figure wonder if the people <UNK> it sold it to some movie studio to put out but it is already playing on showtime ha ha good laugh i give it 1 1 2 stars c d movie
<START> 1940's cartoon banned nowadays probably because of the <UNK> <UNK> gag in which <UNK> rides a black person as if it were a horse br br the whole story takes place in a <UNK> where the characters of the books come to life every evening so we have among others the ugly duck <UNK> and the wolf of they wind up in a chase after the wolf tricked <UNK> with a phony duck hence the title br br and chase is all there is in this little cartoon that doesn't have any real appeal nowadays only fun if you're a true fan of the looney tunes i guess br br 4 10

<START> it's unbelievable but the fourth is better than the second and the third after the third that was awful it's incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new ideas chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movies interesting the final that lets know that a fifth can be done
<START> dark <UNK> 3 scarecrow 1 out of 10 in <UNK> theory of <UNK> time is of the perspective of the one that views time or so i've heard in other words this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change even on fast forward and you will be reaching for that fast forward button it <UNK> in somewhere around eternity br br if you are familiar with own version of project <UNK> this is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local wal mart you will not be surprised by the complete and utter lack of entertainment value contained within br br the line reading i refuse to call it acting is uniformly awful this is a collection of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> pretending to be in a movie between <UNK> of <UNK> the camera work is drunken father shooting vacation film quality and while the special effects are okay the scariest effect is the breast <UNK> in the nude scene br br the story is awful the sets are from a haunted halloween put on by <UNK> middle school students and once again the line reading remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming is distracting beyond mere words avoid

<START> you can see that if the flick ain't directed by his brother this is the best he can do and sad to say his best just doesn't cut it ice cream man is a very bizarre horror film that's a real blast to watch if you're in the right mood in the wrong mood it has been known to cause people to <UNK> out violently at loved ones so please watch with caution br br clint howard stars does anything really star clint howard though as the evil psychotic bizarre yes all in quotes he's not quite any of these but he's getting close ice cream man who <UNK> the local children with bomb pops that are really <UNK> and ice cream that has chopped up humans and dogs in them <UNK> br br anyway the <UNK> really just an excuse to show of the well the um well it's a plot oh wait i know it's an excuse to show off all the loser actor cameos there's jan michael vincent and lee <UNK> ii the sequel as cops tracking the <UNK> man <UNK> ice cream and even doug appears as a supermarket clerk br br even better than that are some of the bizarre goofs in the film i really like the fact that for some reason instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unhappy fat kid of the group they just make this one kid wearing padding under his clothes and the entire premise that anyone would by <UNK> of ice cream from a ice cream man who buys ice cream <UNK> from the ice cream man then there's the entire psychiatric ward scene in which jan michael <UNK> acting <UNK> from mildly interested to bored beyond the state of consciousness these are the cops who also the ice cream man's place for clues but manage to complete <UNK> over the ice cream truck where of course the various bodies and such are kept oh well better luck next time troops br br howard himself overacts like he's making sure people two towns over can see and hear him it's all just plain dumb and fairly fun to laugh at in the fine tradition of the or <UNK> you'll have a good laugh with the right sense of humor i love that one br br
<START> if you are ever in the mood for a truly terrible film it would be hard to find something that could even compare to this i have spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the sheer joy i get from it and man this is one of the worst this movie was so bad i had to buy the third online that one wasn't as bad which is amazing since it was straight to video this is one of those films that is hard to comprehend how it was made in the first place i mean someone had to actually have read the script or many scripts i'm sure they made several <UNK> and said yeah that's it here's some money actually they probably just wanted to make a <UNK> 2 before they even had a script then went with whatever they had <UNK> horrible so if you are a fan of really bad movies watch this one it is a true classic and film doesn't get much worse than this and if it does please let me know
<START> before miracle on <UNK> street maureen o'hara and john payne made this this this film i was going to describe it but can't find words for how badly this film turned out the subject matter of <UNK> a child and <UNK> illness are both very serious and sensitive issues but that notwithstanding this could have been done a whole lot better than it was it was so extreme in its portrayal that it didn't come across as real at all probably its problem started with a weak script br br another example of a screenwriter taking a novel and writing a weak movie see my review of a stranger in my arms the beautiful o'hara was often <UNK> with <UNK> like this another being forbidden street <UNK> which i may review eventually br br if you have any emotional ties to this from childhood you'll be <UNK> to this rather lifeless <UNK> and lackluster film but for something along the lines of this maybe you can find its tv movie remake it has to be better it has to be
<START> i watch crap like this all the way through to see if there are any <UNK> qualities whatsoever to justify including it in my <UNK> video <UNK> don't you watch this not even a minute of it unless someone has a gun to your head you will as i did <UNK> <UNK> at least 500 times and pray that one of the one dimensional characters all played by really bad actors would turn and shoot you dead br br even if you are the biggest sandra <UNK> fan in the world it is not worth even watching the two or three short scenes in which she appears br br i want to kick the <UNK> of the sleazy marketing people who put <UNK> huge picture on the face of this dvd box and have them thrown in jail for <UNK> me or something like that i really wish i had the chance to read a review of this film before i bought it br br please give me a call and i will pay you 10 to remove this movie immediately from my <UNK> before it stinks up the whole place just kidding please don't call
<START> i watched this movie on tv last night hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an <UNK> of some highly disease i was disappointed and i think the movie was garbage it did not seem real to me some of the acting was awful in particular that of the doctor she was about the worst i've seen the whole thing played like a <UNK> <UNK> case <UNK> even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn't seem sincere i have seen some disaster movies in particular those weather ones which are actually so bad they are amusing this one is almost as bad but it is not even amusing it is tedious and boring don't bother with this one
<START> it was an interesting and entertaining movie well worth watching the acting was decent but it may be out of date for some people i was glad to see cast members of such highly acclaimed movies as raging bull and <UNK> in this movie a great and dramatic ending and pretty good writing
<START> right on i totally <UNK> with all your sentiments and add these i came to my pc especially to post a comment on this dreadful minus movie i was going to say that in this day and age i am at a loss to comprehend how anyone could possibly make such a <UNK> movie but you beat me to it anyone reading this and comment trust me don't waste you time and money it's an absolute shocker the acting is totally pathetic the script is way worse and the so called special effects are a joke surely no one actually invested money to make this movie i really cannot think of anything else to say about this so called horror sci fi product but must pad this commentary to make 10 lines of comment in order to have it accepted for <UNK>
<START> there are times i am convinced that the is the best sullivan gilbert opera ever but that is only so long as i'm not listening to be that as it may the is probably the most frequently filmed of the operas yes i put the composer first nobody says <UNK> and <UNK> or hart and <UNK> or and <UNK> or what's his face and <UNK> you don't even hear the names of for or gilbert was just the bigger name and the bigger ego at the time so they put his name first it's time that silly practice was put to rest br br anyway the is a <UNK> s g <UNK> it has some of <UNK> numbers combined with some of <UNK> <UNK> lyrics it has an interesting book and <UNK> dialogue it's got a wonderful degree of <UNK> and it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical <UNK> br br this particular production filmed in a live performance in 1990 turns its imagination toward striking simplicity set in a british <UNK> resort toward the end of the art period it throws over the of the original entirely the result is <UNK> and setting in an eye <UNK> <UNK> of whites grey and blacks <UNK> by occasional bits of red and less frequent uses of yellow and green it takes some getting used to but it's really <UNK> of course when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of japan you would be right to <UNK> oh <UNK> <UNK> did i just say that it's most <UNK> that this fine production is now on dvd however one <UNK> the print seems to be photographed through a glass of <UNK> clarity so that the expected <UNK> of the image is <UNK> and ever so slightly fuzzy the tendency to <UNK> images is alas annoying why do people who are doing a really <UNK> production want to <UNK> it up with artsy <UNK> stuff of that sort but it's the performance that counts the most we may skip the <UNK> since although one is performed sullivan never wrote one true it may be so he wrote none for any of the but the <UNK> doesn't even date from <UNK> lifetime and was <UNK> by <UNK> the techniques used in the others as for the rest of the <UNK> it's first rate and <UNK> funny br br the <UNK> <UNK> here is the <UNK> eric <UNK> who does it credit there is a tradition of bringing a big name into the role the was a u s tv production years ago in which <UNK> <UNK> was played by <UNK> marx with mixed results <UNK> performance is delightfully quirky he does taken from a county jail <UNK> by a <UNK> his i've got a little list is done as a speech to a <UNK> of course it has the usual updated lyrics which are much funnier than the usual run of such things and his delivery is positively hysterical it goes on that way throughout br br in this <UNK> it's important to have a good it's just no fun if you're not being at in style this has a fabulous in <UNK> <UNK> in her way almost as big a name as <UNK> she <UNK> with the best of them in a wonderful rich wonderful especially for a soprano and her costume not to mention her <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> apparently accompanying poo is played by i have trouble getting around is somewhat un <UNK> <UNK> but is voice is undeniably a solid rich addition to the vocal palette there is a nice touch during a <UNK> where the chorus <UNK> with <UNK> to the mention of his nancy on his <UNK> bear in mind the <UNK> about <UNK> be that as it may is a fine singing actor and if his appearance doesn't put the best face on poo his performance does br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly she and do lovely <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mark richardson plays his persona as something a and does it very well poo <UNK> richard van allan is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water a role later done to death in american sitcoms you know <UNK> <UNK> forced to <UNK> to <UNK> children that sort of thing the richard is bloody marvelous with an <UNK> voice at absolute <UNK> with his ridiculous lyrics br br i don't recommend you get this as your only get a good traditional production as well so you can see what gilbert intended more or less in terms of staging that being said i'll watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once on the whole this is a terrific offering a vocal and visual delight with delicious over acting it's a dvd to treasure with <UNK> like <UNK> tap dancing <UNK> and all watch for the <UNK> with signs
<START> count me as being one who is happy to see no <UNK> in this episode the poor man's dr watson does nothing for me as he simply drags down every scene he's in <UNK> is often necessary to the story as the representative of <UNK> and a little miss <UNK> is fine for <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> from painfully dim to over mannered in different episodes if i have to sit through one more vacuous oh i say there i'll take the gas <UNK> br br as a general rule the more <UNK> you get in a <UNK> story the better every line for <UNK> is one taken away from <UNK> and i've never read the books so i really don't care about <UNK> to <UNK> characters a lot of viewers reviewers seem to have a problem with <UNK> the movies from the books if you want the book as written then read it i don't see the point of watching the television version if you know what will come next at every stage theatre is not <UNK> don't expect a <UNK>
<START> this is species already <UNK> into a beautiful model <UNK> may a <UNK> baby with an urge to kiss and kill br br the movie begins with a strong launch and infected by a bore virus throughout the middle to end br br the weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot story as you should have compared it natasha species got the same plot but adds up much interesting side plot and not mentioning good actions and strong ending br br this explain why patrick stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in star trek next generation he wanted to find more models in glass cage floating inside <UNK> <UNK> br br a must see for a science fiction fans
<START> this film is worth seeing since it is a classic in the sense of being the very first full length film released in the process of three it was not very good in its acting or story plot but can be a great movie <UNK> question from an historical standpoint it should be seen in the 3 d process with <UNK> <UNK>
<START> recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged film by director <UNK> at the 2002 toronto international film festival i have <UNK> my highest honour of the film festival on this feature make sure that you do not let an opportunity to experience this cinematic gem pass you by but be this film will make you shed a tear if you belong to the species known as <UNK> a 10
<START> the premise of this movie of a comedian talk show host running for president as an independent just to shake things up is funny entertaining brilliant and even a bit inspiring thought about the west wing debate when tom <UNK> leaves his <UNK> thought about steven <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> good times the first 15 20 minutes of this movie are therefore very very entertaining the debate especially when he eventually <UNK> elected it's a pity that is because of a computer <UNK> you'd want him to win fair although that is unrealistic br br but after that this movie goes completely downhill i thought we'd get a great movie like 1993 in which we see how it would out if a comedian actually ran the country instead the movie turns from comedy into a thriller a romantic comedy and a drama and does none good the computer <UNK> becomes the main storyline which really sucks boy is this disappointing i give it 3 stars just for the premise and because i actually managed to watch this movie from start to end without stopping it which is usually a good thing with me
<START> the <UNK> producers are hoping that cameron name will help sell this picture unfortunately nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen despite some beautifully shot european locations and some solid production design elements the film fails mostly due to its awkward unbelievable romance between <UNK> and <UNK> an <UNK> experience
<START> how does this movie suck as a fan of michael work on the sopranos i picked this up at blockbuster based on his name and a story that sounded like it had promise it still does but this movie doesn't fulfill it br br every turn of the story is entirely predictable i kept looking for the lifetime bug on the bottom right corner of the screen it's all there the noble woman coming out of hard times the guy failing to live up to his potential despite her best efforts the kid who gets stuck in the middle etc etc etc the mysterious <UNK> identity is what really made me want to throw stuff at the tv i would have been more satisfied with little waking up and realizing it was all a dream br br the filmmakers may as well have had a the moral of the story is bit before the credits since as another reviewer pointed out this thing really does roll like an <UNK> special don't <UNK> don't drink don't do drugs stay with your wife spend time with your kids come on how about a little nuance how about some interesting bad guys writer director a w should be <UNK> out for special notice not only is the dialogue <UNK> the pacing within dialogue and at either end of many scenes makes this movie at least 45 minutes longer than it needs to be and believe me it feels like longer the talents of <UNK> <UNK> and some of the supporting cast steve <UNK> <UNK> are the only things that keep this from a 1 rating all of their good work is nearly <UNK> though by the atrocious job of portraying the boy not sure if it was a casting mistake hey it's a mob movie so let's cast someone from <UNK> clues who can't do anything but over <UNK> with a big fake grin next let's cast the <UNK> brooding kid in the disney flick or just awful directing but those scenes are really painful to watch br br i'd be interested in another <UNK> take on this character and his story it's a shame <UNK> has already been used up by this flick awful awful awful
<START> i saw <UNK> when it was released in the 70s it was one of those pictures that received an x rating for violence we <UNK> into our local <UNK> and saw it anyway pretty good picture lots of blood from the street fights although the cheap sound effects for the punches took something away from it and lots of sex i remember one of the early scenes when <UNK> meets this pretty brunette in an apartment she is showing him without saying a word he picks her up puts her in the and nails her from what i remember the picture <UNK> from that point on so when i found out bogart is also called black fist and was available on vhs i ordered it online i was very disappointed black fist is <UNK> edited for television so many of the scenes i remember were missing i wondered if indeed this was the same picture
<START> while the <UNK> was certainly funky perhaps one dutch roll short of stoned the premise of the film was fantastic it really took a <UNK> satirical in the true traditional of hal hartley look at god jesus and devil the interaction of jesus and satan provides some hilarious scenes even the monologues of jesus were great this was by far the best jesus i've even seen so <UNK> like son of god ish but still such a nice guy on one level this is a very general look on the <UNK> of christianity but yet there is still a personal level where you can relate to jesus christ without having a god complex <UNK> to martin <UNK> and hal hartley
<START> i read the above comment and cannot believe it of course its a children's movie its an adaptation of a children's book this film is easy to get a hold of try play com or amazon and its very easy to gain a copy the jokes are hilarious for kids and adults alike and the adventure is clean with no violence its completely suitable for children of all ages the songs are <UNK> and yes a little repetitive but thats what children need and whilst watching it my little ones were heard singing hi hi all night they loved it a story of innocence and friendship very lovely and well worth watching for kids and adults of all ages
<START> if you first saw this movie with mary of the fourth form then it's perhaps possible for the <UNK> of nostalgia to encourage your <UNK> side if not it doesn't stand a chance the young <UNK> is complete nonsense people may have used the occasional word you'll hear here but not huge of them in sentence after sentence it doesn't so much date dracula ad 1972 as blow it to pieces from the moment anyone under thirty opens their mouth it's impossible to take the film seriously and as for it being a laugh it's not even a smile the idea of throwing dracula into modern times is a good one and worthy of a far stronger script than don <UNK> can provide the river <UNK> and <UNK> male are no match for puppet bats model <UNK> and terrified extras but you can't help but feel that with better writing it would have been so different
<START> i love this movie despite the fact it just misses being great it's an adult entertainment full of issues that a grown person can relate to the acting is superb it's fun watching john cassavetes and gena rowlands as a <UNK> middle aged couple who knows how much of it came from their own marriage susan sarandon has never been <UNK> or more appealing than as her <UNK> character <UNK> <UNK> julia is a hoot as a <UNK> the scenery in <UNK> is spectacular the new york settings cause me to <UNK> due to many shots of the world trade center fantastic score by with so many things going for it why isn't this a great film it's a bit rambling and overly long <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> between humor and drama still it's engaging entertaining and deeply thoughtful
<START> by far the most racist and cartoon for children 7 kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress talk and act like the characters portrayed i am disappointed in <UNK> and nick jr for <UNK> to air this terrible program the <UNK> brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers they should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon usually the young <UNK> start off working in movies and doing voice overs for cartoons and then as they grow older they move up to programs for young adults a good example is nick cannon he first started out with appearing in all that later on he starred in <UNK> ii then <UNK> and now his tv show nick cannon presents wild <UNK> out where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes this comment was originally for but i wanted to show examples of how <UNK> kids watched on tv not long ago can become those who get involved with non kid friendly programs it is very sad that this happens but all <UNK> change and grow up it is just the opposite with the <UNK> brothers new cartoon it is bad enough we have to deal with all the bad people from the <UNK> with allowing the young generation watch this program it will just <UNK> the kids with possibilities to the ones who don't have a chance at a good life just my feelings on this cartoon and my beliefs on what will happen to our children if they were to watch it
<START> when i first heard about this movie i noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s i noticed the music was by <UNK> john so i figured i had nothing to loose so i got it what a surprise the movie was awesome it was true love is all about the characters paul and michelle had no <UNK> no money and sometimes no food yet they were still happy i recommended this film to all my friends but they all my tastes and even called me names <UNK> the movie featured two <UNK> naked i think that only made the movie more realistic the cinematography was great and it only come to show the great abilities of director lewis gilbert
<START> i really didn't like this film it was boring and didn't interest me that much at all i'm more of an action girl and it had none i went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left but was totally <UNK> don't get this movie unless you like the <UNK> and plenty of boredom i just really didn't like the movie it wasn't my style but it could be yours you would just have to watch the previews or something but it's my recommendation if you're a girl don't get this movie this <UNK> production draws on some of the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> allowing us to reflect on <UNK> and <UNK> of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping <UNK> this just isn't for me
<START> don't believe the hype br br i had to see why all the critics <UNK> over this movie i have seen it and still don't get it the plot is thin very thin after the movie was over i still did not know the female lead characters name and one of the two male characters did not even have a name in the credits he is credited as the farmer i did not care about the characters so i did not care about the movie br br the scenery and cinematography were brilliant but so is the stuff on national <UNK> or the discovery channel br br i can not recommend this movie to anyone
<START> i was very concerned about this film it was <UNK> to play at a jewish film festival and was reported to be very hostile to israel while using clever humor and irony br br i was <UNK> that the film was not a <UNK> however as a work of film it was deeply disappointing the film was full of random events some of which eventually connected most of which did not some of the events were very clever and funny but some were merely random and pointless br br there are repeated scenes between two lovers where they sit in a car and play some game perhaps in some cultures this is erotic but it's like watching thumb wrestling after the third time it really became tiresome br br i have always found david lynch to be <UNK> bizarre using strange stories and images to cause audiences to think that he is so sophisticated that they don't grasp his work in fact there is nothing to grasp the same is true here the stories do not add up to anything and there is not much of a political point being made in one scene a <UNK> israeli soldier <UNK> palestinian drivers at a <UNK> that's news br br i don't understand why this film has garnered controversy nor why it has garnered attention it is an inferior work and seeing it was a waste of time
<START> and 1 2 stars out of <UNK> is one of the strangest films i've ever seen so ridiculous yet at the time it's strangely compelling and never the least bit dull whether it's due to the <UNK> nudity the large amount of violence and action it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hours of cinema br br the <UNK> has been sent to investigate <UNK> <UNK> when they <UNK> something hiding inside the coma of the giant rock a small team led by colonel steve <UNK> has been sent to search the area what they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat like creatures and three nude and seemingly unconscious <UNK> beings inside strange <UNK> <UNK> two male and one female <UNK> may they decide to take all three back with them which results in a catastrophe br br when london receives no response from the crew another crew is sent to find out what's going on when they <UNK> with the <UNK> they find the remains of the crew all <UNK> beyond recognition the <UNK> are still in perfect condition and they take them back to london br br after various <UNK> the scientists still don't know what these beings really are then late one night a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room the female is being held he touches her shoulder and she <UNK> stands up and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked manner she approaches him and begins to kiss him when it becomes clear that she's actually taking his <UNK> sucking him of all of his energy the effect is slightly cheesy br br she escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind another man colonel caine peter <UNK> is brought in to track her down then the men discover that there is a pattern to the <UNK> process the corpse of the security guard <UNK> in 2 hours and takes the <UNK> of a doctor it seems in every 2 hours this process is repeated by a victim with the help of the <UNK> sole survivor they attempt to track the girl down before it's too late br br <UNK> is pretty good late night entertainment it has all the elements one could look for in such a movie loads of nudity blood gore and plenty of special effects this is certainly better than a similarly plotted film species thanks in large part to a more riveting finale br br the performances range from decent to terrible <UNK> the worst is easily steve <UNK> who overacts to no end much better are peter <UNK> who comes through and convincingly and the gorgeous <UNK> may she's as beautiful as french actresses sophie and <UNK> <UNK> may does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without <UNK> and looking uncomfortable is impressive there are times when she can be quite creepy being simply seductive most of the film manages to work because of her br br
<START> i got this thing off the sci fi shelf because i remembered seeing the first of the series when i was a kid i'd rented the second one and it was a decent b sci fi this one was out right obnoxious the special effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done the two assistant female <UNK> were so terrible that i literally <UNK> every time they came on the screen the plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick i don't know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but i'm sure that they'd have done better to have left it at 2 movies the movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible i only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device
<START> it's bad for ya really showcases more of george <UNK> talents he really is still as sharp as a <UNK> it is a shame that we lost him this past year but his comedy will forever live on this stand up special is literally one of the funniest i have ever heard a comedian perform even though he is making fun of small children it just makes you laugh the way he says some of the stuff it is true that <UNK> can literally make something that seems unfunny and turn it into one of the funniest things you have ever and will ever hear i really enjoyed this stand up particularly from <UNK> and recommend that those that liked this check out more of george <UNK> stand up
<START> i absolutely loved this movie it's my number one favorite although there were a few flaws what movie doesn't have flaws this movie was very well written directed and produced the characters in this movie are very real and believable they made all of the characters fit into a specific role i think that the most apparent thing about here on earth was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations brought into the movie it's not one of those movies where you just can't seem to relate to anything because in it are situations that everyone is or has been in there are so many different things going on in this movie that it is hard not to relate to it i am just 18 years old and i can even relate to it it was heart warming and wrenching at the same time here on earth will make you laugh cry and sometimes angry i give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion
<START> there is only one word that describes this film bad i have no idea why this movie was even made or how they got dennis hopper to star in this film stuart gordon is a better director than this and hopper is a much better actor the film is plain stupid i did like the square pigs idea and there was an interesting love scene involving a cyborg other than that avoid this film at all costs
<START> dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a horribly <UNK> woman when one of her colleagues discovers a <UNK> formula <UNK> sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful when she's denied the drug because of possible side effects she kills her colleague to get what she wants the drug works and she becomes beautiful but the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her br br have you ever heard the expression as exciting as watching paint dry that pretty much sums up during the film one of the characters <UNK> the line something so horrible it's <UNK> i wasn't sure if he was talking about something in movie or the movie itself i'm really disappointed because i had high hopes for this one had possibilities but they're never realized at every opportunity the plot has <UNK> do the <UNK> things imaginable the writing is horrible and part of the problem is <UNK> she's not that appealing and cannot carry the film on her own br br another big problem with is the direction and editing it's a mess we see things and places that have no bearing on anything in the movie the camera <UNK> on shots too long after the scene is over i can't think of a single shot that would call anything but unoriginal this group of filmmakers <UNK> little in the way of imagination or talent br br i may not be familiar with the italian comic on which is supposedly based but i'm sure it's got to be better than this
<START> this movie tries its <UNK> to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel br br quirky and obnoxious characters a few quirky town with quirky folk a quirky coffee shop or restaurant coffee shop here lots of shots of canadian stuff for <UNK> ocean stuff here lots of mention of gotta get out of this town downright <UNK> br br and it succeeds on all counts br br something to note though i couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post northern exposure quirky comedy or something surreal like a drug induced or psychotic <UNK> the editing of this movie jumped around from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping take for instance the very opening shots of yelling teens in a car who are they and what the h did they have to do with anything and this sub uh plot use that word plot loosely kids that seem to span generations i don't think they actually do but the editing makes it look like they <UNK> from flashback all of a sudden to current time huh what did i miss br br avoid unless for laughs or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing
<START> it's a unique film as it gives us our only chance to see the young <UNK> coward in all his ironic glory because he seems so reserved detached he's perfect for the role of an <UNK> <UNK> who matter of <UNK> uses all those around him however in the deadly serious no pun intended last act when coward must make like the flying <UNK> he's much less comfortable br br but his way with an <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> macarthur have given him some gems macarthur really he was the wit of the pair br br the film is superbly <UNK> by the great lee <UNK> but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence <UNK> and cared about one thing getting their dialogue on screen note h m themselves have blink and you'll miss 'em cameos as <UNK> in the <UNK> scene br br the most notable supporting player is the one and only alexander notorious broadway <UNK> and close friend of both macarthur and coward who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of <UNK> coward br br curious that would agree to do a film that clearly <UNK> the legendary round table of which he was a <UNK> and macarthur something of an <UNK> member br br the <UNK> actually won an oscar for best story though that victory is probably due more to <UNK> <UNK> presence than any brilliance in the plot it's coward and the dialogue you remember
<START> cuba gooding jr will win the oscar for best actor in 2003 and ed harris will win for best supporting actor what a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of <UNK> because if this film doesn't get to you then you have ice water in your <UNK> br br it was 1976 the setting was in south <UNK> and the civil rights act was about ten years old we have a white high school football coach and teacher ed harris then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow cuba gooding whose greatest <UNK> including a radio are <UNK> into a shopping <UNK> which is also used as his <UNK> br br ed harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film he gives cuba the <UNK> radio and what follows is an riveting engrossing poignant exploration of the human soul br br the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece
<START> it's not plot driven ok it's not a character study fine there's no action alright there's no point hmmm br br maybe it's supposed to represent the boredom and absurdity of living in and parts of israel these days in a state of violence petty <UNK> deep <UNK> <UNK> etc but mostly it's long long scenes of nothing happening or things which look like they're dripping with meaning a <UNK> tower crashing to the ground an balloon floating into <UNK> a <UNK> tiger women bullets into a <UNK> but when you try to <UNK> some meaning there's no there there br br bonus you can watch this film in fast forward and it will make absolutely no difference except that it might be slightly less boring
<START> stanwyck at her villainous best robinson her equal as ruthless land in this fairly ordinary western br br some good action scenes strong use of location colour and <UNK> but why the obvious use of stock footage in the <UNK> scene br br ford is <UNK> as always and foster is strong as <UNK> daughter but it is the <UNK> film and it's not just stanwyck and robinson brian keith makes a surprisingly dashing villain as <UNK> lover and richard <UNK> is unforgettable as a cold hearted killer br br see it for the camp value
<START> we're both stumbling around together in this <UNK> world whose rules and <UNK> are largely unknown seemingly <UNK> or even possibly nonexistent always on the verge of being killed by forces that we don't understand so says ted in the film which for some people sums up life and probably is a film about existence what is real and what is unreal and how you tell the difference or not the last line of the film is superbly ambiguous br br the film seems like a shaggy dog story indeed it has a real shaggy dog in it but it takes you along on an interesting ride full of provocative <UNK> touches that will make you look at <UNK> game <UNK> fish <UNK> and bones in a new light some bits are quite <UNK> it takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called and a chinese restaurant is called <UNK> restaurant 'the film has an engrossing <UNK> that is <UNK> away from your usual big budget science fiction movie you can read many things into the film and it <UNK> watching more than once br br the main actors are jude law who is ok and jennifer jason leigh who is great some roles don't suit this very talented actor but when she has a good role like this she is <UNK> her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice suits the part of looks great in a short black <UNK> too there are other familiar actors but they are not given much to do it looks good sounds good and a howard shore score <UNK> the film very well <UNK> is possibly the alfred hitchcock of the sci fi horror genre no matter what film he makes he is always worth watching
<START> in efforts to make a somewhat comedic yet serious movie about the art of growing marijuana stephen <UNK> director fell a few <UNK> rips short of a good movie while the cast is nothing short of amazing this movie is extremely hard to sit through the acting of billy bob <UNK> ryan <UNK> jon bon <UNK> hank <UNK> and kelly lynch couldn't even save this movie from failure it would be <UNK> to <UNK> three single dollar bills down the toilet then to check this movie out at the local video store br br
<START> hoot was terrific the <UNK> are adorable and the movie highlights an interesting <UNK> issue i didn't know existed florida is full of so many fun characters and the film does a great job of bringing that to the screen my kids particularly loved all the different animals from snakes to <UNK> to <UNK> it's really a simple story but also one that they need to hear at this age when kids are young that's when they really develop their sense of values and yes one of those must be caring for our environment and all the creatures that live in it i think it was great that the film even <UNK> a conversation with them on the ride home about animals and how to help them it was just truly sweet and enduring to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the baby birds anyway overall it was really a great time and i'd recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining and meaningful
<START> this has got to be one of the most magnificent things i've ever seen on film i don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be but that hardly matters this film is extreme absolutely wild and surreal the <UNK> and the marketing only make it more so because you know that ever so often some mother has to <UNK> her kid to accept our reality after he <UNK> this out from the video store expecting something completely different look at the for one thing and where else in america can you see a ten year old kid swear as much as this one does and then get his eye ripped out by <UNK> the rival of pulp <UNK> <UNK> and that food inspector scene is the best the amount of well known to vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things about it soon much sooner than you realize you too will find yourself saying is that meat <UNK> is that drew barrymore is that the doctor from star trek voyager is that flea is that the owner from twin peaks <UNK> <UNK> with car <UNK> and isn't this guy from the new rob zombie movie he looks an awful lot like shrek i think my favorite scene is at the very end with phil in a full body cast i mean please why aren't more movies like this shown in <UNK> this director hardly has anything else to his name higher than return to <UNK> lot but he displays true stumbling man child genius in this creation if you're an intellectual looking for something to p s away your evening on i highly suggest this film for satisfaction this movie's plot is all too ridiculous but imagine it taken out of context boy arm wrestling an over aggressive meat <UNK> who seems hell bent on taking out his anger at not being accepted into guns n <UNK> looks over his shoulder and sees the doctor from voyager enter the bar can you imagine what any half <UNK> channel <UNK> active through the last six years would think of seeing that now imagine if you actually cared about meat <UNK> or voyager to begin with or imagine if you're a flea fan rocky horror picture show fans this film contains notable music mind you but its soundtrack is more <UNK> than mad max 3 what does that <UNK> for you this is the retarded <UNK> <UNK> cousin sister mother puppy of the rocky horror picture show how about when <UNK> flies back onto his arm in an act of cable access special effects quality when i saw this film it was on the suggestion of my cousin who had watched half of it in a fit of half aware childhood in the early half of the nineties and who has since been haunted by vague memories of it i myself had not slept in three days it made me laugh of course it's also an anxiety movie the music doesn't encourage the suspense but it eventually gets to the point where it's been fully established that the american censorship <UNK> has obviously missed this film entirely and absolutely anything can happen in it and probably will any time gus turns a corner or the view so much as changes camera angles i found myself <UNK> over the possibility of those cards flying out his window at any second watch this movie awesome
<START> you could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie the first one had an original story the second stole one from king kong and in the end i hope of this trilogy the story seemed to have been <UNK> altogether drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives that was about all there was to it the special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars if you have a <UNK> theatre in your local area wait and see it for a buck i wouldn't even bother renting it that would be too much money for this thriller
<START> i saw this movie because it had a giant person and was labeled as a monster movie i do not understand why it is called a monster movie the movie is a drama i was expecting a lot of destruction but what did i get most of the movie was relationship problems and people thinking that a woman was a loony because she saw a spaceship crash with a giant inside for an unexplained reason the action started a few minutes toward the end since the woman was killed isn't that murder couldn't they have done anything else besides murder her if you watch this because you expect it to have action because it is labeled as a monster movie don't watch it it is not a monster movie it is a drama
<START> excellent <UNK> <UNK> piece that really had some teeth to it without feeling hopeless or worse manipulative <UNK> <UNK> might be a good double feature with american beauty as well best performance to date that i've seen from anita and every actor in this seems like a <UNK> hats off to ann <UNK> for the direction and <UNK> ho for the brilliant script seriously one of the best dramas i've seen in a while especially if you have a taste for classical literature ala poetry again excellent
<START> i feel as though i know these people and have known people similar to them these days though people are <UNK> from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness it has a slow beginning but then look out if you love romantic comedies but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change or at least did have back in the 70's then you should see this movie
<START> but even caricatures need a plausible plot line i suppose in 1934 some part of that audience long ago would enjoy this tepid farce it doesn't age well it does give <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> experienced and expert support players a shot at leading roles <UNK> who is featured <UNK> in the thin man series tries his best but is over matched by witless plot with the backdrop being a stage play with gangsters its not exactly original material movie's saving grace is the always excellent edward everett <UNK> in a wasted performance but don't waste your time watching everett in this film i would encourage anyone to watch him in his effort in holiday with cary grant and <UNK> hepburn same era 1936 but much better script and storyline better gags and needless to say star power as well
<START> i was lucky to see this sequel before the original because i'm not sure i would have gone out of my way to see it if the contrary had been true i found mission better than it's predecessor for different reasons but the major one is this it was almost word for word an adaptation of one book not an <UNK> like the first movie the physical resemblance of some characters to their animated self were very funny especially the bad guy who's name is escaping me but he's the other architect i don't know how this movie played in english my first language is french so i didn't have that problem i imagine some of the jokes weren't that easy to translate i've learned something with years it's better to watch a movie with the subtitles than with the dubbing maybe you wont understand what is said but you wont lose the rhythm and i think that's important too i would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves et
<START> the most remarkable thing about talk radio is how bad it is the voices all have a phony reading from a script ring to them an evening with an annoying <UNK> at a dallas radio station is told with the of a glimpse into hell stone tries for an existential revelation and gets <UNK> comedy instead whenever a <UNK> makes a profound empty point about something stone <UNK> the camera at one of his character's face as they are stricken with some traumatic realization that is never revealed to the audience <UNK> overacts throughout in one of the most irritating performances ever <UNK> onto celluloid underrated classic give me a break
<START> this was another great episode from season 11 of south park br br <UNK> <UNK> having syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble he is able to swear at the other kids at school kyle tells the principal that <UNK> is <UNK> it but she doesn't believe it chris <UNK> is planning on having <UNK> to be on <UNK> to talk about syndrome live and <UNK> but later on <UNK> starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff this was a funny episode about <UNK> <UNK> syndrome i recommend it to any south park fan
<START> valley girl is an exceptionally well made film with an all around great cast even though the dialogue is a bit dated now when the movie was released it was very hip to this day i know many people teenagers included that cannot form a sentence without using the word like that is without a doubt the legacy this movie will leave a rating of 8 was given for this like most excellent movie
<START> i would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the film it really does grip you john paul does eventually get to see the light and make a life for himself away from being tied to his mothers <UNK> strings br br i imagine there must be so many families these days in the same position especially with children leaving home older but i wouldn't say <UNK> with very sad parents who haven't really got lives of their own and who make their lives a misery br br i think this film should definitely have a wider audience i would also say that the other actors played brilliant parts as well it is such a deep film and very moving
<START> when the noble clan is <UNK> by the <UNK> clan loyal <UNK> <UNK> escapes with his <UNK> eight year old son and his daughter they are <UNK> by the <UNK> who serves the god <UNK> a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the giant stature <UNK> into the side of a local mountain ten years later and seek vengeance against lord but are captured in the attempt and sentenced to die <UNK> desperately attempting to save her master threatens with the god's <UNK> only to be <UNK> to death for her efforts a vain cruel narrow man orders statue to be destroyed in order to crush any last <UNK> of hope among the remaining <UNK> but the god <UNK> who <UNK> has been silent has other ideas br br <UNK> is an enthralling timeless deeply moving fairy tale <UNK> produced on a respectable budget it is a film about values the values of <UNK> of justice of decency of loyalty of self sacrifice and of love it is about <UNK> and rule and of the consequences of failing to live up to the responsibility that rule <UNK> these are things that are not talked about much in our times except by <UNK> <UNK> like william <UNK> but are nonetheless relevant and <UNK> shows us why br br <UNK> is a perfect example of why japanese cinema is so glorious the values listed above have <UNK> relevance for those involved in this film as they do for many a japanese filmmaker there is no lip service no <UNK> no irony here instead there is an authentic effort to <UNK> a world where these values can once again have life and to show what happens when they fall into <UNK> just compare <UNK> or the lone wolf and <UNK> series or any kurosawa film to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kill bill b to see what i mean br br in a film whose <UNK> talent is so uniformly excellent i would merely like to point out master <UNK> <UNK> score the talent and beauty of actors <UNK> and and the stunning portrayal by her death scene is one of the most moving and meaningful that i have ever witnessed
<START> committed is all about graham as an <UNK> <UNK> who goes in search of her self estranged husband who has gone in search of himself which all leads to a sort of upbeat comedic odyssey involving a bunch of side characters and issues a fresh fun and unpredictable little flick what committed lacks in story it makes up for in good and subtle morals and if you enjoy this little chick flick which received slightly above average reviews by critics and public alike you might want to check out lisa <UNK> hit indie <UNK> lo 1996 b
<START> this movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a <UNK> nicolas cage fan back in the mid 80's i taped this movie when <UNK> were impossible to do this with and would watch it over and over nicolas cage is just brilliant here and he looks wonderful and has no affecting acting <UNK> see peggy sue got married to know what i mean about that i measure all his performances against this one he was so perfectly cast as the cool punk guy with the edgy friends the music was great the the <UNK> modern english men at work whenever i hear melt with you i am taken back to the finale of this movie br br what ever happened to his cute <UNK> deborah <UNK> and his hysterical friend cameron <UNK> certainly took a different turn than nicolas interestingly the <UNK> friend elizabeth daily ended up being the voice of tommy from the <UNK> she is billed as e g daily for that horrid show bizarre br br if you want to take a great trip back to the 80's watch this movie it is definitely a classic like totally
<START> i had the <UNK> of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead i only saw one other play in the 1970's 1990's that had an emotional impact like this play did i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn't <UNK> her role in the film she wasn't well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy <UNK> instead sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way i love anne <UNK> but she seemed too young for this role the movie plot was true to the play anyone who ever <UNK> suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the <UNK> on those who are left behind
<START> first off i'm not a <UNK> but i'm in some kind of <UNK> <UNK> unit the guys who get called if an <UNK> hits and the real <UNK> need more people for so i had some training and <UNK> but i have no real life experience br br but still there are some points one notices as totally unbelievable i can understand that they removed the mouth nose pieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke because the public would otherwise see nothing but some things defy logic br br no second mask attached to the <UNK> how the hell do you want to rescue people <UNK> the smoke without one br br <UNK> people no it's not done like that i'd be screaming too if somebody <UNK> a rope around me in that fashion and hung me from a building if i could scream that is and not pass out from want of air because the rope <UNK> my <UNK> the second time when they're jack it's better but still weird br br aim high no you bloody don't you always fight fire from as low as possible you don't fight want to <UNK> flames you'll want to the fire and that's below the flames br br no discipline they're running around like chicken and they shout all the time instead of using radio and keeping discipline br br no tactics why don't they work in teams of at least two you still can get separated but it takes much more than if everyone just <UNK> around alone in search for victims br br do they really enter buildings without bringing water i europe <UNK> would never enter a burning building without br br <UNK> on the roof wtf do they think they're doing there without security lines or water exploding rooms wood and brick does not explode suddenly br br the better points are actually <UNK> and the other non <UNK> parts of the movie it's a lot of <UNK> but that's alright i'll give it a point for this
<START> this movie was a waste of time it looks nice pretty settings nicely acted appears earnest and seems to be leading somewhere so you stay tuned awaiting a meaningful payoff it doesn't happen br br it surprised me that so much effort could be put into a movie it was clearly very <UNK> done and have an outcome that seems nothing short of a b movie br br save your precious time and see a good french film like les <UNK> funny jean de or <UNK> of the spring i can't recall the language in europa europa but that's another great film heavy but very worth viewing br br this film appears to promise a lot but delivers nothing
<START> it used to be that video <UNK> like sub <UNK> and brain damage films would release low budget shot on video horror films to a <UNK> market of <UNK> that ate them up with glee that's acceptable to me because you could see these movies from a mile away with their shoddy box art and cheesy titles br br now we have lions gate getting into the mix only they have decided that it'd be better to sucker in poor <UNK> by putting a professional looking cover on it and charge the same price as one of their higher budget <UNK> made features do not be <UNK> in by this granted if you've seen dark <UNK> 1 or 2 than you already know what to expect with 3 but there is a place for movies like this and it is not on a video store shelf beside <UNK> made features br br i am a fan of independent cinema and have watched several low budget shot on video productions that were still a worthy rental but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting if you can call it that was abysmal it was amusing to laugh at the horrible line reading for a minute or two but eventually it was too much to take and became unbearable the story is bad the dialogue is worse the acting somehow manages to be even worse the only possible saving grace to this would be one <UNK> scene that still manages to be awful but is an award winning effect when compared to the blood <UNK> after a girl is slapped or the <UNK> <UNK> br br it took me three tries to make it through this entire movie and i only did so because i paid good money to rent it and felt like i should at least finish it all the way through stay away stay far far away from this one
<START> a new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat lake bell is wonderful it is to bad that her other show miss match was canceled i am just glad she came back on surface i can't wait for the return of surface this show is really something unique to watch with an eerie underwater world that is akin to jurassic park this show keeps you wondering what is next is adorable even if he is going to turn into something larger and much more ominous there are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old subjects when something like surface comes along you just have to say thank you
<START> may contain spoilers i find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives while it is most certainly not perfect it is much better than it is given credit for the acting and photography are excellent some of the musical numbers are great including the title number where do i go easy to be hard and black boys white boys while i have not seen the stage musical i think that it clouds the judgement of many this is not the musical you see in theatres do not attempt to compare them the theatrical musical might have been sensational to watch but it would never have had the same effect on film so a plot had to be added and the ending that has been added is just amazing the movie left me feeling like i had actually watched something important unlike most of today's movies which only satisfy on one level
<START> this film has the worst editing i've ever seen this is yet another film to avoid at all costs unless you view it via mst3k on their website they wonder why the coast guard <UNK> with this film i mean they let them use a helicopter
<START> may contain spoilers horrible just horrible i loved stephen king's novel and this is just a horrible adaptation of it they change the ending they change the plot they changed alan character from a <UNK> husband to a happy fiancé if you are a fan of stephen king's novel stay away even if you are not stay away br br the book was <UNK> dark even for steve king an 11 year old kills himself in the novel a middle school principal is found with child pornography in the novel this is nowhere near as good as the novel br br this movie is my least favorite film of all time i hate this film with a vengeance
<START> i first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an <UNK> recording of the soundtrack i liked it so well i went back to see it several times cannot understand why it was considered a flop julie andrews was lovely in this film her voice was in top form and the <UNK> was beautiful br br the film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavy handed they were still fun br br i recently found i could get a copy in dvd form and ordered it i was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the dvd i ordered
<START> this is one great show that it makes me wonder why it got pulled off the air so many times but i believe its now here to stay this show cant compare to any other before simpsons was pretty on the edge and than came family guy and they are <UNK> it out to go off the edge the things this show gets away with is incredible totally work the watch if you like the simpsons you will love family guy
<START> my kids enjoyed the movie but i was bored there were a few good lines and a handful of funny parts but the plot was pretty lame and relied on the special effects and <UNK> to pull it through still it hit the center of the <UNK> that it was aiming for it was good for the kids
<START> i thought of this movie when i watched <UNK> <UNK> why because both movies have randy quaid playing a retarded robot this movie made years earlier but probably written by a screenplay writer that <UNK> the same coffee or something like that <UNK> avoid at all costs even to pay tribute to the late great andy kaufman is hard to do here find another film or just watch taxi reruns on tv his character is so much more <UNK> tank you <UNK> much
<START> john candy and eugene levy star as inept security guards who chase down a big time mobster inept is truly the right word for this alleged comedy a few laughs but mostly <UNK> and thoughts to yourself like why am i watching this c p yes that is meg ryan in this too which i am sure she <UNK> want to be reminded of a waste of a talented cast on a scale of one to ten 0
<START> fantastic film wow this is really a treat i can't believe that i discovered such a gem of a movie br br a pretty young girl traveling south to florida meets a friendly older couple with an <UNK> after she has a flat at a rest stop however she learns that things aren't as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after she spends some time on the road with them br br everyone in it was just so perfect for their parts you just about believe that you are watching this happen in real life in front of you br br newcomer emily grace did a fantastic job as the really cute yet somewhat shy alice emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see just how she got into the situation that develops in the film i'm sure we'll be seeing emily in more films in the future br br contrary to what some others have said the lighting and photography in this were just perfect the editing was done well too just the right way to put together images of the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling along with the cast on their road trip br br i didn't see it on the big screen but i can only urge everyone to go out and see it more films like this are exactly what we need br br sf
<START> the 1970s opened the door to the largest most diverse era of film in the history some films were great the godfather the conversation mean streets <UNK> the french connection five easy pieces jaws <UNK> and mrs miller others were not so great the <UNK> the outfit <UNK> joe the taking of <UNK> one two three <UNK> <UNK> castle keep and others were barely worth the price of admission br br yet every one was a fresh breath of air compared to today's corporate hollywood where every film is given a big weekend to <UNK> its cost or go straight to hbo and rental br br what decade does so well is to relate the sudden and rarely experienced sensation of freedom to be given money to make and direct a film perhaps personal perhaps not sometime with a <UNK> of extras sometimes in the middle of a busy street before the cops show up long before the corporate suits <UNK> and lawyers ever became part of the system br br the <UNK> are superb especially julie christie and dennis hopper though as you listen you'll slowly discover just how many big directors today coppola scorsese ron howard dennis hopper peter got stated as roger corman <UNK> working long hours with short pay shooting a film in under a month learning all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it themselves turning in product that was on time and under budget br br see decade for its message and for a long and varied list of films to watch made through those <UNK> <UNK> years br br though i would not complain if <UNK> decided to <UNK> another documentary solely to that most under rated grand <UNK> of film roger corman
<START> <UNK> the line of <UNK> tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former government assassin turned psycho the secret service agent bodyguard eastwood is on defense and the assassin <UNK> is on offense the stakes the <UNK> live br br i really like this movie i've seen it numerous times on tv and have recently bought it on dvd yet it's not an excellent movie the plot is way too thin and the attempts to it are downright ridiculous the whole love story isn't very plausible and the way they brought an extra character into the story just to be able to kill it off is kind of insulting to the more or less intelligent viewer though i feel these mistakes can't be forgiven i can easily look past them to mr <UNK> exquisite performance i've always deemed him to be a great actor but in this movie he's really on fire there's a reason why he got an academy award nomination <UNK> russo and clint eastwood were okay but i don't <UNK> their performance to be memorable they're never at the best of their abilities br br if you don't expect too much you'll certainly like this movie it's no masterpiece but john <UNK> is really extraordinary and i don't think anyone can't enjoy his performance really worth the watch
<START> i struggle to see the point of this movie it is supposed to be a comedy but i didn't laugh once the storyline is one that could have been interesting in a well made movie but since this is acted by comics the result is totally unbelievable as comedies should be the comic strip series was very hit and miss even <UNK> the episodes and it is fair to say all of the people involved have gone on to do greater things one to avoid i have also just found out that comments have to be 10 lines long the whole point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching not write an <UNK> <UNK> about it or taking it apart if you like seinfeld larry sanders the young ones alan <UNK> arrested development <UNK> red dwarf then you might like to pass on this on the other hand if you like lame jokes such as can be found in friends and <UNK> enjoy watching this
<START> last year was the <UNK> <UNK> of charles <UNK> birth and the <UNK> of the <UNK> of the origin of species so it's fitting that jon creation got released the movie focuses on the period of <UNK> paul <UNK> life while he was writing his famous work and the mild strain that it put on his family life br br i guess that the movie <UNK> <UNK> tension with his religious wife emma jennifer <UNK> and his guilt over his deceased daughter annie but i still like the thought of <UNK> theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma as it was the us was one of the last countries in which creation found a <UNK> due to the <UNK> evolution debate yes it's still going on br br all in all this isn't a masterpiece but i recommend it the same way that i recommend <UNK> the wind i hope that one day the <UNK> evolution debate won't be an issue if this film helps put the debate to rest then more power to everyone in the movie also starring martha west jeremy northam toby jones and <UNK>
<START> the missing star who <UNK> for the golden lion at 2006 <UNK> film festival is a film that when you think about the first <UNK> that comes to your mind is intense intense looks intense sequences this movie's intensity captures the viewer since the very first scenes at the in italy i couldn't recognize the city maybe <UNK> or even <UNK> although the pace is quite slow br br vincenzo the male lead and with him all the audience sees a completely different china than a normal <UNK> <UNK> horrible high rise building with about 8 hundred flat owners inside <UNK> <UNK> fog and <UNK> everywhere but also the beauty of the river that will soon become a big lake because of the controversial <UNK> that will wipe a lot of towns out china is a country under construction but under all these <UNK> public works there are still poverty and unfair laws br br we can relate more easily to this story because <UNK> the expert director chose two phenomenal leads sergio <UNK> a well known actor in italy and the chinese surprise <UNK> <UNK> a total unknown girl that gives an as intense interpretation as br br the film is not perfect there are some flaws here and there but that doesn't mean it's a mediocre film try to see it
<START> are we serious i mean wow just wow i think i saw this flick in an old issue of war <UNK> this is pathetic originality is completely dead instead of trying to <UNK> a new idea what we receive is a bland re do of an old plot line and to switch it up we just change the gender or race of the original character it's moronic and everyone should be sick and tired of seeing it but i guess this is just a rant and will most likely fall on deaf ears to <UNK> with the sound of another turd hitting the toilet water like the best western since 3 10 to <UNK> wait for it 3 10 to <UNK> thank you hollywood for killing film as an art form and turning it into a commercial <UNK> of neo pop junk and blatant <UNK> wonderful
<START> i am a huge fan of <UNK> and i just knew that i had to see this movie even though i can't say i'm a soccer fan but watching this just filled my heart with joy and i had a great time in the movies watching it br br <UNK> fast does a tremendous job directing this movie and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting they grow with the movie and makes it what it is even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie there is surprisingly little soccer in it the whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word n o r w a y on their trip to the world cup in soccer playing in germany this year br br if you're only gonna see one norwegian movie this year this is the one
<START> this delightful movie tells the story of <UNK> and it's incredible you'll laugh and you'll smile and you'll laugh it's really all about the laughs when jon bon <UNK> is funny in a movie it's a heck of a movie <UNK> said now go watch it
<START> a post apocalyptic warrior goes off to save some kind of nun and on the way meets some <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> who want to kick his ass this is one of the hardest to watch films ever there are scenes with silence that seems to last hours before somebody comes out with the next badly written badly acted line there are action sequences that keep repeating and we're not talking the 1 2 3 action repeat on a particularly good kick that was made popular by eastern directors we're talking many many repeats of long bad fight sequences this is incredibly confusing at first but then quickly becomes annoying as you're watching a 30 second sequence for the 2nd 3rd and 4th time any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity the only thing thats keeps this film in the apart from the bet from a friend that i couldn't watch it all the way through without begging for it to be turned off and <UNK> off safely so it may harm no one else is the fact that although painful this film is unintentionally hilarious i'm not at all a fan of those so bad that it's funny type of films but at parts i was in tears other points to note are the quality of the sound and picture but this is <UNK> as it's obvious money was a major problem in the making of this film final verdict king of the so bad they're funny genre anybody having that kind of genre video night should get themselves a copy also lets not forget that it is actually the worst film i've ever seen
<START> i had to write a review for this film after i saw it last night and read some of the comments of people trying to <UNK> the <UNK> of this film go down to post i don't fit any any of those <UNK> the other <UNK> that needs to be on the list is 5 people didn't like this movie because it was not good i found the film to be and forced my wife picked it for us to see because she is a huge kidman fan and she also likes jude law br br speaking of law it took a long time and a huge amount of suspension of belief for me to believe his southern accent i can't help but wonder if they didn't make his character less <UNK> on purpose so we <UNK> have to hear that tortured accent so much br br as far as the movie it took a long time for it to get interesting about 1 or 1 5 hours and then fell flat in it's ending what was interesting is that i did not know that this film was directed by about 40 minutes into the movie i asked my wife this isn't going to be another english patient is it it absolutely was br br as far as the battle scenes i'm trying to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene but i think the most <UNK> word that accurately describes it is simply dumb it was forced it was unbelievable it was silly and it was dumb after the battle i looked at my wife and asked was that just dumb to which she <UNK> <UNK> her head br br the only bright point in the film was the performance of <UNK> the role was a bit over acted like any decent comedy relief role but it worked from her speech pattern her walk her mannerisms and <UNK> her little <UNK> my favorite if you want to get 3 feet up a <UNK> ass all you have to do is listen to <UNK> talk to each other she was able to create an almost cartoon like character who did her job extremely well br br i simply did not like this movie and i have to wonder about the kind of people who do say they like it or the english patient for that matter i suspect you could <UNK> them in one category 1 soap opera fans
<START> <UNK> finds alice faye without any songs as a <UNK> trying to flee china and without <UNK> she's in a heap of trouble i won't say what exactly and even american won't help her out br br i mention that because one of the <UNK> that the chinese including the <UNK> who attack the american mission in this story set deep in the chinese interior was that particular institution <UNK> american citizens who committed crimes were tried by american <UNK> set up by our we were far from the only country doing that however br br anyway the story opens with her on a train for shanghai trying to use a hokey russian accent the accent <UNK> warner <UNK> who's pretty <UNK> br br <UNK> however <UNK> the journey and the two of them seek <UNK> in the american <UNK> <UNK> over by charles <UNK> he's the best one in the film and i only wish that a better story was given because i liked his character he's a widower and a proud member of the service <UNK> in <UNK> by william <UNK> he <UNK> a transfer ten years later and that's the last he was heard from as assistant secretary of state jonathan hale <UNK> put it he's the real forgotten man br br <UNK> does all right in a role that someone like clark gable would have done in his sleep at mgm the <UNK> would have come more natural to gable than to <UNK> as the mission is <UNK> and <UNK> against the <UNK> br br alice faye did have one number to sing why <UNK> song was cut out god and <UNK> only know one thing i'm still trying to figure out is when the mission inhabitants take final <UNK> in the <UNK> with a trap door just who was left upstairs to pull the <UNK> over the <UNK> door br br <UNK> had the potential to be a lot better than it was but sloppy editing and lost faith in the project made 20th century fox release a project <UNK> watching <UNK> is like eating a badly <UNK> meal
<START> what is there to say about an anti establishment film that was produced in a time of such <UNK> void social indifference and <UNK> <UNK> first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects <UNK> of such filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the <UNK> scene <UNK> in paris in the late 1950's known as the french new wave br br they discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with <UNK> american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political and <UNK> that held the development of the arts in check in the mid <UNK> century br br film <UNK> race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are <UNK> by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of work is that his films have almost a <UNK> <UNK> effect a mental reaction is <UNK> through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to <UNK> because he takes a more intimate approach to defining <UNK> that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretation br br although my favourite film is <UNK> this one is his most important
<START> as other reviews have said another of the countless number of alien <UNK> this time with a great of the terminator thrown in add a bit of the classic sf story who goes there and a insanely stupid plot device lifted from the <UNK> strain apparently flashing red lights make <UNK> killer unable to <UNK> scared people standing three <UNK> away from them br br ok the story after a sequence of people running around in a space ship and killing each other we get a <UNK> br br 25 years later br br the crew of a <UNK> station <UNK> mars due to be <UNK> in 48 hours <UNK> a space ship on a <UNK> course it's the <UNK> the ship we saw in the opening sequence not a good time to have taken everything useful off line on the <UNK> station to do some <UNK> then the approaching ship doesn't <UNK> from its course and is <UNK> a do not under any circumstances enter this ship warning after a lot of shouting at each other the crew of the <UNK> station <UNK> something together and get the station out of the way just in the nick of time but the ship changes course and <UNK> them any way <UNK> one of the crew on a stick <UNK> crew <UNK> thing the satellite starts to loose integrity bits de lots more shouting and running about in which only two crew people are sucked out into space backwards why are they always sucked out backwards br br after a few the wheelchair bound who is called the only only <UNK> joke in the whole movie <UNK> that the <UNK> is <UNK> them of all their power and they need to go aboard her and switch off its <UNK> they all go on board and take their <UNK> off do not enter this ship obviously means get on board the ship and expose yourself to possibly fatal <UNK> <UNK> one team head for the main computer room where they find a dead frozen guy <UNK> what looks like an american express card but turns out to be a the other team find some switches amazingly the dead bloke turns out to be the father of the attractive female crew member voted most likely to survive an encounter with a <UNK> alien they switch the <UNK> off but this means the ships <UNK> will explode a spooky point of view shot starts killing people there's some <UNK> about the <UNK> having discovered an new <UNK> a power source worth millions which mean the more <UNK> members of the crew immediately thrust themselves into danger to get hold of it the <UNK> shot returns with <UNK> <UNK> walking noises on the soundtrack unfortunately these give you the idea the killer is wearing <UNK> and the effect is wasted br br after that it's all just running around and getting killed in order of <UNK> and acting ability until only the obvious survivors survive along with the cute dog which had managed to lead at least two crew members to their deaths just why space hardened veterans wander into the jaws of certain death looking for their pets cats and dogs has long been a mystery of this kind of movie other stupid highlights include everyone forgetting to act the falling levels of <UNK> until reminded by the voice of the on board computer not that the low levels of <UNK> in any way any of the impressive fires this load of idiots start if the killer <UNK> id so clever it can steer the ship in a tight <UNK> and have another go at <UNK> the <UNK> station why didn't it turn off the do not under any circumstances enter this ship warning <UNK> i'm sure if it was looking for more people to kill then yelling go away was not a good way of going about it br br <UNK> is the only person who gets to do any acting everyone else just <UNK> their <UNK> all the time while <UNK> their teeth and shouting and pointing guns at each other it that sort of script full of <UNK> marks the only thing that kept me watching till the end was the hope that the script demand she take all her clothes off or get wet while not wearing a lot unfortunately it didn't one of the things wrong with this movie apart from it having more <UNK> put on screen than in any other movie ever is that there was no gratuitous nudity
<START> rich vs poor big city vs small town white collar vs blue collar these things are not original themes in movies so when one chooses to involve these themes the <UNK> story line had better be very original or very good this one was neither i never believed in the romance of the two young lovers in this movie neither convincing nor compelling it just fell flat don't bother even with a video rental
<START> i am sick of series with young and clueless people talking about their problems all the time self centered boring and absolutely annoying popular <UNK> creek beverly hills etc hack is a breath of fresh air with a great actor david morse a completely different plot credible people with real problems thank god and very very good <UNK> i just love it i hope hack will go on for a long time because it is a great television series for grown up people for a change
<START> the stories were pretty weird not really funny and not really cunning i'm not sure what the point of the stories was the first story was actually mostly sick the second was just really really pathetic and the third was only weird the fake baby was actually quite badly made
<START> the is probably slim <UNK> best performance of all time when we were shooting everyone connected with the production figured that slim was academy award material unfortunately united artists had a james bond picture in release at the same time and did not <UNK> much attention to the i personally feel this film was under rated by most critics sam junior <UNK> was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film also cliff robertson had a <UNK> film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us too the picture is worth watching if just for the <UNK> footage some of the best ever filmed shot by james <UNK> the director and my co writer steve died a few weeks after the <UNK> release cutting short a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife sally his daughter <UNK> and <UNK> son <UNK> please give this movie a shot i'm <UNK> that you'll say it was well worth while i thank anyone who has taken the time to read this stephen <UNK>
<START> i own a copy of this film and have always loved it i comment here however because i saw the <UNK> presentation of a concert version of <UNK> todd earlier this week that production was put on by the san francisco opera and starred george and <UNK> in the early '80s replaced <UNK> as <UNK> had won the tony for his performance i saw and angela lansbury who also won the tony for her performance as mrs <UNK> perform <UNK> on broadway they must have made the film at about the time i saw the show to this day the most moving moment i can ever remember in the theatre occurred when sang these are my friends these are my friends see how they <UNK> my arm is complete again br br performance in the san francisco opera production convinced me that he has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since i first saw him perform the piece on broadway and later in the film what a talent he is sympathetic funny and scary all at once and he can sing boy can he sing all of this reminded me of how terrific the film is highly recommended ten out of ten
<START> this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time lacks energy to say the least energy is what <UNK> moore gave us in <UNK> i never felt once in this movie that was anxious for anything revenge love justice not in this guy's portrayal br br there is also no chemistry between <UNK> and if the plot did not force them to be friends you don't get the impression they want to hang out with each other plus the sidekick has the more interesting personality <UNK> br br the dialogue is predictable and boring br br the narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the dukes of hazzard you can picture what this is like i cannot believe the director would agree to this it insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line i just witnessed br br hey at least the horses and locations looked good maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director br br rating 2 you may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is
<START> it is sad that <UNK> was the best thing about this production especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog delivery br br actually this isn't as bad as some critics say but it isn't good either it is amusing and does play like a poor country cousin of the conan line making it a conflicted uneven poor work and speaking of poor the quality is terrible due to the era in which this was filmed but that is not the only reason br br the story <UNK> is inferior even to the conan line but moreover it loses itself in the red <UNK> must be dominated by big strong <UNK> <UNK> and entirely forgets its purpose if it ever had one br br it's entertaining but in a low budget guilty pleasure b kind of way br br it rates a 4 2 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i first saw this in the theater in 1969 when i was 9 and immediately fell in love with it i'm sad that <UNK> has not seen fit to release this on dvd but one day one day i recently <UNK> a vhs copy of this on ebay and sat down to watch it <UNK> years later i'm happy to report it still stands the test of time the acting is spot on john <UNK> <UNK> are lush and leslie songs memorable when i am older you and i fill the world with love london is london are just a few of the <UNK> and not enough can be said about peter <UNK> <UNK> clarke michael redgrave and michael acting <UNK> <UNK> deserves an a for his update of the james hilton story there really is nothing not to like about this film it's a good cheer me up selection glad they have released the original soundtrack as a three cd set with lots of extras wish <UNK> would hurry up and do the same with the film
<START> this film was not great cinema but definitely a good film to see with your family especially children from 10 15 there are good topics of discussion brought up in this movie such as bullies the environment and working to make things right jimmy music was a plus and the scenery was wonderful the young actors were excellent and this is a movie i would expect to see on the family channel or the hallmark channel except for a few words in the dialog a middle school could show this film to start discussions in the <UNK> hopefully it will be shown in drive ins this summer so that more people get to see it it did follow carl book well and it was fun to see him in a cameo performance
<START> well let me put it this way i have always been one of the hardcore brothers i've always loved rock music and especially heavy metal that's why this movie is like a gift from god i believe this movie is one of the best movies ever well except from <UNK> story and star wars of course it's great to hear all the classics like long live rock and roll <UNK> ted <UNK> songs by jon bon deep purple <UNK> <UNK> and several other legendary rock bands heavenly absolutely gorgeous wonderful i hope they will make more movies like this otherwise it's just crap movies like that <UNK> in da usa or what they call it and 8 miles <UNK> well i strongly recommend this anyway everything i'm missing is a couple of songs but except from that it's one of the best movies ever ten out of ten
<START> jack lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever <UNK> the screen he could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease making most of his peers green with envy while his performance in save the tiger is oscar worthy i feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other better roles that had <UNK> this current one br br this is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast or in this case one particular member it's too bad the <UNK> <UNK> didn't match that of <UNK> don't waste your time with this one
<START> david <UNK> is agatha <UNK> <UNK> detective <UNK> <UNK> in after the funeral produced in 2005 anyone who has heard david <UNK> speak with his own british accent knows what a shock it is because his accent as <UNK> is so perfect and <UNK> to the character <UNK> is the <UNK> of agatha <UNK> books and although i confess a love for peter ustinov in the role his portrayal doesn't have that much to do with what christie wrote br br in this episode <UNK> is asked by a <UNK> friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his <UNK> on the train the <UNK> <UNK> the events after the death a strange will the expected heir and the <UNK> of the man's sister that he was murdered when <UNK> meets the family he discovers adultery lots of secrets another will and murder br br the story is excellent with rich production values and a wonderful detailed depiction of the time period all of the acting is superb particularly from monica <UNK> who plays miss <UNK> <UNK> here is without <UNK> his beautiful office or miss <UNK> but he's effective nonetheless br br i had the <UNK> of seeing david <UNK> on broadway in <UNK> breathtaking what an actor when he's playing <UNK> all i see is <UNK>
<START> my wife and i couldn't even finish the film truly it was rather painful br br first the historical accuracy is <UNK> not so much by the events themselves as the ridiculous one <UNK> of the characters for instance <UNK> takes the burden of power only with great <UNK> indeed he is portrayed as if he's some sort of great <UNK> and believer in democracy br br second the camp my lord the dialog is <UNK> bad i recall the soap opera my mother watched when i was a child having better dialog than this the constant exposition and <UNK> <UNK> upon the ears like <UNK> on <UNK> ugh okay i <UNK> a bit but the dialog truly is bad the hbo series rome is superior for no other reason than that its characters were at least believable regardless of their <UNK> br br rome was also wise enough to know they couldn't stage epic battle scenes the creators of this film did not when <UNK> attacks the battle scene is practically <UNK> br br i will grant that the costumes are perfectly good the sets are fine though their cgi backdrops can be a bit jarring at times the sound is bad in terms of the music the <UNK> work and the dubbing of so many of the side characters br br anyway it's completely not worth renting as a history major i was hoping for an alternative approach to <UNK> than <UNK> rome which i feel failed to capture his overall feel quite as well as they did <UNK> or <UNK> instead i should have just stuck to my reading
<START> both jackie and <UNK> are terrific in this movie they are well suited to their roles and have several chances to shine in particular the way <UNK> <UNK> the words puerto <UNK> is very funny as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time i had seen the original of this movie called old <UNK> starring bette davis and <UNK> hopkins they allegedly did not get along so because the movie is about female friendship that might have been a problem here the actresses clearly admire and respect each other hart <UNK> and meg ryan have supporting parts and are both excellent in particular <UNK> who never got many decent parts in movies as far as i am concerned george <UNK> did not make another movie after this so this was a good one to go out on
<START> i suspect there are several cuts of this <UNK> doing the rounds the copy i saw focused heavily on <UNK> erotic films and referred to his horror <UNK> in passing there are numerous x rated films presented in their x rated glory and <UNK> in america's legendary snuff footage the breasts being cut off is given generous screen time br br the interviews with the highly likable joe are informative and <UNK> he is an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> his interest in shocking audiences why he wanted to mix <UNK> with horror and how he may have been responsible for one of his performers turning gay br br his friendship and working relationship with <UNK> beauty laura <UNK> is touched on as is his indifferent attitude to shooting hardcore br br joe <UNK> <UNK> an incredible period in <UNK> cinema that has now passed it is great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his fine unique work br br rip joe
<START> snake island is one of those films that whilst one sits and watches its amazing level of stupidity makes one wish the film camera had never been invented the real reason why plan 9 from outer space will hold onto its <UNK> title of worst film of all time for a while to come is not so much because of how bad it is it is because of the fact that it is the most entertaining bad film you will ever see snake island is the other kind of bad snake island is just so bad that it is excruciating a stupid premise combines with a script that was written by monkeys <UNK> one key <UNK> onto <UNK> that were then <UNK> in order to resemble dialogue to make the most obvious problems here filmed entirely on location in south africa the <UNK> in which the film takes place are about the only element that can <UNK> be considered well realised many shots involving snakes consist of close ups so surreal in appearance that one begins to wonder whether said snakes are cgi puppets or real snakes that have been fed really hard drugs br br william <UNK> stars if you can call it that as an author traveling to an island resort on what appears to be a river ferry coming along with him is an assortment of very generic poorly defined characters it is all a matter of random screen writing as to who survives to the end but <UNK> certainly appears to be <UNK> firing his agent the rest of the cast seem to be from the home and away acting school where any <UNK> of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by open mouthed <UNK> and <UNK> one's eyes about in every direction the <UNK> effects are often worse with one memorable scene where a double <UNK> shotgun sounds like the rather flat sound effects that used to <UNK> <UNK> in such games as meanwhile snakes continually explode or jump about at random it would have been more accurate to call the film snake holocaust br br of course no z grade horror or sci fi film is complete these days without gratuitous scenes of <UNK> women in a state of <UNK> as every woman in the cast almost gets their clothes off the film starts to become less snake island and more snake island orgy but like all the worst <UNK> all there really is in this case is a lot of setup with no real payoff the sex scenes never <UNK> and the deaths of characters are so flat so uninteresting that the entire film becomes pointless unless you consider watching william <UNK> running through a <UNK> forest wearing ill fitting <UNK> gear and <UNK> snakes in all directions with a <UNK> bat a payoff for the record i don't i used to think that <UNK> was the worst film ever made about <UNK> snakes i was so very very wrong at least <UNK> had a snake one could be afraid of if they suspended disbelief for quite some time some of the snakes shown killing the human cast are no bigger than the from some <UNK> of combat boots i have worn br br so we so far have the <UNK> for bad horror films running along nicely the <UNK> lame cast are <UNK> for as are poor audio and visual effects the dialogue is so wretched so ill timed that i have seen better writing and delivery during some of the school plays i have acted in many <UNK> ago unfortunately where snake island <UNK> in this respect is the area fatal to all bad films in essence it forgets to be so bad that it is funny it is so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and becomes painful the second that the cast start to speak compared to william performance in snake island jon <UNK> performance in <UNK> was as oscar worthy as russell <UNK> in gladiator not that voight or <UNK> are necessarily bad actors but with material like this you're hard pressed to say a single word naturally listening to some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime one's mind tends to blank out the experience primary as a self defense <UNK> br br because of the aforementioned failure to be <UNK> bad i gave snake island a two out of ten my special score for films that are so bad they cannot possibly be good but not bad enough to entertain it is all just so boring or pointless that one might as well be watching the test pattern the proper way to spell crap is s n a k e i s l a n d
<START> sorry randy i love your comedy but in this case you really laid a <UNK> egg br br the plot was thinner than a single <UNK> of my skin the acting more wooden than a giant <UNK> and i think the direction was non existent br br there certainly appeared to be pathetic attempts at take offs of other films jaws and european vacation to name but two br br if memory serves me right eric <UNK> played the same type of character in <UNK> <UNK> european vacation but much better br br i am wondering if chevy chase and <UNK> <UNK> were approached to make this sequel if so they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down br br in my opinion no one can better chevy and <UNK> in their roles as the <UNK> and randy quaid <UNK> them admirably in the earlier movies br br randy quaid should have quit national lampoon whilst he was ahead
<START> i usually love these movies give me a good old b movie any day but this one was simply awful the acting was terrible almost to the point of my turning the movie off completely i thought i saw the all time worst but this one is right up there with attack of the killer tomatoes in all honesty it was the acting that did this film in for me br br i found the actor's to be clumsy and the lead male female were extremely dull this movie had absolutely nothing going for it i may be asking a ridiculous question here but why the nudity and sex scene did the producers think nobody would watch if they left them out i think they were probably right oh where is price and the <UNK> when you need them
<START> there are movies that are leaders and movies that are followers br br <UNK> was a leader and here's one of its followers br br party camp is about as <UNK> as any of its <UNK> who <UNK> the depths that <UNK> the original had so successfully <UNK> of course that one had bill murray so what does party camp have br br i'm glad you asked that question br br jewel <UNK> has made these flicks her bread and <UNK> and what a side dish she provides even as an innocent <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend to a rich <UNK> she provides that <UNK> steam she gives to all her parts and yes guys she shows if you know what i mean and i think you do my gosh that smile of hers could melt through <UNK> br br what oh yeah the movie nothing special as i said every cheap joke is aimed for and hit at about <UNK> level and eternal teen <UNK> is good for a laugh or two but instead of a sense of humor there's just nudity lame sex jokes more nudity a soft core dream sequence a sex symbol nurse simply for <UNK> <UNK> purposes even more nudity br br hmmm maybe it's a good idea bill murray wasn't in this br br two stars for jewel naturally plenty of camp but not much of a party
<START> how many reviews of this film will i have to write before i get it right tom <UNK> fully <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> from his real life brother george sanders with this entry <UNK> out in beautiful double <UNK> single <UNK> style suits and <UNK> in gorgeous <UNK> steel cars with huge <UNK> <UNK> and suicide doors that come up to your <UNK> <UNK> travels from new york to miami to keep a formula for industrial <UNK> from falling into the wrong hands his client is lovely <UNK> <UNK> who has got gorgeous hair but will let you only kiss her for the first two months along the way he runs into the type of colourful array of characters only a b movie could provide his sidekick in this outing is perhaps best among <UNK> <UNK> edward <UNK> as goldie locke who is given some really funny lines he runs into sinister dish doris <UNK> the type of <UNK> chick that you know puts out her <UNK> is benny played by steve <UNK> who twenty years later was a <UNK> <UNK> bag in two paramount king movies they both work for cold fish and <UNK> cap wearing kenneth <UNK> ready to do what it takes to get the formula as he <UNK> his <UNK> to brazil <UNK> with the <UNK> pursuing cops ever this entry still <UNK> supreme forget those <UNK> minute <UNK> give me a 1 hour <UNK> movie any day i got a wife and two kids who's got time for a two hour movie shake up some dry <UNK> and forget your troubles with this great <UNK> movie but if you didn't tape it off local tv in toronto like i did 17 years ago you're out of luck
<START> ok so this film is well acted it has good direction but the simple fact is that it <UNK> what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years the straight man deciding to be gay and the gay man deciding to be straight i did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes after that i got really offended as what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles the leads are played by handsome men but don't let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling <UNK> all the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our <UNK>
<START> i watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say i was not impressed not at all i do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances but some good performances do not make a good movie br br on the discussion board i found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points it says is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at <UNK> an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes the brilliant acting of barbara and <UNK> schneider the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work <UNK> ritter make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips especially in sound however the boredom the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes remains unfortunately this is true i wasn't intrigued by the story at all the protagonists are cold ambition less people they do a lot of drugs and have a lot of incestuous sex so what for many times the direction seemed to be virtually non existent not to mention the technical aspect the poor sound quality was enormously disturbing br br what's the point of the movie what's the message behind it all the anonymous reviewer said somehow failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in mid air without a message thus the boredom i blame on the movie the movie is reserved and <UNK> cold almost neutral and it doesn't take long to see the flaws for long stretches the characters of sean and <UNK> are not credible they clearly have difficulties with the english <UNK> the character of the mute brother is not developed very well some moments are very promising though in the scene where the call boy is skinned the one and only true love scene an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long as a <UNK> one has to regret the chances given away again i must agree i did like the final scene especially because of the beautifully captured faces of <UNK> and <UNK> schneider but it was nothing compared to the boredom i had to suffer for the first thirty minutes the sex scenes though were <UNK> staged and perfectly edited br br all in all deed <UNK> was not my cup of tea a good controversial idea wasted but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director this would have become a better movie
<START> i hate football i hate football fans i hate cars but this film was the funniest thing i have seen in quite some time br br i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend and all i have to say is i laughed till i cried and when is it going to be available in the uk and <UNK> girls this is one football film you will need to see its hilarious br br the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a <UNK> company is just amazing the guys may not be well known actors but this is good down to earth real humour with real people and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen br br well done
<START> i'm not really much of an <UNK> <UNK> fan although i do enjoy who's on first and to be honest there wasn't much in this movie that would inspire me to watch any more of their work it wasn't really bad it had some mildly amusing scenes and actually a very convincing giant played by buddy <UNK> but somehow given the fame of the duo and the <UNK> in which they're generally held i have to say i was expecting more as the story goes the pair stumble into a <UNK> job and during the reading of jack the as a <UNK> story with the kid reading it to <UNK> jack falls asleep and dreams himself into the story there's a wizard of oz kind of feel to the story in that the characters in the dream are all the <UNK> of real life <UNK> of jack and the movie opens in black white and shifts to colour during the dream sequence the fight scenes between jack and the giant and the dance scene between jack and polly dorothy ford are among the amusing parts of the movie polly of course also leads to one of the questions of the movie what happened to her jack and gang apparently left her behind in the castle i know it was just a dream so who cares still i wondered there were also a couple of cute song and dance routines my 4 year old <UNK> a bit during this so she was able to appreciate some of the humour i found it to be an acceptable but certainly not anything that would convince you of <UNK> and <UNK> as comic geniuses 4 10
<START> two days ago i got a chance to watch this movie on cable tv asia i have been very disturbed since then the movie <UNK> has been very successful in portraying only one side of the real life it is highly partial towards parents have you ever thought of other side kids there are few parents in this world who just give birth to their kids but don't give right <UNK> care i am a victim of that why do you parents want to have 5 kids in your life if you are merely making only <UNK> 2000 per month i was made to work on streets along with my siblings i have no idea how i managed to reach from there it has been a long time since then but still i don't believe now i am a research scientist here in usa i have provided all the <UNK> to my parents along with care by my two brothers who stay along with them they could not provide basic things to us when we were kids i find this movie very <UNK> its very partial it has hurt my sentiments very deeply i strongly urge the producer director of this movie to look at the indian society in other point of view also and make another movie i can be reached at john <UNK> com
<START> in a small <UNK> <UNK> village someone is brutally killing young sexually curious boys the local police force keep busy trying to track the killer and <UNK> the list down to five or so main suspects including <UNK> village <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and an <UNK> <UNK> voodoo doll <UNK> backwoods witch named <UNK> <UNK> there's also don <UNK> marc a handsome young priest who runs the local boy's school <UNK> <UNK> a journalist helping to aid the police and the beautiful <UNK> barbara <UNK> a gorgeous but seriously screwed up drug addict who seems to have a thing for very i mean very young boys as typical with the giallo <UNK> the plot won't be fully revealed until the last few frames but if you can hang in there long enough this film pays off the script written by fulci <UNK> and <UNK> keeps red herrings to a minimum and will keep you interested and the story is <UNK> supported by excellent location work cinematography by sergio and musical score by <UNK> <UNK> the acting particularly <UNK> is also very good fulci fans who were <UNK> on his 80s like the beyond and zombie will find more artistry and less gore on display here than they might <UNK> but they'll still enjoy a particularly nasty chain <UNK> scene in a cemetery <UNK> yet effectively set to singer <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> and a long <UNK> down a rocky <UNK> that fulci liked so much that he <UNK> it in his film the psychic 1977 scenes of the children being killed is mainly kept off screen except for a brief <UNK> but the camera doesn't hesitate to <UNK> on their corpses the film was not released <UNK> in america and presumably because of some anti catholic elements in the storyline received only a limited theatrical release in europe
<START> i caught this on television one day when i was young and loved it in the 1970's there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise it's one of the best comedies of the 1970's and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to excellent comedic performance which still stands as one of his greatest this is the film that really got <UNK> <UNK> noticed as a director <UNK> proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time while this film is hilarious and <UNK> 2 is so bad that it's fun <UNK> 3 and <UNK> 4 are absolutely dreadful recommended for those who enjoyed <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> i liked this movie for the most part but have to say had there been anyone else besides bill murray in the lead role it would not have been as good he brings an energy to the role that steps this film up a notch than it would have been otherwise i mainly enjoyed the pranks pulled on the one <UNK> and there are other humorous things in this movie too such as the hot dog eating contest this movie would also set the stage for summer camp movies with the competition at the end nearly every camp movie has either this or the <UNK> or troubled kids plot or a combination of both this series also would take a rather strange shift in tone as this one and two are both family friendly movies while part three and four are more adult oriented more like the old teen sex comedies of the time it kind of did the opposite of the police academy movies that went from r to pg 13 to pg movies this series goes from the opposite to r still this first one and only good one is worth some chuckles largely due to bill murray
<START> this film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be so up its own <UNK> and yet it completely not funny it's just that there is nothing of interest in this film there are no real jokes that make you amused you just watch for 80 minutes then turn it off i bought this on very budget dvd and i'm glad because it's not worth much this isn't even one of those films that's so bad you can watch it with friends when getting drunk high and have a good giggle i didn't hate it like i hate some films but it is rather boring and not worth <UNK> any time in br br the only people who voted 10 on the votes for this film must have been connected to it somehow because i cannot imagine anyone actually liking this film other than small children passing time
<START> i read the recent comments and couldn't wait to see the movie however after sitting through 80 minutes of predictable <UNK> that didn't even make me jump and unrealistic villain i was left hugely disappointed i thought cartoons were the only movies that were still only 80 minutes long i thought this might be because of the edits to make it <UNK> rated but the original only contained ten more minutes of kill bill type blood when blood <UNK> out like <UNK> reality loses appeal add in the killer who's supposed to be a ghost but can rip <UNK> head off from the jaw ala king kong with the t rex lives through everything and has an ending similar to that of the sopranos finale and you quite possibly have the most over hyped movie in the last year after watching the movie i felt like i had seen countless movies with the same plot and method and also felt largely <UNK> i <UNK> what everyone else saw in it but if you want a good horror movie this weekend see halloween it's definitely worth the 10 when it comes to <UNK> let's hope the next one is based on the book
<START> first things first i am by no means a <UNK> movie watcher i'm not one of those people who gets movies just to pick apart the flaws and criticize i like most other people watch to be entertained i'll basically watch any type of movie of no matter how bad anyone says it is sometimes a movie's so terribly made and written that it <UNK> a sort of pity humor which i get a kick out of with all that aside <UNK> <UNK> was simply pathetic i saw it on tv and just didn't know what i was watching it was too poorly written and cheesy to be an adult movie and had way too much sex innuendo and swearing to be a kid's movie in fact i doubt even kids would be amused by it the humor pretty generous even calling it that was so pretentious and campy i couldn't see how anyone with half a mind could even find it funny the only thing that made me laugh was how people like <UNK> mac and ludicrous could put their name and time onto into something so hurting character was such a cheap <UNK> for laughs which fell extremely short of its goal the plot didn't make any sense whatsoever the storyline has got to be the worst sequence of events ever put together on screen i could keep going on but i want to see what people think of my reaction before i start discussing specific instances of pathetic scenes all i have to say is it really has to make ya wonder how much time these writers spent on their knees trying <UNK> get it made br br j
<START> i am a huge horror fan particularly spanish horror this film had so many possibilities to be good it's a marvelous idea a vigilante ghost nun as most of what has come out of mind both visual and sound effects were also pretty good but everything was <UNK> spoiled by bad direction awful casting and a painfully bad exposition exposition script too bad maybe should write and direct himself a remake br br moreover i don't really understand why this had to be spoken in english by actors who can't really speak english and when they do they do it so bad it just makes their performances even more fake if you look at contemporary spanish horror films like el or <UNK> the performances are totally in tune with this type of stylish ghost story and that is being realistic being believable as someone like ourselves like real people because that is the only way horror achieves it's goal unfortunately everything failed in la
<START> gave it two stars because the dvd cover was good enough to make me buy this piece of horse <UNK> i paid a dollar for it at the local dvd exchange and i want my money back i have a couple of good movies at least i think they're good that have never seen the inside of a video store after seeing this i'm really insulted by that light years worse than anything i've ever seen i can't even recommend this as a campy joke movie it is so bad instead of making you laugh it makes you angry how did this awful film find any kind of i can only believe it was self distributed as the amateurish dvd <UNK> would suggest to the producers of this movie get out of the business it's obvious you have no talent for it
<START> i'm not prone to <UNK> and my expectations were low to start with but how did this seem like a good idea just because you have a camera some big ugly friends for actors and <UNK> of talent does not mean that you should go out and make a film this should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower i e it should never have seen the light of day however somehow this rubbish found a <UNK> to help it escape the confines of a 3 by 4 foot <UNK> it goes from bad to worse talk about low budget one torture scene consists of a guy getting a <UNK> of coffee thrown over him while he's tied to a chair evidently this is very painful because the big baby proceeds to scream in agony maybe he ordered <UNK> the acting is worse than wooden i could possibly watch a tree for 30 seconds before becoming completely bored if you can look at this rubbish for that long you're a better man than i and the fight scenes would be at home on a <UNK> play yard do not touch this movie unless you enjoy pain in which case you should try <UNK> <UNK> coffee over yourself i'd like to say it's so bad it's good but really this is just awful
<START> i have never ever seen such a bad movie before the scene where they shoot some guy the pistol don t even shoot damn that is <UNK> the scene with the boy is even not that good no script not any good sound not anything good to say about this movie
<START> watching the preview of <UNK> i thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film thankfully the movie was entertaining suspenseful and realistic there never is the perfect crime and <UNK> showed why the movie show perfectly when people get into <UNK> situation they behave like animals the last hour of the film is very entertaining matt dillon is still a very good actor hard to believe dillon is 50 years of age i would buy this movie i give <UNK> eight out of ten not a christmas movie did i write ten lines yet nope anyways there is not to many action films <UNK> has a lot of excitement in it which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy
<START> a pre nerd robert carradine a pre <UNK> <UNK> jr and an almost pre <UNK> <UNK> griffith take to the road and head for <UNK> with romantic dreams of becoming wealthy <UNK> well their dream is about as exciting as this lackluster youth road movie they aren't particularly interesting and the film doesn't exactly have much of a point beyond we got together the <UNK> of some famous people and made a low budget film about their <UNK> ' out of the cannon of 60's and 70's road films and rebel youth films this one is mediocre under developed <UNK> characters not much wit not much <UNK> to the story which is as bland as the films <UNK> landscape br br but for those who care they head to <UNK> and apparently <UNK> was like the wild west in the 70's because everyone carries a gun and is rough and <UNK> robert carradine says charming things like i hope we can find a shower my nuts sure <UNK> ' and he's the one with <UNK> griffith they are quickly robbed and forced to take jobs and the local <UNK> their <UNK> puts the moves on <UNK> and eventually fires <UNK> for not being corrupt that's when they aren't smart and do not leave town <UNK> instead to eat dog food or go hungry get beat up by the guys <UNK> and then take a <UNK> in the <UNK> car the final half of the film <UNK> the evil <UNK> as the trio commit a robbery go on the run and <UNK> a kidnapping scheme and so forth the film just sort of ends annoyingly and <UNK> but seeing as how they didn't bother to have much character development and story in the first place its rather appropriate worth a look if you are really into low budget 70's fare but ultimately pretty forgettable
<START> i have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life but none are coming to mind right now hell ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that tarantino brought back and did right in movies like pulp fiction and <UNK> dogs the problem with hell ride is unlike <UNK> and <UNK> the story is garbage and so is character development how many movies does bishop think he can blatantly steal from the brief case in pulp fiction the air gun in no country etc etc speaking of bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie i couldn't help but laugh at those scenes where he's standing with his trusted out desperately trying to seem like some hardened biker nothing in this movie is believable and why dennis hopper did they really need the easy rider <UNK> too i blame larry bishop for his horrible plot and dialogue not to mention his failed attempt at the leading role don't bother watching this movie it's a waste of time
<START> i went to see this movie mostly because it looked so good in the trailers robin williams and barry <UNK> should equal greatness instead it just continues <UNK> bad streak of movies lately what's wrong with the movie more like what's right the ensemble crew does a pretty good job around robin and like usual christopher walken is fantastic that being said this movie just plain wasn't good i really only recommend seeing it if you want to see what it would be like if jon stewart ran for president and won saying he won isn't a spoiler since it was in the trailer the concept and idea is really amusing but that's all most of <UNK> jokes are just recycled from old comedy bits of his and there are very few laugh out loud moments and most are just dumb like most comedies that turn out to suck all of the funny bits are put into the trailer really no surprises there but come on some of the movie reads like a tom <UNK> or vince flynn novel people were expecting this to be <UNK> return to greatness instead it's more a <UNK>
<START> a <UNK> comic tale of a down <UNK> priest showcases the economy that luis <UNK> was able to achieve in being able to tell a deeply <UNK> fable with a minimum of fuss as an <UNK> from his mexican era of film making it was an <UNK> talent to possess with little money and extremely tight <UNK> however surpasses many of <UNK> previous mexican films in terms of the acting francisco is excellent narrative and theme br br the theme interestingly is something that was explored again in made three years later in spain it concerns the <UNK> struggle for humanity and <UNK> amongst a society that rejects any notion of virtue father however is portrayed more <UNK> than sister whereas the latter seems to choose charity because she wishes to <UNK> for her perceived sins whole existence and reason for being seems to be to help others whether they or we like it or not the film's last scenes in which he casts doubt on his behaviour and in a split second has to choose between the life he has been leading or the conventional life that is expected of a priest are so emotional because they concern his moral integrity and we are never quite sure whether it remains intact or not br br this is a remarkable film and i would urge anyone interested in classic cinema to seek it out it is one of <UNK> most moving films and <UNK> many of his <UNK> frustrated desire mad love religious <UNK> etc in my view is second only to 'the <UNK> <UNK> in terms of his mexican movies and is certainly near the top of the list of <UNK> total <UNK> <UNK>
<START> bobby and <UNK> are two little boys who move across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life soon after the family <UNK> in their mom marries the king who ends up being an abusive <UNK> especially to bobby so bobby decides that he will fly away from the abuse in his birthday present br br this movie was difficult to watch especially the abuse scenes it was hard to watch an innocent playful little boy become abused and turn into a <UNK> scared and <UNK> young man the acting is excellent br br i cried throughout the last half of the movie there were some funny scenes in it too like the monster <UNK> and the dog that finds the pop <UNK> br br i wouldn't suggest letting little kids watch it it was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really really flew away
<START> i work in an office on <UNK> and there is a tv that only gets one channel so i don't have the option of turning to something better i keep it on though because it provides a little background noise sometimes i get a decent movie show not today today i got <UNK> <UNK> the city looks like a third rate set which of course it is all the actors and bad guys look like they just <UNK> from <UNK> school i have seen better dramatic <UNK> at a carnival the special effects flames at end of movie are more fake then michael <UNK> <UNK> even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor a badly acted badly shot badly written movie
<START> <UNK> i didn't order no amazing hit show we'll you got one hack is simply the greatest television show ever made a little bit of me died when i <UNK> on the t v one friday night to catch a little hack and it wasn't on the show <UNK> deep into key social issues of our culture i found that at the end of any episode i watched i walked away having been both entertained and informed i am actually dumber now that hack is gone i no longer want to help the <UNK> and less fortunate since hack has been gone i see them as and an <UNK> strain on so for the love of god we need to bring back hack
<START> as someone who used to spend hours driving around the <UNK> of north london in an attempt to avoid the horrific <UNK> this film immediately <UNK> throw in my interest in what london was like back in the late 70s and you have the basic premise for my version of tv heaven on paper the film <UNK> all the right boxes and having just watched the knowledge the actual movie itself certainly lived up to if not <UNK> my high expectations br br visually i was surprised how different london looked back then i lived in in the 90s long after <UNK> had transformed the area it truly came across as <UNK> <UNK> and down at <UNK> london may still have bad <UNK> <UNK> but the general feel of the place is much <UNK> <UNK> and pleasant nowadays based on what this movie shows rather than my own memories br br as for the story and the acting well top marks obviously go to <UNK> <UNK> as the vampire absolutely brilliant he acts deliberately <UNK> <UNK> between total straight faced <UNK> and surreal <UNK> in order to <UNK> the knowledge boys as he puts them through test after test br br all in all this was an excellent thoroughly enjoyable trip back into a very specific time and place that i find endlessly fascinating but even if you're not especially interested in london circa 1979 you'll still enjoy following the witty dialogue and likable characters of the knowledge
<START> this is my favorite horror film a close 2nd to <UNK> i saw <UNK> dark <UNK> when it first came out in theaters in 1983 at the theater where i worked br br i was born in 1963 so i have a certain love for <UNK> horror films despite them being a little dated and the dialog not well written what i thought was so original about it was that the phenomenon of has not been addressed at least to my knowledge at that time and is a very real phenomenon br br i didn't care if adam west was in it nothing against him but his supporting role was not memorable but thought meg <UNK> was good casting the little known donald <UNK> from and from <UNK> as an ambiguous scientist who <UNK> studies on abilities was sadly overlooked as a gay guy i was paying more attention to david mason daniels meg <UNK> unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend he's selling real estate in texas now br br i felt the film <UNK> in two ways who was discovered to have murdered 6 girls in his surreal apartment had a funeral that was sparse in <UNK> <UNK> the fact that not only was he mysterious a <UNK> but a killer as you know these types are buried without <UNK> second if corpses were going to be mobile they would <UNK> dragging their feet the filmmakers could have gone for the schlock walking <UNK> arms out stretched zombies but <UNK> for what would be believable kudos the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from eyes at his like he's <UNK> his kingdom of dead cast an eerie light in the <UNK> that will stay with you for years if you've ever gone to a <UNK> even on a sunny day you will notice that they have their own <UNK> lighting caused by <UNK> glass windows don't get me started on the <UNK> silence even himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric perverted old man the score was one of a kind and memorable and i keep kicking myself for not getting it on <UNK> when it first came out the track shooting was done where it was supposed to be i especially liked the carefully planned characteristics of each corpse the bride the badly child still holding its teddy bear the grandmother the tall thin black guy and the half faced world war ii vet and the green eyed elderly <UNK> who was the first to <UNK> the <UNK> even corpses can be good actors i suppose the only thing i had to <UNK> about was the arm that came out of one of the <UNK> and choke <UNK> boyfriend couldn't possibly be done unless a corpse was put in laying on it's stomach and feet first but why it looked a little to fresh too br br the film begins eerie with us never seeing face until the last quarter of the film which is like <UNK> a birthday present as he is picking up teen girl <UNK> in his daughter's psychic flash we then see <UNK> his body away in his one bedroom apartment where we see he's <UNK> his <UNK> craft by <UNK> into his wall the rest does drag as the <UNK> like group <UNK> julie into a final <UNK> by spending the night inside the <UNK> but it is a well placed build up to the <UNK> horror later the movie isn't bloody in any sense of the word the <UNK> part is when daughter uses a <UNK> mirror to feed his power back to him and he <UNK> then <UNK> i've always felt that a power like could never die and a sequel could be worth looking into i can see it now one dark night ii turning in the grave but let's face it the film stands alone i heard the film had other titles but the original fits br br a remake would be pointless but if there were to be one i would write better dialog and <UNK> some scenes such as show the studies on abilities done in the lab instead of hearing about it on a tape <UNK> in this information age something like that would be well documented on dvd and more corpses why just raise the ones in the <UNK> when power could spread to the graveyard too let's just say i'd hate to be one of the persons who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax something that too can be shown i think having one of the <UNK> sisters recognize one of the corpses as a relative would have added some good if disturbing character with cg effects some awesome scenes with <UNK> <UNK> remains would be off the wall br br say what you will about <UNK> dark <UNK> but it has it all so see at least once in your life or death
<START> i am surprised by the relatively low rating this film has it is a screwball comedy romance film rolled together by someone besides billy wilder but it does a really good job even won an oscar br br it is ingrid <UNK> first film in the us since the 1950's even though she is no longer the young <UNK> she was in her early films she brings off a difficult role quite <UNK> this film proves she had multiple talents beyond her good looks br br goldie hawn who won an oscar in this her first film as supporting actress is very good as the modern sophisticated yet quirky latest mistress to dentist playboy love them leave them walter goldie is delightful to all the senses in this role which with a great cast set her up as a slam <UNK> for this early career award br br this film is not real deep but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well not sure why it's average is so low as i give it a solid 8
<START> there are so many more <UNK> to the plot of this wonderful thought provoking movie than just infidelity and cover up of responsibility for the accident i was struck by the initial seeming goodness of husband <UNK> who wanted the driver when he thought it was everett <UNK> to the police and the change of heart and morals when he learned it was his wife as well was he indeed good and or was he attempting to redeem self by allowing her to go with rupert then things she decided the right <UNK> to do was admit that she hit him most importantly the theme of redemption for the accident for the infidelity in her own odd flawed way is strongest in <UNK> care for everett i believe that is why she <UNK> that effort br br this seems to be a common theme in modern british novels <UNK> <UNK> the end of the affair come to mind love it
<START> oh but this is <UNK> one good actor after another turns in <UNK> dialogue in half hearted fashion under what must have been incredibly pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable i like robert <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is one of my favourite actresses tom <UNK> can act well when pushed and david <UNK> is a professional of the highest integrity but they all around like fish in a barrel of <UNK> <UNK> i swear <UNK> was <UNK> on <UNK> or both br br was there a good performance in the whole thing well yes david hood as the junior underground engineer whose mate got washed away looked like he was taking the thing seriously and credit to him for that it can't be easy when all around are losing theirs so to speak or maybe his scenes came under the direction of the assistant director if there was one i just don't know what these people were doing in a film that was this poor other than paying the bills obviously i can't begin to say how disappointed i am in them you should be ashamed of yourselves br br any <UNK> other than david hood the third yes the <UNK> shots of london largely <UNK> were very well done and the effects artists responsible deserved better than to have their fine work <UNK> by such a shallow story if you'll forgive the expression as those few people that do see them will do so on a far smaller screen than would be to best advantage br br what's going on here why are british film makers trying to imitate such <UNK> spectacle driven <UNK> level genres as the disaster movie and then doing it even worse than the americans gritty realism character integrity the capture of real emotion in a way that makes you feel it and care the family way spring and <UNK> wine get carter the long good friday <UNK> don't get me wrong i like a bit of <UNK> <UNK> the real italian job the adventures of tom jones but oh that it should come to this there was more realistic drama in carry on camping
<START> the numbers don't lie <UNK> people have voted for this film that says a great deal about the standing of one of the most <UNK> insightful comedians of the late 20th century and for those of you who know the work of bill <UNK> if he were alive today imagine what he would have to say about the boy president from his home state that his short career remains <UNK> is a sad situation and this film or rather these two films explain why first you see how his talent was obvious from the start again and again those who knew bill <UNK> always say he was not only funny he was also unique the film also shows how the quality of his material was too challenging for many in the entertainment industry his drinking also contributed to his career problems but that is less evident in this film and then the second film is a complete performance if you have never seen or heard bill <UNK> this is a wonderful introduction to the person and his dark but intelligent humor especially due to the fact that the topics are now almost 14 years old yet remain ironically up to date is <UNK> by the fact that many of the events took place under the first president bush br br watching them together first the biography and then the performance makes you aware of how greatly talented this young man was how quickly his life passed and how the american media can sometimes act as the great big let's make sure nothing is too provocative nothing will be too interesting and the result well as the man himself said go to sleep america your government is in control in his lifetime at least in great <UNK> this artist was recognized for his talent and was successful there 11 years after his death <UNK> people at imdb can say something about the film after you've seen them both i hope you understand why more people should be listening to bill <UNK>
<START> i couldn't stand to watch very much of this crap this is your standard junk that certain annoying women love old english era drama with lots of costumes and cliché characters that seem to be <UNK> from either directly from oliver twist or some other dickens novel this uses the usual clichés from the victorian era certain idiotic people really think that the whole emotional torture of that culture being so bloody repressed is somehow fascinating and romantic this is <UNK> pure and utter junk and boring as watching grass grow as such it is perfect for women who <UNK> some sort of english countryside <UNK> romantic drama in a victorian setting but for this man this movie is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment to watch a bunch of drab boring scenes with unoriginal characters speaking in that wretched forced and fake english accent
<START> i first saw this film accidentally when they showed it on tv and i was up far too late i really <UNK> out there though it's truly incredible from the location as isolated as it's possible to be on this planet it made the <UNK> look like et in the <UNK> swimming pool through the interesting characters keith david is especially good as the <UNK> <UNK> what if we're wrong about him then we're wrong and the effects more <UNK> than alien br br moreover however the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects it's the people you start being scared of knowing that one of them may or may not be all they appear to be it's certainly got the feel of who goes there br br the soundtrack is great it really plays up the isolation fear and gravity of the situation br br finally the <UNK> scene really really cuts even more than the but then again who does punchline of <UNK> enough said
<START> there is somewhere in here the <UNK> of a decent if routine sf story it is <UNK> by several factors first the actor is just awful even the competent actors are awful the dialog is wooden and stilted the plot <UNK> along predictably this seems less like a finished movie than actors going through a walk through extremely disappointing
<START> lead actor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so much in the exceptionally <UNK> the a <UNK> on missed chances in the life of a 50 something woman <UNK> her routine with sincerely poignant motives played out in the <UNK> <UNK> town of <UNK> <UNK> unconventional romantic film so to speak is less a straight out melodrama than a deliberate <UNK> of its characters' surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for br br perfectly <UNK> the requisite world <UNK> subjected to a <UNK> routine <UNK> plays a middle aged woman who before her work shift at a supermarket takes it upon herself to deliver <UNK> of milk among the residents of the <UNK> <UNK> one of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of a local government employee caring for her <UNK> ill wife and were high school <UNK> who courtesy of an <UNK> event concerning their parents separated ways since then br br opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young <UNK> never to leave <UNK> does as such with the narrative <UNK> sticking with as he <UNK> aided by understated yet highly effective performance follows her whether she's having <UNK> with her aunt <UNK> on being single or when she <UNK> up and down the countless footsteps of their <UNK> town to <UNK> milk as she and gradually overcome the <UNK> that kept them apart for years such <UNK> development may not suit viewers <UNK> on fast paced <UNK> but for the rest it's a heartfelt <UNK> that affects <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> this movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses horn to open heaven and pull the good angel dogs out and them on the devil sings and dances to a few songs about the <UNK> of being bad and at one point eats a live rat br br we got this movie free with a pizza you get what you pay for
<START> when one considers that carson <UNK> is one of the foremost literary figures of the 20th century it seems that it needs a very great lack of talent to be able to ruin one of her stories but this movie shows it can be done how do actors <UNK> their way to becoming directors wooden unsympathetic totally out of sync with the poetic compassion of writing my jaw dropped with horror and disbelief that such a <UNK> mash of a movie could ever have found <UNK> and <UNK> the only redeeming features are some moderately good acting although that said vanessa redgrave seems to <UNK> render much the same performance whatever character she plays and some good cinematography in places but otherwise it is a bitter bitter disappointment and it could and indeed should have been a contemporary masterpiece simon <UNK> should hang his head in shame and stick to acting
<START> has there ever been an angel of death like farmer in <UNK> 1960s heroin <UNK> sort of jean <UNK> with a <UNK> pink <UNK> score despite some ultimately insignificant weaknesses a classic shamelessly ripped off by <UNK> segal <UNK> black for their inept jennifer on my mind 1971 although walker playing a similar character is herself very <UNK> appealing in the latter mess more though is terrific a great 60s drug movie and simply an important document of its time very much a cult film so join the cult br br no american movie then as far as i can remember <UNK> the same territory an astonishing <UNK> <UNK> this into <UNK> <UNK> not for the faint hearted great sex scenes too
<START> there won't be one moment in this film where you aren't laughing this is mel brooks at one of his high points and cary <UNK> carries off the part of robin with convincing humour every time you watch this film you will discover a new joke but the ones you have noticed before will never grow old highly
<START> now here is a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time it take ten or so different elements that we're already familiar with vampires martial arts a <UNK> beat top o the line special effects etc and turns it into something that feels brand new in what could have easily been merely a combination of mortal <UNK> and buffy the vampire <UNK> wesley snipes no favorite of mine since and mostly because of passenger <UNK> gives a really good turn as the half human half <UNK> he <UNK> the internal conflict but doesn't <UNK> on it more than necessary he makes blade as deep a character as michael keaton made batman br br i'll say that the only part of the movie that got me a little <UNK> was the always present horror movie cliche of that one person that the hero happens to know who happens to know exactly how to stop the evil guy on the other hand you sort of have to have that in a movie like this so it's easily <UNK> br br well snipes is good and steven <UNK> hyped in the previews makes a more than bad enough bad guy to <UNK> hero he's got class presence and enough control in his little <UNK> to teach al pacino how to tone it down a bit who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a <UNK> pad for an actor i sincerely hope this is and <UNK> where the heck did kris kristofferson get acting talent don't get me wrong but the prolific actor hasn't done anything memorable since millennium and how many of us watched that just 'cause of the cool video box well here he is folks in a very <UNK> turn as <UNK> mentor and father figure and good job too br br the quality of the acting is matched by the quality of the choreography and special effects accompanied by a <UNK> <UNK> beat the fight scenes brings back and quickly <UNK> memories of mortal <UNK> hey it had a script too i was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out there br br the two major <UNK> to me that i saw a quality flick were these i had no feeling of <UNK> about paying full price to get in a la any <UNK> batman the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> godzilla or <UNK> wow how many of those came out this year ugh also i look forward to the inevitable sequel as per the film's ending let's just hope they do as good a job with it as with the first one br br
<START> the is a weird little canadian b movie at first glance it would appear to be just another cheap extremely cheap terminator <UNK> but strangely enough it also shares some qualities with the original <UNK> which hadn't even been released yet when appeared 1986 coincidence who knows anyway the story is thus scientist carl seems to be a pretty nice guy who works for a super <UNK> secret government high tech research lab <UNK> to a sleazy boss named whom he <UNK> heads with about project funding early in the movie <UNK> got a loving wife at home and a baby on the way which makes it all the more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a lab accident but wait <UNK> not really dead after all has <UNK> <UNK> brain and inserted it into his pet project some sort of experimental bio mechanical space suit when carl wakes up inside his new body he understandably goes a little nuts <UNK> the lab and escapes this is a problem because for reasons known only to himself has <UNK> the mechanical suit with a rage reaction program which will cause carl to kill anybody who touches him for any reason in <UNK> that little addition to <UNK> psyche was probably not the best idea br br so <UNK> carl wanders <UNK> through the movie for a while killing a couple of random <UNK> and other <UNK> background characters till he returns to his home and contacts his wife this scene is supposed to be <UNK> touching i guess but turns out comical because <UNK> robot voice is so heavily <UNK> that you can barely understand a word he says he of course tells her to leave the city and never come back because she's in danger but she wants to stay and help him <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eventually hires a gang of <UNK> thugs led by hunter an apparent ninja assassin played by pam <UNK> to hunt down and destroy his runaway creation using <UNK> wife as bait and predictable but laughably cheap looking mayhem ensues br br i'm a b movie kind of guy but the was so half <UNK> that it turned into high comedy pretty quickly i'm assuming that a good hunk of the budget went into stan <UNK> <UNK> carl suit design because that actually looks pretty cool but the rest of the movie suffers from a cheap made for tv kind of look the script could've used a lot more work but then maybe the filmmakers had gotten wind of <UNK> going into production and rushed to get out so they couldn't be accused of ripping them off either way judging by the other comments here on imdb i'm not the only one who's noticed the parallels between and <UNK> and obviously <UNK> is the superior film so there's no need to waste your time sitting through this piece of nonsense unless you want to see a film that can best be described at best as a rough draft of <UNK> if it were made by an <UNK> <UNK>
<START> gotta add a comment to this one br br first ironically one needs to add the alert to <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> but there is absolutely nothing here to be spoiled br br there are six characters the good looking gal whose the a list mountain guide in the area of the climb and apparently among all <UNK> including <UNK> <UNK> on the planet her lost love who disappeared from the titled pass two years prior whom the party is <UNK> seeking but never find her store owner friend also a guide who may be better than a but no match for her the weird lead actor who <UNK> her services and says they'll find her long missing love in the bargain his one associate a computer <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> expertise of a level sufficient that gates might seek advice from him and his other colleague a bodyguard who apparently has an iq not even near three <UNK> br br there are of course <UNK> goings on and the secret quest of the lead actor is to gain <UNK> of a satellite which has fallen in the pass and has world <UNK> and unique data to bring them <UNK> <UNK> exactly what is never revealed br br overacting <UNK> the script looks like something which might get a c in a <UNK> writing class but an f if <UNK> at a higher level and the <UNK> <UNK> every piece of scenery like a <UNK> of <UNK> br br the most interesting aspects of this movie for me was <UNK> portions with three other flicks or roles i've seen br br first the mysterious <UNK> secret data makes one recall the spanish prisoner an a list mamet film surrounding a valuable corporate process never specifically <UNK> but better for it definitely not so here br br second the lead <UNK> proved perhaps even more <UNK> then rambo in dealing quickly when <UNK> later in the presentation br br third i remember a steven seagal flick don't recall the title where he was semi conscious and for about 1 3 of the time and fully <UNK> for another 1 3 although i've not sought viewing a lot of his work i've seen enough to have noted that while <UNK> he provided the best work he ever has and most in line with his <UNK> persona in this <UNK> while awake the young <UNK> may have been the most engaging personality on screen but while <UNK> and <UNK> during the latter portion and unable to <UNK> he provided the best acting during this seemingly <UNK> two hours br br take the thin silly basis for a plot here imagine it being <UNK> into say a on snl with <UNK> bill murray dan <UNK> and martin short in the four roles they could get record laughs with few changes to the dialog here br br the most interesting aspect in the last analysis is <UNK> what information could have been in the spy satellite to be worth even <UNK> to any of many nations and yet rendered worthless according to the guru <UNK> if simply placed upon the internet with no apparent consequences thereafter even a turkey like this one should have at least a small trace of logic somewhere this one is totally devoid
<START> according to me a movie can be best rated by the number of <UNK> <UNK> there are there are probably at least 80 90 scenes in the whole movie that is probably rated as <UNK> by somebody or the other br br this movie is a masterpiece period i know many who have called it ahead of its time probably because it bombed at box office however i think any generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh through out br br i am personally glad that is part of the movie too his role isn't that however its good to see that he is a part of the cast in the funniest hindi movie ever
<START> <UNK> is almost a copy of red in the odd behavior sense but this episode focuses on other people in clark unpredictable life when a <UNK> flower finds it's way into <UNK> jonathan kent is the first to be <UNK> by it the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects jonathan he becomes short <UNK> and violent however clark manages to stop him from doing anything <UNK> until his father finally passes out okay so far so good next up is <UNK> the episode was good up to that point for the flower causes her to attempt <UNK> clark at the last moment he refuses her but the damage has already been done this episode causes the wrong impressions and isn't suitable for people under the age of twenty due to it's adult content the first part was good the last part focusing on the effect the flower has on pete was good but the middle that was all about alternate personality was most <UNK> not and that ruined what could have been a brilliant episode i give this episode two
<START> this is a very bad movie however i read that it was made by a high school teacher so maybe i should give it at least a tiny bit of praise for it's ambitious yet awful special effects here is the plot a monster emerges from a pile of trash and <UNK> in the town of california and <UNK> on a destructive rampage i'm about to spoil the big surprise about what the monster looks like so please read the rest of this at your own risk you have been warned the monster looks sort of like a giant two <UNK> fly wearing a gas mask in some scenes the monster is an actor wearing a costume in other scenes the monster is created by stop motion animation the acting is terrible the dialogue is terrible the special effects are terrible the plot is predictable stay away
<START> ok i could only find three reasons to consider this film worthwhile considering the extremely low budget br br first there was <UNK> <UNK> and rachel carter actually the two of them gave me four good reasons to watch and watch i did br br the only other reason to watch is that a lot of was filmed right down the road now i didn't know this beforehand but i saw an orange county car tag and said wow this was shot in florida br br i was impressed by the flashback to the past and the <UNK> of the young kid but that was really it the killings by the <UNK> man were pretty lame with the exception of the biker br br if you want to see <UNK> and carter ok but return of the living dead will give greater thrills
<START> i just had the opportunity to see <UNK> known in the u s as 'the golden <UNK> and was very impressed by both it's dreamy occasionally surreal tale of a family that from to the u s in the early days of the 20th century it also worked as a proverbial middle finger <UNK> into the <UNK> of <UNK> security preferably all the way up to the 3rd <UNK> in it's depiction of the ill treatment of <UNK> who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land the mostly italian cast with a few exceptions works well this is a quiet understated film that is lovely to look at the occasional but <UNK> use of <UNK> is always a pleasure while the screenplay is well written this is a film for those who are sick tired of mindless <UNK> from hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn not that i have any burning issues with popcorn mind you i actually love the stuff you would do wise to seek out the golden door or whatever it's being titled in your area
<START> following on directly from the last episode of the previous series yes minister br br jim <UNK> now finds himself inside number 10 <UNK> street as prime minister of great britain instead of a <UNK> minister and a member of the government he is now leading her <UNK> government br br all this after some scheming <UNK> by sir <UNK> <UNK> after the previous prime minister <UNK> at the end of yes minister br br sir <UNK> <UNK> is now the head of the civil service br br i thought that this series was better than the first series or though it did not last as long as the first series unfortunately
<START> i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to with the <UNK> should ever have been <UNK> having expressed that i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in <UNK> i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been <UNK> by the ideas and interpretations of another writer the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of <UNK> and film making the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe
<START> i somehow failed for a few years to see this film although it has been quite successful and generated a lot of discussions in israel i am sorry that i did not <UNK> <UNK> seeing it br br the theme of is a very real and painful one for those who know the jewish religious world the place of women in the <UNK> family and society the basic situation that sits at the premises of the film is possible the problem is that the way it is brought to screen and the that the conflicts described receives in the movie is wrong <UNK> does not seem to have too much sympathy for men in the religious world but his approach of picking characters that are either fanatic or unable to express their human feeling makes the whole story seem simplistic neither does he a much better service to his women characters although here at least he shows more sympathy and he also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and gifted actresses in and overall <UNK> vision is too one sided his cinema means are too basic he focuses on the technical details of the jewish religious life which may be interesting for people who do not know them but are really not relevant at all in the context of the whole story starting from interesting premises what we get here is a boring film which seems longer than it is with a very static way of acting obsessive use of music that plays in the same register not only from a musical but also from an emotional perspective and a very <UNK> if not even confusing ending what difference between this film and <UNK> inspired from and describing the very same social landscape and which succeeded to <UNK> human feelings on the screen in there are both too little cinema and too little human emotions
<START> but it's still an entertaining tv movie the <UNK> to the civil war makes a nice change of pace and adds a few <UNK> such as <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> that you might not otherwise see thankfully they didn't try to make it a mini series at 90 minutes it's just about right
<START> this film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made in that it displays the reality of soldiers in a battle situation as well as the particular circumstances of the battle of <UNK> obvious when one <UNK> this film to works such as anthony book <UNK> br br unlike the better known enemy at the gates where the plot <UNK> into a sniper hunting story this film shows what war can do to individuals although filmed by germans <UNK> is anything but a <UNK> <UNK> film it shows that war films can be something beyond flag waving <UNK> <UNK> of the grim truth of war like so many hollywood war products seem to be br br the scripting acting direction and other film techniques in are of the highest caliber br br it's a must see film for anyone <UNK> to join an army and to <UNK> orders from any type of <UNK>
<START> danny glover and carey <UNK> obviously forgot how to act when they made this movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the pay off is even worse i feel sorry for danny glover i hope he got paid well for this because it makes him look completely foolish the same goes for mr <UNK> an absolute slap in the face to any horror movie fan despicable this is probably the worst display of acting by veteran actors i have ever seen i wonder if they bothered to look at the script or if they did it must have said forget everything you know about acting because this makes the two of them look ridiculous for two seasoned veterans to act this way is appalling i hope the pay check was very large i thought at first it was a spoof if you can find satisfaction in this movie then more power to you
<START> i was looking in the tv guide for movies that come from germany and i found one called the so i watched it and i laughed myself silly i wanted the dvd but its not available here i could order it from germany but it doesn't have subtitles it was played again so i taped it and watch it from time to time br br anyway i looked for info on it and found out its real name is <UNK> but i know it by its australian title the br br some people who i know from germany do not like <UNK> because of their accents but not being german myself i didn't notice anything the jokes are good but some germans might find their accents off putting br br i think this movie is funny and if the dvd had english subtitles on all the extras having a 2 <UNK> edition with only the feature having subtitles would be bad i would buy it up in a snap br br i recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story
<START> stylish thought provoking cool and gripping  just four aspects of a film that will long remain in the thoughts of this viewer br br slow paced it may be at the beginning but the director <UNK> with beautiful camera work sophisticated compositions and elegant editing the unfolding of the story not so much the narrative line but the revelation of the characters' inner <UNK> is masterful br br olivia <UNK> who plays sophia the hotel <UNK> who finally breaks down the icy <UNK> of former <UNK> tony is <UNK> beautiful and reveals hidden depths and personal honesty in her brief but profound relationship with br br the <UNK> mafia middle man forced to live out an empty life tormented by insomnia in a swiss hotel becomes caught up in the similarly empty lives of the <UNK> older couple who <UNK> owned the hotel but are now forced to live there as residents after the husband <UNK> away their resources years earlier the husband is constantly dreaming about recovering his lost wealth and making a grand statement to the world his wife realises this is but a <UNK> dream this nicely <UNK> the <UNK> of who sees no way out and does not seek one br br the fleeting love affair between and sophia has consequences that no one could have <UNK> it <UNK> him to escape his prison without bars but to pay a huge price that he willingly accepts and in doing so provides redemption for the older couple
<START> this is one of the best musicals of the 1940s the glorious technicolor shows off rita <UNK> beauty and spectacular hair she should have made more movies in color but then columbia was hardly in a position to <UNK> out money for technicolor <UNK> br br rita is a wow as rusty parker she more than keeps up with gene in some of the most <UNK> numbers ever she also looked beautiful in turn of the century <UNK> so she was given a chance to play her own grandmother br br the film opens with the show must go on it looks great to me but danny <UNK> gene kelly is not impressed his <UNK> is work work work one of the dancers <UNK> is determined to better herself and is going to audition for golden wedding cover girl competition rusty just happens to find herself at the <UNK> as well in a very funny scene has just had a so so audition and seeing rusty gives her a few <UNK> on how to impress the judges don't be shy and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> rusty does so with gusto br br they decide on and go to the show to see her but john otto <UNK> sees rusty she reminds him of someone from his past <UNK> eve <UNK> is still having nightmares over audition whose complaining features genius phil <UNK> and the dancers dressed up as working girls rusty is a <UNK> br br john is remembering a long lost love grandmother <UNK> the first time he saw her singing a sure thing set at the races meanwhile danny rusty and genius are looking for <UNK> at their local diner they then launch into the <UNK> song of the 1940s in my opinion make way for tomorrow br br put me to the test is a spirited song and dance number featuring danny and rusty in the meantime rusty has been chosen cover girl and danny is the place to be seen lee <UNK> appears as <UNK> romantic rival and puts a <UNK> on things lee <UNK> is probably the most boring leading man ever so danny never needs to worry br br rusty dubbed by martha <UNK> sings long ago and far away and it is <UNK> beautifully by danny and rusty the <UNK> that rita wears are stunning travis <UNK> and <UNK> designed them danny wants the best for rusty but is afraid he will lose her gene kelly is also fantastic in the alter ego number where he dances with himself br br poor john is another look back to the turn of the century it was written in <UNK> and is an extremely funny song <UNK> fun at rich relations hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit look for al norman in both poor john and a sure thing he was an amazing eccentric dancer who appeared in several early musicals including king of jazz and paramount on parade he was easy to spot br br the cover girl dance is just wonderful rita was so talented beautiful and a great dancer after a <UNK> of beautiful models parade through covers of america's top magazines rusty bursts through in a beautiful gold <UNK> dancing down a <UNK> to the very catchy cover girl song gosh i just love this movie br br highly recommended
<START> it is not <UNK> for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial wake up call and should they survive this event they come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular good fortune however in the case of <UNK> they are rarely as funny after their <UNK> as they were prior to it such is the case with martin lawrence frankly i pay little attention to celebrities as i have much better things to do with my life than to spend it <UNK> <UNK> so i was unaware of the majority of what lawrence had gone through prior to this film it was interesting but unfortunately all to common i was left with the larger impression that this guy's stand up act just wasn't very funny save the big life messages for a book just be funny on stage if you want to see a funny martin lawrence go rent some of the old <UNK> <UNK> for which he <UNK> don't rent
<START> just as the whole cast and crew knows f all about film making br br this film concerns the adventures and <UNK> of a modern day cockney vampire assassin and an age old <UNK> with her seemingly jaded vampire lover that plot in itself <UNK> of clichés and promises of boredom when on as small a scale a film as this and that's exactly what you get br br first off let me say that i by no means dismiss films because they are b movies in fact some of my favourite films are b movies such as jesus christ vampire hunter but this one misses the mark by a mile br br anyone with any knowledge of small budget films will know that the acting is rarely gripping and emotional but razor blade smile creates a whole new dimension of <UNK> it up on screen some of the so called acting is just <UNK> bad with characters <UNK> cheesy one liners that fall flat and <UNK> expressing about as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after a couple of horse br br a vast portion of the film is also taken up by the <UNK> characters the protagonist in particular unnecessarily <UNK> their mouths showing off their ridiculously large vampire teeth and <UNK> very <UNK> it literally must happen in almost every scene at least once and quickly became annoying and pointless as if that many looks of slack <UNK> supposedly scary vampire faces were used to merely fill a little bit of time and pad out the rest of this turd <UNK> of a film br br contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe on here i feel this film the director in particular is really trying to take this film seriously in many parts the sheer number of overly dramatic action shots and extreme close ups seems to indicate to me that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate to its genre and not spoof it and he fails miserably the attempts at supposedly <UNK> sex scenes come out as comic and silly and the action sequences are sometimes just plain stupid br br also the ending of this film was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions i have seen to a film b movie or not when films such as this force you to sit through hours of themselves only to be rewarded with a oh it was all a game ending it is actually sickening it the conclusion to the plot feels like an <UNK> of the director that he figured out on the last day of shooting because they had run to the end of their <UNK> budget br br but i have not rated this film as one star despite the overwhelming <UNK> and this is because of the only plus point i can really give this film intentionally or not it was funny i am fairly sure the parts i found humorous were not intended to be and i found most of the efforts at genuine gags to be <UNK> but when watched with friends it is a good film to take the mickey out of
<START> tom jackson is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene <UNK> upper in his latest job he <UNK> a new crime scene and destroys evidence and isn't aware the crime hasn't been officially reported uh oh this can't be good br br you hear about <UNK> all the time but usually when a mob or <UNK> hit is involved when bodies etc need to be removed and the area <UNK> up this one is different in that tom works with the police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of a crime scene hey someone has to do it you know the police won't the movie makes that quite clear and it is up to the family to get the area <UNK> up br br this is almost a good thriller but a side plot involving <UNK> daughter <UNK> makes this story somewhat awkward i guess they had to fill in some time oh they brought this side plot around to connect with the another side plot but it was still a reach and awkward see br br this was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension suspense and the pace was somewhat <UNK> the music didn't help either as i noticed the music was more appropriate for watching people take a long journey you know journey music get it ha br br the acting by all was excellent in this almost a good thriller br br violence yes sex no nudity no language no
<START> great little short film that aired a while ago on <UNK> here in <UNK> get a copy if you can probably only good for a few viewings as you'll end up remembering the script and it's the twists that make this film so funny well directed and <UNK> scripted it's an example of just how good low budget short films can be
<START> my girlfriend and i are really into cheesy horror flicks especially ones with lots of unnecessary nudity when we saw the box cover for this movie at blockbuster we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night we began watching it already not expecting it to be great but thought it would at least catch our interest 20 minutes into the movie we realized that the pace would not eventually pick up and that it was an incredibly boring movie we tried to get into it but the plot made very little sense even after reading the back of the dvd box over and over again the film was shot very dark and it was pretty annoying to try to figure out what was going on in each shot each violent scenes were very hard to make out and you never get to actually watch the violence you're expecting this is definitely a film without motive that was shot poorly and very drawn out each scene was about 20 minute of the same thing and i felt i got the point after the first 5 skip this film and re watch another freddy or jason flick and you'll be way more content
<START> this is a <UNK> movie from my childhood i can still hum the theme song at the drop of a hat i remember getting to stay up late to watch this movie with my father usually two to three times a year we always referred to it as giant robot although the effects in this movie are crude compared to today's standards they were perfect for this movie's genre i am also a big fan of the japanese monster movies so this movie fell right in to place with the others it's been years since i've seen this movie would love to get my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8 year old daughter
<START> i cannot believe i let myself rent that piece of garbage the acting was so poor my grandmother could have done better the punches thrown in the movies were nowhere near the character the scarecrow was knocking to the floor the movie became a chore to watch br br so this group of baseball <UNK> decide to go <UNK> even after they weren't supposed to in orders form there coach under consequences so naturally they go anyway they decide to tie a loser to a post with the so called scarecrow when the <UNK> best friend finds out about this him and his girlfriend go to rescue him br br the kid is found out to have <UNK> and is <UNK> while the <UNK> head out to the beach the next day the scarecrow finds them there and kills them all pretty much br br i'm sure you really don't care anyway the scarecrow ends up having a connection with <UNK> boy and the boy starts to finish off the scarecrows job once the scarecrow is killed yes it is really really cheesy br br it thought this movie was full of bull sh t sooner or later the only ones living naturally are the boyfriend and girlfriend who are the main characters the evil is then <UNK> to the boyfriend and he kills himself to break the curse so nobody else will be hurt touching hey no don't waste your hard earned money on this i give it a score of a one since thats lowest otherwise it doesn't even deserve that much
<START> i have read all of the reviews for this direct to video movie i can agree that the movie is not <UNK> or deep impact quality nevertheless if you are looking for a way to pass ninety minutes or so then this is a movie that is bearable br br i started looking at the film early in the am hours as i was doing some geek stuff it was very nice because i was able to switch back and forth between what i was doing and watching the movie with out missing a beat it is a predictable movie and the acting is not up to par for some of the veteran actors for instance dennis hopper br br but i should point out that i paid only 2 us and as the old <UNK> goes you get what you pay for if you are looking for some deep meaning movie that will have you have to watching it over and over again then this is definitely the long video on the other hand if you looking for something to pass the time then there is nothing wrong with which incidentally was called <UNK> final impact in mexico where i found this video
<START> undoubtedly the funniest movie i have ever seen it's definitely worth the <UNK> minutes it takes to watch i will never look at my kitchen <UNK> the same way again bob deserves an oscar relax kid it's only a movie
<START> a boy who <UNK> maurice richard of the <UNK> receives much to his horror a toronto <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the mail i recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey but nearly everyone knew about maurice richard and the toronto <UNK> rivalry highly entertaining amusing and accurate
<START> chris smith's american movie is an insightful examination of the american dream the movie focuses around mark an independent film maker from <UNK> mark has <UNK> of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had an out of focus <UNK> camera the movie follows mark through his attempt to make his dream feature film <UNK> there are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as mark goes through pre production of <UNK> and later his short film <UNK> <UNK> co <UNK> the correct <UNK> mark says sounds too much like <UNK> which he plans to use to raise money to complete <UNK> this film's insight and humor is on par with roger and me michael moore's great film i first viewed it at a chaotic sundance film festival screening that brought out the spirit of the movie a giant air <UNK> fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie hit seven people and caused a twenty five minute <UNK> half way through the film the sound started <UNK> and the <UNK> had to be stopped to fix it and in the last twenty minutes the <UNK> stopped and the film burned up despite the <UNK> the audience stayed through the movie and gave it a standing <UNK> american movie also won the grand jury prize for documentary at the end of the festival i highly recommend this fine film worth sitting through any <UNK> screening
<START> unfortunately <UNK> seems doomed to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work <UNK> follows the original book very closely seemingly until the production company ran out of money all of the sets in the first half of the movie were <UNK> <UNK> from the book something which has been lacking in many other <UNK> films despite its other numerous <UNK> i continued to watch in anticipation of some really great scenery wrong by the time the detectives show up at the crack <UNK> apartment in the book the movie is out of <UNK> and one of the most suspenseful scenes from the book is ruined where the book offered grisly discovery a search and a chase through the guys apartment the movie offers the <UNK> of the guys car br br let's face it <UNK> writes without a budget in mind because imagination is free if a <UNK> novel ever gets made into a decent movie no one will go and see it because they have been let down so many many many times before this is why dean frankenstein is now just <UNK> if you had seen your work butchered that many times you'd get out early if it looked like happening again
<START> maybe it's because i read peter wonderful book before seeing the film but i was terribly disappointed by this movie in my opinion the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique and replaced it with more common hollywood style elements br br it's too bad too since this movie has a terrific cast particularly fred astaire douglas fairbanks jr melvyn douglas john <UNK> and the then largely unknown alice <UNK> they're just not given very much worthwhile to do br br in fact i was all for leaving halfway through but a friend convinced me to stay to the end as he was sure it had to get better he to me during the closing credits
<START> this film is probably the worst movie i have watched in a very long time the acting is so wooden a door could have done a better job the plot is laughable and shallow and the actual <UNK> shown is a far cry from reality i still don't get the as portrayed in this poor excuse for entertainment i am not a <UNK> but i do know that the can only be performed by someone of origin and not by an all american white boy br br i am assuming that this was made for the american audience so the <UNK> and disney <UNK> is <UNK> but there was hardly any attempt to point out the basic rules of the game apart from the prison side where the main character suddenly takes charge of an american football game and gets everyone playing <UNK> instead the only thing good about this film were the end credits it would be less painful to spend ninety minutes <UNK> <UNK> into your <UNK>
<START> if it would of had jack black listed as the leading actor i would of stayed away from this movie right away it actually makes some of his movies look good compared to this movie this movie should of been filmed as a cartoon for ages 3 8 and it would of been a lot better it is nothing but a bunch of the stupidest skits from other movies put together to make one big mess the movie looks like it was shot in about one day with no thought at all behind it there's a few times where it looks like maybe there's gonna be a turning point and the movie well actually have plot to the movie or at least a storyline would develop but the stupid skits inserted just ruin the whole movie
<START> this film proves you don't need a hollywood budget to make something fun to watch what stuck with me is how the crew from different locations was able to pull together with no promises of <UNK> to make something just because they believed in it i think anybody who makes low budget movies can relate to certain scenes such as actors who just can't get that one line being bothered by the police and having most of the crew disappear after the first week nobody got paid for this which says a lot for the people who had to travel cross country and for the long hours spent editing after watching sell his personal property use his own money and trash his house to make the movie i am a bit curious how close his wife may have come to leaving good job to all
<START> this movie is one of the funniest i have seen in years a movie which deals with death and <UNK> without being depressing or <UNK> christopher walken provides much of the comedy in this charming romance and i could hardly breathe for laughing so hard br br i saw the movie a preview and when it was over the audience not only <UNK> but <UNK> i am telling all my friends to watch for it's arrival in the usa i definitely plan on seeing it again in the theater and <UNK> it on dvd as soon as it's available
<START> this is not a <UNK> james cagney vehicle since his screen time is unusually slim frankie <UNK> plays tough kid jimmy smith the leader of a gang of street thugs that is sent to <UNK> school with a few of his <UNK> friends cagney plays <UNK> <UNK> a gang leader himself who is given a token position as a deputy <UNK> when he finds out first hand of the brutal treatment <UNK> out at the <UNK> school he is compelled to make some major changes with the help of the <UNK> nurse <UNK> evans br br the mayor of hell is fast paced and is still entertaining after all these years the cast is well rounded featuring dudley <UNK> arthur <UNK> g pat collins and allen <UNK>
<START> what has hurt this film is everyone and their aunt <UNK> is comparing it to its <UNK> predecessor which is always going to hurt any show if you take it as a western it's a <UNK> good show we discover how our characters in wind up in the situations they start up in such as why do two texas rangers who live on adventure wind up in a dead town and how did gus manage to lose the love of his life the performances are very good and we see the exact same mannerisms the characters will have down the road the actors did a very good job the cinematography was superb and while the music didn't live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades past that was an impossible task and it was still fine br br it also helped that we had three episodes which you just don't see in a miniseries anymore heck it's downright impossible to see a two part <UNK> these days br br fans of the western <UNK>
<START> this is not the best movie you might ever see but it still is very refreshing of course it has it's flaws it has it's <UNK> moments and yet at the same time it's different from all the sh t you're used to and is funny in a way only the french can give you this you might recognize a little from the masterpiece <UNK> when you see the opening i give it 7 out of 10 but still <UNK> it to you if you're tired of the usual bore you can rent in the <UNK>
<START> when i first rented batman returns i immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional i mean jack nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first so without him how could there be a good movie simple throw in danny <UNK> br br batman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman there are more villains here less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects and more nerve striking issues however the music is similar to the first if not darker the scenery is definitely more depressing than the first every detail right down to the time of year this movie follows the same comic style format we came to love in the first batman br br now for the performances michael keaton thankfully returns as batman bruce wayne he was great in the first movie and just as much in this sequel there was not enough screen time in the world for keaton as batman need more danny <UNK> gave an award winning performance as the penguin the most <UNK> disgusting lovable angry evil sad pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie you hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time and it explains him down to the last detail too making it all the more <UNK> michelle pfeiffer was excellent as <UNK> <UNK> kyle two completely different personalities in one she actually got a good amount of back story as well christopher walken didn't disappoint as max the greedy <UNK> selfish <UNK> of the power company michael <UNK> also thankfully returns as the lovable alfred and he was just as good here as well pat <UNK> also returns as gordon although i feel he was really never in the spotlight br br with lots of great twists and sub plots batman returns is sure to please any fan of the original br br 9 10
<START> i enjoyed <UNK> 11 i thought it was quite enjoyable helped by the performances and the direction however i was disappointed with this film don't get me wrong it is not a complete dud thanks to the stellar performances from brad pitt catherine zeta jones george clooney and matt damon especially and the efficient direction from steven soderbergh however the film really does suffer from truly <UNK> pacing some of the film was so slow i almost fell asleep between one key twist second the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up the camera work wasn't as innovative as it was in the first movie either whereas in the first movie it was smooth and professional it was jerky and awkward here and the music wasn't particularly memorable the screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun and the film felt anti climatic at the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy despite the expert playing and direction so much potential but really a missed opportunity 4 10 <UNK> cox
<START> before i saw this movie i believed there were two kinds of bad cinema 1 your average completely uninspired fare i e <UNK> and 2 the work that is <UNK> bad or so bad it's good a la <UNK> the hands of fate now that i've seen dr gore i know there is a third kind of bad movie the utter crap <UNK> that will be <UNK> <UNK> on your memory a work that is mind <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br i have hated certain films before but i've never hated a film so much that my loathing reached its hold and became self loathing have you seen a movie that not only makes you regret losing the hour you spent watching it but makes you <UNK> for another hour after that mystery science theatre <UNK> beware this is soul sucking cinema go rent circle of iron or the killer <UNK> instead
<START> i really wanted to like this movie because i love troma and loved the trailer and loved <UNK> another of films it did have some almost good moments like the <UNK> love song playing over the car crash scene and a scene near the end where the protagonist gets some closure but on the whole it was just boring and mildly unpleasant br br the <UNK> shocks that came up with were really predictable and worn out <UNK> murdering prostitutes incest could have still been good but poorly done unsure whether it was trying to offend <UNK> or both ultimately did neither br br in conclusion we watch troma movies because we want films with heart this film did not consistently feel like it had heart there were some good scenes but ultimately it was dull and unpleasant
<START> i was surprised to catch this on tv friday and i enjoyed it between the presence of <UNK> phillips and the numerous references to everything that could be considered <UNK> this was a fun movie to watch i enjoyed the story which reminded me of a book i've read earth david and was fun to see on tv <UNK> looks great but i also enjoyed her performance as <UNK> because she did seem different from everyone else but the greatest thing about this movie was the atmosphere that has been described in books by gibson sterling and others it was just fun to see it on tv
<START> i loved this movie it's a lot of laughs the acting is good and the writing is really sharp i'd rather see a hundred movies like this than three lord of the rings repeating and repeating themselves br br it's a low budget affair and seems to be shot on <UNK> but looks good and jay <UNK> and <UNK> nicholson are great together why do you have a ten line minimum i'm not a critic just a <UNK> br br i doubt very much that quentin tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with <UNK> gratuitous violence this movie should be seen on more screens than just one i laughed from beginning to end
<START> do not watch this movie go see something else i was very disappointed i cannot rate this movie any better than 3 the acting was quite good and i really liked william dafoe as the villain but i cannot see why this movie made it to the big screen the story was old and has been shown in 100 other movies and 1000 tv series movies the main problem was basically nothing is happening take a kidnapping let the villain make the wife of the kidnapped man deliver the money make the police look stupid and boring and <UNK> this to 95 minutes you got your <UNK> movie the only 2 reasons i did not rate this a 1 was a dafoe and b the plan b ending there are not many endings you can give a <UNK> movie 75 of these kind end with ending a 20 end ending b and 1 ends with something boring boring boring
<START> the sf premise isn't unique although it pretty much was back then but the focus is a completely different one than in other artificial reality films especially during the first part it is an elaborate crime picture that uses the sf premise to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the <UNK> of <UNK> characters and <UNK> witnesses who don't have to lie to be <UNK> instead of an <UNK> narrator we have an <UNK> world br br in part two we follow the main character's struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation he knows his very existence is nothing more than <UNK> <UNK> how does he deal with this knowledge he knows that there is a world that is more real than his but he is trapped in an artificial world a world where nobody can understand him the problem of thinking of knowing something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with for me the film <UNK> this <UNK> very well with its dreary artificial atmosphere which also supports the factual <UNK> of the film's world br br other than 'the <UNK> or 'the <UNK> it's little concerned with <UNK> a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot instead it very much focuses on the psychological aspects philosophy is only in so far interesting in that certain philosophical concepts are essential in how they shape and alter the character's perception of the world br br arguably it is longer than it has to be which isn't a problem if you are as captivated by it as i was and part 2 runs pretty low on steam
<START> i no words no words can describe this i will try for the sake of those few brave people who stick knives into their <UNK> after watching this show br br this <UNK> person her acting is like watching a female gorilla dance upon the nest of highly <UNK> insects perhaps i <UNK> however i have a feeling that the description fits a regular day of writing this show br br the characters in this repulsive pile of raw <UNK> are as useless as a small piece of space rock that flies into the sun on any day of the week though heart attacks have not been experienced while watching them act like fools on the cheaply built sets i have no doubt that it will happen eventually br br the main plot of this <UNK> into the faces of the actors is that of a foolish girl who <UNK> a live weekly web cast on the <UNK> titled com with her brainless friends one of which owns equipment that the producers of this show probably couldn't afford her legal guardian is some kind of moron who is apparently her older brother br br i haven't watched all of this show for fear of developing cancer or perhaps a cold but some of the plot points i have seen involve the brother getting stuck in an elevator the <UNK> of the apartment almost <UNK> and the world's priest coming for a visit no really br br avoid this if you are over the age of unborn or if you have a history of joining mysterious <UNK> due to mental trauma if you do decide to watch it laugh when the laugh track tells you to as this will <UNK> out the repetitive noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for too long br br the show receives a one star rating because the imdb inexplicably has not adopted the use of negative numbers
<START> i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production but it turned out to be the the biggest let down a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss it was vulgar and <UNK> i don't think dr seuss would have <UNK> how the grinch stole christmas was much better i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on whereas the cat in the hat screamed <UNK> they caught a lot more than i would have liked growing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got <UNK> on the big screen lets see what they do with <UNK> hears a who i hope this one does dr seuss some justice
<START> this is without question one of the worst movies i have ever seen however it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious i like to compare it to plan 9 in that it can be so bad so awful so dumb and such a waste of time that i find myself laughing out loud br br one of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of robin hood and let be honest and say that i love robin hood with errol flynn and robin hood men in <UNK> but let's face it from the forbidden love between peck who is definitely <UNK> it although in all fairness this was still a good few years before the masterpiece to kill a <UNK> and the female character who is so forgettable apparently that i have forgotten her name to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys screams robin hood all over it br br however i don't think the film isn't worth seeing on the contrary i think that this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years even if it was unintentional
<START> a really wonderful cast and very talented technical crew wasted their valuable career time and our equally valuable <UNK> time by bothering to support this utterly predictable and <UNK> formulaic piece of commercial junk the movie is based upon a really good and very <UNK> idea but both the producers and the director simply applied the standard hollywood <UNK> formula and thereby ruined any potential value from the production br br an unusually high tide and very strong <UNK> conditions combine to produce a record high storm <UNK> that <UNK> london and <UNK> most of the <UNK> valley the plot centers around a heroic scientist tom who <UNK> the authorities of the danger and ultimately saves the day a glamorous female police chief who runs the entire show and an <UNK> deputy prime minister david <UNK> who tries to look important br br but it's all so unreal that one feels like an extended tea break after just 30 minutes the young glamorous female police <UNK> demands complete authority over the army during a <UNK> state of <UNK> and gets it as if the experienced general is just pushed aside like a complete moron who has to <UNK> her boots because of her obviously superior capacity the trouble is that our female <UNK> whilst now responsible for millions of lives spends most of her time worrying over the fate of her two daughters who have taken a trip to south west london and haven't to say they were alright so our mighty woman sets her staff to look for them and decides that the sole <UNK> for all the army and the rescue services must be south west london and not any other quarter of the city of course the minister the army and the entire <UNK> accept her without question one can only assume they all had property there when her children are eventually found after endless reports and efforts by her staff she is told by our male hero <UNK> god they're safe that's the main <UNK> never mind about the millions of others or all the other <UNK> she was supposed to control as long as her own kids were safe everything was alright br br this film is just another excuse to push the same old female <UNK> sexist <UNK> trap that women are the clever <UNK> caring and clearly able leaders whilst men are good for nothing except physical bravery mindless strength and very <UNK> knowledge and yet the one simple <UNK> that she could have given the <UNK> namely to go to the nearest tall building and <UNK> go up to the 4th floor or above and <UNK> <UNK> when the waters was never given by this female super hero or indeed anyone else the whole problem was so simple to solve and yet millions of people apparently didn't think of simply going upstairs pathetic rubbish
<START> the best thing about the movie is the name as it both describes the plot and the acting at least they cannot say they didn't warn you kind of like the button labeled don't push this br br segal must have run out of things that move like planes trains and ships but the plot remains the same under cover guy who fights slowly but still beats like 40 <UNK> types and doesn't even blink when doing so what <UNK> me is that segal is now as big as a <UNK> and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a <UNK> with a machine gun and 50 clips of <UNK> where do all these bullets actually go to the only redeeming feature of this movie is watching <UNK> pound <UNK> rule real name jeffrey <UNK> doesn't quite sound so punk into the floor i could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that especially wearing an outfit like that it was just a bonus watching get is ss kicked and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed sorry it's just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy can't act <UNK> out of the movies who came up with idea anyway i'd lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angels br br the only surprising twist in this movie is that they don't do the politically correct thing and have come in and save the day no doubt if <UNK> otherwise known by his <UNK> as <UNK> which again doesn't sound so cool when you refer to him as cal had been in the movie he'd throw some signs down on her and probably saved <UNK> life or something
<START> honestly this may be the worst movie i've ever seen and i've seen spider baby and not of this earth heck i've even seen 200 <UNK> having just discovered the freaks and <UNK> series and being surprised at the acting ability of linda i checked out the reviews here and decided this was worth a try that is the last time i will ever rely on a review at imdb i didn't realize that morons were writing imdb reviews while they were waiting for their calls to be answered on am radio br br this movie is so far beyond bad that mere words cannot express the <UNK> of its <UNK> state seriously br br watch this movie if you think will <UNK> is really really really funny if you think adam sandler is a comedic genius watch this movie but please don't breed
<START> have you ever tried a kind of food that your friend made and then said to yourself wow that was not a good mix well that is how i felt after watching this film br br many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very very corny comedy its almost like watching mr rogers play a ruthless gangster very weird some things just don't mix and this film clearly proves that br br there are some very good performances here as dean <UNK> <UNK> and alec baldwin are all excellent but that doesn't make up for the lack of balance and <UNK> in the film br br jonathan <UNK> has done some excellent work in films such as silence of the <UNK> and philadelphia but seems to be out of his element with this one
<START> i saw this before ho at the <UNK> film festival in <UNK> everything about it is either <UNK> the hat to or completely ripping off tim burton i enjoyed it nonetheless even if it is extremely derivative what most impressed me was the quality of the visuals given the obvious shoe string budget the set design and the props were inventive and original although the script definitely was not
<START> especially considering i can count on one hand the romantic comedy films i have ever enjoyed br br <UNK> driver is very good as the heart transplant patient who has a mysterious connection to <UNK> recently deceased wife i can think of several awful films which have used this story line i think there was an <UNK> movie with jane seymour this film however is a keeper br br duchovny is sympathetic and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad the dog misses his deceased wife all of his friends want him to find a replacement and there is an amusing scene where he is on a blind date and driver is the waitress his date is horrible and he finds himself intrigued by <UNK> driver br br <UNK> <UNK> is also good in one of his last roles as the <UNK> grandfather bonnie hunt and james belushi this is the only film i have liked him in round out the comedy aspect of the film br br this is a good film because the story works it is not overly romantic and does not insult the audience's intelligence highly recommended 9 10
<START> the main attraction of anywhere but here is the superb performance of natalie portman she gave her rather <UNK> character a lot of much appreciated emotional depth susan sarandon a fine actress is suitably sincere as the mother figure i thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script i am not saying the script was bad in any way i am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times i don't think it was the script writer's fault the film did suffer from being overlong and became sometimes <UNK> in the longer scenes the film does look beautiful with some good direction and excellent performances all in all watchable certainly but maybe more for an older audience 7 10 <UNK> cox
<START> director <UNK> is perhaps best known in his <UNK> at least for his japanese gangster films a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both samurai and battles without honor and humanity and both feature a lead character who finds his <UNK> challenged by <UNK> both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die and since so little is done to develop them their deaths have little impact when they do come this film has other flaws as well the makeup costumes and sound design are <UNK> poor and the battle scenes were <UNK> as well inferior to other samurai films of earlier years seven samurai comes to mind br br sonny chiba plays the sonny chiba character in samurai the no nonsense master <UNK> who <UNK> through the film <UNK> <UNK> what a guy he even gets to wear an eye <UNK> if you were expecting to see the legendary <UNK> <UNK> you may be disappointed his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting he disappears for good br br overall the strengths of the film are its story which is infinitely more <UNK> than those gangster films and the challenges <UNK> to traditional concepts of good and evil two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently <UNK> father who may have had some help on his way out early on it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn't be more clearly good and evil after all the older brother <UNK> and has a <UNK> the sure sign of a villain eventually however it becomes clear that in a winner takes all struggle for power there are no heroes and villains only winners and losers
<START> it's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released the dialog was unnatural especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step father i guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog but what was said seemed false and artificial the suspense just wasn't there the music was about as bad as it gets the only reason i watched this movie was because i live in the death valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen fortunately the movie was on tv and so i didn't waste any money renting this sorry excuse for a film i honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than was presented here it's too bad that the time of an entire film crew was wasted on such trash i guess the only positive thing i can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good
<START> anne natalie portman tells us about how much she hates her mother adele sarandon that's how the movie begins adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to california without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason the story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter it's really deep and touching thanks to the great work of the actresses natalie was nominated to a golden globe for that role she is one of the most talented actresses i ever saw and so is sarandon they really look like mother daughter the soundtrack is also great the movie is incredible 10 out of 10
<START> i was swept into this series just as surely as the sea would <UNK> me into its grip although it started out slowly i found that the realism in depicting the ship the variety of characters and lively dialogue keep me watching the protagonist was destined to be challenged grow and change on this voyage and i wanted to be there for it i was not disappointed the series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in between often in the same scene the same breath there was a wealth of emotional interaction and expression relentless and compelling to observe the movement of the ship added an almost <UNK> <UNK> to the many scenes making the characters ill one moment and adding humor the next br br edmund <UNK> is a complex character the likes of which we don't see often we may know where the captain stands or mr but they are older men set in their ways <UNK> was young and arrogant still learning testing himself and being tested he <UNK> getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched that grew with each hard taught experience i appreciate the excellent characterization it's too rare in movies and television
<START> director who brought us big budget <UNK> like the <UNK> and the remake of <UNK> has directed this ripoff of the die hard concept done on what looks like a blair witch budget br br a california nuclear <UNK> is <UNK> by arab terrorists but are you ready the terrorists aren't arab they're really disgruntled american soldiers <UNK> as <UNK> we find out that they don't really intend to blow up the <UNK> just make a statement we're not sure what the statement is but never mind so there's really no threat but then one of the terrorists decides to go it alone and actually blow up the plant because he's kind of crazy so maybe there is a threat after all but the army goes in and all the bad guys are killed so there was no threat oh and a good guy is killed too let that be a lesson to everybody br br if all of this sounds muddled and kinda of a waste of time then you got the idea of what watching <UNK> is all about br br the script never bothers to introduce the characters or to even give any personal details that might flesh them out or emotionally involve the audience so we're left with one dimensional characters the expert that nobody will listen to the trigger happy sergeant the slimy politicians the <UNK> <UNK> the story <UNK> from one cliché incident to the next in a formula <UNK> of practically every action movie you've ever seen but at nearly every turn just when we think something may be at stake the script <UNK> and we find out there's actually nothing to worry about br br like die hard there's an police officer who's on the inside <UNK> to the bad guys the big twist is that the cop here is a woman oh and she's injured too but not that bad just enough to make her <UNK> a couple times oh and instead of the <UNK> <UNK> that bruce willis had this cop has a magic cell phone that works everywhere even underground when he's not yelling at everybody else bruce <UNK> his jaw made out of <UNK> tries to <UNK> her over the <UNK> <UNK> he even makes a joke once but we're afraid his face might crack after all this is serious business br br but mostly it's scene after scene of people arguing the military expert is arguing to wait it out his reasoning doesn't seem particularly sound but he's supposed to be the smart guy in this movie so the people at the white house argue with him the army sergeant <UNK> with him too the nice <UNK> nuclear engineer <UNK> with the main terrorist the dialogue is absolutely b movie all the way and lines like stop the broadcast stop the broadcast may have you in rolling off your <UNK> as you wonder if the characters are actually referring to this silliness br br maybe to compensate for the lack of production quality the camera work is kept <UNK> in that faux documentary 21 <UNK> style that's supposed to lend <UNK> and energy to the scenes but the way it's <UNK> and <UNK> applied here it's downright annoying even pretentious further attempts to <UNK> up the <UNK> are made with the inclusion of nonsensical black and white footage that's randomly <UNK> with the main action but this too is pretentious and annoying in that blair witch kinda way in short the <UNK> attempts look very amateurish br br the music lives up to the visuals it's and cheap sounding sort of like a porn movie but with less melody and lots more heart beat sounds the graphic treatment is <UNK> bad too cheesy graphics in huge red <UNK> scream out to us 9 28 <UNK> as though the actually makes some kind of difference br br <UNK> may work as a marketing concept but it's clear that the script was a second thought fx part of fox put this cheesy production together and dropped several million dollars on it now that's what i call a <UNK>
<START> made at the height of the black power movement this movie portrays african american arnold johnson getting made <UNK> of a corporation after the white <UNK> dies the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous <UNK> once in power he decides to turn it into a <UNK> organization br br i don't know how robert downey sr did it but he did it is the ultimate <UNK> at america's power structure it's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of richard <UNK> mind this is a comedy classic in every sense of the word a real masterpiece hilarious
<START> i rented dark <UNK> the first one because it looked like a cheesy monster on the box type of thrill ride scarecrows also freak me out the movie had an effective title sequence but what followed was pretty lame flat bad lighting acting editing direction recently i noticed that <UNK> 2 the <UNK> had a pretty extensive ad campaign i thought maybe the first one was <UNK> successful so they <UNK> the <UNK> on this one a bit possibly delivering some bigger budget scares and fx from the killer scarecrows well there are no scarecrows in the video not a problem the problems start in <UNK> 2 with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept with strange <UNK> and bars <UNK> away titles and <UNK> as far as the actual photography every time the sun shines in a shot you'd have all these blown out whites <UNK> that you're watching some ultra low budget mini <UNK> project that some filmed at his <UNK> farm the acting was not acting at all the cheap rip off of the shining twin girls was below <UNK> film student standards the editing was extremely amateur and lazy the sound was jarring and choppy e g every time the editor would cut to a new shot you'd here the sound change perspective with it it's as if someone gathered their friends and family actors took a video camera out in a <UNK> for three days put a light on top of it for the night sequences no joke that's what they actually did burned through some tape stuck the footage in their computer cut a very rough version tossed in some music <UNK> any imaginative sound work or mixing burned it directly to dvd and threw it on the video store shelf any horror fan should be insulted by this type of direct to video work that is void of any skill or style just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get somewhat of an image on tape doesn't mean it should be released to the public if i could give this a rating lower than a one i would
<START> there's something strange about the <UNK> sentiment you can find in some cheech and chong material one of the songs in up in smoke well i often wish more songs these days began that way but in this excuse for a video the <UNK> duo are showing us the videos for four songs from their album of the moment also titled get out of my room you hear a voice over during the opening credits in which some anonymous producer describes the record as being a novelty recording that will just take up room on the <UNK> unfortunately this opening voice over hits the nail right on the head br br most music <UNK> <UNK> by the seem to keep to a rule of putting the best material early in the album often when one gets past that first song the <UNK> <UNK> notices that the recording has little if anything to hold their attention bands that <UNK> mainstream convention on the other hand often saved their best material for last or at least spread it <UNK> throughout the disc in this case cheech and chong appear to have decided to <UNK> their <UNK> the opening piece get out of my room is a hilariously themed song with an incredibly bad video many a viewer of a 1980s music video will find the sloppy direction somewhat nostalgic <UNK> conception of british punk is also incredibly funny br br where it all goes downhill is the second number i'm not home right now nothing kills interest in a song quite like <UNK> and it's tough to get more repetitive than this <UNK> turd honestly one feels the urge to slap cheech in the face and tell him that we get the idea he isn't home right now so please move on the next song along the theme of love being a strange thing is the absolute rock bottom not only for this collection but for cheech and chong in general it's almost as if this song was made for the sole reason of padding out the <UNK> running time br br fortunately the <UNK> duo saved the best for last but it is also curious to note that chong is completely absent from this cut born in east l a is a simple number based upon the old bruce <UNK> number that <UNK> <UNK> view of <UNK> as one is by <UNK> tale one has to wonder how many poor <UNK> who couldn't speak a word of spanish were <UNK> to mexico simply because their skin wasn't <UNK> white racism was an integral part of america's culture in 1985 and it remains so today if anything it has gotten worse so one has to wonder what born in east l a would be like if it were written in the current era br br unfortunately two cuts does not an album make especially when there is so much boring filler between them the interviews before get out of my room for example are quite funny not side splitting like much of up in smoke but funny enough to justify their existence unfortunately the two middle songs are reflected in their making of footage boring song makes boring filler if you cut out the middle half hour of material from this video you'd have something <UNK> better br br i gave get out of my room a three out of ten they are earned by the first and last video i'm pretty certain that the stars look at material like this today and wonder what they were thinking
<START> this one is a very solid randolph scott western he plays bat masterson and goes to liberal kansas to clean up the town he becomes good friends with robert ryan who played a very straight up leading man role it was not until after this that robert ryan began playing much darker roles in fact in <UNK> randolph scott made one other movie which was not a western and never made anything but westerns after that until he retired in <UNK> this movie has good pacing and builds up to the climax <UNK> i can't say any more as it would give away the plot be sure to see this one 8 10
<START> screening as part of a series of funny shorts at the sydney gay and lesbian <UNK> <UNK> film festival this film was definitely a highlight the script is great and the direction and acting was terrific as another <UNK> said the actors' comedic timing really made this film lots of fun
<START> i've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and can't seem to do it but with a movie as bad as night of the blood beast the plot hardly matters an astronaut crash lands and is believed dead his body later <UNK> but is found to be carrying the <UNK> of some strange alien life form but how did they get there and where's the alien that <UNK> the strange creatures in john body br br imdb lists the runtime for night of the blood beast at <UNK> minutes is that right <UNK> minutes it had to be longer than that it felt interminable to me even with the mst3k commentary which was very funny by the way the actual movie felt much much longer and it's pretty much a <UNK> from beginning to end i like a lot of these alien invasion type movies of the 50s but not this one it failed to grab my interest on any level the baby aliens were too silly looking to be taken seriously the titular blood beast was pathetic and none of the characters did anything for me add to that the usual low budget roger corman <UNK> and you've got a real loser of a movie
<START> i only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't <UNK> of pornography all that much pornography has a useful purpose in society can't say i can always think of one but it probably does br br personal <UNK> set aside i really thought this film was pretty funny i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography i bought it because i am one of those <UNK> <UNK> who will watch anything about in <UNK> i own just about every version there is on dvd so it was an obvious choice to complete my dvd collection with this i must admit i was beyond my expectations and the whole thing would have been thoroughly offensive if it hadn't been so damned funny besides the music is really good and i like musicals br br not everyone can make a good <UNK> musical anyone that has seen 'the first <UNK> <UNK> knows what a stink bomb that was considering what a low budget bill worked with <UNK> is pretty remarkable as a musical it's better than some musicals made on <UNK> budgets br br the film can't totally escape the <UNK> of porn i usually watch the <UNK> version for full shock effect and some of those scenes are because we are talking about lewis <UNK> i found myself feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> starts <UNK> it made me feel like a <UNK> and the gratuitous lesbian scenes with <UNK> and the kitty cats were a bit too br br the film has a great sense of humor about everything however there is one especially funny moment during the <UNK> orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says who do i have to f k to get out of this movie hilarious br br i'm not sure i buy the whole sex is good for you ball your brains out philosophy here but sex is human and nothing human disgust me i don't know if i really feel that way but i couldn't resist saying it some people think everything should be about sex i <UNK> <UNK> just show some responsibility and <UNK> this movie definitely scores points for the sex minded but i wouldn't push your luck next time you might really freak someone out i mean we are dealing with children's literature here
<START> when i saw the trailer for this film i said out loud to no one in particular this film is going to bomb i also said that about the matrix and look at what happened there now i am not a box office guru by any stretch but i usually have a pretty good gut about what is going to be good and what is going to really suck in this case i was <UNK> by my complete and utter <UNK> towards david <UNK> let me put it to you a different way i don't like his as a person from what i have read of him in interviews he is unbelievably pre madonna like and he is full of himself considering all he has done is x files or as an actor playing god was a really poor film but he came off thinking that for some reason he deserved big bucks on the big screen but i am happy to say that even though those things may still be true about the man return to me is delightful and has it's heart in the right place bonnie hunt has directed a beautiful story and she has told it with class and grace this is one of the most romantic films i have seen and even though it may seem to be a bit sad and <UNK> in its premise give it a chance and you will be hooked br br it has to be said and this pains me to do so that the reason this film works so well is because of the story and the cast <UNK> and driver are so wonderful and believable here that i honestly wanted to cry along with them there is one particularly powerful scene when <UNK> comes home after his wife has died and he <UNK> down on the floor of his house as it always does the family dog looks to the door to wait for his wife to come walking in she doesn't and with his shirt collar still <UNK> with blood rob <UNK> tells him that she is not coming home ever he then calls the dog over to him and they seem to share a cry together the dog lets out a small <UNK> and then rob cries and this is one of the most realistic moments of pain i have ever seen in any character in any movie you can feel his pain and at that moment i forgot i was watching an actor that i generally don't like and i felt that i was watching someone that i knew the loss of his beloved this is powerful stuff br br another strength of the film is the supporting cast bonnie hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of irish and italian characters that share a common bond they share a pub called italian pub that is a delicious name all by itself and heading the scale of <UNK> cultures is carol <UNK> and robert <UNK> these are two proud old men that love their <UNK> but love their <UNK> and niece i think it is respectively and that is the character played by <UNK> driver this scenario is <UNK> for comedy and hunt doesn't miss anything here br br bonnie hunt and james belushi also share some funny moments together as the middle aged married couple and belushi gets top points as he accepts <UNK> <UNK> and shows off his ample <UNK> of a stomach for laughs with his family <UNK> of three or four kids there is very little time for him and the wife to have quality time and again hunt handles this with perfect <UNK> br br this is a wonderful story of finding true love knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family return to me is a wonderful romance and even though i still don't have a great admiration for david <UNK> i have to admit that he was perfect in this role and i could not picture anyone else playing his character he was sensitive and believable and the movie was good because of him not just because of him but he sure added to the <UNK> br br if you are a sucker for a good romance and you want a good cry then this is the film for you br br 8 5 out of 10 i will see anything that bonnie hunt puts out with her in the director's chair
<START> it's that film that loads of people <UNK> as a classic apocalypse now now a re cut re up <UNK> 22 years after it's original release br br the film is loosely based on <UNK> heart of darkness it's main plot if it has one being capt <UNK> journey on a naval boat through the vietnam conflict on his way to <UNK> a rogue colonel colonel <UNK> we see the characters and situations he meets and he tells the <UNK> story along the way br br my initial feelings towards the film is that it's not particularly gripping at times especially early on but at least a good dose of comedy is put in in the form of surfing fanatic <UNK> as the film progresses however a good deal of tension is built up with <UNK> reading through various reports on <UNK> <UNK> until the end is in sight when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end br br the usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional and i found the performances of martin sheen marlon brando robert duvall and <UNK> forrest to all be worthy of a special mention the score i found initially sounded out of place but as the film progressed i'm not entirely sure if it did actually get better or it <UNK> better or if it had just grown on me but by the end of the film i was thoroughly enjoying it br br this is the second time i have seen the <UNK> version i have seen the original around four times i'll say now that the first time i saw it i was disappointed i was expecting a classic film with lots of war the fact that <UNK> got the mission at the beginning of the film and didn't carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that is the film seemed unnecessary this is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully as with all films that are more character than plot based as the second time around you know where the plot is going i had a similar experience with it's a wonderful life which is now one of my favourite films br br with the big four vietnam films apocalypse now wins over the rest on atmosphere but lacks the action and involvement of platoon the emotional intensity of the deer hunter and cannot really be compared to full metal jacket probably my favourite of the four apocalypse now is a great piece of work especially towards the end where it becomes <UNK> and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesn't mind some casual violence
<START> i haven't any idea how <UNK> could regard this as a decent b western or how one <UNK> said the plot was more cohesive than most nothing could be <UNK> from the truth this movie is one huge non <UNK> it is an <UNK> to the noble b western films of the <UNK> i have seen many of wayne's early lone star and republic westerns and this one is easily the worst br br the bad guy is known as the shadow for crying out loud initially the <UNK> scheme is holding up open sided stage <UNK> simultaneously his gang <UNK> all of the cattle in the territory then they decide to move on to bank robbery to do this they need to shoot up the town with a machine gun no explanation of why that's necessary or how he got that <UNK> little toy br br no single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here the shadow is obviously just a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally evil schemes br br he <UNK> his <UNK> to his gang through a fake wall safe knock knock who's there he is apparently <UNK> because whenever his henchmen need to talk to him they knock on the wall the safe opens and <UNK> he's there i can just imagine that he has met them face to face and says i have some secret <UNK> <UNK> to give you about our next evil deed meet me at the wall safe and i'll give 'em to you just why the shadow requires the safe to communicate with his army of <UNK> is like most of the elements of this mess never explained br br he has a nifty tunnel to the ol' hollow <UNK> across the street from which <UNK> point various of his baddies perform <UNK> he also has a hidden <UNK> not in his secret <UNK> behind the fake safe but out in the main room br br when not behind the safe he hangs out on his cow less ranch <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> we learn that he has murdered the true owners of the ranch two brothers and assumed the identity of one the daughter of the dead brother has recently arrived from 1930's nyc judging by her wardrobe and she apparently never met her real uncle because he <UNK> her too br br if you thought that bad guys always wore black hats and good guys white hats you need to see this movie here the good guys all <UNK> their hats in favor of white head bands that make them look like they have all suffered head wounds before any shots have been fired it's like a game of pick up basketball only wayne has them <UNK> <UNK> their heads instead of just taking off their shirts br br perhaps the <UNK> of all is the ending immediately after <UNK> the shadow and his gang we jump far enough into the future to see wayne and his wife the while niece on the front <UNK> of their home never mind that there has been <UNK> romance there <UNK> is playing with wayne's 3 4 year old son dressed up in <UNK> <UNK> fun br br no thanks to this nonsense wayne went on to become a screen legend only a super star or not could <UNK> this entry in a film resume long live the duke
<START> in my never ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime i stumbled upon this film on cable i tried hitchcock three times before this and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received i always felt he was good not great from what i've seen this was the best of his films i've seen robert walker is absolutely chilling his performance takes the film where hitchcock wanted it to go even an average performance here <UNK> the overall product my favorite scene was his obsession about getting the lighter from the drain how exactly does he get his arm down there though bruno is quite a compelling character but i also loved the performance by patricia hitchcock as barbara the rest of the <UNK> family as well as guy were a bit dry and boring but she added some <UNK> to the movie as well as having some of the better lines in the script br br lastly in any suspense movie you're going to live and die by your ending this one holds water unlike a couple other hitchcock films i've seen i truly was unsure of how it would end which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited
<START> is a cinematic <UNK> of gypsy music from several countries it is touching sad and <UNK> most of the segments appear to be completely <UNK> the music ranging from the sensual flamenco music of the spanish <UNK> to the melancholy music of the central european <UNK> is exquisite if you love gypsy music you'll find absolutely beautiful br br
<START> more of a <UNK> like turtle with <UNK> that go up like a <UNK> <UNK> more battles with people in bird suits that look like people in bird suits a <UNK> <UNK> ball space ship two naughty boys who know how to do everything including getting on board the space ship more tiresome music more gamera is the friend of children stuff i remember when and <UNK> came out the movies were a lot of fun because the monsters were actually a threat to people now they are just a parade of silly costumes with very little behind them the adults are all ridiculous and moronic like in american sitcoms the kids are the bosses when in reality they couldn't think their way out of a paper bag these monster movies must be the japanese means of these little above all however is that after seeing three of these movies with the same plot over and over check the stock footage the ultimate conclusion is that they are boring if you haven't see this one don't bother

<START> for those of you out there who have seen this <UNK> on vhs i would recommend the dvd in fact the vhs is utter rubbish the main reason is that the film was shot widescreen 2 <UNK> 1 and the producers ran out of money making the vhs version and released it as 4 3 the result is that several actors are not on screen at all and in many drag races less than half the cars are showing since one is on each side of the screen the dvd is actually a reasonable version of the film br br a lot of the best scenes in the film were cut before the final release they were viewed as being too offensive to minority groups in fact the <UNK> of a us release caused even more cuts in the film for example the americans <UNK> did not understand words such as <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> dad and mum were meant to be hippies the dad survives in the film as a wasted <UNK> smoking <UNK> but the following scene with the mum was cut the scene took place in the roof space of the house which was <UNK> with <UNK> foil lights and filled with plants you get the picture the producers had rounded up a lot of real plants for the <UNK> and when they saw the result on the big sheet they freaked and the scene was cut <UNK> br br yes the film is noted as an australian cult classic voted 2 in street machines best 100 films of all time <UNK> missing out to mad max ll the latter had over 10 times the budget of in fact the budget on was so small that the director could not afford to wreck any of the cars even though there would have been a public <UNK> if anyone had <UNK> a real ho compare that with <UNK> and the <UNK> or blues bros where dozens of cars were <UNK> br br so there's one real and two <UNK> one of the <UNK> was bought from the local <UNK> community in after the <UNK> crashed into the back of the country boy's truck that was <UNK> the car was meant to burst out from the side of the truck because the budget was so tight the car was made up with ordinary brown <UNK> tape instead of the painted on gold <UNK> of the real thing br br the <UNK> is absolutely real the car began as a very plain 4 door and was brilliantly and quickly converted to the blown <UNK> in the film the <UNK> was a which made around 1000 this was reduced to around <UNK> for the filming the car was able to easily to <UNK> <UNK> as show in several scenes in the film br br just for the record anyone with 12 000 could have picked up all the cars after the film the ho the dodge the <UNK> <UNK> the lot wonder where they are now br br <UNK>
<START> come on anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any <UNK> <UNK> they should not be allowed to be heard because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever br br anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by <UNK> <UNK> should be <UNK> to a chair and forced to watch <UNK> <UNK> episodes for 20 years straight br br the takes and double takes by the wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film br br <UNK> <UNK> should receive a <UNK> academy award for this cartoon it's the best
<START> with its few touches of <UNK> works as low grade horror but as a major follow up statement to the original it <UNK> miserably br br things begin somewhat promising during the opening credits we see and hear several interesting shots and sounds the <UNK> black <UNK> with the <UNK> cross the kitchen knife <UNK> carried into the apartment and dropped in shock the is shown sticking out of the <UNK> floor and the <UNK> of the itself without <UNK> or furniture voice overs can be heard here from the previous film's dialog interesting too is the <UNK> egg hunt the titular child <UNK> in the eggs and <UNK> are also black once the story gets rolling it never really and what happens to <UNK> when she boards that bus and is <UNK> away to god knows where br br patty duke a poor replacement for <UNK> <UNK> ray <UNK> and tina louise as the <UNK> whore who raises the child adrian andrew head this almost star cast with ruth gordon <UNK> her <UNK> role br br although not a total failure this sequel of sorts should have been released in book form first then maybe we all could have been a bit better informed and not left totally in the dark a fairly recent sequel novel son of <UNK> 1999 is the legitimate <UNK> by ira <UNK> himself br br
<START> on a scale of 1 10 <UNK> sweetheart got an 11 from me and from everyone else at this showing the picture was incredibly funny i told my wife it's obvious that this man walks on water but across a bed of fire that's a bit much this is one of the very best <UNK> of comedy satire and uses of innuendo i have seen since mel <UNK> young frankenstein i can't believe this picture was not picked up by a major studio br br this film festival audience was sophisticated and was able to pick up on every comic innuendo either visual spoken or implied the characters are real and the combination of a great script and a great casting was obvious max and grace are real people with real problems that are dealt with regardless of the odds of success it keeps you smiling while being serious and laughing with all the <UNK> humor brilliantly built into this production br br to sum it up this is a must see picture
<START> imagine watching a slide show where the <UNK> <UNK> on every slide long enough for you to completely <UNK> it three times over now imagine that the images in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes  a small park and empty <UNK> court a piano now imagine that the people running the slide show are having a <UNK> slow semi <UNK> conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the <UNK> they're showing you great  you've just imagined the entirety of the film india song ' br br the film is an <UNK> slow montage of images that do little except to simply scream out look at me i am profound ' with such blatant self importance that the images themselves and the movie as a whole are rendered not merely <UNK> of <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> the visuals could easily have been replaced by a series of static images as described above since it is so rare that there are actually people on screen and even when they are the people actually move only slightly more often than the furniture they never speak or interact in any meaningful way  they just stand there looking at each other and occasionally crying the most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the film is when three people walk across a parking lot in slow motion in fact the visuals could easily have been left out entirely as the story is told completely through narration the story is about a woman who hates india because it's hot and hates people don't hate india because it's hot this point is covered several times it is also about a man who feels that he is entitled to sleep with the aforementioned woman since she will sleep with anyone who asks her to but he doesn't get to sleep with her simply because he never asks and he's very upset about this so he stares at her as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek later on he stares at his <UNK> as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek actually you don't get to see the single tear running profoundly down his cheek when he's staring at his <UNK> but you know it's there anyway just because that's the sort of film this is br br at best the narration becomes background hum serving as a perfect compliment to the coma inducing visuals simply staying conscious through the entirety of this film would require a supreme act of determination to watch it and actually come away with a serious and meaningful idea of what it was supposed to be about would <UNK> the same sort of <UNK> as trying to read lengthy technical documents in the dark this film is perhaps the greatest <UNK> of pseudo artistic <UNK> that man will ever know
<START> the movie starts off with reeve <UNK> and his assistant fighting same vampires this scene is probably the best out of the entire movie the rest of the movie unfortunately is cheesy highly unrealistic and a buffy the vampire <UNK> ripoff the ending also sucks big time br br some moments such as the scene where gypsy and helen played by popular chinese duo band twins <UNK> gillian fight over a stuffed teddy bear are particularly <UNK> the storyline is also lame surely they could have come up with something more scary than a book called day for night br br some good parts though jackie chan and anthony wong make the movie bearable with their comical roles however the good bits just end there <UNK> gillian from twins have never been able to act well and annoy you to pieces and the friendly but <UNK> vampire role was unfortunately given to edison <UNK> who is a talentless pretty boy br br rating 4 10
<START> this movie was <UNK> bad it wasn't even funny at all not even the sarcastic scenes were funny oh man bad so bad thumbs down <UNK> karate kid teen wolf <UNK> dirty dancing some kind of wonderful soul man and probably another or two chris <UNK> at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer who runs a dance studio in a warehouse he has a jealous girlfriend who breaks her <UNK> and her dance spot goes to the cute blonde newcomer who chris has eyes for i thought the acting was really bad i like laugh out loud comedies this was not one not another teen movie wasn't funny but had a lot more funny scenes than totally awesome scary movie is funny i always laugh when i watch those super enjoyable this movie not funny
<START> if you've ever had a mad week end out with your mates then you'll appreciate this film excellent fun and a laugh a minute
<START> is a full moon production i knew what to expect very little quality but i didn't expect this to be as painful as was to watch br br it's just awful bad acting confusing script and direction annoying characters i wanted to kill the whole thing was probably made in one week i've seen episodes of <UNK> that were more complex and convincing than this <UNK> br br it has the look and feel of an <UNK> episode of a badly conceived tv series no one has ever seen it was a chore to watch and i could feel my mind getting and by the minute watching a movie shouldn't be this much hard work
<START> a march <UNK> new york times article described <UNK> as one of the first hollywood films of the 1940s to face questions of racial and religious prejudice with more <UNK> courage than audiences have been <UNK> to expect while rko was producing <UNK> <UNK> century fox was making <UNK> <UNK> another story about rko <UNK> to beat the much <UNK> fox picture to the theaters releasing <UNK> several months before <UNK> <UNK> in july <UNK> rko screened <UNK> for <UNK> of various los angeles religious groups in addition several <UNK> which were designed to <UNK> the audience's prejudices were <UNK> before and after <UNK> of the film <UNK> received both praise and criticism for its depiction of in america and was the subject of many <UNK> received an academy award nomination for best picture but lost to <UNK> <UNK> it was also nominated for best supporting actor robert ryan best supporting actress gloria <UNK> best director and best screenplay adaptation in september <UNK> <UNK> was named best social film at cannes in december <UNK> <UNK> magazine an african american <UNK> gave the film its <UNK> award for <UNK> <UNK> understanding loved this movie if you get the chance to watch it see it
<START> finally a good movie made on the most demented serial killer in history for those less familiar with ed <UNK> he was basically the madman who was known for grave robbing and <UNK> his victims which most horror fans ripped off shot in a period style that reflects the bleak <UNK> of <UNK> perfectly this is easily the most atmospheric horror film yet to depict <UNK> and his gruesome killings kane <UNK> jason from friday the 13th series and michael <UNK> hills have eyes i ii deliver chilling performances in this serial killer <UNK> that easily leaves behind the lackluster former <UNK> attempts so far i'd say this is one of the better horror films released this year 0
<START> if you love vampire <UNK> and are a fan of gothic horror then you might want to check out midnight i did not know much about this movie before i watched it and i wasn't expecting much but i found the movie to be fun and entertaining br br starring <UNK> <UNK> as the leader of the vampires simon <UNK> itself from other low budget vampire flicks by <UNK> in the mythology of st george and the dragon in a fun new way br br i'm not sure what the budget for this movie was but i sense that if it was a little more then they might have really been able to hit home the gore and effects br br if you're up late one night and you're in the mood for a fun low budget vampire flick then midnight is a good choice
<START> and a hard spot somewhere else i haven't seen this movie since i was quite young maybe 12 or 13 who knows but what i do know is this is the movie that taught me how to <UNK> i kid you not i have no idea if it is any good by any real standards of today but for me back then it was everything br br the only reason i feel comfortable writing this is because i'm sure no one will ever get around to reading it i mean really who is going to look up this movie these days br br i just discovered that i have not yet used up the ten line minimum for the amount of length i most take up in a review i had no idea there was such a minimum length but there i go like a student trying to fill up a page in a <UNK> my ten lines thank you very much
<START> possibly the worst movie i ever saw the person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light you can't see anything in this movie it is way to dark the parts where you can see something the camera is directed straight at a light source so you get big lens <UNK> so you still can't see this movie should have been a radio play or something some parts of the movie are actually edited upside down for some kind of crap effect low budget movies can be done so much better then this and low budget is no excuse for this an editor should have said something when he started editing and saw that you couldn't see anything maybe the makers should have spend some of their low budget on a preview <UNK> so they could see what they shot the only good thing about this movie being so dark is that you can't see the awful acting it also covers up the crappy <UNK> people at <UNK> film schools make better movies then this movies shot with handy <UNK> look better then this
<START> why is it that in the <UNK> and '60s italians made so of the best movies and then during the '70s and '80s made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies probably because art films didn't make any money the cannibal movie unlike the zombie movie which was created by americans and by italians is a purely italian creation designed as a <UNK> exploitation showcase and to make as much money as possible no artistic integrity getting in the way here eaten alive came during the cannibal movie <UNK> the director <UNK> hadn't even hit his <UNK> yet his genre classic cannibal <UNK> was still a year away br br in plotting similar to read ripped off from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cannibal classic cannibal holocaust a woman janet receives word from the police that they've received a <UNK> film from her sister she's gone missing in africa and it's suspected that the <UNK> ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it mel <UNK> as a professor of tells her that a man named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has started a <UNK> like cult in new guinea and that's where the sister is the woman hires a guide robert to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister and wouldn't you know it the jungle is full of cannibals br br one sentence should sum it up if you've seen on cannibal movie you've seen them all mostly because these films steal shamelessly from each other copied cannibal holocaust to make this film and <UNK> this to make cannibal <UNK> <UNK> copied parts of this for hit and run and because they all share the same material they all feature the same traits awful photography boring scenery terrible dubbing overacting and exploitation exploitation exploitation genre fans will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran <UNK> and have a scenery eating contest exists solely to be naked raped or in peril plenty <UNK> gore for all the <UNK> out there the cannibals who do actually appear to be native cannibals eat lunch met disguised as human flesh and in the grand tradition of cannibal movies any live animal shown <UNK> is usually killed shortly thereafter overall really not a good experience but i'm sure there are <UNK> out there who find this <UNK> entertaining i know i did
<START> the andrew davies adaptation of the sarah <UNK> novel was excellent the characters of <UNK> and and kitty were superbly portrayed by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> respectively the whole series was a total joy to watch it caught the imagination of everyone across the board whether straight or gay i wish there could be a sequel
<START> one of the most notorious of the banned video <UNK> of the 1980s is also one of the most <UNK> over hyped make them die slowly is about what you'd expect from an <UNK> directed jungle yet poorly rendered native torture techniques some ridiculous social commentary yes even <UNK> than cannibal holocaust and lots of guts being <UNK> the film's exploitative violence though is often only shown in brief close up and never <UNK> on for very long which <UNK> its effect interpret that how you may the dialog is <UNK> usual silliness as our male heroes show their affection for females by calling them <UNK> t and the like the cast of familiar faces including <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> and robert does their best in the face of the <UNK> idiocy including a completely ludicrous <UNK> <UNK> but cannot save this <UNK> lousy effort
<START> a great performance by emily grace i stumbled upon this movie while <UNK> my satellite <UNK> and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service <UNK> i was high entertained and had much compassion for the character alice played by emily grace the story had me guessing in what would happen to alice and was not <UNK> the overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters the ending of the story ended on a rather fair way i will purchase this dvd to add to my library i am a new fan of emily grace and i high <UNK> in seeing more from her performances
<START> this was the worst movie i have ever seen i have to admit i didn't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining br br the <UNK> was the most unpleasant character i've ever seen neither funny nor attractive in fact creepy and obnoxious are far too <UNK> br br it is painful to watch there is no acting especially not from the star who behaves as a <UNK> up mentally <UNK> take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors br br as horrible as it is to watch one of those can't shut up black actors watching a puerto <UNK> one is even worse br br the name of the movie is <UNK> he is the <UNK> this movie is a must miss
<START> i put this movie on not expecting much other than a b movie gore fest thankfully i was presented with a very well made film that built up the suspense and managed to maintain it throughout its run time this was an impressive achievement the acting was solid creating characters that you cared about and related to and although some may find the film slow it did force you to think about what you would have done in the same situation added to this there was some fine camera work and the directors pulled it all together admirably an excellent effort then that is well worth your time if you prefer development and suspense over gore
<START> i remember when this film came out and watched it a few times on vhs i was so glad when it was finally released on dvd i was hoping for widescreen but at the point would take what was available i love how they used color in the film the <UNK> scenes are so alive with color the trees are the i've ever seen most of the film was shot in <UNK> a beautiful town located on the st <UNK> river they must have really <UNK> locations for filming because they did a great job the story is well written and directed i would rate this as one of peter <UNK> best i'm also surprised that andrew the director of photography hasn't done more he did an incredible job the acting also rates up there it's amazing to see two actors of such a young age pull off this type of film <UNK> <UNK> did a great job as <UNK> mother who wouldn't want her as a mother
<START> john <UNK> truly <UNK> himself when he directed michael jackson's thriller as a short film of course it's corny the dialogue is terrible and it all seems way too cheesy but it's perfect none the less br br michael and his date are out at the cinema to view the latest horror flick when it all gets a little too graphic for the date she leaves michael follows on the way home they decide to take a <UNK> through the local graveyard there it begins br br the actual thriller dance is amazing it's full of those trademark jackson moves as well as some memorable zombie moves too it doesn't appear rushed at all nor too long the whole thing seems movie like and it really is actually rather scary of course it's one of the most famous music videos of all time and is probably the greatest music video ever made as well br br overall watch it seriously those 13 minutes will be some of the best ever spent staring at a screen 5 5
<START> well it's safe to say that <UNK> cruelty is one weird film supposedly an insight into the human mind <UNK> cruelty is <UNK> four macabre and bizarre tales of the extreme the first segment entitled is really just a warm up but it's good in that it gives the viewer an idea of what to expect from the next three segments it simply sees a naked woman laid out on a table while another woman cuts into her <UNK> and pulls out a human <UNK> i've got no idea what the point is but it certainly makes for visceral viewing the following story is the best of the bunch and takes in the old favourite sick movie theme of incest the segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister he's <UNK> by her <UNK> yet he wants to have sex with her anyway and naturally he gets his way this story stands out because of the monotonous and of narration as well as the ending which doesn't fail to deliver the shocks this segment is well acted well filmed and easily the highlight of <UNK> cruelty br br naturally the next two sections aren't as good as the second one so the only way from there is down but director still manages to pull something out of the bag before the film ends he doesn't do it right away however as the third segment is the weakest of the film and simply sees a lot of people have sex with the ground it's very surreal and therefore memorable for that same reason but there doesn't seem to be a lot of point to it and i was in the mood for something a bit more morbid after the second section the film ends on a high however as while i'm not entirely sure what the point was the final segment features the film's best imagery this segment focuses on religion and certainly isn't for anyone that values it director has achieved something here as while this collection of four <UNK> stories doesn't come together as a complete whole the film almost feels <UNK> as it's shot in such an <UNK> and eye catching manner the director would seem to have been imitating the highly respected surreal director luis <UNK> albeit with gore rape and incest and if you ask me he hasn't done a bad job at all not for everyone but certainly worth a look for extreme fanatics
<START> when the opening shot is u s marines seriously <UNK> the u s flag a movie has a tough road ahead but unfortunately it was downhill from there there is a military <UNK> credited who is also apparently a retired u s marine making it even more <UNK> that this incredible <UNK> of <UNK> and law went <UNK> even more <UNK> is the way they simply <UNK> over how a marine is reported <UNK> then buried in very short order without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body or if there even was a body the u s government is still finding the missing from wwii and it takes months to identify the remains military shot down remain <UNK> for months or years and are only <UNK> <UNK> when the remains have been positively identified or after years of red tape here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks maybe this happens in <UNK> but not in the u s clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with or respect for the u s military br br beyond that there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with <UNK> out of nowhere there must have been some really extended <UNK> between auteur and actors as they <UNK> to find their motivation for such <UNK> having a script that worked might have helped but this one seems to have been made up on the spot working from <UNK> notes there's no way to know if the script was this awful originally or if it was the auteur or the middle management kids at the studio who bear responsibility either way this is an awful movie that should have never been made
<START> this movie is not about the <UNK> nor is it quite the french connection br br the seven ups are a group of elite policemen that use tactics not in <UNK> with <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> heads the group with his <UNK> or regular looking <UNK> they are running <UNK> on a local <UNK> and things go awry when a <UNK> wire is found out br br meanwhile richard lynch the most evil looking man in film invasion america little <UNK> and his partner end up killing the cop by accident and escape from <UNK> in the coolest chase scene i've seen <UNK> and french connection are not as good as they one up the west side to the george washington and onto the <UNK> in new jersey br br the stunt drivers are terrific and lynch makes it away free though he looks scared witless from the dangerous trip roy <UNK> is nearly killed when his car <UNK> into the <UNK> rear of mack truck ripping the roof of his vehicle off br br things come to a head and one has to keep watching to follow up on such a sequence quick moving and intense fresh for a thirty years
<START> i'm <UNK> how a filmmaker notorious for his political left wing <UNK> could make such a subtle non <UNK> picture if you're for capital punishment you'll still be for it after seeing this if you're against capital punishment you'll still be against it but whatever your stance is this movie will at the very least make you reflect on why you feel the way you do there's not one false note in the film
<START> the big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort and charlie chaplin was no exception this patriotic and <UNK> picture is part of his contribution although the war was nearly over by the time of its release the tramp goes to war <UNK> <UNK> acts of <UNK> and kicks the <UNK> in the bum it's a very funny film although i don't think it nearly one of his best it's with 'a <UNK> <UNK> as his better <UNK> for first national before he made his early masterpiece 'the kid ' they are his first three <UNK> which contain <UNK> more elaborate gags than he could usually <UNK> in his two reel shorts at mutual br br it can be difficult to balance a pro war message with slapstick antics and scenes of <UNK> on the front but one wouldn't think so watching arms ' it's also <UNK> in many respects to a more serious dramatic work with a similar message such as <UNK> of the world ' chaplin had become a true <UNK> of screen comedy by this time he makes it look <UNK> he knew very well by now that a film with fewer gags with more <UNK> <UNK> and careful timing could be better than any <UNK> <UNK> type farce with a dozen <UNK> a minute the sequence where chaplin is disguised as a tree is a <UNK> example even with wars raging chaplin can lift the spirits of millions
<START> <UNK> is a light hearted comedy that will entertain you with some fine performances will smith turns in a believable performance as a cloak and <UNK> date doctor who must remain invisible to protect his <UNK> and his profession smith was excellent never it up too much br br the best piece of acting goes to the actor don't know name playing this <UNK> who has fallen for this woman who is out of his league this actor did an excellent job of character development as he <UNK> to smith's directions but in the end just can't help being who he really is br br and in the end that's the main message of this film be who you are in love and you'll be ok br br at the same time will smith meets this attractive lady and the date doctor gets a taste of his own medicine as he slowly falls for this woman don't know her name but she was pretty good too br br overall this was a delightful light movie that is definitely worth seeing
<START> i recently was in a stage version of this play and on the last day of the run i was excited to see that it was going to be playing on tv i stuck a tape in as it was on late at night and i watched it the next day i have to say i was very disappointed the actors in the film made few of the discovers that are in the script that is understandable as the process is probably different but it was <UNK> to see a lot of the original script was changed for the movie as well to make it better for the screen but i am not sure if it helped the movie out at all i gave this 4 stars only because i know the script and the writing is a lot better than what this movie portrays
<START> i watched deadly voyage because david <UNK> was in it after enjoying him in the <UNK> series and <UNK> <UNK> is always worth watching so i went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film alas it was not to be br br i won't bother <UNK> the performances the pacing the cinematography or any other <UNK> aspect of the film others here have already given their opinions on those elements the only thing i want to address is the film's message since it <UNK> in the intro that it's based upon a true story and <UNK> hangs the film's supposed importance br br deadly voyage primarily focuses upon an <UNK> black african man named kingsley who wants to move to the us because he believes that he can make money there nothing more nothing less his motivation is utterly selfish of course some people will by saying that he was doing it for his family but in fact he decided to have children on the <UNK> he could make in so he really just created his own problem to that end kingsley decides to <UNK> away aboard a russian <UNK> bound for new york in the process of doing this he faces harsh conditions racist crew members and other challenges br br but this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic why should the audience be expected to care about kingsley simply because he has a goal goals aren't such a rare <UNK> that his should be <UNK> above say the goal of the <UNK> captain or the woman he left at home with his <UNK> child <UNK> goal is illegal in the eyes of the us government it is also illegal in that it steals from the russian <UNK> company if he makes it to the us it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into and if he gets caught the <UNK> company will be <UNK> 45 000 i doubt very much that any of the care about what their chosen course of action is <UNK> anyone else they're clearly just out for their own gain he could've spent the 1 000 he won in the <UNK> at the beginning of the film for legal passage to the us and applied for <UNK> and a work <UNK> instead he takes the illegal and dangerous route br br so since <UNK> voyage is illegal selfish and cannot be <UNK> justified why should we care about him or his ordeal simply because he faces challenges why should his challenges be <UNK> above the challenge of the russian <UNK> company getting to new york without because he's black and the <UNK> company is white the reason seems to be because danny glover the film's executive producer and others involved want us to root for kingsley as if he's a hero on some sort of noble voyage but once you accept that illegal <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> mission aren't noble at all you can't really care about him br br before anyone plays the race card i assure you that i would've felt the same no matter what <UNK> <UNK> the involved parties were imagine if a british person decided to <UNK> away in a train headed for sneak across the border and collect <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to bring back to britain to sell how much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate very little i'd bet so why should we feel different for because he's black because he's poor by american standards the filmmakers are <UNK> on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means and that a <UNK> company being <UNK> 45 000 is <UNK> compared to the remote possibility of an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> slightly more in the us than he could've if he had just stayed in his own home country i didn't buy it for a minute
<START> toy soldiers is an okay action movie but what really stands out is the amount of effort that the <UNK> and director put into portraying american counter terrorist forces accurately just check out the end credits there are more than a dozen us military officers and officials listed the movie accurately portrays the fbi as having control of the hostage situation but turning it over the us <UNK> <UNK> force who are <UNK> in the movie as the <UNK> was still denying their existence at this time once the president the <UNK> act of us code the us army forces at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time and even the use of an ah 64 <UNK> for air support which might seem a bit over the top is not terribly unrealistic far more expensive and frankly better movies have portrayed american counter terrorist forces with far less accuracy
<START> <UNK> directed written performed and filmed this quiet and <UNK> danish film is an example of cinema at its best and if a person exists who can watch <UNK> feast without being touched at a very fundamental level they are a person i do not care to know br br the story is quite simple in the <UNK> two elderly maiden ladies and <UNK> in remote <UNK> where they have sacrificed their lives romantic possibilities and personal happiness in order to continue their long dead father's religious <UNK> to the small flock he served one of the women's youthful <UNK> sends to them a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whose husband and son have been killed in france and who has <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> she meet the same fate although they do not really require her services the sisters engage her as maid and cook and as the years pass her <UNK> and <UNK> efforts on their behalf <UNK> the aging <UNK> to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined indeed the entire village <UNK> and depends upon her br br one day however <UNK> receives a letter she has won a <UNK> and is now by village standards a wealthy woman knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to france the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly french meal for them and the members of their tiny <UNK> the meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember but not for reasons that might be expected for <UNK> feast proves to be food for both body and soul and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her br br the film is extraordinary in every way <UNK> in detail yet not <UNK> in its presentation of them as the film progresses we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to god and their all too human <UNK> and the scenes in which <UNK> <UNK> her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful beautiful and incredibly memorable there have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of <UNK> feast which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul highly highly recommended br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> when i watched this movie i had no idea what it was about and i had never heard of it before but i must say i was positively surprised the first few minutes are almost the most funny of the whole movie the store clerk from india is just too funny anyways the story <UNK> really too much to talk about but i think it´s ok the acting on the other hand is quite good and still the only actor i recognized was mickey rourke who <UNK> really in the movie until the ending and the ending is where the turn off is i think it´s not bad but i <UNK> feel like it really ends i feel like there should have been something more a final battle in some way i <UNK> know all in all this was a good movie and i recommend it to anyone into tarantino type movies with loads of violence and dark sinister humor i rate it 7 10
<START> i don't understand why this show didn't go on there could've been various ways to continue on the line of <UNK> and after season 2 obviously <UNK> couldn't have been the <UNK> agent <UNK> cells and them from the inside but still they should've given this show at least another season br br the show is well casted believable and views the <UNK> religion from both the normal and the <UNK> point of view it touches controversial subjects in detail and it has a dramatic meaning that can be said of very few shows <UNK> i'm actually sad that i didn't know about this show until late 2007
<START> <UNK> just before dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there it's one of the finest made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like the final terror don't go in the woods or the prey out of the water br br a group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought however they are not alone in the wild a <UNK> in <UNK> murderer who seems to be in two places at once is lurking and apparently hates <UNK> br br director who gave us such great b films as <UNK> 1976 and blue sunshine 1977 does an excellent job with this smart thriller as well the movie is nicely atmospheric with a <UNK> sense of tension and some strong suspense this film makes even the open wilderness seem <UNK> claustrophobic the <UNK> locations are beautiful and well captured by the <UNK> cinematography the music score is a true original and awesome in contrast with the <UNK> visuals br br deborah benson makes for a great lead her presence was captivating <UNK> henry delivers a good performance as <UNK> lover and chris <UNK> provides some occasional charisma the supporting cast especially veteran actor kennedy also does quite well br br a true gem of the slasher genre that needs no gore to thrill definitely well worth seeking out for slasher fans and horror buffs alike see it br br 1 2 out of
<START> one of the most sublime of american masterpieces <UNK> opens the film by with his open mouth <UNK> on a <UNK> we wonder is he coming off a heroin high we just see his face then flash his body flash his naked rear i can't think of another film that used this flash <UNK> form of editing so well to create a hypnotic <UNK> mood an editing method that works wonderfully as both pacing and style after that introduction when opens his mouth his accent is jarring we expect him to be some kind of soft spoken instead he's got the voice of a street thug <UNK> isn't comfortable letting our <UNK> go <UNK> the lengthy opening is very sexy and playful it's a combination of martial troubles fascinating lip <UNK> kisses and early morning sexual <UNK> it all kind of flows together if not always smoothly then emotionally realistically br br what i got from this was the same as what i got from the 400 blows when i first saw it this is like a 20 something <UNK> of that story there's a sense of <UNK> between the flesh sellers and the <UNK> when walks the street looking for men to <UNK> his wife's abortion there's the feeling of a secret <UNK> as boys make deals with each other i never found it boring though nothing happens nothing happens brilliantly the boys hanging around as they do waiting for tricks the main trick that finds is fascinating to watch using greek <UNK> and only touching his back a form of aesthetic body worship on the man's part it's also dreadfully funny i'm not talking to an empty bed am i it's one of the most revealing scenes in the movie in any movie i think certainly any movie dealing with sex and sex for sale when eyes seem red and <UNK> we can't tell if it's because he's drunk ashamed embarrassed or all br br the conversations in the film are cut up they don't matter the film is silent in a few scenes some of the most poignant and beautiful you may ever experience yet when <UNK> chooses to include one the way he includes it we sort of piece it together it's startling such as one conversation between and a <UNK> hustler and neither of them ever mentioning the word gay or hustler what follows is a scene where we listen to a pair of <UNK> as gets <UNK> this just after explaining to the <UNK> getting used to the job br br is a subject worthy of the attention paid to him both by his <UNK> and <UNK> he's less than effective as an actor in the sense of acting as performing but as far as revealing something he's incredible he's someone we immediately want to feel above yet we go through his experiences with all their <UNK> and we're forced to try and know him he's the kind of blank <UNK> that we're drawn to but can't get a hold on and of course he's incredibly striking forgetting everything else this is partially a testament to the beauty of the male body gorgeous <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie has one devastating scene but like everything else you can't really master it a girl says that she's been raped and her only self defense is in saying that had the rapist only asked for sex <UNK> her he would have gotten a better lay it's shattering the movie has feeling for everyone but even better than that it's not merely sympathetic it actually attempts to help us understand human beings and without ever <UNK> what it is we're meant to be understanding it neither looks down on nor <UNK> the people within the film it feels <UNK> when we see <UNK> arm around a <UNK> when he reads a letter he talks about not getting past grade eight at one point he's utterly charming as he pauses on a word then says and continues br br you can learn something more profound from the interaction between and one of his <UNK> in terms of gay straight relationships than you can from any case study here we have the young boy who smiles his top lip disappears as he does so when a 30 something gym bunny korean war veteran runs his fingers through his hair it's a scene that feels very profound this adult man sharing something with a younger version of himself it's not two gay men together or a gay man paying a straight man it's something else you can't put your finger on questions of sexuality are beside the point never before has popping a <UNK> seemed as <UNK> after sharing something with each other emotionally though with since he's there for money it's never apparent why he's there though he's never less than sincere which may be his most <UNK> quality so can you help me out the man says sure i don't mean my pants 10 10
<START> two things can happen when an ensemble cast is brought together either you are left walking out of the theater asking why ' or you receive <UNK> from heaven a delightful comedy from the burton sisters whose mother not only provided inspiration but the screenplay itself ursula burton plays <UNK> a nun whose friend's and family had always believed she was touched by g d when money falls from the sky the clan use young faith that the money was gift from the heavens to allow all their dreams to come true years pass and we find <UNK> returned home to her native buffalo she comes to the realization that the gift needs to be <UNK> and calls together her friends and family academy award winners shirley jones louise <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to return the debt before <UNK> sunday the money has long since been spent and all the characters find themselves in financial difficulties shirley jones and frank <UNK> are a husband and wife con team that teach the all important in life of how to dress for winter in buffalo and my personal favorite they expect you to take the <UNK> when visiting a restaurant the audience can only hope that if <UNK> does reach her goal that that someone won't run off with the money the movie teaches us that it is not money but ourselves that make our and other's dreams come true every action has an outcome not just for you but the community around you when looking into the mirror we see ourselves as we'd like to be <UNK> from heaven answers the question of how other's can see the image we'd most like to reflect the <UNK> have done a superb job directing the cast to break out of their <UNK> and create new and inventive characters in the day of multi million dollar budgets this low budget <UNK> proves it is not the cash in hand but true talent that will draw the biggest laughs <UNK> the american president just shoot me adds a special flavor to this already talented cast
<START> this film was made thirteen years before i was born but i still think it is the <UNK> most harmless piece of fun ever made it simply could not go wrong with the cast of superb british character actors it boasts br br where to start <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> margaret <UNK> <UNK> the wonderfully innocent played to perfection by the <UNK> <UNK> the victor hyde brown a guy <UNK> special and the rest of the staff sum up post war middle class england to a <UNK> br br the humour is sometimes obvious but it is of that special ealing variety and is never offensive br br i have watched this film more times than i care to remember and still laugh like a drain at the antics every time the <UNK> of the <UNK> occupied by the girls school the <UNK> planned but ultimately doomed twin <UNK> of the school and the chaotic ending involving the arrival of a third school to add to the <UNK> are priceless br br it's an old cliché i know but they really do not make them like that anymore how i wish they did if you haven't seen it please do you won't be disappointed
<START> first a warning br br i recently saw this movie on dvd in the universal series the source print looks to be in <UNK> condition but the image is a bit soft suggesting it might be a second generation copy straight from video the framing is far too tight so all the compositions are terrible even the title of the movie is <UNK> i gather from other imdb reviews that there is a much better version available br br mr and mrs smith is just a <UNK> to hitchcock's career br br in his lengthy interviews with <UNK> <UNK> in the sixties hitchcock gave a <UNK> <UNK> of his whole body of work but all he could say about this picture is that he did it as a favour to carole lombard and that he didn't understand the characters so just photographed norman screenplay br br in truth there is not much more that needs to be said br br it is a screwball comedy out of the same <UNK> as it happened one night his girl friday and story carole lombard is a typically <UNK> wife who learns that her marriage is technically <UNK> falls out with with her husband on the <UNK> of and spends most of the picture being <UNK> br br robert <UNK> does well enough as the put upon husband but it is hard not to lose patience with him long before the end of the movie the audience is saying dump the silly cow she's not worth it br br gene raymond plays the best friend with whom she becomes engaged he is supposed to be a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> although this is not obvious from his accent and only really becomes apparent in the drunk scene which he otherwise plays very well he is an <UNK> generous gentleman so of course he is <UNK> and <UNK> by robert <UNK> and made the butt of many of the jokes although he is not as badly treated as the similar ralph <UNK> character in his girl friday br br this movie feels like it was made by people who only knew of screwball comedies by reputation but hadn't actually seen one for example a good screwball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of on going comic threads that continually <UNK> and <UNK> here all the comedy elements are just strung out like <UNK> on a <UNK> this is screwball comedy by the numbers br br it is the same with the direction typically these comedies race along at an ever increasing pace that rises to near <UNK> by the end hitchcock doesn't get this his direction is somewhat <UNK> and the picture becomes a <UNK> succession of scenes that all seem slightly over written but under and slightly too long he was never a particularly good director of actors so he just lets the cast get on with it they do ok br br hitchcock had a good sense of humour which he frequently used in his thrillers but he had no feel for comedy as a genre his later trouble with harry was also a misfire for similar reasons to this movie but at least he was involved in that picture here he is just going through the motions br br all the people connected with this movie were good solid professionals so it is not especially bad it just feels a bit derivative over familiar over long and ultimately rather flat br br mr and mrs smith is one for carole lombard fans and hitchcock <UNK> only
<START> yes it feels and for the most part plays like an after school special for a slightly more adult audience alright maybe a teen audience but add in bill murray already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent a nice supporting cast and an unexpected <UNK> about growing up and remembering those great or not so great days at summer camp and you get a heartwarming funny sleeper hit br br it does get a little too smarmy for its own good but that is also one of its charms when you hear the title <UNK> and see the poster you expect a teenage sex romp but what you get is a yet sometimes sexy look back at those <UNK> years at summer camp the and the of simpler times reminds me of a christmas story which i also love the <UNK> of summer camp were never so well stated the only movie i've seen that comes close is indian summer which i like almost as much as <UNK> and also stars matt craven let's hope he <UNK> the trilogy maybe he could come back for return of the <UNK> and bring some dignity back to the franchise <UNK> 2 through 4 bare no <UNK> to the original classic br br <UNK> is easily on my top 10 guilty pleasures of all time not really guilty either it's a wonderful little film that always makes me smile
<START> i will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from me br br the film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process i'd love to know what they were on when this film was being made br br its also the most historically inaccurate film in existence 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or <UNK> taking place br br characters are unlikeable design is simplistic and everything just <UNK> on without any sense or logic to it br br and the ending is probably the worst of it its supposed to be thought provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is what the f k is going on br br i'd say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes avoid this film at all cost and choose a sci fi movie that isn't stuck up its own
<START> if extreme activities and i don't mean the hollywood ones like x games and the people who pursue them interest you then seek this doc out br br this is one of those truth is stranger than fiction tales of donald obsession to prove himself against great odds those odds were <UNK> by mother nature the media and his own mind it is also about a time lost to us although it was only 40 years ago br br the filmmakers have done a great job in gathering a wide range of material to tell his story and the story of the great race that consumed him br br i couldn't help but to think about timothy and the apollo <UNK> in the 2 great <UNK> <UNK> man and in the shadow of the moon while experiencing you don't simply watch this story br br if you live in a big city buy it or rent it it is worth the effort to find i had to travel 100 miles to l a to buy it and i am glad i did
<START> ok we have a film that some are calling one of the best movies ever but i'm sitting here thinking hell the f the <UNK> <UNK> which there is no story the is quite plain <UNK> nothing great and the acting is nothing real out standing so if you want to pretend to be arty say you like it but if you have a real view say you don't like it or if you did explain why
<START> someone on these boards has <UNK> that the whole thing is being <UNK> by the best friend of the protagonist albeit a friend he hasn't seen for some 20 years i'm reluctant to dismiss this out of hand but it does raise some <UNK> questions why would a <UNK> engineer or a shoe salesman or butcher for that matter want to create a mythical world and <UNK> it around a friend it in the process with a set of equally mythical supporting characters with an imagination that good the friend should be writing not dreaming dream or not someone and the obvious candidate is director <UNK> has created a very watchable world in which tony makes <UNK> a fine art we are asked to believe that forty something la the mafia some years prior to our meeting him and as <UNK> he is a virtual prisoner in a small swiss hotel from which each week he drives to a local bank with a <UNK> containing nine mill large in used notes other than this weekly trip he is free to do as he likes and what he likes to do is smoke play cards with a man who <UNK> and a wife who reminds the husband how far they have fallen socially and ignore the friendly <UNK> of olivia <UNK> who has spent two years trying to get a smile and or a <UNK> out of him for reasons best known to himself and which are inconsistent with a man who has no interest in anything or anyone spends a certain amount of time every day <UNK> a <UNK> to the wall of his bedroom and listening to the private conversations of his card playing partners eventually he does respond to <UNK> he has to do so or they would be no film this is plot the one about <UNK> who never wears a gun or sean duke wayne the <UNK> man' who refuses to rise to <UNK> and fight until the obligatory scene where the gun is <UNK> on and the <UNK> <UNK> but instead of himself with a polite come he <UNK> 100 000 from the <UNK> and buys her a car the final <UNK> occurs when <UNK> tells him she will pick him up the following day at 4 <UNK> in her car and they will drive into the mountains to celebrate his birthday we've established that she lives <UNK> so why she is then seen driving from somewhere miles away ignoring a police <UNK> to drive off the road and <UNK> the car is anyone's guess this inconsistencies apart this remains a fine piece of film making with an excellent lead performance and a very good supporting one
<START> if it were possible i would have given this sorry excuse for a movie a zero star it was by far the worse i have ever seen it was as if it were a home movie that some bored <UNK> decided to make as a joke the acting was horrific the actors didn't even react to the fact that they were being murdered br br honestly i bought this movie by mistake the spanish title said <UNK> <UNK> 3 so i thought hmm maybe it'll be ok wrong it was honestly the worst ever i didn't get past 20 minutes of the stupid movie i <UNK> through chapters and nothing interesting ever seemed to happen br br the <UNK> were also terrible it was like a home movie i would never recommend anyone to watch this terrible terrible moronic movie
<START> if you're looking for a kung fu action movie look elsewhere while there are fighting scenes the film revolves around its <UNK> protagonist who struggles to find her way in <UNK> <UNK> unlike most kung fu comedies the action scenes are used to <UNK> the comedy instead of the other way around br br cheung is a statement about the <UNK> nature of kung fu movies where the stars always seem to find some reason to fight instead of some grand drama about honor and respect minor <UNK> cause the characters to yell at each other and start beating each other up br br my young <UNK> as it's known in the west is the story of <UNK> <UNK> nun played by <UNK> <UNK> who is a young woman who marries an elderly <UNK> to keep his from falling into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother after he dies she moves to <UNK> to live with her nephew played by director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his son ah <UNK> played by <UNK> ho br br the basis of the irony is that although <UNK> is the same age as ah <UNK> her manner is more akin to her status as his step great aunt while ah <UNK> speaks english extremely poorly plays the guitar and goes to costume parties <UNK> utterly fails when she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in <UNK> complete with makeup revealing <UNK> high heels and dance scenes br br what makes this movie great is its realization <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is perhaps one of the greatest if not the greatest director of his generation in hong kong and <UNK> <UNK> won best actress at the first hong kong film awards in 1982 also this is arguably <UNK> <UNK> finest performance his chemistry with <UNK> is remarkable and although he went on to have a <UNK> career in kung fu comedies often working alongside sammo hung he has the perfect combination of <UNK> and comedy as the romantic tension and intrigue build in the second half of the movie his entire <UNK> changes no longer does he easily through life without a care in the world he becomes the straight man and his <UNK> the kramer <UNK> and george br br my one complaint is how suddenly the comedic aspects of the film die off during the conclusion the film transitions from outright farce to dramatic intrigue with little but a change in incidental music but there is a certain <UNK> in it the film begins focused on the intrigue focused more on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character and it ends that way too but the final scene returns to the movie's comedic roots giving conclusion to both aspects of the film
<START> nurse betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately it was funny but it also had many touching moments freeman rock kinnear the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real the story took such twist turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch if you're sick of the recent formula movies see nurse betty for something completely different go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out
<START> love is a many thing is set in hong kong in 1949 50 and tells the story of the relationship between mark elliott a white american journalist and han a half chinese half european doctor this story of a mixed race love affair was quite a daring theme for the fifties and as it often did hollywood tried to <UNK> the blow by casting a white actress as the supposedly non <UNK> woman who falls in love with a white man something that would be regarded as politically incorrect today but was quite acceptable then think for example of the casting of <UNK> <UNK> in show boat or natalie wood in west side story the setting of the story in a british colony was also perhaps a way of exploring racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in america loses her job in a hong kong hospital because her british superiors take exception to the fact that she is dating a white man whom she is unable to marry because his estranged wife will not grant him a divorce as was sometimes the case european <UNK> was made the <UNK> boy for some of america's own <UNK> imagine the that would have been unleashed had a similar film been made about a black or mixed race woman doctor in a hospital in <UNK> br br besides racial issues the film also raises questions of international politics referring to both the communist <UNK> of power in china and the <UNK> of the korean war han was a real person and a well known author of the period in reality she tended to support communist regime but here she is shown as firmly anti communist this is not however primarily an issue movie about either or politics but rather a romance a good example of what would have been known at the time as a woman's picture such films although mostly made by male directors were mostly aimed at female audiences they dealt with love and romance often unhappy romance from the woman's point of view and had a strong female character in the leading role the genre often provided roles for actresses older than the <UNK> of standard romances earlier examples were normally in <UNK> but by the fifties they generally as here used lush <UNK> colour br br although a chinese or <UNK> actress would have been more convincing in the role jennifer jones does a very good job as i found william <UNK> as mark rather <UNK> but this does not matter much as is very much the <UNK> figure she is screen much more than mark and the film <UNK> her family and professional life much more than it does his although jennifer was still strikingly beautiful she was in her mid thirties rather older than most romantic <UNK> of films of this period <UNK> was about the same age unusually for the fifties when boy meets girl often meant older man meets girl br br the film is not particularly profound but is well made with some attractive photography particularly of hong kong itself <UNK> the growing trend in the fifties for shooting on location rather than on studio sets seldom can hong kong have looked so beautiful the view from a hill <UNK> the city takes on a special meaning as this is where and mark go for their romantic <UNK> the overall mood is one of poignant doomed romance a mood <UNK> by the atmospheric photography and the musical score including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written 7 10
<START> <UNK> wound up falling into the same category as many promising television productions that could have been a really great classic only to become a sad joke br br i really like kevin <UNK> and his supporting cast but i didn't care for the direction the show took since their movie <UNK> either i believe the show would have had a much more successful run if they had kept the same format they did for the movies br br i watched in the beginning and lost interest along the way i did encounter the odd episode afterwards but my attention span towards it was lucky to make it to commercial break
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> disgusting <UNK> city worst piece of junk ever made sick weird horrible enough said hold your nose don't eat after seeing this sick demented garbage <UNK> of a movie you won't be able to eat your food for a week but maybe that's good a new <UNK> has been invented go to see this vomit inducing film get sick to your stomach and you will be so turned off by the whole mess that you can't eat for at least a week and you drop about 15 pounds br br me me lay with a name like this it's really amazing that she doesn't have a cult fan following she rates as the worst actress ever her films make ed woods look like gone with the wind this movie rates a minus 10
<START> i love everything about family guy br br my favourite characters in family are brian and and i like the episodes when it mainly features them such as road to <UNK> island season 2 as they interact very well the comments they make just have me in <UNK> <UNK> behaviour is also very funny as some of the things he does are just so brilliant they're retarded the voice acting is excellent especially seth as he provides the voices for half of the <UNK> family as well as their perverted <UNK> glenn <UNK> and how he manages this range particularly with singing i just don't know he deserves his two <UNK> for providing the voice of evil baby genius adam west also steals the show with his funny and completely insane regular character the mayor of what i like about chris voiced by seth green is the things he says show that he takes after his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense br br the only thing i have found annoying is that in the uk fox has decided to change the seasons to increase dvd sales which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing br br if you enjoy family guy then i would thoroughly recommend seth other project american dad which uses a different style of humour but is still extremely hilarious
<START> talented screenwriter alvin <UNK> sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial <UNK> about a <UNK> mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in los angeles despite mom's <UNK> behavior apart from several good sequences i didn't quite buy susan sarandon as a <UNK> she's too <UNK> smart and focused to be passed off as this devil may care lady and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent natalie portman <UNK> much better as her kid and yet there's a creepy <UNK> to her work and some of her scenes such as the one where she asks a boy to strip are misguided and uncomfortable to watch certainly not an incompetent piece anywhere but here does have moments that work but it isn't an <UNK> film nor has it proved to be an important one from
<START> i <UNK> watching 15 park <UNK> despite of <UNK> the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over the top acting br br once in a while movies like 15 park <UNK> come by and <UNK> you off your feet br br the movie <UNK> your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that <UNK> has done a wonderful job of <UNK> the audience to every line of the movie the impeccable character development just right amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all br br i have a <UNK> respect for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who convincingly plays the <UNK> she beats expectation yet again after page 3 and mr mrs <UNK> <UNK> role is very well developed and <UNK> does full justice to the character <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> add incredible flavor to the movie br br i define shower moments as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you <UNK> over in your shower endlessly till your wife girlfriend mom <UNK> at the door delivers many shower moments especially the conversation between <UNK> and her mother where the mother is <UNK> when talking to <UNK> about her thoughts it immediately brings out personality to the audience br br the end is a very bold statement by the director probably too <UNK> for the indian audience yet delivers the elements to promote the movie from a good to a great status
<START> 'the 4th is a decidedly mediocre film starring juliette lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a problem neighbor jane lewis has recently inherited a terrific <UNK> floor apartment from her grandmother and per <UNK> with the <UNK> gets a ridiculously low renting rate her boyfriend william hurt as a creepy weather man wants her to move in with him but she wants her own space so she moves in and weird stuff starts happening and because this is a b grade horror flick there's a dumb not to be found in reality reason why as the none too intriguing jane keeps trying to tell others her boyfriend the police <UNK> what's going on everybody thinks she's losing it so of course she has to face the problem the lunatic living right below her alone neither scary nor interesting the movie's single saving grace is lewis she's a very fine actress but poorly used here which is not to say she isn't the best thing about this flick because she is she has <UNK> charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen of the <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> this type of movie this type of movie though is not worthy of her which is ironic given that she's probably the only reason anyone would see it
<START> brett <UNK> again makes a very good film that is <UNK> by the so called film experts it is low budget but fun and the leading lady is very sexy i wish i could see more of irene joseph good viewing fun i bought the dvd and enjoyed it the special effects are stop motion animation and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today i always enjoy brett <UNK> movies and if you liked this i recommend bite me screaming dead and anything else he has done i look forward to seeing more of his work and well as more of ms joseph i simply cannot see why this woman hasn't been in more movies as her acting is excellent
<START> broadcast news <UNK> james l brooks 1987 br br br br although it lacks the emotional punch of <UNK> debut feature terms of <UNK> broadcast news is a <UNK> film with exceptional performances from each of the three leads and a script that feels as genuine and well <UNK> as a hard hitting news report let it be known this is a character film first and foremost and a satire second in my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms the film's characters are given surprising depth and dimension while the satire remains sly and never bitter comparisons to network are unnecessary because the films have two completely separate goals and attitudes while also a great film network is a cynical and weary work in other words its mad as hell and fed up with the state of television <UNK> style of satire feels more extreme and <UNK> in contrast the characters the news rooms of broadcast news love and live for their jobs sometimes to the <UNK> of their love lives they <UNK> pleasure from the <UNK> and <UNK> of news <UNK> just as the audience <UNK> pleasure from watching this sweet and <UNK> realistic masterpiece
<START> i occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show's contestants are they are pathetic not because they are fat but because they whore their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune br br for anyone to appear on national tv and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> about being fat entirely their own fault is nauseating what does this say about us as a nation does it suggest that your lifestyle choices and the consequences of them aren't our responsibility br br the biggest loser is an appropriate title but it has nothing to do with one's weight br br absolute trash
<START> this was such a terrible film almost a comedy sketch of a noir film the budget was low compared to a blockbuster but still higher than most but its where they've decided to cut costs that is totally weird some actors are at least competent while others look like they just been dragged off the street one of them being the lead actor hes so very bad that i <UNK> when ever he said anything he talks through the entire movie then there's the weird costume choices at the start of the movie all characters are wearing 1930's clothes they drive a classic car but the background is a modern day thats blatantly state of the art and the costumes and some settings continue to follow this 30's film noir theme then <UNK> in drives a brand new with 24 inch wtf same thing again when a guy has a night scope on his rifle you get a shot down its sight hes aiming at a guy with an <UNK> and <UNK> gear on in a even stranger contrast the locations are brilliant and seem to have cost more than the rest of the entire film the camera shots angles a very good and show these locations brilliantly in the scenes the director has a keen eye for a good looking single shot but no idea how to do much else br br people who should be shot for this br br the writer the director the casting agent the costume designer br br people who should be tortured to death for their <UNK> monotonous nails on <UNK> board voice br br anton the lead actor writer producer if you ever seen the movie hostel i wish that would happen to this guy but he doesn't escape
<START> how on earth this film isn't more widely regarded is beyond me br br i picked it up for <UNK> and i'm not <UNK> when i say it's the best pound i've ever spent on a film br br the thing that usually lets films about the club scene down is either the music or the actual scenes filmed in br br here the music and club scenes are completely credible using some big tunes of the time and filmed in real <UNK> with people actually looking like they want to be there br br the performances from the actors are of a high standard all round although jason <UNK> in particular for me stands out he was playing frank n in the rocky horror show in london at roughly the time this must have been filming so his drag phase was in full flow and of course tim <UNK> who's <UNK> drug land boss is convincing br br simply put if you're a fan of british film you have to see this it matters not a <UNK> if you're into <UNK> as the film is strong enough as a story anyway br br highly recommended
<START> certainly the highlight of this film is it's cast br br diana <UNK> george c scott bernard hughes to mention a few br br i have <UNK> more time in <UNK> and with doctors over the years than i care to think about br br this comedy attacks the <UNK> and <UNK> in all aspects of our society through the setting of one of it's most <UNK> <UNK> the medical profession br br the idea that such goings on could be possible might be a shock to some but is a delight to anyone with the perspective of experience br br dr <UNK> scott <UNK> a mid life crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes as we and he become <UNK> with the <UNK> of his involvement with miss <UNK> <UNK> br br the thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mix in the form of the irony that the hospital appears to be killing it's own workers as they their affairs in it br br the climax is unpredictable unless you've seen it and made even more hilarious if you happen to guess br br it's not everyone's brand of humor to be sure and has <UNK> funny dark moments if you're open to them br br i loved every minute and was delighted to see it out on dvd
<START> well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof to <UNK> things up cop dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal michael keaton br br well criminal agrees but escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son dead criminal no transplant dead son br br well the police in this movie doesn't have a brain in case they never heard of a <UNK> to knock off the criminal without killing him end of movie as simple as that br br but it when all crazy and stupid including the death of and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly
<START> i've watched this film a few times and i never really liked it i'm not a fan so <UNK> <UNK> horror so i can't be <UNK> on that account i found it a little sleazy i think the thing that <UNK> me about <UNK> is the <UNK> aspect not sex mind you but <UNK> i'm surprised at how many people have rated this film so highly so i'll have another look at it but for me it wasn't creepy it had no atmosphere just a bit of <UNK> look at those bad stupid london prostitute women and that little innocent anna about to get raped by yet another nasty man i suppose ultimately for me the film had no depth whatsoever just a bunch of nasty <UNK> men and women only there for the <UNK> value this no doubt was to some degree what victorian england was like but the sets are even too clunky and dull <UNK> a sense of victorian menace roger <UNK> horrors on the other hand now that's style atmosphere and elegant horror for me this was just exploitative flat <UNK> trash
<START> after watching <UNK> the <UNK> by sarah waters i decided to watch the characters were just as good in both performances though missing <UNK> <UNK> in the adaptation of br br the story line overall was of a good choice the <UNK> and the of the characters were amazing excellent watch only missing <UNK> <UNK> br br if you do enjoy the romance of two girls this isn't one of the best films to watch br br it takes on a different spin from <UNK> the <UNK> but just as good br br would recommend it to everyone
<START> i wanted to like this one the situation was rich and the setting unusual and interesting but the story is <UNK> with childish female gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow the director is unfairly <UNK> against the characters content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures and inexplicably indulgent towards the behavior of the heroine the potentially interesting power struggle between the <UNK> and the <UNK> is not really dealt with br br feminist film makers will get more credibility when they stop <UNK> situations to throw all the sympathy to the heroine and start dealing honestly with issues this movie more closely resembles 'the 7 pieces of <UNK> another earnest failure more than 'the <UNK> a real tale of passion
<START> this movie has no heart and no soul it's an attempt to up a cult film out of the of other better directors <UNK> david lynch and tim burton <UNK> seems to think that if he on a kind of <UNK> visual style and fills the street with <UNK> and garbage he's making a statement but it's not a statement about anything except the director's shrill <UNK> of hey look at me i'm an artist too but he doesn't have the imagination of an artist just a good memory for things that worked such as some of the actors trapped in this for other directors all of this would be almost acceptable if this movie was not a turgid boring chore to sit through
<START> not much actually happens in this movie there are a few pivotal moments and everything else is talking about a crucial moment that takes place before the movie began the primary <UNK> used in the story is the flashback flashbacks can be used very well but they aren't here there is zero indication when flashing back or forward and there are only weeks <UNK> the events so context as a scene unfolds is the only way to know when something happens perhaps this was intended to add a sense of mystery in places but it was largely annoying br br if you are interested in watching a 100 minute on screen discussion of the <UNK> of things and a lame questioning of good versus evil enjoy if watching close ups of a mostly <UNK> stare on ryan face for much of the movie appeals to you you're in luck sadly i can find no reason to recommend this movie oh and as another review <UNK> spacey really is only in a cameo role here and plays with a <UNK> <UNK> that you've probably already seen br br the rest contains spoilers though a few big points are held back br br first the killing of the so called retarded boy happens before the movie opens and we never learn what happened exactly the <UNK> is that he was killed to stop the deep sadness that was <UNK> through the boy's eyes there aren't many other unanswered questions as the characters beyond the boy and the lead are very one dimensional br br as for what is with the lead character another review suggested he is crazy i agree he isn't <UNK> but don't know that i'd call it crazy it seems that the movie tried hard to convey that he was either <UNK> or retarded in some way because he sure seemed slow and unable to grasp the obvious either that or they were going for a neglected youth with some <UNK> disorder and or who was heavily <UNK> as always ryan <UNK> is good at conveying something to the audience but it seems exactly what was deliberately left up in the air in this case this movie provides no answers just questions but it was a <UNK> bad movie that i really didn't care
<START> i just finished watching today and i'll begin by saying that i found this dvd on the shelves of blockbuster while <UNK> around looking for something new and good to watch the picture of ali caught my attention br br after <UNK> over ali i picked up the cover and continued to glance around the cover from the looks of it i thought the costumes were a bit over the top and then i saw the other indians on the cover and figured this was some kind of spoof film or something like that br br when i <UNK> over the the synopsis part and saw salman khan i did a double take salman khan in an american film with ali in a dvd at blockbuster because salman khan is to bollywood films like mel gibson is to hollywood films i had very high expectations for this film it had to be good i am very pleased to say that is a phenomenal film it far <UNK> any and all of my personal expectations br br i suppose a film like this is what happens when you have a decent script a talented experienced <UNK> and goal oriented director two incredible actors playing the lead roles and just a very hard working supporting cast and crew khan and appear to have really great chemistry together and both shine on the big screen they look really good together the musical numbers weren't bad at all which was surprising considering how cheesy and long indian <UNK> musicals are these days and you'll be happy to know that the indian costumes are very far from being cheesy as you'll get br br the beginning of the film was kind of slow the middle was really good the scenes leading to the climax were pretty dramatic but the ending was just awesome i have a few <UNK> and complaints about the dvd however while i loved the widescreen aspect ratio of the dvd i didn't like the fact that several other things were left out of the dvd for starters there are no subtitles now english being my first language it's not a problem however when some of the indian actors and actresses spoke it was at times difficult to understand what they were saying <UNK> would have helped br br another thing that i would have appreciated on the dvd would be a <UNK> reel or some kind of collection of <UNK> and lastly how about a menu feature that would allow us to skip right to the musical numbers man some of those songs were really good on the flip side i <UNK> enjoyed watching the making of br br i have tons more to say regarding the <UNK> of this film and how much i liked it but i don't have the time nor do i want to keep on writing why i enjoyed it so much i hope that salman khan does more english films in addition to his hindi films and i certainly hope this hindi film will not be ali last bollywood film and i encourage the director to continue making bollywood film <UNK> featuring salman khan ali and other big name actors just make sure the scripts are original and good br br 10 10 this is just a great love story film that your entire family can enjoy
<START> i'm not a big fan of musicals although this technically might not qualify as a musical but i thought i would give it a chance as i love war movies it was mediocre at best br br hudson seems totally out of <UNK> in this role it just didn't work for me julie andrews probably played her part as best as she could but i just find it hard to buy her as a conniving <UNK> spy sorry i know that is classic stereotyping on my part but i have to say i think this is julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking i always thought of her as more <UNK> but then surely that's a result of her roles in sound of music and mary <UNK> no doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that <UNK> in this role she was quite <UNK> in appearance here but i still didn't buy her as a spy br br i couldn't keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself <UNK> in and out and having conversations with those in my room which i usually never do i'm always everybody so that tells you how little it held my attention don't waste your time
<START> while credited as a tom and jerry cartoon this is not the cat and mouse team but an earlier <UNK> and jeff rip off featuring them going to africa and <UNK> themselves in the stereotypical burnt <UNK> makeup to try to blend in while the <UNK> humor is mostly lame there is a brief musical sequence involving black <UNK> that was entertaining i have to ask however how could tom and jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times one of many entries produced by the van corporation for distribution by rko radio pictures before rko made a deal with disney only worth seeing if you're an animation buff or is interested in how certain <UNK> were stereotyped as entertainment way back when
<START> this version of the magic <UNK> is not only the worst production of <UNK> great opera that i have ever seen it is also the worst video production i have seen of any opera br br i'm a big opera fan and i have more opera on dvd than movies the sets are cheap and cheesy doesn't even have a bird costume he is just dressed like some guy the sound is in <UNK> the color is really bad it is <UNK> in orange most dvd's from this period have the color <UNK> restored but they did not bother with this one also the language has been changed to swedish instead of the original german br br this is not a movie version of the magic <UNK> it is a filmed performance and it is not a good performance and it was not filmed very well you can pick any other available dvd of this opera and i guarantee it will be better than this one my <UNK> is for the version <UNK> by james <UNK> with sets by david
<START> upon a recommendation from a friend and my admiration of philip baker hall i rented the first season disc of the loop it's a typical tv comedy with all the clichés that the genre employs with the wacky scheming brother <UNK> <UNK> blonde <UNK> token <UNK> love interest <UNK> sarcastic asian <UNK> <UNK> which reminded me of <UNK> as if anyone needed to be reminded of that show the plot deals with various bad luck usually by <UNK> that <UNK> sam that puts his job at the airplane in <UNK> only to have him save the day with ensuing in the middle i didn't a certain episode i described them all to a t <UNK> lies the problem as what seems like it might even be passable entertainment at first just gets <UNK> stale when watching episodes in a row and growing bored beyond belief at the endless <UNK> <UNK> will do something <UNK> rogers will say something overtly sexual russ will tell about his gay son <UNK> will do her <UNK> of sandra oh on <UNK> blah blah blah blah blah the only positive is the lack of an annoying laugh track but don't let that fool you into thinking it's any good go watch a far better comedy arrested development always sunny in two name two off the top of my head surprised that this one is still on the air oh that's right fox only <UNK> the good shows i forgot needless to say i don't trust my friend's taste in shows anymore br br my grade d
<START> i have watched this show from the beginning and i am a 45 year old man to me this is so much more that a show that appeals to women this is the story of a family possibly an unusual one but a family none the less it centers around a mother and daughter and <UNK> <UNK> two bright attractive and in their own ways successful women makes her home in fictional stars hollow <UNK> a small new england town with a sense of history and a population of people that may be unusual but acts as a dysfunctional family the show also throws in the relationship between and her parents richard and emily <UNK> old money <UNK> <UNK> people who do not <UNK> of choices in life though doesn't care the relationships story and through line are what makes this show in my opinion the finest on the wb network soon to be the <UNK> watch this show
<START> this is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'the <UNK> it could be <UNK> that the actual mystery here is not one <UNK> best but what makes 'the <UNK> special is the characterisation and i found the actors here more or less without exception were perfect in their parts in such a uniformly good cast it's difficult to <UNK> stand out performances but i have to say that sarah miles is just perfect as lucy what is extraordinary is that she not only conveys <UNK> <UNK> and her more lovable qualities but she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact lucy is not really all that nice <UNK> <UNK> is also very good as <UNK> and claire price very affecting as <UNK> john is really quite an unlikeable character but jonathan cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him br br as i said the script follows the story quite <UNK> the only <UNK> thing i found was that <UNK> and <UNK> relationship really comes out of nowhere and i do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done the whole thing looks beautiful as well really capturing a perfect english <UNK> br br its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing
<START> this is a great <UNK> of interviews and <UNK> form the films of the late sixties and early 70s that were a counter movement to the big studio films of the late sixties directed by ted <UNK> it is obviously a labor of love of the films of the period but it gives short <UNK> to the masterpieces of the times br br many of the filmmakers of this period were influenced by <UNK> antonioni fellini bergman and of course john cassavetes unfortunately the documentary <UNK> in at <UNK> minutes is too short the film is rich with interviews and opinions of filmmakers some of the people interviewed are martin scorsese francis coppola robert altman peter <UNK> ellen <UNK> and roger corman bruce dern sydney <UNK> dennis hopper and jon voight br br bruce dern has a moment of truth when he says that he and jack nicholson may not have been as good looking as the other stars that came before them but they were interesting this <UNK> the other areas of this period of film making in american history br br the filmmakers were dealing with a lack of funding from the studios because they were expressing unconventional attitudes about politics sex drugs gender and race issues and <UNK> involvement in overseas conflicts like the vietnam war br br there is a great interview with francis coppola saying that he got the chance to make the conversation because the producers knew he had been trained by roger corman to make a movie with nothing so they <UNK> his film br br another interview is with jon voight who was directed by hal <UNK> in coming home a clear anti war film about a crippled soldier <UNK> himself back into society after his facing battle voight talks about how his working methods helped him achieve an emotional telling point when <UNK> said that they were doing a rehearsal take and it ended up being the take used in the film it was better because it was so un <UNK> and not <UNK> of its <UNK> by being over <UNK> br br there are also many fine <UNK> from al <UNK> break through film the panic in <UNK> park and interviews from dennis hopper on the making of easy rider and interviews from sydney <UNK> about making films br br all in all the documentary is a fine jumping off point for any film lover who wants to see great examples of what the new voices in film were like in the seventies many of the sundance folks where this film made a big <UNK> are unaware of just how much the independent film maker today owes to the films of john cassavetes <UNK> <UNK> william <UNK> and roger corman br br rent it from your favorite shop it will at least <UNK> you up to some films you may not have seen before and can enjoy today amazon com has it for as little as 11 50 if you want to buy right out
<START> i am so disappointed after waiting for 3 years for repeats the dvd of the original masterpiece series <UNK> i couldn't wait for this series the first episode just ended and i am appalled everything that was great about <UNK> has been <UNK> here pretty much worst introduction <UNK> laughter this takes the original point of it away and just <UNK> it nearly unwatchable one joke about eyes the audience was good the rest i can hardly remember it feels like a poor quality knowing me knowing you i hope this <UNK> as the series goes on otherwise i shall be seriously disappointed back to <UNK> br br you are the most compassionate man i ever known and i know god
<START> guess a few <UNK> film directors were sitting around <UNK> their or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the cannes or other film festival and one said hey guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class <UNK> it kind of sort of worked clearly someone was smart enough to <UNK> some of the best <UNK> of the <UNK> chosen for example <UNK> <UNK> so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the dvd you got more than your <UNK> worth not every director succeeded but more did than not and the flick seems to improve with each viewing over the years my favorite is the <UNK> beautiful love <UNK> from die okay a young naked elizabeth <UNK> is eye candy but her husband singing to her his wife's ghost is incredibly beautiful with the love music second only to and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in all the operatic <UNK> could the flick been better sure what couldn't not have been but it's well worth a view especially of you're in a hyper romantic mood
<START> a group of <UNK> travel to the <UNK> to try and locate a lost <UNK> named diana who disappeared years before in a plane crash and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their <UNK> br br once again my search for sleazy european cannibal movies has taken me deep into jess franco seemingly endless cinematic wilderness <UNK> with sub par <UNK> <UNK> with crap camera work and <UNK> with awful acting franco regular <UNK> taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an <UNK> elderly woman it is here in this <UNK> place that i finally stumbled upon <UNK> of an abysmal jungle based <UNK> so <UNK> bad that it took me three <UNK> <UNK> to finish watching it br br <UNK> and <UNK> dull even by <UNK> standards this <UNK> piece of trash fails on almost every level the story is a dreadfully dull derivative of edgar rice <UNK> tarzan albeit with a feminine twist the film appears to have been filmed in the local gardens although grainy stock footage is poorly integrated into the film in a pointless effort to convince viewers that the action is really taking place in africa and the death scenes are virtually <UNK> franco can usually be relied upon for some splatter but despite initial appearances this isn't a cannibal movie and it isn't that gory br br where the director does succeed however is in his casting of sexy young <UNK> as jungle jail bait diana running and <UNK> through the in nothing but a skimpy <UNK> cloth her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the fact that she was only sixteen at the time this <UNK> beauty makes quite an impression franco also throws in some further nudity courtesy of <UNK> carmen as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who gives us a glimpse of her <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mess as topless warrior woman thus <UNK> avoiding getting yet another rating of 1 10 from me although i'm sure he'll be receiving plenty more in the have loads of his films yet to see
<START> generally speaking i'm a an admirer of jess <UNK> film making but for some of this movies i really have difficulties understanding the motivation behind them or even their reason of existence like this sick puppy for example <UNK> has absolutely no cinematic value it's poorly made without any sort of plot and featuring some of the most ill natured sleaze footage ever captured on film this is another filthy women in prison film where rape lesbian action and violent torture games are daily routine the guards are <UNK> than the prisoners and the institution is <UNK> by an <UNK> <UNK> who only gets sexually <UNK> when he spots a girl having sex with a dog the girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the entire film yet you can't really enjoy this sight with all the <UNK> going on the dubious highlights include a <UNK> hunting game you can guess what he prey is a duel to death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl having a <UNK> <UNK> all the way through her <UNK> avoid this sick mess and you'll save yourself the trouble of taking two <UNK> in order to wash the filth off
<START> rent this only movie if you're in the mood for laughs for sheer stupidity as this movie wouldn't scare a bunch of at a halloween party the trouble is there is too much gore for <UNK> so definitely don't put this in your vcr for the <UNK> it starts off with a little bit of promise giving you the impression that the box cover artist may have actually started watching this film before <UNK> the cover but then <UNK> quickly into epic stupidity the killer scarecrows are clumsy <UNK> that are about as scary as the one in the wizard of oz but not quite as smart if they'd only had a brain i got this movie for 1 20 at a local <UNK> close out store and even so i feel somewhat ripped off i think with all the other comments posted here if you actually pay to see this you can only blame yourself
<START> i first saw this movie about 3 years ago i was shocked at how stupid the fbi was not to prevent such a tragedy it could have been easily prevented this movie was just unbelievable br br now seeing it after september <UNK> i am appalled and can say that this could have been prevented more easily that most people would want to know br br this film is 100 true br br in the final scene of the film when the mastermind of the 1st attack is being taken to prison by helicopter and flies over the towers he makes a spine chilling remark that was laughed at when he said it next time we'll bring them both down this was actually said by <UNK> after his arrest br br this movie reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were carried out right under the <UNK> of the fbi and <UNK> it shows how the 1st and 4th are partially to blame for the attacks br br i watch this movie now and know that both attacks could have been prevented
<START> blake <UNK> legendary fiasco begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes a combination of the eagle has landed star oh what a lovely war and <UNK> pink <UNK> films darling <UNK> never <UNK> the viewer the <UNK> sequences the musical numbers the romance the comedy and the espionage are all ho hum at what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn this disaster <UNK> in tone never decides what it wants to be and apparently thinks it's a spoof but it's <UNK> and <UNK> square old fashioned in the worst sense audiences understandably stayed away in <UNK> it's awful james garner would have been a vast improvement over hudson who is just cardboard and he doesn't connect with andrews and vice versa and both andrews and hudson don't seem to have been let in on the joke and perform with a <UNK> <UNK> blake <UNK> <UNK> isn't much more than ok but it's the only good that ever came out of darling <UNK> the expensive and professional look of much of darling <UNK> only make what it's all <UNK> on even more difficult to bear to quote paramount chief robert evans 24 million dollars worth of film and no picture
<START> i have no idea who these others are but this movie is plain awful they have to prop up joe <UNK> when he is a minor character bait and switch movie just like the studios did with adam sandler and jim carrey etc the dvd i watched states this obscure gem revolves around joe <UNK> mob character who is a <UNK> that start a war etc etc joe plays the part of joe he does not even carry a gun plays a character and gets spoiler whacked so much for the movie revolving around <UNK> the only halfway memorable scene was a bad attempt at comedy when they passed gas while waiting for a score if you watch this movie after reading this i warned you please stop and do not lose <UNK> minutes of your life
<START> first of all i must say that i love this film br br it was the first film that i saw from director micheal <UNK> and i was impressed that how good the direction was good br br <UNK> surely knows how to direct actors what i found <UNK> is also <UNK> scenario at first you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected from everybody in her <UNK> then you realise that she has a mother who is a freak and is too much present in her life now you know that she is deranged that she has emotional problems but you don't know exactly what and then you fall into her dark side but her dark side is only reveal when a student fall in love with her she can't herself anymore br br the roles are very and difficult to play but isabelle <UNK> is marvellous in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at cannes festival benoit is very solid too but a little bit <UNK> by <UNK> performance br br there is one thing that i found strange in the scenario is how the character played by is not very credible he is too talented it is rare that a person is a piano <UNK> but pass the most of the his time to play hockey and study it think that it is a weak point but only a minor flaw br br i just saw the movie once so i can't do a very complete critic because i didn't the movie i like what i saw so i give the film a 8 5 10 br br oh yeah as for the end <UNK> showed that he really wanted to shock his audience a motivation that don't think is necessary to make movies but <UNK> does it with style and <UNK> that is why his film is better than <UNK> <UNK> for example br br vince
<START> as an early representation of the turmoil of the 1960's that followed diane <UNK> nicole kidman can be <UNK> as an early flower child the film itself deserves no such <UNK> the lack of character development motivation and justification for the character's behavior makes the movie very disappointing i sat watching and waiting for some explanation of the bizarre actions only to find that was letting me <UNK> into a story that must have been <UNK> inside joke that the few facts presented did not match diane life very much did not help to <UNK> things either br br the washed out art direction in <UNK> <UNK> life was nicely <UNK> with the brilliant colors in her life with lionel and the trap door <UNK> was a nice <UNK> of <UNK> attempt to <UNK> her new life into her existing family however i don't see how that trap door in the ceiling of her <UNK> room could directly connect to <UNK> apartment which was two <UNK> of stairs up from <UNK> br br maybe my analysis is a little too literal in looking for some character development and relationship understanding that goes beyond one sentence or one comment i also would have liked to see at least one of <UNK> photos as well i won't wait for the sequel
<START> before i forget let me say the artwork in here is outstanding from garbage <UNK> to the huge cruise ship the drawings are beautifully done if this wasn't animated critics would be the direction in here because it's really good br br to the story <UNK> is picking through the garbage at the <UNK> but the are slim while brooding at the <UNK> next to a big ship in a he spots <UNK> in his cage <UNK> spots him too and you know his first comment the same one he always makes when he spots the cat anyway <UNK> runs over opens the and says hello breakfast <UNK> <UNK> the window on his face and says you bad old <UNK> <UNK> the cat falls into the water br br the <UNK> quickly <UNK> back aboard ship into cabin grabs him and is ready to leave when <UNK> there's <UNK> at the door with her <UNK> <UNK> takes a beating as the old lady <UNK> her pet bird once again but <UNK> says <UNK> i've dropped my glasses i can't see a thing without 'em heavens to where are those <UNK> br br now <UNK> has the upper hand and the normal cat trying to catch bird <UNK> are on again like <UNK> glasses <UNK> most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of <UNK> on them so when she woke up and put them on she'd see the bird and think it was okay br br overall a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch as you can tell by the quotes i love the dialog in some of these old cartoons
<START> an obscure horror show filmed in the <UNK> two couples stay overnight in a cabin after being made a little uneasy by the of the locals who or what are the blood <UNK> after awhile they find out watch for the character of the village idiot who like a chicken he certainly is weird
<START> how to take charles <UNK> fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flick his pivotal and <UNK> ideas and their radical influence on western thought and <UNK> society are <UNK> except for two brief scenes in one of which it is claimed he is killing god pure to make the movie emotional and the rest of the movie <UNK> to that purpose it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with <UNK> music at which one is <UNK> to cry anyone who actually read origin of species would be vividly aware that there was no <UNK> with god in any of <UNK> work to the contrary there was an <UNK> awe and respect and a revolutionary new way of looking at things a good movie about <UNK> could be educational thoughtful and deeply inspiring even in a religious sense but that would <UNK> the soap opera intentions of this flick this is a flick that is designed to make people <UNK> in contrived sympathy and then feel transformed although unable to understand why it makes fast use of <UNK> great name only as marketing <UNK> as one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression sad that the sets and costumes are so good production values except for the writing were obviously high see it if you want to <UNK> for the loss of intelligence in american literature
<START> i never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that i <UNK> to the hbo service now i know better jack is usually one of my favorite actors but not even he could rescue this part not that he tried jack plays his usual of type character unfortunately it doesn't transfer over to the american <UNK> he is about as believable a cowboy <UNK> as pee wee herman there is no edge to the performance and for that reason the comedy fails he is almost to goofy the remainder of the cast was worse timing in delivering lines is apparently something that the leading lady had not <UNK> as of 1978 and the others appeared to be just happy to be there my recommendation to those of you interested in seeing this movie is that you save your valuable time for something like watching paint dry
<START> auteur <UNK> explores the depths of love passion and <UNK> and the devastating results of loss in his latest film br br <UNK> world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a <UNK> to the core of the human soul a director he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors superb editing especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end thriller which leaves much to the eye br br what an accomplishment for <UNK> br br <UNK> cheers <UNK> angela <UNK>
<START> i have not managed to completely block out this film from memory even though it has been two years since i've seen it br br don't get me wrong i have long forgotten the main story line the relationship between kidman and law that made no impression on me but it was the torture scenes in the film that really struck me i cried for about two hours straight after <UNK> br br it had never previously occurred to me how people in war time could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love we see several examples of this here in both the scenes with natalie portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home i was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind however i am glad i watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can <UNK> on it's own br br the blonde <UNK> character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since i saw the film his horrible <UNK> and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me at one point i wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself see the movie pushed me over the edge of reason it only occurred to me afterward that i'd only be hitting a big screen that shows the film's power and intensity at least br br i recommend the film for it's sheer experience not for the <UNK> love story but for the manner in which it depicts war without needing a battlefield
<START> i thought sleeper cell was interesting and exciting to watch up until the last episode when nothing happens its f <UNK> you americans portray muslims as terrorists and the americans as hero's its the other way around i hate it when every american tv show ends up predictable i was hoping the bombs would go off in that stadium but i knew it <UNK> it takes the joy out of watching it when you know that the good guys are going to save the day yet again americans are the biggest terrorists g bush the leader of them all he is to blame for 9 11 and i'm p off that you keep throwing these shows at us which are all the f same i've a good show about terrorism its called the and bush himself the cell leader its the same with 24 how ever 24 was good sleeper cell is a mock and should never make a season 2 its f joke and so are you american producers
<START> i find myself <UNK> that people are not so critical of a work that deserves criticism the many similarities both <UNK> and literally with <UNK> aside the deliberately chooses the easy path by putting audience before art and therefore denying the world a <UNK> intelligent and creative work br br now consider the following is it not possible that the real story of the creation of the <UNK> <UNK> may actually be an engaging and powerful story itself and equally so in a dramatic telling <UNK> was completely deaf by the writing of the <UNK>  isn't that more interesting how was the <UNK> <UNK> wouldn't it be great to know so ask yourself what possible motivation could a filmmaker have for introducing a woman as the <UNK> if there was a <UNK> he would certainly be a man what was his story please try to be a little critical here even if you like the invention of a woman composer br br fantasy should be much more than a <UNK> of reality to serve a writers purpose for those who find themselves comparing and <UNK> the invention of anna with the invention of claim to have murdered <UNK> in <UNK> consider that he <UNK> to a priest in a lunatic asylum <UNK> uses this device to great affect in the film may have worked if anna was a <UNK> of <UNK> imagination but we are meant to believe she is yes and that <UNK> was <UNK> by aliens br br most of the positive reviews i've read here so far are often expressions of a desire for the film to be good almost a deliberate <UNK> remembering the film for what you wish it to be rather than what it is br br for those who believe that fantasy <UNK> the means then consider you are not only accepting an inferior interpretation of real events but also <UNK> the truth for the sake of a <UNK> br br finally a short note on the acting here that may surprise some of you ed harris is not good as <UNK> van <UNK> does that shock you he looks awkward throughout the film much like an actor dressed up but off set and standing at the <UNK> table most of his lines are said as <UNK> rather than replies to anna lines i e he is not listening to the actor he is quite clearly an actor <UNK> as the character rather than being the character br br really how many times does <UNK> have to roll in his grave before we get it right just ask yourself would <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i love sandra <UNK> she's one of my all time favorite actresses but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash <UNK> i realize that it's almost 20 years old but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did beware it's not even worth the 5 50 <UNK> rack you know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks the sound quality is horrendous there's no closed <UNK> to even hear the hideous dialog and it looks as if it were filmed on a 1 98 budget i thought that i'd like to see sandra in an early role to see how she evolved as an actress but <UNK> is too kind a word to use
<START> this movie is one of the <UNK> adaptations of a fabulous book that i've seen jean <UNK> novel is a fantastic book that i think is an outstanding read for any child i can't give the same <UNK> to this movie
<START> this is just a very bad film miles looks as if she is in pain during the sex scenes and the acting is wooden it also drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all one of the worst films that i have ever seen
<START> i have watched this movie quite <UNK> i am not sure whether it was attempting to be a horror gore fest in a rob zombie type affair or an exploration of real events br br in either case it missed its mark it's not particularly historically accurate with characters being chopped and changed for the sake of the story br br the performances were neither compelling nor bad br br for me i would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could easily have gone down this route without spoiling the overall effect
<START> i'm a fan of judy garland <UNK> minnelli and gene kelly but this movie just left me cold i was expecting another american in paris from minnelli so perhaps i was expecting too much br br the movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers i was impressed by the very <UNK> kelly dance as on the ship i was also impressed by the nicholas brothers in be a clown too bad the song was so annoying i also enjoyed judy attacking kelly with a check <UNK> autobiography for some interesting information on that scene br br actually the movie has what must be some of cole <UNK> most annoying songs especially nina also judy and gene yell constantly like <UNK> children br br the plot is thin which is par for the course for musicals but it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs i suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor please some movie find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been
<START> the movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based it was hard for me to find newspaper <UNK> about the actual facts but when i located them i could see that truth in this case was stranger than fiction <UNK> light was <UNK> evil in her role as the mother in this movie so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role the mark i think of an excellent performance rick <UNK> was appropriately clueless as her son who also <UNK> her in court an example of how hard it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept the actions of a parent no matter how criminal they may be one can find fault with the movie but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based
<START> you know that this film is in serious trouble when the best acting job is the support role played by arnold <UNK> while this was still relatively early in his career and he wasn't the best actor compared to <UNK> <UNK> he's sir john gielgud in fact this film proves that the only reason she got much of any attention were her boobs and because she was involved with the incredibly self destructive football player mark so instead of this being her break out film this and a beverly hills cop movie mark about as high as she went in her one note career it was obvious too that the <UNK> <UNK> gave up on this movie as well because the supporting cast aside from arnold is pretty lame and the script is dull dull dull fans looking for another conan movie would no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and <UNK> film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is tired of doing movies and know wants to do some success in music being half <UNK> half expert <UNK> he wants to rise in the music market however know everyone is like him and making the good singer linda moon to record a hit will be harder as expected the first part is funny and filled with irony this one falls into the easy jokes and has many less good moments only the two women uma and are decent in their part most of the film is done with <UNK> character <UNK> exaggerated a little is ok too much is disgusting and the only one that one could save is the gay bodyguard who at least is coherent the rest are too much idiot the most surprising thing is the fact that the movie is not boring everything happens so quick and there are so many things happening that you do not have time to get bored if you want to follow the movie it may insult your intelligence a lot and the movie is bad yeah but well it's not boring
<START> jack frost 2 is out of the question i'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies br br as sam and his wife take to the for a relaxing christmas jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with <UNK> br br don't take a at this film at all most people say its a laugh with your mates but its a waste of time if the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story especially the cheesy character names
<START> you don't have to be a <UNK> dame football fan to enjoy this because i am not but as a football fan in general this was fun to watch it almost makes me a fighting irish <UNK> if you can't get caught up in the emotion in this film <UNK> fan or not you better check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenes br br as a sports fan i loved watching the classic footage of early college games they had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of they interspersed that footage with pat o'brien shown as head coach on the <UNK> and some of the players such as george ronald reagan br br reagan gets pretty good billing in this film but his part really isn't that large o'brien is the only actor with a large role in here the rest all playing nice characters include <UNK> page as wife bonnie donald crisp as the <UNK> father john callahan albert as chemistry professor father and reagan as perhaps <UNK> most talented and famous player ever br br what this film does nicely is balance the personal story with the football neither angle is overdone the characters in here all people you can root for as there are no villains on my last look it was interesting to discover johnny <UNK> <UNK> son playing at the age of seven and to see george reeves tv's superman as one of the players br br there have been very few football movies made in hollywood for some reason and precious few good ones this is one of them
<START> absolutely nothing the movies that are great in this world are not recognized unless they are filled with <UNK> explosions and death this movie is filled with a man talking about showing you a more complex character than has been seen in many movies br br when a movie is incredibly fast paced but stays mostly in one location it has to be the work of a genius surprisingly enough it is this movie is directed by oliver stone and therefore is one of the best directed films of our time br br this movie's screenplay was co written by oliver stone and eric <UNK> barry main character with oliver <UNK> help the screenplay was created as a <UNK> rolling script which keeps you interested the entire time if you have any amount of intelligence if you have an open mind about any subjects and the wit to comprehend others then this movie is something which you should find some way to watch immediately
<START> in case you dear readers never heard this movie was the main inspiration for last year's samuel l jackson eugene levy <UNK> the man this 80s <UNK> buddy action comedy <UNK> short <UNK> billy crystal and the late <UNK> <UNK> gregory hines together as some witty <UNK> town cops who don't play by the rules that's pretty much the extent of the movie interest is somewhat <UNK> by <UNK> line delivery that is <UNK> similar to will smith's and by cameos of now more famous actors like joe <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> jimmy my favorite scene is i <UNK> the car chase on the tracks i guess basically i just view this movie as a major helping hand in the <UNK> of action buddy flicks well this and lethal weapon 4 and rush hour 2 and the man
<START> hello all i went to this movie without any expectation though i knew would've given an excellent film i was stunned the backdrop is the struggle between the settled in <UNK> <UNK> and the government the story is about how an young girl who lives with her foster parents at <UNK> india leaves to <UNK> <UNK> in search of her real mother the high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and <UNK> the cinematography editing and all other technical details full marks to the cast and crew i have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there excellent work though the war sequences reminded me of saving private ryan such a work was never attempted on indian screen overall the movie is great and hats off to mr br br <UNK> has once again proved that he is a director who can take indian cinema to great heights i would love to watch this film again and again an excellent film and a must see
<START> i felt that the movie directed by <UNK> bergman was very dry it shows the things people will do to survive during a war and the shame that comes out of these actions however i feel that it was not complete or attention holding he never fully got into the plot or deep into the character emotions or reasons behind their actions the only thing that i found rather attention holding in the movie was the transformation of the two main characters jan and eva many times during the movie was just the two main characters sitting around or doing their daily <UNK> and not even having a conversation i understand this was to show the reality of these people however i feel there are other ways to show reality and have it be entertaining i think that <UNK> bergman could have filmed this movie in a more riveting way
<START> well the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion yes chuck is a real martial artist and kicks some butt in this film but it is rather slow and the acting in my opinion is for the most part <UNK> although i think steve james does a decent job like my friend ryan i was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theatre at the end of the film rather than to go after <UNK> girlfriend until than the killer had only killed women oh well i guess it wasn't as predictable as i thought <UNK> a film you can pass on
<START> after an intriguing start this little drama quickly <UNK> into the ranks of sheer mediocrity the start of the movie sees two women heather graham and natasha <UNK> wagner meet each other while waiting for their boyfriends to get home from their holidays natasha <UNK> wagner is a lovely looking actress and she plays louise a cute girl whose beloved boyfriend is an all round entertainer music movies you name it he does it while she's telling the other girl carla heather graham all about her wonderful boyfriend it soon becomes apparent that the similarities between their two male friends are too much and it's obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy oh dear enter robert downey <UNK> the sleaze bag that has two girlfriends while some poor guy somewhere has to go without one downey plays the sort of guy that the ladies like but men find <UNK> annoying he is basically a <UNK> boy the worst kind too on the phone <UNK> mother all the time continually <UNK> his girlfriends with ambitious albeit empty promises etc it's enough to make a normal guy sick br br the film <UNK> rips off superior three way love triangle films such as jules et jim this film doesn't work though mostly due to the fact that it's story is so unbelievable seriously if two women had just found that they were dating the same guy they wouldn't stick around to talk about it another reason why it falls down is that it's just so turgid there's no end of possibilities for the outcome of the situation that this movie presents especially with the <UNK> of setting it all in a small apartment but all the movie does is get lost in masses of dialogue badly written and poorly delivered dialogue that is the film is also <UNK> <UNK> it just isn't believable that people would act like they do in this film after finding themselves in this situation robert downey <UNK> is one of the many things that is wasted in the film with natural born killers he proved that he could give brilliantly entertaining performances and that is something that this movie could do with the two females aren't wasted because nobody expected anything from them anyway but downey could definitely have been better <UNK> overall a waste of time don't bother see jules et jim or natural born killers instead that's my advice
<START> having watched the first scene i realized the acting was so bad that it couldn't possibly pick up later superficial and artificial with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology the way a five year old tries to make it sound as if he knows what he's talking about br br the second to second storyline is completely unrealistic and just about every single decision the screenwriter did was the kind you expect from a below average grade school student the overall storyline was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of <UNK> the few attempts to make the dialogs sound intelligent was limited to neurotic <UNK> behavior a ten year old might like it but it would take a five year old to accept the lack of realism how does advanced cell function allow someone to <UNK> a code lock by touching it as if with a magic <UNK> pick out one out of <UNK> of voices through a <UNK> system thereby ripping off superman and <UNK> a home computer by just <UNK> whats wrong instead of looking for faults actually that scene is a neat example the fault was that one of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the was broken the way it would look if a <UNK> <UNK> on a engine is ripped off by an explosion this is something that can't happen and if it did it wouldn't prevent the computer from working there is no <UNK> current passing through this <UNK> but when he without doing it himself his arms worked by <UNK> because the cells in his body was super efficient put a push pin into the rip a <UNK> with icons appeared on the screen immediately without <UNK> br br and so it goes all the way like when he escaped an <UNK> room in the <UNK> <UNK> by lighting a lighter below a fire resulting in open doors throughout the building naturally <UNK> didn't predict this sharp witted approach to escaping nor did they put any guards outside his room or anywhere else to guard a living walking breakthrough in military so he walked out and got a cab examples like this one are not only numerous there is in fact just about no single scene that makes sense br br also the so called great effects were terrible he threw a basketball back to a kid in the park and the kid was thrown back 20 feet into a tree no <UNK> or but constant speed and height like a <UNK> <UNK> i'm sure if i <UNK> and looked for the <UNK> that kept the <UNK> of this kid the way only <UNK> can they probably didn't know how to or bother to <UNK> them completely if someone is thrown that far into a tree they would at least say <UNK> or rather be <UNK> with broken bones but the kid was just just confused and amazed br br moronic that's the word for every creative decision made throughout the entire production i'm going to put the director's name on my own personal <UNK> someone as poorly skilled as him cannot improve i feel like demanding <UNK> for having wasted 45 minutes of my life for watching it and the time it took to write this although it felt <UNK> it was traumatic to realize how little it takes to get a pilot <UNK> the only excuse a slightly intelligent person could have to watch this <UNK> would be <UNK> or <UNK>
<START> buster keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films and they don't come more <UNK> funny than this gem the dead pan comic gets involved in a <UNK> mix up with a wanted <UNK> this leads to his elaborate <UNK> of several street cops and fellow passengers who <UNK> the his face from the wanted signs the goat is a <UNK> with brilliant site gags from the opening scene at the bread <UNK> right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end a keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking as sound is never something you needed with him his movies explain themselves through the wonderful yet incredibly dangerous things he did to himself it isn't hard to see just how influential he really was the man is every bit as thoroughly amazing today as he was in <UNK>
<START> i was expecting born to kill to be an exciting high tension film noir instead it's got two good action set pieces one at the beginning and one at the end and some <UNK> atmospheric cinematography by robert de usually a <UNK> cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir but the rest of the film is pretty boring lawrence tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by the numbers performance <UNK> <UNK> out what the audience expected from him after dillinger an overrated movie but at least better than this claire character is too stupid and <UNK> to have any audience appeal and the action such as it is stays so <UNK> inside that damned house in san francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling it's one of those movies in which the supporting players notably elisha cook jr whose character's <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script and <UNK> <UNK> out act the leads it also doesn't help that nearly half a century after alfred hitchcock and anthony <UNK> <UNK> the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in psycho <UNK> is so gross and obvious he might as well have psycho <UNK> on his <UNK> also there's no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called <UNK> than the male but perhaps james <UNK> made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film born to kill is a real disappointment from robert wise who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career
<START> this comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its <UNK> high user rating which i find frankly puzzling the reasons why i didn't like this title are following br br 1 the <UNK> must have had some doubts whether to make a jackie chan type of a flick or a dark tragedy as a result in terms of genre the film falls between two <UNK> as the tragic and comic elements clash and <UNK> out each other rather than make a <UNK> whole br br 2 the characters' motives and <UNK> are incoherent and unconvincing psychological truth and logic are sadly missing br br 3 absurd casting i don't blame the actors for it is a hard thing to create a convincing character by acting alone if there is <UNK> logic in the script however why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the leading two actors whose ages in the film can't <UNK> by more than 3 4 br br 4 to me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2 if you can't find a character you could sympathize with it is hard to follow the story with interest when you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist it turns out to make no sense br br 5 some films apart from being entertaining are also thought provoking having seen this film i began to wonder whether the thought the director tried to <UNK> was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly wholesome and delightful i cannot put any other construction on the ending br br 6 the film is <UNK> with totally unnecessary violence violence in a film and elsewhere is a good thing if it serves an important and worthy purpose purposes can be different and i don't want to enter into this broad subject let me just say i don't object to violence in such films as saving private ryan the passion of the christ or the pulp fiction in <UNK> the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic or <UNK> what for i do not know personally i don't <UNK> any satisfaction from watching teeth being <UNK> with a hammer or hear a man cut off his tongue with <UNK> and then see him <UNK> on his own blood etc etc br br 7 the film reminds me a little of japanese porno in its <UNK> on incest and young asian girls' <UNK> <UNK> and the like it appears there is a minority who actually enjoy this kind of thing if you're one of them you might find this film enjoyable br br in short i do not recommend this film either as entertainment or food for thought where it isn't silly it is disgusting don't waste your time
<START> malcolm mcdowell <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> daughter and she as having a form of illness when they believe they are seeing the <UNK> like creatures which live with the rocks and the roots to quote the movie br br basically a family moves into an older house which has a smaller doll house in the backyard the daughter well played by <UNK> starts to <UNK> the creatures until they become <UNK> the family cat also disappears br br there are a few good scenes with <UNK> <UNK> millennium and malcolm mcdowell as the psychiatrist there is also something strange which occurred to one of <UNK> patients br br if you enjoy this type of story you may also like bad ronald which had a similar odd theme and the house is haunted by bad ronald scott <UNK> only that movie is from the 70's 7 10
<START> there were two things i hated about wasted the directing and the script i know i m opening myself up to <UNK> but stephen t kay s direction is too much like a like a well like a mtv pop video it s shot i think on digital video against an <UNK> soundtrack often out of focus and often with rapid cross cutting if you re not a teenager you ll find many segments of wasted unwatchable due to the <UNK> approach as bad as the directing was it was the script that <UNK> my chain the story is told through samantha a poor little rich girl who spends much of the film talking through voice over strange how the voice over never seems <UNK> enough to have come from the same character telling us of the pressure of her <UNK> the pressure of home life her social <UNK> and it s all this that led her to take drugs it s for similar reasons like <UNK> break up that her two male friends i thought she was supposed to be lonely to start taking drugs oh poor little sammi in her nice house and her problems how my heart <UNK> for you and your <UNK> not what wasted <UNK> t mention is that no matter what someone is addicted to be it drink drugs <UNK> or chocolate that person has to work at becoming an addict they re not a victim of <UNK> forces they re an act of free will both traffic and <UNK> made this point very well people become <UNK> because they want to to portray them as victims in any way is wrong <UNK> and very possibly dangerous br br by the way if mtv are anti drugs will they stop playing videos from stars who <UNK> admit taking drugs
<START> this season lacked real but as far as setting up stories to get us in the mood again season 6 is without highlights and <UNK> br br this season lacked its usual sopranos style and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in each and every episode this season you probably would have had 6 episodes worth of real stories br br side stories like <UNK> mom is she or isn't she was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character i would have like to have seen bobby express his anger more at <UNK> in that carnival episode but to no <UNK> br br and that's just it these side stories had no real purpose and lack finishing if they are going to finish off these stories in the next 6 episodes i'd rather not watch it because its not really worth seeing br br disappointing is to nice a word to say about this season and its finale
<START> <UNK> jones elisha her bad boy brother nick <UNK> michael murray her boyfriend <UNK> jared and her friends <UNK> paris hilton and her boyfriend blake robert richard and dalton jon <UNK> travel to another city to watch an important game they decide to camp in a field halfway and proceed their journey on the next day however the fan belt of car breaks and he stays with <UNK> to buy a new one in a close town where there is a house of wax when they arrive in the place they realize that the place is a ghost town and two deranged former <UNK> brothers have transformed people in wax <UNK> br br i liked this house of wax indeed a worthwhile teen horror movie the story follows the standards of the texas chainsaw massacre and other slash movies and it is well made has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects and the death scenes are amazing even if the movie were not good watching the sexy and delicious paris hilton is worth my vote is seven br br title brazil a <UNK> de the house of wax
<START> this sequel proves that tim burton was for all <UNK> and purposes the best choice to ever direct a batman movie the story focuses on taking on three enemies the penguin wonderfully played by danny <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> michelle pfeiffer and max the superb christopher walken br br perhaps the best entry in the series it has it all complex themes complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out the cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand out is <UNK> as the multi layered penguin here is a guy who is evil <UNK> funny and perhaps most importantly scary the infamous scene with image <UNK> still sends <UNK> up my spine in other words the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances br br i do not hesitate to say that batman returns is my favorite of all the <UNK> released sorry dark knight fans if you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action then please check out this badly underrated film br br if nothing else it's at least the best film tim burton has ever made
<START> i found west point to be an <UNK> film although i doubt that i would watch it again the performances were convincing with william haines as yet another <UNK> amusing young man that has his come <UNK> by film's end it's hard to believe that stardom <UNK> joan crawford less than a year after this film was made as she looks rather awkward at times br br i would apply the comment made by another concerning <UNK> <UNK> 1932 to this film as well there is a great film waiting to be made here but there is something lacking the backdrop and <UNK> of the <UNK> was well <UNK> but i was less involved than i thought that i would be perhaps <UNK> character went too far or got away with too much his <UNK> did not seem genuine enough and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the army navy game where's the <UNK> in that might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself also i doubt very much that william weak <UNK> character would ever have a real life counterpart at west point br br all this aside the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring it is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution thank goodness that tradition still means something at west point too unlike the vapid traditions of <UNK> league schools only half <UNK> engaged in these days br br as to the score it was appropriately martial but there was a distinct over use of <UNK> drums using them for knocks on the door scene transitions et as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious it rather <UNK> the viewing experience i was ready to say i get the point already br br with that enjoy the film but don't expect too much emotional involvement
<START> this film was filled with great acting great musical sounds that blow your mind completely away <UNK> <UNK> darius <UNK> deep <UNK> was a sharp cat with the <UNK> and he soon met his <UNK> with long nina <UNK> big <UNK> house 2000 nina put her heart and soul into this role and when she meets up with darius the sparks fly at first and then there is a sort of hate relationship the entire cast of actors made this a very entertaining film with plenty of comedy drama and lots of loving and cheating going on this is a very down to earth film and at the same time shows how everyone eventually has his and her destiny in life and are placed in their little corner of this big world great film enjoy
<START> wow there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is i usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad but this was just too much i would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device if you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror if your thinking about watching this because your a sandra <UNK> fan don't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time and her acting is absolutely atrocious not to mention the rest of the cast which could be replaced with <UNK> who would do a better job at least then we wouldn't have to listen to the terrible dialogue
<START> film follows four friends from the 1950s when they're in high school up to 1981 they are craig <UNK> a <UNK> immigrant georgia <UNK> a free spirit david michael who has no personality and tom jim <UNK> a big strong handsome rugged guy all three of them are in love with georgia but she only loves the film mostly focuses on those two it chronicles their lives love and attraction to each other over the years it also gets into trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father br br i love this film but it's not without its bad points high <UNK> voice is annoying but you get used to it the story jumps around very quickly tom and david's lives are never explained tom shows up with a <UNK> wife and kids and david has a wife we never meet until the end some crucial scenes are badly written and there's some obvious pre release cutting probably to keep the film at 2 hours br br but everything else is so good you can easily forget the problems the story is compelling you really get to know and understand the characters and always get caught up in the lives with a few exceptions the script by steve is good in fact was a <UNK> immigrant himself and based much of the script on his own experiences all the acting is great especially and <UNK> also reed <UNK> throws in a strong likable performance as <UNK> college roommate and lois smith is very interesting in her role and look quick for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br basically it's a real great story about immigrants coming of age love of america and covers the 50 80s perfectly br br this film was <UNK> <UNK> on its release the studio didn't know how to <UNK> it it is a hard film to market and the critics <UNK> on it pauline review in the new <UNK> was particularly harsh it barely played in theaters i was lucky enough to catch it in 1981 in its short theatrical run and has simply disappeared that's a shame this is a movie that is just <UNK> for <UNK> i'm not <UNK> on it but you never know a definite 10 all the way
<START> i rented this movie expecting it to suck and it didn't let me down i rented it with some friends as a joke but what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine br br it starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box it looks like a blade rip off and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie its called vampire assassin but isn't an assassin someone who kills for hire well this guy kills the of his own <UNK> so that doesn't make him an assassin br br then when you actually put the <UNK> in it gets worst first off the menu animation is lame but when you actually start the movie every thing from the set design to the lighting or lack thereof is terrible you know a movie is bad when the credits even suck the acting is laughable the action is childish the writing is <UNK> and the directing is the worst
<START> i happened upon a rare copy of this early <UNK> film with high expectations <UNK> is a prolific contemporary director i enjoyed his 1988 film women on the verge of a nervous breakdown and i had read one or two very positive reviews of the film well i must have missed completely the humor that the reviewers saw in this film i just found it incoherent tasteless and boring yes there are plenty of <UNK> people in drag and crude sexual situations and yes these elements may have shocked audiences in 1982 which was almost certainly <UNK> intention but much of the shock value has probably <UNK> over the years leaving a limp storyline beyond that the whole movie seemed very chaotic none of the characters were particularly sympathetic and for a comedy even a dark one i just didn't find this film funny i suppose it is possible there is a very <UNK> audience for a film like this but i'm just not part of that audience and not sure that i want to be
<START> this was a decent movie for the first half too many cheap boo moments but the tension builds the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely the kids are not particularly deep but hey that works for teens br br then it just gets ridiculous and tries way too hard the why in the world would he they do that moments <UNK> anyone's capacity for suspension of disbelief the twist involves too many ridiculous <UNK> and the title comes from a late attempt to <UNK> some meaning into the film that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped there was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be funny br br great premise but just badly written and doesn't hold together some very nice shots but they're hard to enjoy while you're rolling your eyes
<START> yes it was an awful movie but there was a song near the beginning of the movie i think called i got a woody or something to that effect i would love to find a sound track of that if there is one available i saw this song on <UNK> <UNK> and as awful as it was it had it's moments and that song was one of them br br if you like babes in <UNK> this is the movie for you but if you don't then don't bother it was great material for <UNK> <UNK> i have to admit though i would really love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack though not just that song but a couple more were really funny and are classics as far as i'm concerned
<START> king of the underworld features an early role for bogart in one of his many gangster roles br br he plays joe <UNK> who uses a female doctor to treat his men and pays her for it he follows her when she goes to live with her <UNK> after one of men kills her doctor husband who also worked for him <UNK> kidnaps an author on his way to find the female doctor and gets him to write his life story and he then plans to kill him he finally meets up with the doctor and after she gives <UNK> and his men a substance that makes them <UNK> blind she and the author who have now fallen in love manage to escape just as police arrive br br the excellent <UNK> in the cast are kay francis james <UNK> and john br br watching king of the underworld is a good way to spend just over an hour one evening br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> i've been a fan of <UNK> gate since its first release i've seen it at least half a dozen times and have long thought of it as a masterpiece so it was with excitement and a sense of anticipation that i took myself off to see the restored director's cut br br to my surprise i was disappointed on seeing it again and have since <UNK> my <UNK> of the film <UNK> gate touches upon greatness in parts but overall lacks the <UNK> and narrative <UNK> and the passionate urgency characteristic of a truly great film br br firstly two technical problems the sound quality is throughout the film <UNK> on at times some of this perhaps is intentional a way to <UNK> the chaos and confusion of history as it is unfolding but at key points one is unable to register what it is the characters are saying br br the cinematography is similarly the images lack <UNK> and of detail the result is a certain <UNK> and lack of <UNK> <UNK> which succeeds in <UNK> <UNK> and background br br <UNK> the narrative is off key throughout as if <UNK> can't quite make up his mind as to the effect he is after he wanted an epic for sure but a <UNK> or dramatic epic the film sits <UNK> and <UNK> between styles and perhaps even genres at times it reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> or even <UNK> in its <UNK> pace and elegant scene painting at other times it threatens to turn into a <UNK> <UNK> more akin to 'the wild <UNK> in fact the latter film offers an <UNK> reference point for an <UNK> of as it shares the same period concern and employs a similar tone of <UNK> nostalgia for a darker yet more heroic america br br this <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> isn't helped by the poor quality script which often sounds forced and jarring to the ear the result is an <UNK> sense of period speech br br the near greatness of <UNK> gate <UNK> in its set pieces the roller <UNK> sequence in particular is <UNK> beautiful one of the most <UNK> scenes ever put to film br br another set piece which works very well in terms of <UNK> theme mood and setting occurs when kristofferson and <UNK> go riding in the new <UNK> to the lake and she <UNK> herself while he <UNK> in the <UNK> the <UNK> pacing <UNK> music and monumental scenery combine in this scene to convincingly portray the love story which might just lie at the heart of the film and which could have been its saving grace if pursued more convincingly br br some critics have complained about the length of the film this in itself doesn't bother me a good film can't be long enough the restored minutes are critical in <UNK> the motivation and characterization absent from the cut version and they are full of <UNK> interest br br perhaps the chief glory of <UNK> gate lies in the <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack the repeated <UNK> <UNK> and its different throughout full band guitar solo <UNK> etc lends a haunting quality to the <UNK> action and <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> lacking in the narrative itself br br despite its obvious flaws most notably the absence of a compelling narrative there is a sense of <UNK> about the film one leaves the cinema with a <UNK> sense of missed greatness and a wish that <UNK> could <UNK> the film with the wisdom of time and <UNK> to put right what is so badly <UNK>
<START> breathtaking at it's best intriguing at it's worst francis ford groundbreaking epic <UNK> <UNK> is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century and in my opinion the greatest ever film depiction centered around america's involvement in vietnam br br what i like most about <UNK> <UNK> is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre growing up as movie buff and with a particular interest in war films i've seen many films which have attempted to portray the and <UNK> of vietnam but have been <UNK> in doing so films such as <UNK> and <UNK> were <UNK> fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of vietnam by depicting which are more often than not <UNK> by the <UNK> of hollywood film production br br in <UNK> <UNK> there are no battles no heroes or villains there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of vietnam through the physical aspects of war rather it is a film which <UNK> <UNK> and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute <UNK> of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century br br the sheer brilliance of the acting in particular the interpretation of <UNK> captain <UNK> by martin sheen along with the spectacular cinematography filmed in the <UNK> which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film makes <UNK> <UNK> an unforgettable epic br br <UNK> a <UNK> of emotions and leaving us with a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is not for the light hearted <UNK> it is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated
<START> i'm glad i never watched this show when it came out br br i just wondered why it lasted 4 years it reminds me of the terrible 80's with fake people fake clothes and fake music how did i ever survive growing up in this era br br the acting in the majority of episodes i have watched are forced this makes for very boring shows the plot lines are not very interesting as the old twilight zone shows the old show inspired the imagination and made one look forward to the next show br br stick with the old twilight zone shows and spare yourself the pain of watching garbage
<START> ego seems it's the only reason this movie was made this movie is so wrong in so many ways that it's below one's dignity to write much about it every character was only good at self praise and lead actors i use this term <UNK> as has the director <UNK> in the <UNK> of stone the little story if that fails on the basic aspects such as logic feeling and drama direction leaves much to be desired blatant flaws are all over the place character motives aren't defined <UNK> husbands are found overnight broken car windows <UNK> themselves among other things br br let's face it <UNK> can't act neither it seems can in her defense she's still a <UNK> child who looks older than she is thanks to <UNK> of make up raj overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible <UNK> <UNK> laughs a bit too much the actor who plays friend is the only natural br br a few questions do come to mind how can such a film cost <UNK> 500 000 000 where did the money go granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and <UNK> was paid an obscene <UNK> 15 000 000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs but the sheer stupidity of the film <UNK> the mind including 3 <UNK> auto <UNK> that show up and jump on a police car br br the good <UNK> shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his <UNK> voice and trademark let's give the devil his due <UNK> as usual gives good music br br the bad direction story singing is still hard to ignore br br the ugly dialogs and everything else br br final word painful in every sense of the word watch this movie only if you loved
<START> i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance i really hope norton did not do this he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie br br i found it entertaining it wasn't mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects but it was not a bad it was fun to watch but <UNK> definitely not a bad horrible movie br br 7 10
<START> when i first bought this movie i had my doubts about it even though the cast was pretty impressive but after seeing it i really do not regret spending the money in fact i'd love to spend it again and again and again on movies like this an absurd combination of humor drama thrill and the big questions this is exactly what makes it a great movie okay some might not enjoy what they see and some might even turn it off after a little while your loss it's got a wonderful way of dealing with the issues we've all been through in one way or the other and the characters you think you won't enjoy the company of throughout the movie turns out to be the ones you really come to love after a short while for anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor and living watch this movie i promise you you won't be disappointed
<START> i recently watched this movie because i'm a big kinski fan but oh my god don't get me wrong i love this guy but in this movie his whole acting is just simply a <UNK> to work but fortunately he isn't the only one to blame first of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a <UNK> looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit that's all all the dialogs and characters are so bad it's making you scream but maybe that's the fun of it all if you know the kinski biography it's obvious that kinski didn't care about those movies at all especially all his <UNK> western roles he just took the money and that was it again this whole movie is totally weird only for hardcore fans of the genre
<START> i was <UNK> into watching this by the many friendly reviews here boy are they way off mark to give this 9 to 10 points and call it one of the best movies of the is just <UNK> the big problem here is lack of pace and a paper thin plot it's like slapstick on <UNK> everything <UNK> along predictably and <UNK> the plot is weak to begin with two garbage men <UNK> on their <UNK> <UNK> witness a murder and unravel a waste <UNK> conspiracy and the movie never manages to go much further there are some amusing situations and decent acting but that's not anywhere near enough to save this <UNK> of a movie br br it's simply a comedy that doesn't get its fat ass off the ground so why waste your time
<START> this film is right up there with the oscar and moment by moment as one of unintentionally funny films of all time br br it is worth the rental for a some wildly great br br the story is absolutely ludicrous nothing in life would happen like this it's so completely unbelievable the way james woods tries and <UNK> heavy <UNK> than they give this supposed two bit hustler a job 3000 miles away in la what a joke br br i love the old beat <UNK> bug to <UNK> how low they've gotten in life because of all the br br sean young is as unbelievably bad as the i'll love you forever no matter what wife you'll ever see if it wasn't so funny you would throw up at how <UNK> sweet young tries to project herself and as bad acting as you'll ever see br br james wood overacts throughout the whole movie and he's so extremely funny and is way way over the top it's just not to be believed woods seems like a parody of a cocaine fiend off saturday night live but watching woods on is worth the price of the rental br br i love it when woods tells the guy who wants to give him some more that he doesn't do that stuff anymore right before that woods just did three giant lines of coke br br this is some very funny stuff br br the ending is so comical but right on par with the rest of the movie
<START> one of the most magnificent movies ever made the acting of charles later known as bronson is simply outstanding this is the crown on the career of director winner who himself was often <UNK> saying this was his masterpiece the plot has been copied many times but it's never been topped j moore the gun <UNK> many times claimed his <UNK> growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to and rightly so this is not just a movie this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate although this movie has never been fully appreciated in the usa it has found a huge following in europe and asia where the movie is regularly shown at film schools and it is still a popular hit in student cinemas all across europe all in all a true classic
<START> sometimes full moon makes entertaining movies this isn't one of them full moon is like a low key troma their movies aren't as violent or off the wall but they're usually just as devoid of talent the acting in this movie isn't terrible but the script is pretty bad and overall it's pretty boring and it doesn't even contain any nudity like many full moon movies to somewhat redeem it skip this one and go rent head of the family
<START> i gave it a seven only because the acting is good and of course by that i mean <UNK> the other two principals were decent but the characters themselves what on earth was so bad about the character <UNK> played james <UNK> i didn't see him behaving like the <UNK> emily watson accused him of being bill on the other hand was an <UNK> jerk who i was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise who was i kidding tom <UNK> isn't paul <UNK> after all so what on earth did emily <UNK> anne character see in him she herself admitted he was pretty much a piece of <UNK> in his treatment of her why would she even want to be in the same town as him to say nothing of the same room br br i noticed some other reviews one person said she cried at the end to witness <UNK> tragedy what tragedy what you mean losing an <UNK> who finds someone like bill amusing give us a break
<START> burt reynolds stars as an undercover cop who is after a crime boss rachel ward as the high price call girl he falls for burt does well in this role and i think he would've done well in more roles like this br br rachel ward is beautiful and sexy in her part good pacing and story but something is missing in the <UNK> on a scale of one to ten 7
<START> this movie is truly amazing over the years i have acquired a taste for japanese monster movies and am well aware that early examples of this genre can be poor however this one reaches a new low as it follows the adventures of johnny a young boy who controls a giant robot and his fight against the evil <UNK> gang who seem to have an endless supply of horrid giant monsters at their <UNK>
<START> <UNK> q is an original and isn't like those other bad disney film spoiler a boy named <UNK> moves to a new town and has trouble at school he is good basketball a girl in the 1950's died with her boyfriend when their car was crashed off a bridge <UNK> amy jo johnson from the power rangers pink ranger is helping <UNK> as a ghost to get a <UNK> along the way he must explain to his sister about her ghost and finally getting this <UNK> <UNK> returns to the bridge she died on and then she gets in the ghostly car of her boyfriend and they <UNK> up later as he misses her he finds a girl who looks just like her do you believe in reincarnation <UNK> q is a good movie to see now and then but they barely give because disney needs to fill everything up with stupid movies and shows i give it a br br 7 10
<START> i made a promise that if ever i posted a comment that was less than <UNK> then later felt different about it i would return and make known my change of heart so far this is the first time it's happened br br i'm really starting to enjoy hack something has clearly changed the <UNK> seem to be much stronger the plot may still be a tad surreal but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven i <UNK> this to fine acting br br not every show can come <UNK> out of the starting gate a winner some need time to pick up speed i'm glad i kept watching this program and i really hope it lasts
<START> based on the <UNK> leonard novel of the same name <UNK> suffers from a lack of focus direction and creativity  all elements which the original story likely had and negative test <UNK> forced severe edits including the complete of a character resulting in a film that feels almost nothing like a leonard story far too many characters <UNK> a storyline too simplistic and straightforward not a typical <UNK> of the author's work and the focus continually switches between two hit men who are difficult to like and a troubled couple who don't command our sympathy while the story itself provides precious few twists and turns sadly by the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery br br washed up hit man <UNK> the <UNK> mickey rourke follows a strict code during his missions that inadvertently <UNK> his latest assignment now on the run from his former <UNK> he <UNK> joins forces with inept <UNK> criminal <UNK> <UNK> joseph gordon <UNK> to gain some quick cash by <UNK> a wealthy <UNK> when struggling couple carmen and wayne diane lane and thomas jane are <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> plot they are forced into hiding as the crazed killers will stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses br br <UNK> proves that being based on an <UNK> leonard novel isn't grounds for immediate success or even a promising adaptation the characters situations and even <UNK> in the film are all tired and unoriginal and only very randomly hint at something more it's not that there wasn't potential especially when <UNK> black <UNK> calm and <UNK> assassin perfectly <UNK> a hit during the opening scene  purpose and principals are just continually abandoned as each minute <UNK> away the style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most intriguing visually the roles of bird and even wayne are fleshed out <UNK> giving immediate interest and depth to <UNK> that typically end in a creative <UNK> br br the pairing of the cold and <UNK> black bird with the irrational and explosive <UNK> is an <UNK> combination comparisons to <UNK> would be <UNK> too kind except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that kept them initially interesting as <UNK> starts picking up the more experienced killer's <UNK> bird <UNK> his grip on his own methods of murder regardless of what he sees in his <UNK> lighthearted <UNK> with donna rosario dawson it's hard to imagine that his final confrontation with <UNK> carmen would <UNK> a confession of his true nature and subsequent <UNK> that drastically affects his outcome likely or not this is unfortunate downfall  and little entertainment can be garnered from these characters who <UNK> lose their originality by continually <UNK> the <UNK> that once made them intriguing br br the twins
<START> this 3 hour epic seems much shorter explores the will to power and conquest and the <UNK> motives that <UNK> that quest by tracking two parallel lives the emperor whose desire to <UNK> the chinese <UNK> states has its basis in noble aims but <UNK> into violent <UNK> isolation and ultimate <UNK> and the assassin <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> killer who comes to recognize the <UNK> consequences of murder and finds a form of salvation as with all great art this can be understood on many levels the movie <UNK> for me images and ideas from homer <UNK> <UNK> shakespeare and <UNK> br br the story itself is true i checked it out at <UNK> com so this film will appeal to history buffs it's ironic that spent much of his last years in a <UNK> quest for <UNK> not shown on the screen but consistent with the plot br br the movie can also be viewed as an allegory of and the cultural revolution through the movie one can understand that the last 50 years of chinese history have had their <UNK> in the last 3000 br br fortunately for the audience these complex ideas are developed in a film that is rich in imagery action and <UNK> the battle scenes alone are worth the price of admission
<START> un <UNK> <UNK> cat in the brain is one of the <UNK> horror movies ever made there is a lot of blood and gore including chainsaw <UNK> bloody <UNK> and numerous <UNK> the film is also interesting as self parody of fulci but the gore and violence is the key element in it some of the gore fx were taken from own <UNK> movies alice lo and i <UNK> both 1988 plus gore fx taken from fulci <UNK> the snake house aka bloody psycho by massacre by <UNK> <UNK> non <UNK> della <UNK> by mario <UNK> non <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aka <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> all 1989 the scene where brett <UNK> beats the woman's face to pulp is from alice lo a film fulci had made for italian tv in 1988 the of the female corpse at the beginning is taken from the same film as is the head in the <UNK> and the guy that gets driven over and over again highly recommended especially if you like extreme cinema
<START> br br what more can you ask for a great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century two fine emotional performances by <UNK> and finney a realistic vision of war time london a great supporting cast this film takes you on an emotional <UNK> through humour sadness loss and <UNK> if you are in the theatre it is even more effective this is a true 10 on the rating scale
<START> and one of 'em are bad movies the title as it turns out refers to a killer of the human male variety not fish this is not the <UNK> directed <UNK> of <UNK> which did have the fish and is also known as <UNK> <UNK> a trio of <UNK> 2 men and a woman hook up with a local hunter <UNK> named somewhere in the amazon jungle unfortunately they are not familiar with the film resume of william smith who plays otherwise they would have known immediately he is the villain of the piece smith may have also refused to film the ending or cut out before they finished filming see end of this comment br br as mentioned elsewhere this <UNK> has a lot of filler lengthy shots of the local <UNK> birds and the central set piece a motorcycle race which goes on too long the reason this gets a second star from me is of course william smith who can't really save this <UNK> but once again proves why he was the <UNK> <UNK> guy 30 35 years ago if you needed a really nasty villain at his best smith could be really terrifying he's the type who enjoys killing possibly in sadistic fashion and you get that sense from the evil grin he usually puts on when a mood strikes him physically he's very <UNK> and you know the other 3 characters are pretty much doomed within the first half hour this was what smith brought to most of his roles it seems hopeless for the other characters against this monster unfortunately the movie continues to <UNK> things up to the very end as if a minute of footage was lost a confusing <UNK> climax
<START> nuts in may may be one of the worst films i have ever seen if ed wood was still alive this would be the type of movie he would be doing to say this movie is bad would be the understatement of the century but how bad is it really well here are two levels of bad i go by it's so bad it's good or it's so bad it's god awful this film falls into the latter section what little unintentional humor it has does not make up for the slow hard to understand boring majority of the film br br summary spoilers br br two middle aged <UNK> take a trip to the countryside for some r r and camping there they met ray soon to be jim i'll explain later who's <UNK> is next to our main couple throughout most of the movie the two leads go sight seeing on the beach at a rock <UNK> and other exciting locations in between these adventures they talk endlessly about the environment <UNK> <UNK> collecting the duty of a proper citizen and proper <UNK> all thing i want to see in a comedy they bore anyone who will listen to them the dialogue is not only bad but the pacing in some scenes is so slow i sometimes felt like off scenes would go on forever and just when it begins to build up and something is about to happen the scene ends half way through the movie i thought to myself nothing is going to happen in this thing it is truly a movie about nothing br br the characters are annoying and constantly repeat things at one part i felt the director was playing a cruel joke on his audience the scene i am referring to is the sing along scene in it our two brits play some of there music for us actually it was the same 4 four lines over and over and over and over the idea was to get ray to sing along with them but ray knew as well as us that they are the worst <UNK> known to man this scene was beyond tedious by the fifth time the song was played i started to question the <UNK> of a <UNK> god br br words can not describe the awfulness of this film the first thing that strikes you is the <UNK> british accents that most of the cast has remember the thick scottish accents in <UNK> times that by 10 br br towards the end our tree <UNK> incoherent couple get into a fight with some of <UNK> friends that have complete <UNK> for the rules of camping our hero becomes so <UNK> that a climatic battle ensues between our hero and the head <UNK> to settle their <UNK> the two men engage in a stick fight that's right a stick fight now this is where the humor starts i laughed so hard at the <UNK> of it all that i thought this may make up for the other 80 minutes after this battle our hero runs behind some <UNK> to cry his eyes out and the other man calls ray over by calling him jim for some unknown reason br br a stick fight a crying nature loving 40 year old and a character name change 3 4 into the movie ed wood would be proud br br though i was again forced to endure the last 10 minutes which to sum up ends with a long take of a pig why who the hell knows at one moment we see a pig <UNK> and the next the credits start to role over the screen one of the worst endings to a one of the worst films of all time
<START> the plot seemed to be interesting but this film is a great <UNK> bad actors a camera moving like in the hands of an amateur if there was c movies this would be a perfect example a plus for a nice dvd cover though and a great looking female actor
<START> boogie nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997 i could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it i'm in no rush to watch that overblown romance disaster epic titanic again the fact that boogie nights did not even receive a best picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrow minded the academy is only <UNK> the sweet <UNK> and robert <UNK> contact came close to being as great as boogie nights no other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as <UNK> pulp fiction until now paul thomas anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded just as tarantino gave john <UNK> career a kick p t anderson has given burt reynolds the kick that his career needs boogie nights will also undoubtedly make stars of don cheadle heather graham and john <UNK> overall a wonderful film the best since pulp fiction maybe even better
<START> a man in <UNK> lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey he <UNK> her up with a <UNK> and she teaches him how to <UNK> then they fly off in the spaceship leaving the monkey behind cringe inducing <UNK> aside this short film makes no sense i think that's the plot but i'm not sure by a long shot you can't tell that this is <UNK> at work despite his characteristic <UNK> good use of slow motion though can be found on the ny film series of experimental film videos no 18 i believe
<START> i for one was actually expecting this movie to be pretty good maybe my expectations were a bit to high but the fact is i love judd nelson in fact he is the only reason this movie is worth watching and really his role isn't all that great the main highlights of this film are raunchy sex scenes and boring dialog if those are the highlights i'm sure your getting a pretty good idea of what kind of film this is there is definitely a reason this was a made for television film only see this one if you have nothing better to do on a friday night or just like to waste money on video <UNK> save your time and rent the breakfast club
<START> what a total <UNK> of this was you've got to be kidding people any positive reviews of this movie are plants or <UNK> from the movie makers themselves disgusting movie not gross but just plain awful
<START> the entire movie an <UNK> adaptation of one of <UNK> <UNK> stories takes place on the night of january 6 <UNK> <UNK> most of the film takes place at an <UNK> party given by three <UNK> two sisters and their niece where a group of upper class <UNK> gather for an evening of music and dinner while there is very little plot per se the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about <UNK> in the early 20th century when the <UNK> for independence were just beginning the cast all talented irish stage actors with the exception of <UNK> huston are universally wonderful and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself the poignant final scene between ms huston and the amazing <UNK> <UNK> reveals much about the marriage of the characters there is <UNK> mixed with humor and insight and for those who like quiet thoughtful movies the dead is highly recommended my wife is from <UNK> we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every january <UNK> after many viewings it never fails to move me and each time i <UNK> something that i've missed before
<START> this proved to be a rare case of a made with british funding unfortunately the result is <UNK> except by its <UNK> <UNK> and borderline camp approach despite stars and director the former is led by a wooden franco <UNK> and an ultra hammy telly <UNK> as a couple of would be robbers if anyone is able to believe either actor  who generally <UNK> cool  as a duo of bumbling crooks he's more <UNK> than i am br br their goes awry ending in murder and <UNK> with cases of <UNK> instead of <UNK>  however the <UNK> criminals see an opening to their dilemma when they inadvertently the son of a british <UNK> a miscast lester who even gets to kick trigger happy <UNK> where it hurts at one point still they never actually <UNK> him and their sole intent is to cross the border into france <UNK> along with them is <UNK> girlfriend a wasted <UNK> soon enough though she's had enough and decides to run away while the others are sleeping the crazy <UNK> notices this and following the girl kills her in the meantime <UNK> and lester have <UNK> up  the former thinks his <UNK> may have double crossed him so he goes on the <UNK> with the boy in <UNK> after a brief spell at a rich old <UNK> country estate which features totally gratuitous rear <UNK> by both <UNK> and lester <UNK> catches up with them they continue their trek where the trio run into a family of german <UNK> the situation <UNK> to the point where <UNK> <UNK> them inside their trailer and <UNK> the lot into the river  though he's badly hurt in the process himself typically it all ends with the getting killed just as they're about to reach the border br br the film therefore contains most of the <UNK> typical elements  sleaze <UNK> violence chases the aftermath of the opening robbery when the <UNK> car causes havoc in the city's narrow back streets and even <UNK> a funeral <UNK> is downright <UNK> etc one mildly interesting aspect to it is that by the end lester himself is seen to have been definitely <UNK> marked by the experience  coming to feel excitement when an act of violence is committed
<START> had no idea what i was going to experience viewing this old film from 1940 however i always enjoy viewing <UNK> day katie who plays the role as a younger sister to jean <UNK> helen and also their mother <UNK> burke mrs julia thought i was going to be bored with the story of two sister's and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet up with robert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who has the reputation of being a millionaire playboy who has plenty of <UNK> and is a heavy <UNK> who parties all the time one night helen goes on a date with <UNK> and he proceeds to get bombed out of his mind and simply cannot drive his car it is at this point in the film when this becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this film which will definitely hold your attention right to the very end of the film
<START> it may be a little <UNK> now and it certainly can never have the impact it once had but this is still a thrilling reminder of what michael jackson could once do looking back on it now for the first time since its initial <UNK> i was struck not by the horror <UNK> quaint but fun and vincent price has never sounded so genuinely un <UNK> menacing than its <UNK> of the horror film allowing jackson behind genre and make up to give us a <UNK> revealing portrait of male sexuality br br because thriller isn't really about horror in the way horror isn't really about horror it is about that age old theme the sexual awakening of a young woman the film opens in a cinema with jackson's girlfriend uncomfortable with the imagery and the <UNK> <UNK> response of course she is on a date and she is less scared by the film than what she knows will be expected by her boyfriend br br the mainstream imagery of the film they watch the group atmosphere all suggest the socially <UNK> expectations this leads her not only to think of the body in disgust hence all the <UNK> <UNK> the loss of her virginity is seen as a kind of death but the sexual <UNK> is not just about her boyfriend but her peers her society hence its as a gang <UNK> br br this is brilliant disturbing stuff the best thing director <UNK> has ever done jackson the most popular artist on the planet was still willing to show that the fixed image of a star contained <UNK> not all of them <UNK> the song itself has held up remarkably well the creepy <UNK> bass <UNK> the extraordinarily <UNK> lyrics the beautiful 70s disco ecstasy <UNK> the chorus shattering <UNK> revealing the <UNK> desire behind the fear
<START> possible spoilers ahead br br i'll only say what hasn't already been said here and i'll continue this for the rest of my <UNK> wwe comments br br if you're going to have a women's title match at least make it interesting rather than just a <UNK> to put over the current champion i guess <UNK> couldn't handle an intense match but they wanted to have the legend in a <UNK> br br i thought the killer <UNK> were wasted in <UNK> especially here i became a fan in 1989 about a year after the b brian blair was gone and jim <UNK> became a <UNK> back so i didn't realize for a while that they were a top tag team even top <UNK> br br but i loved seeing bill in the battle royal he really came into his own here creating a cocky <UNK> character in a pre match interview and even making an <UNK> in the battle royal besides steve <UNK> and kevin greene he is the only professional <UNK> from my generation with any respect for wrestling anyone remember dennis <UNK> and what was with the hart ridiculous green <UNK>
<START> this short was in part four of the short cinema <UNK> a film i rented from netflix but which appears to have originally been a <UNK> film series for people who like mediocre modern short films and love to have the dvd chock full of commercials i have so far tried two of the dvds and felt <UNK> at the horrible way that a viewer needs to <UNK> the <UNK> in order to see the films talk about an over produced and overly complicated way of doing this while i have and will continue to see as many shorts as i can i really doubt if i'll bother with the <UNK> because of these factors br br now it could be that because i disliked the <UNK> so much that i was not <UNK> <UNK> towards this portuguese animated short this is definitely possible however even if this is the case i feel that the other reviews were way too positive about this simple little film some of the artwork was indeed nice i liked how the simple black and white drawings suddenly became 3 d <UNK> as the camera went from a dull distant shot and <UNK> into the city below this was lovely and took some work but as for the story about a cat who wants to go to the moon it just did nothing for me br br important update i saw this film again on a dvd entitled cartoon noir on 5 <UNK> it was a pretty unappealing collection of art films however this time i saw the story of the cat and the moon with an entirely different audio track and boy did it make a difference instead of portuguese with subtitles it had a french <UNK> narrator who spoke english in a film noir style while i usually hate dubbing this time it really made the film the narration of the portuguese version leaves a lot to be desired if you don't know the language or understand the subtleties unless you speak the language try looking for the other version provided you understand english
<START> i think it's the sort of film you either love or hate and i'm really not the type to go in for arty movies my mother rented dr the other night and i nearly ran from the room ha but i love this film br br we recorded the beat one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great film that way by accident saved that tape and watched it a lot i eventually got the vhs to add to my collection i've watched it many times and at one point copied down the <UNK> i even tried to <UNK> one scene for my high school drama class she had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words she refused to let me do it if it could upset my drama teacher that much it has to be good honest she never treated me the same after that br br i liked the acting it came off very true and honest it wasn't clean and polished but it was better than that it was true to life how anyone would truly behave and display emotions not how hollywood does it was great acting especially by the one playing rex br br the story was original not only do the characters get drawn into his world but you do too not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all simply caring and friendship make things a bit better br br the only thing is that even in the 80's there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing but that little bit of innocence didn't hurt this film br br i think it's a must see you will either love or hate it but either way it makes an impact and that makes a good film that you will remember and talk about later
<START> i think a person would be well advised to read or see i favour reading <UNK> night before seeing or re seeing she's the man the movie is good on its' own but comparing the two and looking for the in jokes makes it a lot more fun shakespeare was inspired by others i think he'd give a thumbs up br br bloom said in shakespeare the invention of the human that most of the people in <UNK> night need to be locked up the person malcolm is based on is for no good reason people in she's the man are sane in contrast for instance duke is far more than the duke of he also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay he displays a lot of self control br br it's a teen comedy a clean one so it doesn't have the dark edges of the play for instance olivia in the play is mourning the death of her brother in the movie she has been dumped br br if you like sir andrew and sir toby in the play they don't have the same attention in the movie br br the in jokes are quite often quick the <UNK> last name is given once it is antonio lots of people who've read the play say that antonio has more love for a man than is just friendship deep love between men was noted in those days some see a sexual side to it homosexuality was illegal br br the only line from the play i caught is where duke quotes the coach on greatness during the game in the play it is said by <UNK> maria
<START> once a year in america saturday morning would give way to new cartoons usually sometime in america just about the time school started br br i guess this was to make not having school on <UNK> that more bearable br br one friday night before the premiere of the new saturday morning cartoons a movie came on br br at the <UNK> core i had not a clue who cushing nor <UNK> were clearly they were not from the same country so i couldn't grasp why they were traveling together br br i do recall seeing the <UNK> in the fire breathing <UNK> mouth br br what <UNK> this movie for me is the opening with the <UNK> metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factory br br how do you end a movie like this the music again and two cops as the <UNK> appears behind them br br whatever reason i remember watching this movie more that friday night than i do any new cartoon that came on the following morning br br that was definitely the late seventies br br it would be during jurassic park <UNK> <UNK> i believe before i would see this movie again br br yes people in costumes there was the fire <UNK> again br br still loved the ending with the two cops br br finally it would be nearly another decade before i would send off for the movie on dvd br br now i would just watch the beginning and intro br br oh i do love much of the movie of all these sci fi jules <UNK> <UNK> wells <UNK> movies this one stands as my <UNK> br br what i note now is that one of the cops begins turning around a wee bit too soon then turns back then he and the other cop are <UNK> as they turn <UNK> once again to look behind themselves at the <UNK> br br perhaps for me this movie stands as the best of the saturday morning shows which is why i enjoy it so much
<START> i got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for <UNK> with clips from it so i watched the movie and it is indeed <UNK> beautiful a masterpiece of animation br br unfortunately the story doesn't keep up it starts out well with interesting <UNK> about people <UNK> for the possession of the rose bride but suddenly <UNK> fill up with water and <UNK> their walls people <UNK> away and finally for no reason whatsoever is into a car and a chase ensues br br i like much anime for it's ability to make alternative <UNK> but this universe is just stupid if you are gonna watch this movie turn of the sound it's better that way
<START> if folks were really this stupid i could be the supreme <UNK> of the world in this one <UNK> plays a <UNK> bean counter for some little jerk water town run by a group of crooked <UNK> only slightly <UNK> than he is when things appear a bit shaky for the crooks they go for a frame up of the <UNK> <UNK> plenty of laughs as <UNK> does his usual bumbling stumbling act i especially appreciated the <UNK> <UNK> scene <UNK> at it's highest level
<START> this movie dr <UNK> as the best horror movie i've ever seen the plot was great the plot twists were even better and the cast was great it's hard to believe that they <UNK> the most unknown people 8 years ago and they would be big names today br br the plot is simple 4 teenagers wreck their car in the middle of nowhere they stumble on this <UNK> and do what everybody who is in an accident should do build a fire and tell scary stories br br 1 the hook great opener anyone who is in high school has heard variations of this story on prom night but they do it real good in this movie br br 2 the honeymoon ok this was not the best of the 4 it was pretty good and you get to see some <UNK> on the word some it's just your basic creature in the woods story br br 3 people can <UNK> too this is a <UNK> tale of what happens in internet chat rooms all across the country this segment alone should be required viewing for parents whose children have access to the internet br br 4 the now this is the best story in the whole movie a guy on a motorcycle breaks down and goes to this mute girl's house very good plot twist br br the main plot the <UNK> has the biggest and best twist in the whole movie i won't tell what it is cause i don't want to ruin it i was never this shocked during a movie in my life br br plot a br br acting a br br writing a br br directing a br br music a br br overall a br br i recommend it to anyone over 13 with the exception of people can <UNK> too any parent who's child has access to the internet needs to watch this one with their child
<START> i am not a fan of sean penn but in contrast to my german colleague whose review appears here i think he was perfectly cast as the neurotic <UNK> character in this film he has every nuance <UNK> and reminded me of several <UNK> who had similar tastes in <UNK> chemistry i saw this film but once 10 15 years ago and this is the only part of the film that was <UNK> <UNK> on my mind i don't say it very often but in this case i will bravo sean penn as for the story line well it's based on fact and as such it is a tragedy that people would sell their country's secrets to the then enemy again penn has shown what you can do if you disagree with the administration use the <UNK> you have paid for in blood don't break the law
<START> of course how could he he obviously co <UNK> several aspects from that excellent movie which was also based on the sensational french case of the self described doctor in the world health organization who murdered his family and himself when finally <UNK> as a fraud <UNK> refers to his son as monster he sings to the radio in his car he hangs out on park <UNK> and he <UNK> in investment schemes to <UNK> his family and friends all of this and more directly lifted from time out which came out the year before <UNK> life it's too bad because this movie is pretty good on its own with good acting and writing whereas vincent from time out is a much more subtle character who seems to have a sense of <UNK> even though at times it gets twisted into <UNK> the protagonist here seems devoid of any character at all save for his winning looks and charm seriously the part where he used x <UNK> that show his mother in <UNK> cancer to <UNK> more money from his father then <UNK> a subtle twist on the same <UNK> to avoid <UNK> from his fancy home for failing to pay the <UNK> on time it's almost too much the guy has no shame whatsoever in fact he's more like the lead in <UNK> than some poor <UNK> who gets fired and is so <UNK> that he can't face the disappointment of his family and friends and feels forced to <UNK> a shiny new life for himself as vincent did in time out thus one could feel the tension <UNK> in <UNK> life and the violent conclusion coming one thing <UNK> life has that time out definitely lacked was a love interest apart from the <UNK> <UNK> wife it's not hard to understand how the sexy babysitter was able to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to the degree that he ignored the danger of her natural curiosity and allowed it to lay bare his less than carefully constructed con given the <UNK> mentioned this is a pretty good movie that we found entertaining if you long for something touching on similar elements that goes a might deeper and is more intellectually and <UNK> satisfying i strongly suggest time out
<START> 2 3 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies a fact that's sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasn't seen the original movies and somehow it feels like a rip off even though i haven't seen the stuff before it's like that episode of every tv show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes i've seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so this movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences so you could <UNK> a case that it's one of the biggest rip offs ever <UNK> on the motion picture public br br i got to see it in the theater in a <UNK> print which is good enough i suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days i give the movie some credit for semi convincing gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor but that's about it the aztec mummy monster looks good even has some <UNK> in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period but the robot is pitiful although it's interesting that they made the human face totally visible it's a robot human or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie i think that's considered an <UNK> so technically in hard sci fi terms this movie should be called <UNK> vs the aztec mummy but i doubt anyone was too worried about <UNK> here anymore than they were worried about quality in fact the movie is so <UNK> put together that it makes television look good even the dubbing from mexican into english is lazy and weak for example at one point the hero says i might as well begin at the beginning what the heck kind of translation is that couldn't they at least have him say start at the beginning so that it doesn't sound repetitive a high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie it's the epitome of <UNK> film making just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesn't need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film they put no more effort into making it than they had to and considering the extensive recycled footage i would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this movie br br i will now <UNK> <UNK> about it on the principle that i don't want to <UNK> more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually <UNK> while making it
<START> pauline <UNK> gave this movie a good review but it is terrible it is very outdated the humour is silly and the music is <UNK> in fact it is so silly it is almost embarrassing it might have been some fun in 1938 but i can not imagine anyone enjoying it in 2003
<START> this 1955 <UNK> showcase version of the musical peter pan with mary martin has the benefit of <UNK> most of the original broadway cast including kathleen nolan as wendy who was more natural an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color <UNK> play it's a shame that most people won't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production which doesn't even show up in the imdb <UNK> when you put peter pan into the search engine is superior to the color version most people have watched i <UNK> the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better <UNK> now when i put the 1960 color version on it looks <UNK> in comparison i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b w <UNK> showcase <UNK> version br br as an added plus the disc i got also showed the original commercials and opening <UNK> how far away the 1950's seem now such an innocent time compared to today i miss it
<START> one of the best romantic classic teen is a film which is all about <UNK> among equals your most soft emotion love this is a simple story of a middle class man who came into <UNK> by his poetic talent and charming personality he is attracted towards three women and vice versa one a hindi movie star the second a rich lady and the third who lives in his neighborhood br br the situation put him in confusion as he has to decide one of them as his life partner he asked for few days from all of them ultimately he goes to a and asked him who he loves most his confusion is no more and he came to know the lady living in his neighborhood who really cares for him and loves him is his true love played the lead character and has fully justified his contemporary romantic image
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has many quiet moments and fairly slow pacing unfortunately during the many thoughtful <UNK> the viewer is left to <UNK> about the recent scenes just watched and many questions surface and annoy br br for example why didn't the wheelchair guy <UNK> in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide came up around him there was no rescue seen or hinted at br br can it be true that japanese police are so inept and <UNK> at arrest <UNK> as to not first remove the ability to reach for a weapon these detective level japanese police seemed to have no experience dealing with a suspect br br why doesn't the right eye of the lead character blink having one eye <UNK> was distracting and it went unexplained br br what exactly was the lead character spending all his money on to have to borrow so much from <UNK> sharks he was not seen gambling being a non entry level government employee his wife must have had full health insurance br br what was the single man doing all by himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park what was his reason for being there br br how in the world could the gangsters find the lead character and his wife up in the far off nature <UNK> it made no sense br br and again how could the gangsters later find the lead character and his wife up in the remote <UNK> <UNK> resort there were absolutely no clues available for these gangsters to even know which country the lead character and his wife were in let alone the correct specific location at the correct specific time br br and a third same question how could the junior detectives know which few feet of the japanese coast line to find the lead character and his wife the japanese coast line must be vast were all of these characters supposed to have psychic powers br br two final questions the cute girl trying to fly a <UNK> on the beach where did she come from she seemed to have no <UNK> or companions with her and why in the world did she still keep attempting to fly what was left of her <UNK> after it was ripped in pieces this was weird unintentionally python <UNK> br br on the positive side i loved the background music it was dramatic and flowing and added much to this movie the photography imagery and art were pleasing to the eye br br one final point the wife was overly pleasing to the eye not once did she ever come close to looking like a dying sick person she looked very healthy if anything these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically sick the husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly gay man would treat a respected wife a love of friendship but not close <UNK> br br a mixed movie for sure
<START> i never intended to write a review of this movie actually i was just on the sight looking for the name of the star of the film and then i started reading reviews i guess i'll never learn this movie is horrible i'm not going to justify my comments with specific reasons because i really find it hard to believe that anyone with any taste actually likes this a guilty pleasure okay i guess but a film this bad that wasted talent so good caine and <UNK> is a reason for mourning not a pleasant <UNK> a low point for all involved except perhaps <UNK> who must sit up nights trying to figure out which bomb was the bomb that destroyed his career
<START> saw this used dvd cheap and got it for a chuckle i had recently also found the <UNK> on dvd and bought that one to <UNK> having seen it in the theatre as a pre teen and loving it at the time the problem now with going back to these american karate films is that i've since then seen so many hong kong and <UNK> action films in which the fight scenes are long fast and jaw dropping i'm thinking particularly of fights like jackie and benny the jet at the end of dragons forever or tony <UNK> <UNK> fight from the <UNK> the hollywood kung fu offerings are just not filmed right and even make someone of <UNK> skill such as chuck look awkward at times and what's worse than a fight going into slow motion then you know it looked crappy at normal speed so they <UNK> it down for effect it really highlights how ridiculous an <UNK> looks as they stand and just wait to get kicked in the chest br br poor chuck he just has no intensity in this film nor does he project any righteous menace compare that to his former co star bruce lee who had charm and attitude to burn when bruce would square off against some <UNK> s you could nearly see the air around him <UNK> with what was about to happen in <UNK> <UNK> chuck seemed to accidentally be kicking people with complete <UNK> when the judge comes to see him in jail and sentence him to death chuck is staring off with a sad look and i thought ok he's doing that <UNK> focus thing and is going to grab the judge by the throat and get out of this but he does nothing except look up with a <UNK> eyed stare terrible and while the dvd case gives you hope listing a run time of 1 hour 5 minutes it's actually 1 hour 25 minutes so there's 20 more minutes of viewing pain br br for great fight action go watch jackie chan in the first police story the fight in the shopping mall at the end is pure gold
<START> rent this i own the dvd got it for 9 99 a steal being so under rated sure there are better movies movies with fewer or no holes in the plot or action but i don't have that problem with this movie for me if a movie stays true to itself honest and <UNK> of its flaws and virtues obviously in the name of entertainment then it has <UNK> its purpose i got me to care because its makers cared the entire movie is preposterous from beginning to end but its makers took the whole <UNK> seriously and i did not feel manipulated into taking the movie seriously and that is so true because i want to take every movie seriously yet many oh so many let me down for all of its this movie is almost perfect and completely entertaining what a funny screenplay it also has become <UNK> relevant in light of the events on 9 11 in no way do i seek to <UNK> the loss but this movie <UNK> the of the <UNK> collapse before it happened in ways that we will never see had the movie been made after those events br br it's either gone for good or here to stay wouldn't you agree
<START> this was my first look at this short lived british tv horror series but i had seen a couple of hammer horror films horror of dracula captain <UNK> vampire hunter and thought highly enough of them to give this a look br br this first episode was a shocker not for the horror but for all the nudity was this regular tv in england in 1980 if so it showed a lot more skin than what we see in north america there were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts one scene where a guy put his hand on one and another scene with man a top of a woman <UNK> <UNK> hey i'm not complaining br br the story is a simple one a witch who had disappeared in the <UNK> century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man the latter jon <UNK> as david winter wasn't much of an actor but his wife wasn't bad and was a really beauty she was be <UNK> gee as mary the husband suspected her rightly so of having an affair and that plays a part in this story br br patricia quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch <UNK> <UNK> who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time <UNK> the couple until things go wrong at the end as a man i'd say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it this starts off slowly but once <UNK> starts stirring up things it gets very entertaining
<START> i really enjoyed fierce people i discovered the film by accident searching through my on demand movie lists trying to find something interesting to watch the film is mostly about class in america and it quickly grabs your attention the characters are smart and <UNK> and the story doesn't stick to the usual hollywood rules br br the main protagonist is <UNK> a <UNK> but <UNK> 15 year old who spends his summer with the <UNK> family donald sutherland plays the <UNK> <UNK> c <UNK> the seventh <UNK> man in america diane lane plays mother a friend of <UNK> who is also a <UNK> cocaine user and a slut the own a large estate and seems to live by their own rules at first they seem charming and sophisticated but the super rich are different they are used to getting their own way the film is enjoyable mainly because it has crisp intelligent dialog superb acting and a story which takes unexpected turns it is also an r rated movie so it's not entirely wholesome br br the cast is excellent anton <UNK> is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of <UNK> sutherland and diane lane have never been better chris evans is impressive as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stewart is good as the pretty grand daughter high quality movie
<START> what a self indulgent mess <UNK> <UNK> film is apparently <UNK> however it's impossible to find any <UNK> of emotional truth in this chaotic badly acted and woefully amateurish fiasco br br in a way you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous <UNK> manages to make a film about his own rise and fall from abused working class <UNK> to criminal english lord however the tone is either so self <UNK> or so arch that it's impossible to engage with either characters or plot the raw material is potentially great stuff however roy seems unable to <UNK> out the kind of tale that should grab you by the throat then move you to tears and it's a complete mystery why it was ever made to be screened as a <UNK> of images presumably because a single image would have been too tedious to watch br br it's also interesting to see so many otherwise good actors bill <UNK> diana quick lindsay <UNK> giving career worst performances
<START> i've seen <UNK> in person and nothing <UNK> to the video but the show is awesome the dancers are amazing the music is <UNK> and the overall performance is outstanding i've never seen anything like it i suggest that you see this show if you can
<START> but i laughed a lot br br i saw et les at a public screening during the world cup the sound was lousy it was too bright to see the screen properly but i still enjoyed myself immensely the names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor <UNK> all not very witty but in good tradition some very good jokes but also some that not everybody seemed to get br br the only thing i didn't like were the voices of and in the german version at least the voice actors are very well known around here which was the only reason they were casted really they don't fit the characters at all br br all in all a good way to spend some time and if it's free like in my case all the better and to have a couple of laughs 8 out of 10
<START> broadcast news opens with a series of brief vignettes that are a clever way of starting a story about tv anchors who have no clue as to what they're <UNK> about br br at a speech before a group of would be <UNK> all of whom are bored by her presentation most of them leave when the last one <UNK> the co host of the event says quietly to holly hunter i don't think there will be any q a subtle line in a brilliantly written low key comedy a farce about the show <UNK> aspect of tv <UNK> br br william hurt is the inept news anchor who finds himself working with holly hunter as the network anchorman hurt badly needs help in <UNK> <UNK> and holly refuses to take the bait at first he knows he's only capable of looking good but is not a reporter he proves to be a quick study as long as his <UNK> is working and he's getting all the straight info from executive producer hunter br br <UNK> other anchor friend albert brooks helps by feeding her information she passes on to hurt of course she becomes conflicted about her feelings for ace reporter brooks and equally strong attraction to the pretty boy anchorman hurt who's having his own <UNK> with a pretty staff member br br you have to wait until twenty minutes before the film ends to find out which man she'll end up with brooks tells her that hurt is the wrong one because he represents everything she's against in this unpredictable comedy there's no telling who hunter the neurotic heroine will end up with br br <UNK> holly hunter william hurt and albert brooks were all nominated for oscars brooks in supporting role as was the film itself and director writer james l brooks all in all seven well deserved oscar nominations br br the script doesn't <UNK> for a conventional happy ending and in this case that's the only flaw for the brilliant screenplay i felt cheated and somewhat let down by the <UNK> conclusion
<START> i saw this film in the theater when it first came out i'm sorry to say and it was one of only a few films i have ever wanted to walk out of early i didn't have a problem with the drug content and i could see how this <UNK> tale could have been powerful the problem was the film maker working with james woods and sean young drew two of the least lovable characters i have ever seen on film i hated this pair and couldn't have cared less if they sunk straight to the inevitable bottom their was not one surprise in this film every turn of events was so painfully obvious that i felt i could have written the script myself although i like to think i would have done a better job i subsequently heard nightmarish stories about the incidents on the set between sean young and james woods along the lines of some sort of stalking events it made me wonder if the terrible acting <UNK> out of some bad feelings and <UNK> anyway i refer to the boost as the worst film i've ever paid money to see
<START> its my favourite film because there's so much going on that you don't see at first and so many things that make you wonder did <UNK> mean that or is it in my head for instance is the judge meant to be god or some supreme being br br also irene <UNK> as in the double life of is outstanding there may be a few <UNK> <UNK> actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does br br also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to valentine be
<START> not too many people seem to know about this movie which is too bad because i think it's pretty good sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done i think the casting is good with likeable actors characters tom <UNK> does a good job at playing a baseball player go figure not too much of a stretch i suppose and ken from black rain plays the chief the coach of the japanese baseball team there isn't too much to complain about it's just a light easy going happy comedy and i recommend it
<START> late night on <UNK> was on my way to bed but curiosity <UNK> at a contemporary set irish film so i stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end i have to admit that the main attraction was the only english actress kelly <UNK> who is stunning to look at br br this is billed as a black comedy which is one of the hardest things to pull off it should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you don't know why you're laughing for me martin <UNK> after hours 1985 is the best example dead bodies is more black than comedy but the plot <UNK> along and <UNK> down towards further <UNK> i didn't spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so i was suitably surprised br br as a <UNK> of the irish film industry in 2003 it all seems rather worthy it doesn't look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back the script could've been a whole lot <UNK> but the acting was on the whole pretty good i'm glad i watched it flaws and all tho i don't think i <UNK> much about ireland today especially their <UNK> methods
<START> poorly done political <UNK> badly photographed acted and directed every single scene is including those very few that are shot during the daytime it doesn't matter what the location is at an important <UNK> in the white house no lights are on and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is <UNK> through a few windows the of china <UNK> an earth shattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense <UNK> that he should be <UNK> a bust of homer in a <UNK> painting honest it's as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness the slow motion deaths are by now obligatory in any ill thought out movie br br roy <UNK> and maria <UNK> <UNK> do well by their roles but <UNK> is rarely on screen the other performances are <UNK> there is a pretty oriental woman in a short tight <UNK> who <UNK> a gun and is right out of a bond movie who's accent suggests a childhood spent in <UNK> <UNK> and who should have remained the model she probably started out as whoever plays the surviving secret service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably picked for the part because he looked most like johnny <UNK> not because of any display of talent the chinese villains representing both <UNK> and <UNK> china <UNK> and grin as they <UNK> the heroes br br the script is pretty awful recycled from other better films there is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and practically everyone winds up <UNK> two thirds of the way through the ship explodes into the expected series of <UNK> then the movie <UNK> into two related parts part one another shootout this time in a <UNK> warehouse part two an exchange between the vice president now acting president and the <UNK> chinese premiere lifted out of both dr <UNK> and fail safe we <UNK> launch our <UNK> they launch theirs in <UNK> we cannot convince them that our launch was accidental even though we offer to help them destroy our own <UNK> there is even the george c scott walter matthau general who <UNK> that their can't match <UNK> so we should hit them with everything we've got more <UNK> br br the end comes none too soon
<START> a remake can be successful an adaptation can be successful it isn't relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation br br a good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie regardless br br <UNK> i am afraid was a very poor movie first of all just by making characters look dangerous or macho they don't bring in an aura about them br br what was so brilliant about amitabh character that we should have been in aura of his and what showed the of the character nothing br br this fact was said by a <UNK> and amitabh kept giving facial expressions now amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions but why should it mean any thing if there is no history or story to go with it br br there wasn't proper of the characters who worked under too just because a man had <UNK> why should we assume he is wise the flow of the movie was generally scenes from the godfather were created like the policeman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the older brother being killed by <UNK> like <UNK> was killed on <UNK> of pacino but too much was sought to be packed into the movie with too little story and depth to go with it that was indeed the problem br br if you try to pack 3 hours of intricate detail like a godfather in 2 hours and that too with few dialogues what you get is a highlights show from a <UNK> match never making the full impact watching a full match will make
<START> before seeing this film i suggest the viewer puts away any expectations that the victims of the crimes depicted will get equal treatment and consideration as the <UNK> there have been many films about crime victims this one is about the murderer br br dead man walking finds realism in simplicity of the story there are no crack lawyers coming to save william and no dramatic story twists the film does not attempt to put him in a good light he is guilty he is <UNK> is a racist and was responsible for <UNK> murders given all this we are asked to do something very difficult look at him as a human being despite his crimes in this way the film challenges the notion that the death penalty provides justice whether you are for or against the death penalty the film raises questions about whether the guilty can find redemption <UNK> in the justice system and the of the death penalty br br great performances by both susan sarandon and sean penn in particular the last moments of the film show the true depth of <UNK> ability
<START> irwin allen past master of cinematic schlock pulled out all the stops in voyage to the bottom of the sea a badly aged walter <UNK> who actually may have been dead when he played this role is the commander of an atomic submarine that must be the size of the empire state building every room is gigantic and some even appear to have no <UNK> you could bowl and hold a <UNK> ball simultaneously in some of these rooms the sub called the is on its maiden run when all hell breaks loose the van allen radiation belt catches fire and the must launch a missile into the belt by a certain time or the world will go down in global warming flames along for the ride are a bunch of truly terrible character actors many borrowed from tv this makes them tv hack the worst is probably that poor man's stella stevens barbara <UNK> as a naval secretary <UNK> into too tight clothes sporting high heels and acting like she's appearing in a beach party flick maybe that's because frankie <UNK> is also along for the ride a badly aged joan fontaine almost <UNK> here plays a visiting doctor with a big bad secret but in truth who cares voyage is a truly bad movie obviously made for small children but what child is going to sit still for endless shots of a <UNK> model moving over and over again from right to left across the screen in what is obviously a studio tank there is not one scene where we believe these folks are actually aboard a sub when the shakes the actors <UNK> themselves about sometimes in opposite directions to one another just like on the good old star trek tv series when the bridge shakes if i remember correctly not one fish or sea creature is seen except for an <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> onto the sub a nod to 20 000 <UNK> under the sea the <UNK> if it was real was probably about a foot long and it shows worse when folks are standing at the glass nose the ocean they are supposedly watching is obviously a <UNK> involving an unseen air <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> probably filmed in a fish tank you have never seen bigger <UNK> in your life you'd think these <UNK> alone would smash the damned sub to pieces sadly a badly aged peter lorre is also along for the ride near the end when the missile is entering the <UNK> belt lorre is seen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> while everyone else is still waiting for their cue to start shaking hands and <UNK> one another in victory a one take scene if i've ever seen one what a stinker it's not even good for a laugh stick with silent running
<START> dr <UNK> a swiss scientist is <UNK> out of his home country by sherlock holmes in order that the nazi agents <UNK> him do not get his invention of a new bomb sight arriving in london he takes <UNK> with holmes and watson but goes out for a visit with his girlfriend charlotte where he leaves a clue for holmes as to the locations of his bomb sight which he has divided into four pieces but <UNK> eternal nemesis professor <UNK> is also seeking the bomb sight to sell to the nazis and <UNK> dr and the clue left at <UNK> a code series of dancing men which both holmes and <UNK> are both unable to <UNK> completely holmes eventually discovers the clue to the code and get the location of the fourth piece of the bomb sight but <UNK> has the other three and a showdown is inevitable very good entry in the holmes series with plenty of mystery and <UNK> to go about <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> is more sadistic than the cunning sort described in the doyle stories or george performance in the adventures of sherlock holmes but <UNK> skills as an actor makes his <UNK> quite the <UNK> fellow the script and direction both make this entry more of a cat and mouse game between the two characters and that is one of the reasons this entry succeeds so well great job on the cinematography as well rating 8
<START> this isn't the video nasty night of the demon as there are more than one actually there is only one but it <UNK> br br after it <UNK> suzanne scream queen <UNK> <UNK> she passes it on to <UNK> girl angela <UNK> <UNK> through a nice long kiss br br next we see <UNK> showing us her in the bathroom she shows a lot more as jay lance <UNK> thinks he is in for some fun br br soon everything literally goes to hell as bodies drop one by one and are possessed judy cathy and max philip are the last two trying to escape max isn't much help leaving it to judy to figure a way out br br the makeup was absolutely fantastic and the only thing that kept this from being even better was the extremely long build up to the action br br the old man harold who appears in the beginning will be back and get his just <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> may be the scream queen but cathy definitely showed the greatest <UNK> in this film
<START> danny is beyond sorry br br he keeps making the same mistakes and is no longer interesting to watch at first i could feel for him as an addict myself my heart went out to him at the beginning and somewhere along the line he went over the line it is almost as if he is continuing this behavior to keep the show going and at the same time is seriously <UNK> his life and the <UNK> of his family especially his children it is difficult even to have pity for the poor boy i think he needs to watch this show maybe then he might have a chance a saving this marriage i can't understand how gretchen stays with him and i keep wondering how much is just for show and how much is love danny get a life a new one that is and don't get me started on dr gary what is with him and his face his skin looks like it's stretched to the max besides that looks don't mean a thing yet he seems not to be particularly <UNK> i think he too is keeping this going for his own <UNK> gain and often not in the best interests of either gretchen or danny these people are few confused and each remind me of a dog chasing its tail sad very sad c'mon pull yourselves together
<START> it's exactly what i expected from it relaxing humorous and entertaining the acting couple was awesome as well as the scene selection i personally recommend this it's kind of the movie that can be seen by whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or getting bored this cute movie will make you smile and laugh too and the action scenes are tasty classics of modern american comedy and very well done
<START> while the writing was terrible the acting was atrocious the only thing that saved this turd was the breast count but that wasn't enough to make me watch this again all said and done i'm actually dumber from watching this movie this was a new low for troma lloyd kaufman starting the movie wearing a garbage bag and making fart noises should have made me realize what i was getting into this was by far one of the worst ever put out by the troma team the best place to show this movie would be to <UNK> sense they can't get up to change the channel to conclude this is not a swift recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a dark and violent comic fantasy <UNK> so built on the <UNK> of the dirty dozen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> training sequences of the dirty dozen to <UNK> into the action right away in the process tarantino <UNK> one of the dirty major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the nazis were the nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film which ironically makes them even worse monsters br br <UNK> <UNK> the training sequences tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war showing us not only british american and german soldiers but also giving us glimpses into the world of french and german civilians both <UNK> and resistance br br it goes without saying that any tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue but when tarantino made the decision to have the french characters speak french and the germans speak german beyond adding a level of authenticity tarantino also somehow <UNK> that his dialogue in french was as sharp and funny and clever as his english dialogue br br case in point during the opening sequence the nazi jew hunter ss colonel hans <UNK> christian <UNK> is <UNK> french <UNK> farmer <UNK> denis <UNK> suspects that is hiding a family of jews while subtly <UNK> <UNK> asks for a glass of milk after <UNK> it down <UNK> <UNK> on his daughters and his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> et <UNK> je <UNK> bravo the thing of it is in french means cow but it is also a vulgar name for the <UNK> if <UNK> for this vulgar pun <UNK> could quite convincingly claim not to understand french well enough to have meant it that way but <UNK> does mean it that way and he means it as a threat and understands his meaning all too well br br that is a really subtle piece of acting and word play that many audiences would never catch or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat the film is rich with that kind of detail all of the french and english dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while i can't swear to the german i would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft br br <UNK> <UNK> opens with the phrase once upon a time in nazi occupied france personally this reminds me of the opening of every <UNK> book and movie another comic fantasy in a war torn occupied france like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> funny in places although the film also turns darkly serious br br in its more serious moments <UNK> <UNK> reminds us that the first <UNK> of war are compassion and the ability to relax as in almost every <UNK> sequence of the film tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels br br tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous even and that its power deserves respect br br if you can see this film as i did in a packed theatre filled with <UNK> fans who get every joke that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen if you are not that lucky all that you will see is a great great film that delivers a darkly funny punch
<START> this is just my all time favorite movie nothing special it's just so incredibly detailed makes me cry just thinking about it <UNK> bill is the <UNK> guy i can imagine money is not important <UNK> spears are important you don't need money to get what you need if you need something it will just come to you if people would realize that the world would be a much better place whatever you do don't do it for the money
<START> the film is really good it doesn't use violence or sex etc to sell itself like other films but instead just uses a really decent plot based on the original by michael caine and some great actors to make a fun action packed film which i thoroughly enjoyed one thing which made me enjoy this film even more was that it had some actors which i really like such as edward norton who i last saw in <UNK> hour which i enjoyed also jason <UNK> <UNK> enjoyed that also and seth green who i think is great his role as shawn <UNK> roommate dubbed the is hilarious and his <UNK> skills play a great part in the main heist which <UNK> around a large traffic jam in la the car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive i haven't seen the original so i can't really compare the too but i liked this a lot and would highly recommend this film to everyone it isn't a film where you need to like that specific genre it will suit everyone i felt good after this movie it had a really good ending and was overall really fun to watch i give it 8 10 go watch it
<START> the frustrating thing about a movie like this with a true potential for greatness is that it almost enjoys being heavy handed we speak of allegory of metaphor but the truth is there's no getting around the fact that there is absolutely no plot or real character br br at a certain point we most know who the people are even if we never understand where they are going the sheer <UNK> wore me down every time i tried to grasp a truth in this film br br call it beautiful great and awesome i just call it cheating all style and no substance sure it's a matter of taste but i would never take a confusing <UNK> <UNK> of symbols and <UNK> over the spiritual clarity of jean <UNK> or <UNK> but if it works for you i'm all for it art is a personal thing i guess
<START> there is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young girl <UNK> did it american beauty did it br br but they did it subtly they did not make it so apparent from the start that the director is <UNK> them up to make them fall in love with each other not as naturally as two people would age no bar but forcing them to be around each other as if they were supposed to fall in love br br all in all there should have been chemistry it would have solved the biggest problem people with <UNK> against the subject would also have been <UNK> and perhaps convinced it would have become the perfect love story no matter the br br i found it difficult to believe character at times what i found more difficult to understand is why <UNK> a photographer and an artist who seems serious would have had an interest in a girl so <UNK> unless he himself has some hidden in himself which did not come out at all br br there is a lot of use of dutch angles or angles in which the frame is <UNK> it is generally used to show something unnatural or something that might lead to something that is not right so <UNK> is himself calling the relationship unnatural br br the camera angles background score editing and even the <UNK> of shots and <UNK> and their relationship is the indian audience so dumb that we need to be told something in 10 different ways for us to understand especially when the two of them were dancing together it was apparent what was happening what was the need of <UNK> the scene down with dramatic background music i feel the subject was very well chosen but <UNK> should not have made the film with the fact in mind constantly that this is a controversial subject if it is then handle it <UNK> why don't you
<START> in black snake <UNK> writer director craig <UNK> is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like <UNK> the entire film as pretentious a <UNK> southern <UNK> with some oh so <UNK> subject matter the movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being <UNK> into the picture again this is integrated without subtlety after the darker opening scenes the film increasingly its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play and i'll admit the last 15 minutes go way too far into happy ending territory for my liking and that's not to mention the <UNK> footage of musician son house <UNK> on love and death and heavily <UNK> things to come of course yet in a strange way these are also qualities of black snake <UNK> the tale of aging <UNK> samuel l jackson recently dumped by his wife for his brother no less who comes across near death <UNK> <UNK> christina <UNK> easily giving the <UNK> portrayal of trailer trash on celluloid ever <UNK> the girl back to health he chains her to his <UNK> to overcome her demons and hopefully redeem his own fallen self while there is a definite <UNK> appeal in watching <UNK> fall out of her skimpy outfits her performance is <UNK> and mature not a trace of <UNK> <UNK> to be found and she easily holds her own with jackson who <UNK> the blues in his portrait of a flawed god <UNK> man while heavy handed the scene where <UNK> sings <UNK> a song in the midst of a lightning storm <UNK> is compelling as is a scene inside a jumping blues club that makes you wish you were there the setting is strong and a case can be made for the literal symbolism the chain the <UNK> the strange <UNK> man who <UNK> <UNK> being a deliberate <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> and it is the conviction with which this <UNK> is played that lends black snake <UNK> much of its strength the committed performances of jackson and <UNK> make this a film that goes from wrenching to uplifting with well <UNK> grace while justin <UNK> jealous lover is a plot <UNK> i could have done without neither he nor the <UNK> subtlety can keep this from being a <UNK> <UNK> film
<START> great actors good filming a potentially interesting plot and what should have been good dialog nothing else is good about this movie perhaps the writer or director thought they could make a thought provoking film out of annoying characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee br br within 10 minutes i disliked the portrayal of kim by <UNK> so much that it became a distraction while kim is supposed to be an unsympathetic character i am not sure i was supposed to want to commit acts of physical violence upon her the first of many bizarre things that happen is that wes david <UNK> goes from i am missing 50 00 to she stole 50 in about 3 seconds it was quite implausible since she kim never had access to his <UNK> nor was she a master <UNK> there simply was no rational reason to suspect her most people have lost misplaced money and assume just that we lost it same goes for kim later all very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be i think a look at real people the character of kim was at minimum suffering from a <UNK> disorder wes had huge <UNK> issues nancy was just boring and matt was <UNK> particularly about music i actually turned this off about 2 3 of the way through however to write a valid comment i forced myself to turn it back on hoping that something would come together in this movie no sorry it was still bad make it a point to miss this one
<START> as a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships too i cannot see the movie as a movie only as a movie is has some great wonderful shots of the ship most of them done on an existing <UNK> apart of the ones in the disaster scenes of course and a certain room under deck but regarding the story and dialogs i only can call it big crap nothing of that would happen like this on a real <UNK> <UNK> no wonder the film had bad impact on the existing ship if i didn't know better i wasn't tempted to do a <UNK> voyage for sure definitely for europeans i recommend to switch off once the ship ran after that the over emotional very american part begins which i couldn't bear the <UNK> are really really great no wonder in a <UNK> scott film but if you can avoid listening to the text it will become much better
<START> i think that mario van <UNK> movie <UNK> is a very important film it is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of this is a story of early black <UNK> cow boys and <UNK> returning from the spanish american war with a <UNK> of gold the main character <UNK> is haunted by memories of his murdered father the racism applied to the new black <UNK> and <UNK> is explored in this film with excellent casting including <UNK> van <UNK> father billy zane stephen baldwin and a wonderful performance by big daddy kane br br one senses that <UNK> <UNK> to use as many notable black and some not so notable smile actors as possible perhaps too many some notable persons <UNK> hayes pamela <UNK> are only scene in cameo others briefly such as tone <UNK> the sentiment and efforts of <UNK> efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some the large cast a feat for any director work well and do a good job of telling the story in the classic revenge and fight vs justice western br br most noteworthy was the wonderful narrative role of veteran actor woody <UNK> from once upon a time in the west who's own life was a <UNK> <UNK> within the context of a previous era not yet completed faded from memory no other actor could have done this role better read the mini bio on woody <UNK> here as a <UNK> http imdb com name bio br br the film does a good job of <UNK> action with a bit of <UNK> humour the dialog was excellent if a bit contemporary and as others have mentioned the profanity was not accurate to that period the sex scene was a bit much not really needed there are some historical inaccuracies such as the seeming electronic <UNK> of the cattle etc but <UNK> is a good effort to hopefully open the door for more historical and creative works <UNK> of other <UNK> stories and events the actual photos of real <UNK> at the end credits was very nice touch
<START> as is the case with many films of this <UNK> my non <UNK> got in the way of my understanding it the church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries we have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value then throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them working under these rules and attempting to <UNK> them and you have this book and movie i found myself thinking that's pretty cool why did they do that there's this casual thing in the robert <UNK> character where no matter what the issue he seems to always make the right first move i suppose it's like watching <UNK> where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days they know the lay of the land in this film there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on but if you create robert <UNK> you need to set him to work that's ok because heroic <UNK> like him have been saving the day forever i thought the film was fun i thought the da <UNK> code was fun too interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think this is a marvel to look at and never stops for a second
<START> once in a while it is good to see a really bad film like this just so you know how decent an actor keanu reeves is by comparison the premise of this story is good teenagers go out on a boat meteor lands in water aliens kill teenagers what's not to love about that if you're into scream thrillers but i should have known something was up when i read it was only 75 minutes long i thought i hate judging movies by how long they are who says a movie has to be 90 minutes but once i took the dvd home from i was shocked at the awful production quality acting directing of this completely amateurish piece of garbage the only reason i watched it to the end was because i don't have cable tv and i already paid four bucks for it however there was one ray of light the actor who played chris is actually decent and far <UNK> this dreck first of all the special effects were cheap and unconvincing then the aliens the costumes seemed interesting rubber suits but since most of the film takes place in the dark you don't really get to see them and hardly any of the actors were convincing enough to suspend disbelief finally i must say that the dvd jacket was made with much higher production standards than the film itself which felt like a rip off so beware of that when you rent other dvds save your 4 and buy a <UNK> of beer
<START> i'm impressed that the <UNK> was made at all released just one year after american women got the vote this turgid drama makes an earnest <UNK> against the sexual double standard which judges women's sexual behaviour more <UNK> than men's br br slight spoilers ahead a prologue set in the <UNK> colony in shows a <UNK> girl sentenced to the <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> with a boy the boy is not now we come to <UNK> hill new <UNK> in the present <UNK> oliver <UNK> theodore roberts is a <UNK> bible <UNK> what we call in britain and australia 'a god <UNK> is determined that his son david lloyd hughes become a preacher regardless of how david feels about it as for <UNK> daughter <UNK> well <UNK> is confident that women aren't important enough to be anything more than wives and mothers apparently god told him this personally br br david's <UNK> career is <UNK> when he <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the local odd jobs man <UNK> <UNK> character is identified in the credits solely as the jobs man' but a close up of a <UNK> reveals his name to be jake <UNK> the prejudices of <UNK> require that he be merely <UNK> not her <UNK> parent to save his son from scandal <UNK> buys off <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> goes off to the big city to melt into oblivion as one more <UNK> mother br br <UNK> is naturally <UNK> by the limitations <UNK> upon her by her gender or rather by other people's <UNK> of it she meets gray excellent performance by edward an author who encourages her to <UNK> sexist stereotypes but <UNK> is <UNK> engaged to local <UNK> joe <UNK> who won't put up with such nonsense <UNK> is played by <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> performer now remembered solely for comedy roles as a second banana to harry <UNK> and as a villain in three stooges movies he gives an excellent performance here in a role outside his usual range sadly in real life <UNK> spent his final years in poverty and total <UNK> due to <UNK> br br eventually <UNK> ends up working at an <UNK> this being <UNK> i expected the <UNK> to be whites only so i was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to include one chinese boy and <UNK> surprised when he's used as the butt for a racial joke the movie makes one odd error here in a christmas sequence we see the <UNK> mistress <UNK> 'a visit from saint but in a dialogue title she credits santa claus with six <UNK> rather than eight this is followed by a brief animation sequence showing santa with six <UNK> <UNK> to his <UNK> i assume that the animators either by accident or to save money left out two <UNK> and the title card <UNK> the poem to match the error br br lloyd hughes was generally a bland and unimpressive actor his most famous performance is his role in 'the lost <UNK> where he's easily <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> for his climactic scene in the <UNK> hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his father's <UNK> in his performance as the <UNK> shouting father theodore roberts has been accused of overacting to the point of making his role a caricature i disagree sadly decades after this film was made i continue to encounter fools exactly like this man willing to destroy the lives of everyone around them and firmly convinced they have god's authority to do so br br in the central role of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gives a sensitive realistic and intelligent performance i normally dislike <UNK> who tended to be cast in <UNK> roles but wasn't pretty enough to justify them here her character's physical appearance is less relevant than usual br br this entire film is <UNK> directed by john griffith <UNK> a director who deserves to be much better known sadly <UNK> died at the <UNK> of the <UNK> era in his mid thirties had he lived another ten years he would surely have <UNK> several early sound classics in the <UNK> there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions i was especially impressed by a scene in the new england forest when <UNK> and <UNK> have a <UNK> in front of an enormous <UNK> tree i wonder where this was actually filmed the <UNK> deals with unpleasant subject matter but it deserves to be much better known and i'll rate this ambitious drama 9 out of 10
<START> firstly this is not an adaptation of a stephen king book short story <UNK> or anything else from web site and their review on the show when it first aired he never writes down to his audience and he never betrays contempt for his subjects his first original work for television stephen king's cbs july 16 9 11 p m is no exception br br the series was apparently going to be as others have mentioned an ongoing series which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on but this was never quite made clear to the viewers who were left wondering how it all ends br br when the series came out on <UNK> it <UNK> itself as having the never before seen ending it should have said the should never be seen ending br br spoiler br br the very ending was the only significant part changed for the video though parts of the whole were left out and that changed ending was what destroyed the story for example rather than our two <UNK> fbi agents realizing that they were now labeled as bad guys and on the run from the evil jude anderson of the shop as originally broadcast jude simply walks up to them and they shoot him bang dead and no real emotion to speak of in the scene <UNK> on the bit with <UNK> and his wife going <UNK> whereas the original ending left us with a spectacular cliff <UNK> on the video they simply get out of the <UNK> a car br br end spoiler br br it was a sad ending to a rather well made mini series and makes the video completely not worth buying or even renting sincerely save your money and your time
<START> i first saw this movie on <UNK> which is a great network by the way to see underground films i watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesn't hold water but it really was a worth while watch the main character is in such rough shape and you hate to see him deny help but no matter what you just can't hate him his devotion to the beatles and john lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the <UNK> he feels br br the atmosphere of the film is also great at times you feel like you can see what he sees feel what he feels in some situations this movie does not leave you wanting to know more or <UNK> a <UNK> in the plot there are no <UNK> in my opinion i have always been a fan of foreign films especially now with movies being made so poorly in america i really enjoy the foreign settings because i feel it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand a different culture this movie did all those things to me and more please watch this movie and if you're new to foreign films this is a great start
<START> bad bad movie so bad it is worth watching as long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and you'll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie it's worth it the special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny if your sister is about to be eaten by a giant <UNK> dragon wouldn't you do a little something to try and save her if she did get eaten wouldn't you fall on your knees crying your heart out this guy just sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair how anti climatic is that maybe he was supposed to be in shock or something he does join his sister in the belly oh didn't mean to spoil it for you
<START> this has some of the stupidest fight scenes of all time if i was a veteran of any war i would cry when i see this movie not because i would remember being in vietnam but because it is a poor representation of any veteran of that war even though the troops are carrying that movie resembles nothing like vietnam the <UNK> <UNK> even uniforms look like old <UNK> japanese uniforms from a wwii movie the setting is obviously some crappy hollywood back lot the worst scene contains a us soldier fighting hand to hand like in a bad martial arts movie after he <UNK> several enemy troops he says hey come down here and lets kick some butt to a helicopter in the air he then is shot this movie is trash
<START> a well written screenplay a moving story showing the middle class english at it's best some great acting by tom <UNK> and emily watson tom <UNK> is one of <UNK> best actors he knows how to be subtle and honest emily watson is an actress i was not familiar with but to her credit she does a great job of playing the wife the director julian <UNK> did not <UNK> to the typical hollywood gimmicks to give the film some <UNK> storyline it has not over <UNK> it's portrayal of the english middle class the films pace does not <UNK> although it is not a faced paced film a good twist in the plot that is not predictable a lovely english country village setting i enjoyed this film very much the locations were also very well selected if you enjoy films about relationships this is one to watch better to have some <UNK> ready
<START> not just because of that theme in the movie which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot no br br i watched this knowing i would not like it i hate <UNK> whenever someone starts going off about <UNK> with numbers i feel the urge to slap them my own brain starts hurting out of empathy and fully aware this is a movie just about that topic i couldn't resist the urge to watch it and maybe get a good laugh but it wasn't funny just exactly the dumb sort of isn't this totally scary and yet amazingly cool i can turn any crap into 23 dialog i was afraid of as soon as the son started to <UNK> in i knew this movie is a turd no matter what happens but i hardly ever stop watching a movie i started i sat through it i enjoy the pain br br the movie pretends to mock <UNK> under the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly but it rides that wave as much as it's supposed to crush it i don't see that message i only see characters raving about a stupid number with little plot to justify br br top that off with the usual surprises trying to put another twist to throw you off that makes no sense and you almost believe it due to the quality of the narration up to there and you get one hollow piece of movie making that just happens to be centered around the topic i despise if only it did not try to be serious and rather had been some hilarious movie with actors i don't give a damn about but i was starting to like carrey while it's not his fault he is trying it's not even good for watching with a bunch of friends and mst3k the hell out of it br br my expectations were low enough for someone to trip on them but this movie managed to live up to be one of the worst i've ever seen
<START> i hope this isn't a <UNK> of things to come high definition <UNK> are getting cheaper all the time although i wouldn't swear that's what was used here so it's open season for all the wannabe and br br there is no hiding the <UNK> of this stinker and calling it a <UNK> would be doing the industry a big <UNK> the photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the <UNK> i could build me a new house with all the wooden acting what's remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst they are all equally terrible like a whole bunch of ben or steven <UNK> br br what hooked me was the title i'm a sucker for this sort of thing like <UNK> or <UNK> was pretty bad too but at least i got some laughs out of it and the acting was merely bad not awful i can't comment on as i've yet to get hold of a copy of it br br anyway i hope the people who made this didn't make any money from it else they might be encouraged to try it on again please guys <UNK> the camcorder and go back to your regular job
<START> a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond where the only place in the <UNK> is a museum full of wax <UNK> and the only form of help is <UNK> local mr chuck <UNK> as night falls the kids get picked off in record time br br an odd freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of all too <UNK> <UNK> making this a good update of the bodies in the wax museum genre this is an intense shock fest along the lines of the texas chain saw massacre it should then come as no surprise that art director robert a burns repeats that duty here and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy <UNK> score is downright chilling accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von <UNK> it the film in oppressive atmosphere br br plot twists <UNK> in level of success there was one that i saw coming a mile away and one that actually took me by surprise and i was all the more happier for it one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front as the first <UNK> victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own <UNK> the <UNK> is a great <UNK> by <UNK> with blood dripping out of the end br br star <UNK> offers an engaging performance as our down home good ol' boy antagonist while the younger co stars predictably can't perform at the same level although <UNK> jones is a likable enough and certainly <UNK> lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damsel in distress co star <UNK> roberts a brunette in this film is okay in support if i had one problem with this film it's just that the victims are a little too stupid then again that doesn't make this much different from many horror films of the 80's future notable names among the credits are future directors ted who was the editor here ron <UNK> who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with tremors as the assistant director and veteran makeup artist <UNK> <UNK> who's done many films and won three oscars since br br although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements this is otherwise a nice little surprise that <UNK> director david <UNK> delivers with conviction and gusto recommended br br 8 10
<START> the costumes are outrageous and the australian <UNK> scenery is fun to view but there is an edge to this story a mean edge about drag queens i particularly noticed that in <UNK> <UNK> character ralph <UNK> <UNK> perhaps that was appropriate since there is nothing good guy like about ralph <UNK> and his group of queens br br once again we get the strong liberal <UNK> which says anything goes and if you're not with it or in this case pro homosexual then you are a gasp br br what's really disturbing is the ending when a young boy goes off with his alternative lifestyle father and <UNK> his gay lifestyle not because it fit the story but because it fit the agenda of the people who wrote the script pitiful
<START> this is one of l <UNK> shorts most frequently <UNK> as the first real l h <UNK> and perhaps one of their best silent features j ollie is a millionaire who has come to the <UNK> to <UNK> his nephew philip whom he's never seen at first ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical <UNK> but is quite <UNK> when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be <UNK> he has been told that philip is a good boy but he has one weakness women and philip set off to go home but their journey there is continually interrupted by philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman then chasing after the woman huge crowds gather each time this happens not so much because he's chasing <UNK> but because philip himself is also wearing a <UNK> a <UNK> finally manages to drag philip into a shop to be <UNK> for a proper pair of pants but philip escapes from there as well to chase more <UNK> there are lots of laughs all around it's also nice to see a short like this because the boys aren't exactly the characters we know and love ollie is pretty much his usual character but it's such a joy to see stan acting so differently from his usual man child character it shows he wasn't a one trick <UNK> and <UNK> in other types of roles when he got the chance with a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet providing classic one liners which still have me in <UNK>
<START> this version of alice in wonderland is truly original equal parts porn fairy tale and musical comedy this film is definitely a strange bit of adult film history br br alice is a sexually naive <UNK> who ends up following the rabbit into wonderland where she meets all kinds of experienced <UNK> like the mad <UNK> who likes to pull his <UNK> out whenever possible <UNK> <UNK> who broke his along with his shell and a brother sisters sex crazed duo and the <UNK> sexual queen among others br br this version of alice in wonderland is actually quite tame by the standards of the time a time when a lot of porn was mean spirited and nasty as noted by the <UNK> sub genre this one is actually quite funny and strangely endearing it's the kind of thing you'd show your kids if it weren't for the graphic sex a little slow getting to the good stuff but genuinely entertaining oh and some of the musical numbers are downright hilarious if you're a <UNK> have a few if you're a <UNK> roll a couple and give this one a shot 8 10
<START> ok first said i just wanted to check whether this movie has an average rating below or exactly 1 but 5 9 this is <UNK> than any of the <UNK> proceedings that made me curious what people wrote here which in the end made me set up an account to give my of truth into this well of <UNK> i find here br br how dare you guys even mention this movie in the same sentences as e g seven the only thing they got in common is that they show various crime scenes that is it and best thriller of 1999 have you even watched another movie form that year or any other movie in your life at all 1999 is not a year which people are reminded of by <UNK> what's with actual movies like <UNK> eyes wide shut <UNK> road double <UNK> actually more a thriller than this one could ever be <UNK> does not even deserve to be dedicated to a second of 1999 br br really you guys can't be serious i watched that movie yesterday with my girlfriend highly recommended by a friend of her a great film with christopher <UNK> which i had not yet seen hmm br br well first look on the covers ok nothing special at second glimpse you don't need to have supernatural powers to be aware that they simply <UNK> <UNK> head <UNK> his nose <UNK> this that then made a fancy negative pattern on top of it to get the killers image on the cover you could even think they had some apprentice eat a <UNK> of <UNK> just to <UNK> that creepy mouth whatever turned it around and the plot starts with it's <UNK> in chicago <UNK> <UNK> come on a six year old could have made that <UNK> sound more exciting now with this enormous excitement coming from the movies terrific presentation you absolutely wanna start watching it because it can't be that bad it still is christopher <UNK> that <UNK> of mine was proved wrong with <UNK> wrong i mean it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acting ever known to mankind every actor but the tops are the i can do 1 liners police chief wife actually a better detective than <UNK> when she several incidents to a yet absolutely unknown hint in the case and yes <UNK> himself featuring a <UNK> of <UNK> fake feelings logic errors in a 1 minute cycle light years far fetched conclusions which in my point of view represent an insult to any thinking human being and last but not least a camera man who obviously was a <UNK> <UNK> oh well and if you do not completely shut down your brains these aren't premises to watch it then you should know who is who and what is what after max simply because you know any scene after the first that is thrilling thrilling because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future br br the bottom line this is by far the worst movie i can remember trust me i've seen many horrible movies which in some way were at least only bad attempts or bad copies of another movie <UNK> however is the best example on how to fail in every aspect possible it was so bad that after being shocked by its <UNK> low quality in e v e r y t h i n g i laughed more often than in any recent comedy simply because i was fascinated by the <UNK> to <UNK> such an extraordinary film strip good thing for <UNK> he was in <UNK> <UNK> a year later thus he can be <UNK> o br br anyhow i do recommend watching this movie to everyone in the end we had great fun watching it d i guarantee you after you completely watched <UNK> be brave you can do it you will worship the level of acting in any given daily soap br br or just go <UNK> watch <UNK> one more time that's what i'm gonna do
<START> so much great chemistry between <UNK> scott thomas and harrison ford but every time the story about their relationship began to gather momentum the script cut away and dealt with some irrelevant sub plot that did nothing to advance the story indeed the subplots had nothing to do with the story at all they were like commercial breaks in which you watched a trailer for another movie br br the writers or someone who controlled the writers obviously didn't trust themselves to write <UNK> about relationships and the interior lives of their characters they seemed to be uncomfortable unless they threw in some gun battles and bar fights or perhaps they didn't trust the audience to pay attention to a story about a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship under difficult circumstances after all we all know how boring casablanca was br br perhaps if the relationship between kay and dutch had been developed more and had been allowed to play out the writers would have know how to end the story this film is a disappointment for not doing more with its wonderful actors who gave good performances but could have done more with a better script
<START> when people say children are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said little these children are turning 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying <UNK> children you will ever encounter in a film lets start with the blonde debbie she's a slut of a girl i mean come on she wears mini <UNK> she has stupid <UNK> blonde hair and a red bunny like face she acts so innocent next we have the second child the geek who thinks he's so cool with his long range shooting and his use of a <UNK> a coat over the gun and most of all his evil <UNK> smile the next kid is the quiet one you don't care about so thats all on him this film <UNK> me at the children's intelligence and the only enjoyment i got was from my cousin who kept <UNK> about them
<START> this movie is a little slow in the the beginning for about the first 10 minutes or so but once it kicks in you can't turn it off adam beach and rose play the best parts and are great at their acting job you would never be able to guess who the killer is i gave this movie a 9 because at some parts adam beach needs to speak up a little so you can hear what he's saying br br 9 10
<START> this is easily the worst most offensive piece of crap on tv i'd love to completely ignore it but fox has stuck it into their sunday <UNK> forcing me to find something else to watch between american dad and family guy the <UNK> head male star guy is just about the least evolved pathetic excuse for a human i have ever seen on tv nothing on the show is remotely funny and pretty much everything on it has been done already and much better by other shows br br it's obvious that their <UNK> is to ram it deep and hard into the sunday schedule and hope someone starts liking it but i have to break it to ya fox thats the wrong hole the <UNK> not worked on me i simply look elsewhere but come on you freaking <UNK> this show freaking sucks and it sucks even worse when compared to the rest of the fox sunday <UNK> br br they cancelled arrested development for this steaming pile
<START> most of the criticism of attack of show is from people who are unfairly comparing it to an old computer tv program called the screen people are upset because <UNK> decided to <UNK> the screen and replace it with the pop culture based attack of the show to compare the two shows is like comparing <UNK> to <UNK> br br attack of the show is a unique hour long program that covers current generation x y culture it features segments on movies television <UNK> discussions video games new dvd releases sex advice new <UNK> <UNK> players cell phones etc comic books graphic novels magazines and internet <UNK> br br it's a fun show definitely worth checking out you are in your <UNK> or 30s i give it an 8 out of 10
<START> this is one of my all time favourite films its one of those films where i know every line but can still watch it repeatedly without losing interest i always throw on this film if i'm going on holiday or if i don't want to go to the gym just seeing gorgeous body will give me the motivation i need its an easy to watch film which always keeps me smiling but i know it wont be <UNK> cup of tea but if like me you love films that are shot beautifully and have comedy romance and an interesting plot you will love it it is filled with great characters and ben and <UNK> are both gorgeous so anyone can stare at something appealing bottom line you have to give it a try i watched it on tv one day by <UNK> and loved it that i had to go out and track it down which took some time and i could watch it everyday my father the hero i love you
<START> and is an entertaining fast paced and refreshing film refreshing because unlike most other period films it does not <UNK> to give the audience a history lesson or <UNK> indeed historical accuracy is all but ignored this film does not take itself too seriously and seeks to entertain rather than <UNK> and is set in the 18th century yet director jake scott offers a thoroughly 90s take there's action sex and swearing <UNK> and in the inevitable ball scene the <UNK> dance to disco beats <UNK> lee miller and robert <UNK> are brilliant as always and the rest of the cast especially alan <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> are also highly entertaining the film is visually spectacular in places and is a mixture of comedy action and drama with a love interest provided by <UNK> tyler with a shaky english accent in short if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours this is the film for you it won't make you think but it could well put a smile on your face
