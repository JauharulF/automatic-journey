<START> at first i thought that this one was supposed to be somewhat of a comedy horror when i had seen the body in the <UNK> with the lady just standing there screaming over and over again but as the film <UNK> on it got more and more flat the plot was silly with a man upset that the <UNK> of real estate have gone up so now he to call up some radio <UNK> and <UNK> out his fury because he has nothing better to do then the law gets involved and tries <UNK> to make us feel that they really care who the <UNK> is and go out of their way to track this guy down one suspect after another are accused this movie is terrible and the slow moving love scenes of adrian b and her husband are boring and made me just fast forward the movie avoid it
<START> i don't think i will include any spoilers but if i do i can cover my butt the last american virgin came in a time were such teenage coming of age high school sex <UNK> were the rave films such as 1984 hot times 1974 and the popular <UNK> 1981 were making <UNK> money yet it is the last american virgin the one that actually has a more serious plot story amidst the nudity and sexual situations it is the often told tale of three high school buddies who want to lose their virginity the go to the wrong places prostitutes the dangerous ones older woman with jealous boyfriend and the convenient ones <UNK> their high school female counterparts the movie has a lot of funny moments and although the cast did not produce a single major movie star it is worth remembering for a fantastic 80's soundtrack that includes <UNK> the cars journey and others by today standards is raunchy and might have grabbed a <UNK> 17 rating but is a well told story of how sometimes personal <UNK> can only bring pain while love might be right in front of us it is a little piece of 80s <UNK> and worth having in your movie collection
<START> before i sat down and watched this film on hbo i wasn't expecting nothing but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common plot well that's exactly what i got out of it except that i was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie i wasn't expecting it to be i thought it was just going to be another hour and a half that i had on my hands to waste well it was but still it was somewhat worth it the whole plot was very stupid cheap acting and some of the lines were very very dumb otherwise than that it still had it's funny moments even though not many br br all in all if you're going to rent this don't watch it on television i gave it a 4 i was generous because it made me laugh but yet it was still pretty stupid
<START> i found an incredibly frustrating film to watch it starts quite well and moves along <UNK> until the first which is a <UNK> after that it becomes very lazy and <UNK> as a story it was the case of the plot driving the characters and not the characters driving the plot if you hate film where you can't understand why characters do what they do you will <UNK> particularly the last act is odd and seems to occur in a world without common sense also at the end one of the characters <UNK> a past <UNK> to her friend rather than <UNK> sympathy from the audience most people started to giggle this was probably because the of the story was a complete idiots finally there is an ending which just seems tacked on to be <UNK> and comes from the horror cop out school of <UNK> are bad audience so just accept it without any br br is neither good or bad but mediocre and annoying
<START> this is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens these people are going on a trek the young girl wants to photograph animals there really are no <UNK> but i guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real <UNK> anyway there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving there is considerable anti gun talk but we all know where that is going toward the end there's lots of action and a rape thrown in somebody must pay and they do it would have been nice to have a couple of <UNK> to sort of fill the thing out there were lots of monkeys if you fast forward through the dull parts you have a tight little five minutes
<START> this movie actually almost made me cry br br for starters the fake teeth then you spot a nice plastic or drawn set to make it even more boring all the action is followed by a bright light flash then the talking sound levels are so different sometimes too hard then too soft never exactly good like in good movies also it echoes so much that i think they had one <UNK> on the entire set and to make matters worse ever heard of <UNK> if the camera switches the sound always stays centered the actors talk like they are reading from a board staged behind the camera and the <UNK> into another scene how terrible childish br br the music is so badly chosen that it never adds something it only destroys any accidentally created excitement br br to finish it up the fighting scenes my 3 year old niece would make a better fighting scene br br this movie is not even good for a laugh it's just that bad
<START> i give this film 8 10 overall visually a great deal of it is nothing short of stunning an art director's dream mix of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and georgia <UNK> and a valid testament to the power of film as a serious art form beautiful use of color form imagery environment and fabulous set decoration combine with state of the art computer graphics so 10 10 for that wow br br the plot line is well more predictable you know they'll save the girl and get the killer in the end but the story is still interesting and <UNK> enough to pull you in and keep you there 6 10 for that br br <UNK> factor i won't give this a rating but the film certainly made me <UNK> and i was watching it on video on a tv screen it would of course have a great deal more impact on a big screen graphic violence of a twisted erotic nature in a surreal landscape even if beautiful is highly unpredictable the world inside the killer's head is not thank goodness my world because i watched this film on video i was able to replay a couple of sequences and found much to admire the second time around when i wasn't so nervous about where the scene might be going and i suspect the whole film would be worth seeing a second time just for the visual art br br general suggestion don't take the kids or conservative grandparents to this one but if you're keen on the visual look of films like <UNK> art don't mind a bit of kinky gore and just want to take a bit of a mind trip this one's a winner oh and if you're keen on babes jennifer lopez is pretty hot br br
<START> family guy when the show first aired it was fresh original and actually quite funny now i have stopped watching it it has become one of the worst shows on television combining unfunny jokes repetitive drawn out jokes and the hope that each joke can become funny with the inclusion of the word bitch seth clearly has issues with himself and he is obviously <UNK> to the 13 year old boys audience br br i just don't understand how something that started out so funny so different from everything else can <UNK> into this horrible mess of a comedy show i seriously have heard better one liners from a comic br br it truly is sad to see great shows fail and watch drivel like this continue on either seth has stopped trying or he believes that this show is hilarious the way it is br br either way god help us br br i hate this show and will dance an irish <UNK> when its finally cancelled
<START> i'm so glad i only got this movie for 5 anime is expensive no doubt about that i've had my eye on this one for awhile and finally i saw it on sale i grabbed it immediately and took it home only to hang my head in disappointment this movie sucked i've heard people talk about how gory and violent this movie is it's really not that gory or violent i've watched it three times and i think i've wasted enough of my life on this the demons get a point for being unique and kinda cool at times the sex gets a point since it's almost non stop the horny old man gets half a point for being horny and still having the sex drive and the main character who's name i've <UNK> from my mind gets half a point for the cool design of his gun i saw major connections between this movie and demon city <UNK> both have same style animation that's obvious because of the director both have lame <UNK> which suck like the <UNK> and both have terrible endings avoid this movie unless you're into anime sex
<START> i watched this movie by accident on tv and it was so unbelievably awful i could not switch it off every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the oscar <UNK> story by the inept screenplay writer it barely matters because the dire acting clich√©d camera work and <UNK> music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway the worst performance comes from patrick stewart who comes across as the most hammy talentless minor mock shakespearean as the ghost get <UNK> out of here he screams at one stage while waving his arms like a <UNK> villain a truly terrible film and why wonders why stewart who can act when called upon to do so has <UNK> his reputation by making worthless pieces of crap like this and the <UNK>
<START> i believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many <UNK> of <UNK> pro and con i would say the real man is depicted here without <UNK> he is what he is although the movie is but a <UNK> of the man the technique of storytelling expanded his life far beyond the years touched on in the movie this is deep movie a <UNK> of modern life and the way we think and can <UNK> a study into the man whose thoughts and other who used him have certainly affected our lives there are some movies that the historical context is so great that it is the primary job of the actors to stay out of the way the history carried the day and the actors did their job good work to them i say
<START> bad bad and did i mention bad aside from the comical monster <UNK> the workers the funniest part of the movie was when are in the desert and one comments that they have an hour of daylight left but you can clearly see by their shadows and the bright sky that it's probably only 2 or 2 30 in the afternoon talk about <UNK> read the script director br br the only cool part of this movie besides the rack on clara <UNK> of course as another reviewer mentioned is the phantom <UNK> horse that the bone eater rides on that thing was pretty cool as it chased the on their <UNK>
<START> this movie had so much potential to be hilarious yet moving but fell way short of either it had a great story line it just was not executed as good as it could have been the weird hallucinations during his sleep scenes made absolutely no sense and definitely was not needed they made no impact nor did they enhance or lend any understanding of what was to come or happen br br jon <UNK> character was ok but could have been expanded upon more he played the crappy part he was given at his best the character was funny but again it fell short of what could have been br br character was perfect and her performance was spot on br br in closing the writing was horrible and more often than not made no sense and his hallucinations did not fit with the movie at all this movie with better scripting and directing could have been a <UNK> to national <UNK> vacation as far as funny bad things happening to a person on a trip across america br br instead it was only worthy of a second <UNK> if i would have seen this at the theater i would have <UNK> my money back and the film br br the only thing that this film did was waste an hour and a half of my life it also managed to make all those involved in the movie look bad simply because the movie was a stinker br br i do not recommend this movie to anyone ever
<START> i found the first bit of stop motion animation intriguing and the mostly live action short with the girl going about in whatever country it was kept my interest but the other 11 odd shorts really didn't <UNK> my interest or make me think of anything at all the music and <UNK> footage all seemed to be so random that it all just seemed random i would not recommend this to any one unless you get to see it free br br as for the music being so in step that didn't come across either i rented the dvd because i thought it was all stop motion animation or mixed with live action and only the first short was the second had a little stop motion mixed with mostly live action there was paper cut out stuff in one and the rest was <UNK> shots from an <UNK> camera with the music bed just didn't have any meaning to it i could see
<START> i first saw this masterpiece on vhs 10 years ago and the powerful interpretation on angry kid painfully against established society it carried stayed in my heart since then director hector is such a good humanity who finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how kills the childhood of the kids from poverty class even the <UNK> kids have their innocent beautiful dreams but the corrupt reality never gives a chance br br thanks to the <UNK> for the recent dvd release i now can keep this great movie to my favorite collection
<START> <UNK> <UNK> lost his sense of <UNK> i envy europeans and americans who can watch the film without following the dialog with their ears because it is painful to do slow <UNK> heavy and over deliberate but <UNK> on the other hand suffer from the poor quality of <UNK> translation which manages to lose all the subtlety and double meanings that make a careful study of the film so much fun
<START> a great film in its genre the direction acting most especially the casting of the film makes it even more powerful a must see
<START> the <UNK> music poet once said that some folk music repeats similarly at any country of the world they look the same but everybody consider them as their own folk music br br this film as i feel it is about the same music that repeats all over the world at some time of each country's history first a few listen it playing and try to make the others hear it then some believe that they hear it but they don't then nobody says anything and some people appear to listen to it and others recognize that they have heard it but didn't think that others might be hearing it finally everybody listen to the same music and suddenly it doesn't sound any more br br love and poetry as a real <UNK> and the legacy of a father to his children br br why would he call the film the dead when nobody dies the spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule and we call it <UNK> following james <UNK> title br br a nice <UNK> irish filmed <UNK>
<START> this has to be one of the biggest <UNK> ever the script was nice and could have ended a lot better the actors should have played better and maybe then i would have given this movie a slightly better grade maybe hollywood should remake this movie with some little better actors and better director sorry guys for disappointment but the movie is bad br br if i had to re watch it it would be like torture i don't want to spoil everyone's opinion with mine so my advice is watch the movie first see if u like it and after vote do not vote before you watch it and by the way have fun watching it don't just <UNK> watch it <UNK> the end
<START> <UNK> <UNK> had lived through world war two and saw what its effects it had on his people in japan but so did novelist <UNK> whose book was the inspiration for film fires on the plain it's a film about the men in this war or perhaps more universally in wars in general who lose their humanity the soldiers <UNK> along through these fields and <UNK> of the in this story are almost completely without hope if not already just that it makes <UNK> platoon look like a <UNK> at least they had certain things like food after all br br they have little to no <UNK> or supplies or <UNK> no back up no sense of anything going their way in this combat that they've been thrust into they can't even get some proper hospital care unless if they can no longer walk at all or have lost limbs for example say if you have <UNK> you're on your way but its really through the <UNK> of one soldier a private <UNK> that we get a full sense of the <UNK> of war both in its bleak scenes of <UNK> and boredom and <UNK> and those flashes of intense and brutal violence br br in the film <UNK> just wants to get some medical care this is right at the start and his told by his superior officer already he is with eyes that stare off and an expression that has been <UNK> by years of battle that he will die if he doesn't find a hospital he doesn't really but does end up in with some soldiers at first with a platoon that seems to sort of have their act together but is really led on by a power hungry <UNK> who just wants <UNK> of salt and then later with two other stray soldiers who are part of a group that had previously been <UNK> while crossing a road at night br br the story isn't entirely a straight line but it doesn't need to be path in fires on the plain is told in vignettes little stories like when he comes upon a seemingly deserted enemy village two of the <UNK> comes back to get some supplies and <UNK> <UNK> up on them it's an excruciating scene since so far with <UNK> we haven't seen him do anything outright wrong but he does so in this scene not even so much out of evil but out of fear and desperation this is also without spoiling it how he gets a <UNK> of salt little scenes build up so brilliantly and with <UNK> like a simple task of finding a pair of shoes which there seem to be none or when <UNK> later in the film discovers his teeth are becoming torn apart and falling out from lack of total <UNK> so much for food so it goes br br it should also be mentioned that this is a <UNK> realized film from <UNK> shot in a stark black and white view of the fields and woods the cinematography filling everything we see in black blacks and white hot white <UNK> also makes sure to get everything authentic from his actors not simply emotionally but with their own <UNK> look and looks of desperation right on them it's as if <UNK> has to have them all surviving the film as well as characters surviving out in the wild by wild by the way i mean also <UNK> the shock of this is two <UNK> first is the way that a soldier says half <UNK> early on about eating other soldiers to who asks if it was true and only in response getting a don't ask word of caution and the second with the depiction of <UNK> itself from the crazy starving man on the hill who pulls out guts out of his lap and says with a straight face to our hero that you can eat me when i die br br this makes thing especially more brutal when it comes to the director filming the brief <UNK> scenes these are i would argue more brutal than <UNK> <UNK> in their depictions of violence in battle the carnage that is completely random a scene i would point to and that contains just a shot that is excruciating to watch is when from a high angle we see a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly along a <UNK> of <UNK> comes that kills only four or five but it just happens so fast and the soldiers just keep walking along at the same crawl this isn't the only shot of horrible carnage that's shown when needing to be bloody its there but <UNK> across the screen like something completely of the macabre but it drives the point completely br br all of the acting is <UNK> especially who looks to be both most at peace and most horrified by what he sees in the of looks most of the time all of the major set pieces provide something else to the gruesome experience and it all amounts to the ultimate question with an anti war film how can or why do people fight in wars like these it's almost too depressing to put into words and so <UNK> pushes our <UNK> right up into the <UNK> and filth and blood and demands for us to take it in so maybe some day it will never happen again or one can hope this by the end of such a bleak and great film as this
<START> some describe as the most controversial film of its era while this is <UNK> it is certainly one of the most embarrassing virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it author gore <UNK> actually <UNK> with mixed results to have his name removed from the film and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from <UNK> voiced disgust to <UNK> silence what they wanted of course was for it to go away br br for a while it looked like it might <UNK> was a major box office and critical flop producer had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all and although the film was released on vhs to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re edited and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade but now is on dvd available in both edited r and original <UNK> versions and no doubt john gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen br br the only way to describe is to say it is something like deep throat meets david lynch's <UNK> by way of fellini having an off day <UNK> script fell into the hands of <UNK> <UNK> bob who used <UNK> reputation to <UNK> the project and lure the big name stars and then threw out most of <UNK> script and brought in soft porn director <UNK> then when felt <UNK> work wasn't explicit enough he and <UNK> <UNK> photographed hardcore material on the sly br br viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination there is a tremendous amount of nudity and that remains in the edited version but the original comes complete with <UNK> scenes there is very explicit gay lesbian and straight sex kinky sex and a grand orgy complete with dancing roman guards thrown in for good measure the film is also incredibly violent and bloody with rape torture and <UNK> the order of the day in one particularly disturbing scene a man is slowly stabbed to death a woman <UNK> on his corpse and his <UNK> are cut off and thrown to the dogs br br in a documentary that <UNK> the dvd release states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of <UNK> rome if so he missed the mark we know very little about <UNK> and what little we know is questionable at best that aside <UNK> and casual sex were not a <UNK> of roman society where adultery was an offense <UNK> by death and certainly ancient rome never looked like the strange slightly oriental oddly space age sets and costumes offered by the <UNK> br br on the plus side those sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful and although the cinematography is <UNK> it at least does them justice the score is also very very good the most successful member of the cast is helen <UNK> who manages to engage our interests and <UNK> as the <UNK> gielgud and o'toole also escape in reasonably good form the same cannot be said for mcdowell but in justice to him he doesn't have much to work with br br the movie does possess a dark fascination but ultimately it is an <UNK> more interesting for its design and flat out weirdness than for content some of the bodies on display including <UNK> and <UNK> are extremely beautiful and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography but then again some of them are so <UNK> they might drive you to <UNK> and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film <UNK> its <UNK> if you're up to it it is worth seeing once but once is likely to be enough br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> i feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film it is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake or perhaps their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart looking for any reason at all to dislike them br br the long kiss <UNK> is an action film in every sense of the word sure there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself i have never been a big <UNK> davis fan but i was impressed with how she was able to create two very different characters samantha cain and charlie <UNK> in my opinion it wasn't even necessary to have changed her physical appearance to <UNK> between the two her acting was more than enough to do the trick br br more than anything else though this film was craig in <UNK> hands the character of timothy could've been just another <UNK> villain his decision to play him with a more casual approach was just the right <UNK> to all of the action scenes it isn't often that you find an actor who can express himself so well with just his facial expressions point in case the scene in the <UNK> with charlie and her daughter where most films would've <UNK> the moment of revelation with unnecessary dialogue eyes told the whole story br br the basic plot thin to be truthful a seemingly average housewife who suffers from <UNK> slowly discovers that she had been an assassin as her memory returns so do the people who want the assassin dead is she really samantha the cookie <UNK> housewife or charlie the cold blooded assassin or maybe a little bit of both for me the long kiss <UNK> was an enjoyable journey to find out
<START> when pam <UNK> made <UNK> in 1973 it was an exciting though flawed film the plot was gritty and satisfying even if the acting was often amateurish it was so successful that american international pictures decided to rehash the formula the following year with <UNK> brown not a bad film but certainly almost like <UNK> ii now only a year later the studio had apparently given up on creating anything new for ms <UNK> as <UNK> baby was essentially the same plot from <UNK> and <UNK> brown yet again because the idea was so recycled and because the acting and acting are so tired and low energy it's really <UNK> the bottom of the <UNK> barrel br br exactly like these other films <UNK> baby begins with some local black <UNK> <UNK> and eventually killing someone pam <UNK> loves in the past it had been drug dealers and <UNK> now it was <UNK> trying to run all the <UNK> companies and <UNK> <UNK> out of town so they can corner the market and like the other films pam is a one woman hit squad <UNK> justice and a good butt and like the other films there is a cat fight between pam and a white lady right in front of mr big and like the other films mr big is a white guy pulling all the strings and like the other films she is captured by mr big and like the other films he doesn't immediately kill her but gives her ample opportunity to escape here leaving a knife conveniently lying around and like the other films she eventually gets free and kills his <UNK> br br while this formula did seem interesting in 1973 by this film it was frankly a predictable bore even if you hadn't seen the other films it still was bad because the action was so slow the <UNK> and kicking seemed so slow and staged the same could be said for the gun play in one scene four guys with machine guns an <UNK> 15 and <UNK> attack pam responds by opening fire with a <UNK> revolver and killing 3 of the 4 and getting the other to surrender even if she's a good shot she was rather slow and the guys just seemed to wait until she killed them plus even a world champion <UNK> or rambo couldn't have succeeded with such one sided odds after all these guys had very impressive weapons and they were already pointed at her when she cleverly whipped out her pistol and easily <UNK> these professional hit men br br in addition to slow and lame action scenes compared to any other film the movie has many logical gaps that show the writing was terrible but the studio just didn't care in one case her boyfriend williams knew about the <UNK> and <UNK> at the end of the film but pam never told him how did he know about this in another the cops approach a boat filled with <UNK> and the hood immediately open fire however the cops had no evidence anything was happening and the crooks began firing with little <UNK> and the crooks had 30 caliber machine guns and other amazingly powerful weapons but in many cases were killed by cops wielding <UNK> <UNK> br br the bottom line is that this is a great example of been there done that a whole lot better i love <UNK> films but this one is just too dopey and slow to merit watching except by very devoted fans of the genre
<START> terrible acting terrible script wholly unrealistic the <UNK> flies anyway <UNK> the cliches and <UNK> that movie studios love to <UNK> down <UNK> throats <UNK> wood is <UNK> bad in the primary role and the plot points are contrived and sappy <UNK> and <UNK> relationship is laughable at best but the worst element of <UNK> is the script this is some of the most mind numbingly bad dialogue i have ever had the misfortune to hear actually <UNK> inside my ears and <UNK> my <UNK> would be <UNK> to hearing <UNK> wood <UNK> spit out his pseudo profound lines i wish a <UNK> project would be performed on me so i could mercifully have no memories of this stinker
<START> imagine the worst thing that could ever possibly be conceived by human intellect now imagine something infinitely darker i mean worse than that then <UNK> that by the <UNK> of the <UNK> possessed by the star wars holiday special this movie is by far worse than that br br dracula 3000 <UNK> darkness starring such <UNK> and <UNK> actors such as <UNK> and <UNK> as the film's horrifying antagonist count is to eating one's own <UNK> exclusively for one's entire life <UNK> into approximately one hour and twenty minutes to be frank there is no way to approach a review of this cinematic tragedy <UNK> with communist propaganda promotion of drug use futuristic <UNK> and quite possibly the worst special effects since the original war of the worlds br br the hammer and the <UNK> of the soviet union can be seen proudly displayed throughout the <UNK> sets they dare call a spaceship <UNK> can be observed on several posters throughout the film and of course religion has been <UNK> for two centuries by then so they don't know who this god is even though they have no <UNK> about using his name in vain but of course in the <UNK> republic of space <UNK> over by <UNK> president baker death stick like drugs are <UNK> and quite common yet <UNK> <UNK> seems even worse off than it is today they don't even have a wheelchair <UNK> br br racial tension still <UNK> throughout the galaxy in quite a familiar predictable fashion we receive great commentary on ethnic division through lines such as is dracula a us gotta stick together and once you go black you don't go back speaking of the token black characters one is played by <UNK> playing a stereotypical <UNK> <UNK> becomes possibly the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever oh wait second most ridiculous vampire ever that <UNK> title goes to our friend count from planet <UNK> in the <UNK> system these two make quite a pair between <UNK> attempts to <UNK> a strange attempts at making high pitched animal noises a <UNK> years old and gigantic stretches of completely worthless dialogue and count twenty dollar generic halloween style vampire costume exploding <UNK> or <UNK> inane back story br br one wonders if they did not simply give <UNK> the opportunity to get as high as a <UNK> in space without gravity let him interact with the other actors and just went from there br br count motivations are also somewhat in question does he want <UNK> darkness as the film's <UNK> would have you believe does he want to eat the crew or does he want <UNK> to kill them all or does he desire to give handicapped people a chance in such an future it doesn't really matter because none of this film's plot makes sense anyways br br the highlight of this movie has to be it's ending more for the fact that it means the movie is over than by any merit of the abrupt <UNK> of a climax they phone in before the credits instead of facing count off in some sort of duel the closest we get is a shot of <UNK> around at <UNK> <UNK> in front of our protagonist who dies shortly afterwards our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm in an ordinary door then proceeds to collapse <UNK> in pain at a totally mundane yet understandably painful injury this is by far the most fun you'll get from this movie watching a <UNK> <UNK> face as he cries in pain will have you on the edge of your seat with laughter almost worth the four bucks for that alone of course right after that we're treated with one of the film's worst one liners the mandatory <UNK> to sex and perhaps the most abrupt excuse for an ending ever they're driving into the sun and their ship literally just blows up before they even come remotely close to impact i think they just <UNK> the <UNK> bros for the worst finale ever br br i can only sleep at night because we know that a sequel is impossible secure in this fact we can safely say that this is the worst movie ever created and one which will never be <UNK> in low quality lower budget and lower <UNK> acting talent
<START> this movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make the cell a memorable and above average movie br br the cell is beautifully looking with impressive sets costumes and make up yes it's real eye candy to watch all the movie has some perfectly sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at this movie is a perfect mix of an art house type of movie and a typical hollywood thriller that is accessible to both fans of the genre br br the story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense because of that the movie isn't always pleasant and likable to watch but like i mentioned before the style <UNK> for this the style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie br br vincent <UNK> is unforgettable as the serial killer with a twisted mind vincent <UNK> is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more i'm not particularly happy about the casting of jennifer lopez i know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn't suitable to play the main character in this movie her character wasn't strong enough and she was overshadowed by vincent <UNK> and vince vaughn still i felt that vince vaughn was also miscast in this movie he didn't fit the role well enough and no i'm not saying that because i'm used of seeing him only in comedies now days the rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility br br the musical score by howard shore was also surprising good and was sort of <UNK> like at times it suited the movie well and gave some of the <UNK> some extra mood and atmosphere br br it's a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way still the cell is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see due to its style originality and creativity br br 7 10
<START> who really wants to see that disgusting violence disgusting sex for such a long time i do not want to but i always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be this was the hardest right after next friday br br it's basically just crap how can you possibly call it anything else the story of a roman emperor as an excuse for gore and t a yeah yeah hey it's realistic they have been like this fine but why bother us with it i don't care if it has been like this and there are a lot of scenes where i truly doubt it the point is why should anyone wanna see it problem is there is only one reason you could like the film and that would be that you like violence there's nothing special about it just cruelty you can say cool as you'd say in splatter slasher movie but horror movies with violence at least can give you chills and excitement maybe characters you care about but here everything is dark dull and boring every character is mad the story of an emperor who can't deal with his power what in the very first scene he runs naked through the woods with his sister i have no problem saying that we saw a madman for 2 1 2 hours br br but maybe you get turned on by seeing helen <UNK> being pregnant and dancing or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the message of the movie or <UNK> yeah right that was fun real birth scenes how hilarious humans animals who cares let's just treat them as toys br br i don't care what anyone says this is no movie this is just 2 1 2 hours of blood and sex <UNK> and disgusting go watch a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror flick if you want violence at least those movies don't pretend to be some artistic masterpiece and they are shorter br br 0 10 6 1 6 0 4
<START> before this was shown on mtv or <UNK> it was at my local theatre playing just before the main movie i remember this short movie more than the film i saw that day it was the first time i had ever a music movie like this but i will tell you that seeing on the big screen from a <UNK> print in a <UNK> theatre gives it a much better impact than seeing a <UNK> pan and <UNK> version on <UNK> at halloween
<START> i really really don't understand how that movie could get a rating bigger than 4 here on imdb it's simply a huge mess and i have to admit that i actually liked 1 close to no story okay i can live with that but at least they got to the point pretty much at once 2 does not after the stupid premise has been presented there is well over half an hour of stupid and <UNK> teenager clich√©s dumb as hell dialog and close to nothing else except for a few alien scenes that feel like an excuse to have that first half of the movie and predator scenes that make you ask yourself whether those guys making the film even watched any other predator movie or just didn't care enough to be bothered br br after that that crap fest finally gets to the point where the predator starts attacking the aliens or at least pretends doing so and boy is that predator stupid blind and deaf it's awful how he even managed to earn that stuff he has is beyond me he misses with almost every shot only notices aliens when they're right in his face or if it's absolutely necessary for the script so that he can move where he has to be he even gets caught on surprise by <UNK> human teenagers and <UNK> all of the time what's that guy supposed to be after the first hour of that abomination i was more or less constantly shaking my head at every scene close to no scene in this movie passes by without unbelievably stupid dialogs stupid predator actions or stupid lack there of or stupid actions from our heroes br br then that thing finally ended to my surprise not only me and my friends didn't know whether to laugh or to cry but everybody i <UNK> leaving the room was half crying half laughing about those 1 1 2 hours they just wasted br br don't watch never
<START> back in the day i was one of the in the <UNK> rooms these <UNK> would occasionally land in they were not treated well and some of it was brought on by their personalities but we all knew they were a talented bunch of even then they deserved better care than they received i'm afraid they had attitude in <UNK> br br i'm so glad i caught this documentary on <UNK> tonight it will be on again at 1 am and i'll be watching again br br little attention was given to them until the rich dying kid was able to talk his parents into <UNK> the pool and the film really highlights that as the taking off point it was an amazing time and deserved to be recorded <UNK> <UNK> is due all the praise <UNK> on him and long may those z boys enjoy their memories and contribution to the real sport of <UNK> as for the few sour <UNK> reviews contained <UNK> there always were and there always will be <UNK> and <UNK> on who never do more than dream the z boys lived it <UNK> it were it br br nice to see the vintage films and even the lone girl peggy who was so talked about as being the only female to win their respect br br thanks to <UNK> i get to really take the occasional drug free head trip of my youth and <UNK> the heart <UNK> excitement again
<START> i went to see this because i'd never seen tel <UNK> where the story is set i was disappointed since it doesn't offer many views of <UNK> largest metropolis it's also of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a <UNK> of the shoulders br br the main protagonist is a woman in her <UNK> who works as a waitress at <UNK> <UNK> her parents evidently don't care about her very much and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an ring around her feels compelled to take care of her the little girl doesn't speak and can't give her to social services because it's the weekend and the agency is closed so she takes her back to her apartment with the <UNK> roof and when it comes time to work in the evening she has to take the little girl with her the boss is very unhappy about this and other shortcomings in work performance br br another main character is <UNK> who is getting married at her wedding party where is of course working she breaks her leg climbing out of a <UNK> room <UNK> whose door won't open and so she and her new husband cannot take the <UNK> vacation they've planned they end up in a <UNK> hotel on the <UNK> without a view it <UNK> bad there is noise from the traffic and <UNK> is complaining all the time her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman ¬ñ a writer ¬ñ who is also staying in the hotel and <UNK> <UNK> that he has slept with this stranger br br the third main character is a <UNK> woman named joy who looks after old people the old woman she is hired to care for is very <UNK> and speaks no english only german and <UNK> joy speaks english but no <UNK> or german joy is mostly concerned with how her son is doing back in the <UNK> and wants to buy him a toy boat as he has asked she finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it the daughter of the old woman who hired joy is an actress appearing in some sort of post modern physical theater adaptation of hamlet and does not get along with her mother br br the way in which these three <UNK> themselves is presumably supposed to mean something profound i didn't get it there is a fantasy element to relationship with the little girl and maybe non existent relationship with her parents is somehow <UNK> in this relationship when joy sees the toy boat in the shop window there is a strange effect used where the little <UNK> as if blown by the wind and they do this as if they are on the scale of a real life ship <UNK> draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is on a <UNK> cover in the hotel room and a narration of the strange woman's poetry mentions a ship in a bottle but what does all this mean i thought about it for a while and realized i wasn't going to lose any sleep in the process if anyone out there has a clear idea of what it's all about maybe they can fill me in
<START> there's a unique place in the <UNK> of john ford films for sergeant <UNK> and the sun shines bright it was these three films with no box office names in them that ford didn't have to <UNK> the film around the persona of a star being it john wayne henry fonda or any of the others he worked with not surprising that ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another br br ben johnson and harry carey jr a couple of likable sign on to guide a mormon <UNK> train to a valley in arizona territory along the way they are joined first by a group stranded players from a medicine show and then by a family of <UNK> on the run named <UNK> their stories <UNK> and what happens is the basis of the film's plot br br had been done even 10 years earlier on the strength of the two performances turned in by johnson and carey both probably would have had substantial careers as b picture <UNK> in the case of johnson it would have been art imitating life johnson was a real <UNK> cowboy and came to hollywood with a string of horses for john ford to use in <UNK> <UNK> ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history br br but the day of the b western was drawing to a close and johnson and carey had great careers as two fine character actors br br ward bond plays elder leader of the <UNK> bond is a recent <UNK> though and has trouble remembering to not use some four letter words but he's the leader because of his strength of character not his impeccable lds <UNK> he turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader br br in portraying the ford only had to reach back four years to his my darling <UNK> they are the reincarnation of the gang and pure evil in fact if walter brennan who after my darling <UNK> refused to ever work for ford again was willing i could easily see him being cast as <UNK> <UNK> the head of the family as it was charles <UNK> did a fine job this is probably the role he's most noted for shortly after this film was done <UNK> was killed in <UNK> crash he might very well have worked for ford in the future br br ford makes the <UNK> <UNK> here and i don't recall that <UNK> was part of lds <UNK> nevertheless it works here the whole idea being that these people who carry no weapons are <UNK> when dealing with evil people like the it takes some gun <UNK> <UNK> to properly <UNK> of them i think that this post world war ii film is trying to say that <UNK> isn't always the best policy br br another from my darling <UNK> is alan <UNK> playing the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show <UNK> part of that <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> who's doing another turn as a woman of <UNK> virtue the same as she did in red river <UNK> used to do so many westerns that she <UNK> to be out of and into some modern fashions br br is great entertainment and i'm willing to <UNK> in the state of <UNK> it's a pretty popular film
<START> this is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so i won't repeat the same <UNK> but faith akin being an turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary european falls into the trap of <UNK> that other western artists usually fall but come on man you are turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond old town it's a missed opportunity for that reason performances by and are <UNK> of the movie and a very talented and bad ass turkish <UNK> makes some trash talk about american <UNK> <UNK> which i totally agree i will recommend this movie to my american friends
<START> as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate apparently not so much space for opinions in between i for one think that is a good sign br br i always appreciated this movie although the genre is not my typical style i never watched titanic for instance and am not planning to br br the english patient grips because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are <UNK> <UNK> it shows how destructive love can be in a slow strong and utterly painful way it <UNK> because of the extremely passionate affair the pain of the one s who leave behind how pointless one can feel to move on br br the photography is just stunning not to mention the play of the actors the pace is slow but <UNK> and that does justice to the book the <UNK> and the depth development of the characters to put this in <UNK> minutes as some seem to suggest here would <UNK> the multi of this movie people tend to have difficulties with the pace of movies as if they are in a rush to get to work hey get a life enjoy br br i give this movie 4 5 out of 5
<START> wait till you watch this one i mean even after reading this review no other movie till date has sucked more than this one one thing i wont understand is that when you are ripping off some english flick why to add your own creativity with the amount spent for making this movie the producers should have considered buying rights for <UNK> to be dubbed into hindi and released the movie they might have gotten some <UNK> that way i guess if there was a chance to rate this movie with a 0 i would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from <UNK> <UNK> and the girl who played the sidekick to i don't know if my problem is that i have seen <UNK> much earlier than this movie but that cant be a reason to support this movie i could go on for hours but neither i have the time to discuss about this useless crap of a movie not i want to remember those awful scenes from the movie br br please stay away from this flick
<START> no matter what country your in you have to buy this show sure it is australian and if you ever seen any attempt of our <UNK> they pretty much suck but with the they aren't boring forty year old men making bad <UNK> they are a team of people who talk about current affairs pretty much in australia make fun of our crap ads make fun of our politicians and so on br br the guys also had a show in 2002 called which was not as successful as the war which had only started this year so everything they talk about is current news which is really good considering no matter how boring or tragic it is they try to shine some humorous light on things
<START> one word for it hilarious i haven't watched at movie like this in a long time at points in the movie i totally forgot it was a movie i just felt like i was back watching <UNK> la <UNK> or even watching say my own friend going through something like this it was realistic and i liked how <UNK> ryan <UNK> and brandon and the rest of the guys didn't try to hard too actually act they to me were just acting like their famous idiot <UNK> there were a few scenes that i <UNK> more than others like in the shower holy i laughed so hard he honestly was probably my favourite character besides he really in my opinion made the movie just a bit more hilarious it's basically a must see for any fans of the crew
<START> the marriage of an <UNK> new york city couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out it took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door a neighbor tells us the busy distracted husband takes on the <UNK> <UNK> and grows closer to his son but soon the wife returns highly manipulative picture doesn't give us a very realistic <UNK> unit with young justin henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between dustin hoffman and meryl streep but the dynamics are intriguing and involving and director robert <UNK> keeps the pace popping with lots of <UNK> marvelous classical music <UNK> editing and <UNK> bits of humor <UNK> character is designed to be a cold self centered witch but i was ready to feel a lot more for her than <UNK> probably wanted it all has to be painted in terms of black and white good and bad with hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent the film never <UNK> from its <UNK> path and very fine acting nearly saves it but i'm not sure where <UNK> was <UNK> the film in the final act and the closing scene is awfully abrupt from
<START> i just watched this film this morning and i found it to be a great showing of the <UNK> of faith <UNK> gave them another way to look at life not a replacement but an <UNK> she shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her i see the story of god in here he sent his only son to man man could not possibly give anything that would equal that so for our small sacrifice we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it in this film the <UNK> <UNK> have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of god <UNK> showed them that life and god can indeed be beautiful in it's <UNK> sense the love that god's son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the <UNK> for it even the film is a metaphor it seems slow in the beginning but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end it was truly a feast
<START> during filming was vanessa redgrave taking it was like she was reading from an <UNK> i've seen more life in a wooden <UNK> or perhaps that was all part of the character whatever it was very very annoying i kept wanting to shake the screen to hurry her up i read the book a long time ago didn't like much about it except that descent into madness was very well done but i don't think rupert graves showed this very well his acting was all on the surface the connection between his life and is not very well done either but i suspect the attempt is to show the sacrifice soldiers made to <UNK> people like <UNK> to continue their vapid lives the film is very <UNK> and has no real <UNK> to it hated it
<START> this is a hollywood film the <UNK> of those involved are not revolutionary this film will not change the world however it is well made well plotted and well acted which counts for a lot br br it's the cat and mouse story of a disgruntled former cia assassin who feels betrayed chasing a secret service agent who was protecting john f kennedy when kennedy was killed in dallas the agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992 or certainly in contemporary america this would be assassin mitch <UNK> john <UNK> in a tour de force of creepiness in which he gives a <UNK> performance has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to <UNK> the president he <UNK> he has common cause with secret service agent frank clint eastwood at his cool calm good <UNK> <UNK> best who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the warren <UNK> blamed unfairly <UNK> believes for the assassination of president kennedy the tension is up through some phone calls from <UNK> to <UNK> wanting to keep close but not to <UNK> his location and plans br br <UNK> russo is excellent as lily raines a fellow agent with whom develops a grown up relationship it is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers even if russo is a fair deal younger than eastwood at the time of filming russo is a calm capable agent who is able to go toe to toe with the quick witted in friendly banter it is a nice part for russo allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the <UNK> romantic interest of the older man the acting by the leads <UNK> <UNK> competent direction the thoughtful use of music in plot development and excellent cinematography make this a film i can watch over and over
<START> i'm not sure if this is a comedy or not but i found it pretty comical <UNK> is possessed by the devil somehow a perverted priest and the <UNK> are <UNK> fix that part <UNK> and part soap opera you'll at least get some laughs there's the paranoid jealous dad satanic sister valley of the dolls mother and then the cowboy boyfriend all there to help the <UNK> chasing priest fight the demons from dear <UNK> it sometimes felt like a jerry springer episode but i actually paid to see this instead of the cool head <UNK> sailor <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> did in the exorcist you get a lot of <UNK> <UNK> on her bed like it's a <UNK> hiding in her closet and jumping from a <UNK> <UNK> yeah it's chuck e cheese gone wild so if you want to watch a quote <UNK> horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending this is your movie
<START> watch it with an open mind it is very different <UNK> <UNK> about this very well done realistic tale of tarzan the <UNK> are well done for <UNK> christopher <UNK> was brilliant imitating language and behavior i wouldn't be surprised if he took lessons from jane <UNK>
<START> i was very excited to see a documentary on one of my favorite italian directors <UNK> has <UNK> in everything from horror post apocalyptic to hardcore porn he has touched upon genius a couple of times with films like <UNK> and <UNK> the last cannibals this documentary is a and informative guide to the films of <UNK> he is interviewed throughout with english subtitles rolling across the bottom of the screen the <UNK> from his films are narrated by a narrator with english subtitles the documentary proved extra interesting when it <UNK> the often <UNK> <UNK> in america here <UNK> the <UNK> snuff scenes in detail and recalls some funny stories in fact good ol' joe is very warm and funny throughout always wearing a smile and smoking a cigarette the one aspect of this documentary is that it spends little time on <UNK> horror films like <UNK> and the brilliant <UNK> it spends too much time on the erotic cinema and hardly touches the post films but i can't complain it is wonderful to see <UNK> get the respect he deserves highly recommended for fans of <UNK> may he rest in peace
<START> i find it terribly ironic that left wing hollywood continues to <UNK> its <UNK> making these awful <UNK> movies that neither <UNK> the war on terror nor embrace it br br if you're a sixties survivor and a committed <UNK> and you're hoping for an all out <UNK> of war like born on the fourth of july or all quiet on the western front this movie will really feel like a rip off none of these soldiers actually question this war or any war or the idea of war they just <UNK> about having to do another tour br br on the other hand if you're a patriotic american who wants to see a story of courage and honor this movie will really feel like a rip off none of these soldiers loves america or even loves the service the way they <UNK> and <UNK> makes them come across more like suburban teenagers than blue collar tough guys it's not we were soldiers and it's not <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> it's not even mindless action and the war scenes are less rambo and more buffy br br ryan <UNK> so completely cannot carry this kind of movie though he's <UNK> sexy in a rough trade men's room <UNK> sort of way it's hard to picture him as a slow <UNK> texas boy who wants to stand up and be counted this is no sgt <UNK> in the naked and the dead he's more like joel in truman <UNK> other voices other rooms he can't sell you on the idea that he's been in combat and done his bit or that he wants his woman and wants her right now he <UNK> on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes looking as if he would much prefer to bend over and take a good stiff attack from the rear
<START> i feel very strongly that this film was just like waiting to <UNK> with white females in the 1950's as in waiting to <UNK> all of the female characters got mixed up with men who were either married or no good the only difference besides the obvious was that there wasn't much humor in this film i would even say that it was tragic only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere hope <UNK> guy but even then there was conflict in this relationship br br the story was about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had hopes and dreams of success unfortunately for them romance didn't seem to come easy although they were young intelligent and attractive this movie could be called a <UNK> with the saddest part involving <UNK> <UNK> character whose obsession of an ex boyfriend leads to tragedy br br this is a must see
<START> i have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years what staying power it has it was funny and creative i wish my children and <UNK> could have seen it it ranks right up there with <UNK> another favorite i was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on rocky and <UNK> these early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances while the early cartoons didn't address evil very much it was a much <UNK> and <UNK> time they allowed us to develop our own talents and character
<START> food always makes a good topic in movies as <UNK> showed <UNK> feast is the same type of thing <UNK> <UNK> is a french cook who <UNK> her native land after the <UNK> of <UNK> she moves to a very religious danish village the people in this village simply have no use for joy that is until <UNK> <UNK> them one of her exquisite <UNK> br br it's not just that this movie deals with bringing fun to a place that has never known it like other <UNK> movies and non hollywood movies in general it shows that a movie can hold your interest without the use of explosions car chases etc this is one movie that you can't afford to miss br br one more thing do you think that the danish word for feast sounds a little bit like
<START> i have no idea what the budget on this movie was but whatever it was they made it work i have seen movies that spend <UNK> the amount pearl harbor anyone and sucked worse this movie has everything david it <UNK> in the lead role as adam an average college student who gets wrapped up in a game called the great run by leon this guy rocks a genius with nothing better to do than come up with an elaborate game for a bunch of people to play but he doesn't just pick his friends he has a team of <UNK> <UNK> average kids and of course team who are the bad guys but this movie has no black and white there are many shades of gray adam is not the <UNK> hero with no faults he treats alex p like crap and <UNK> is the way he is because of <UNK> from his dad and a <UNK> stomach the <UNK> play dirty but so does everyone else this movie rocks the scene at the factory classic <UNK> <UNK> male child can you write a better clue this stuff is gold jerry gold maybe i am from a different generation but i love movies that seem far fetched but still have roots in reality this never happened but it could <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bunny <UNK> parade oh and watch for a young paul <UNK> still working on that pee wee character ps that was is hot she must have been one bad actress not to work in hollywood anymore see this movie
<START> i feel really bad for reviewing this movie because i wish that i had only watched it as a concept production the <UNK> looked like it could have been a really original piece but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen br br the story follows four five teens that are the <UNK> of the families that started the town of a survivors of the <UNK> witch trials they also happen to be a part of the secret <UNK> called the <UNK> their power must be used <UNK> as it <UNK> their life force in small amounts and is highly <UNK> in theory this would make a pretty good action sci fi at least an interesting <UNK> flick br br but there were just too many glaring <UNK> that don't allow this movie to reach its <UNK> full potential that acting wasn't good the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues for sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job the movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental <UNK> or any feel of pacing br br the movie has it's moments but overall was a little disappointing br br a <UNK> 4 10
<START> what kind i say about this movie well for starters i thought that this film was okay not the greatest not worst i said this cause i thought that the script was great and original really different and refreshing now i wouldn't say that it's the greatest film that i've seeing cause of the acting the actors that played each role seems that they played them without emotions as if they took the life out of them when the wife laughed or cried this didn't look real to me for some reason that's just an example but sincerely all the characters didn't act real at all i wish i could say more positive things about this film so you guys can see it at least once but how can i do that since i know that i'm not going to see this movie again i rented this film from the library of my school without hearing anything about the film itself or the director i took a chance because the story that was describe on the back sounded really interesting and it really was
<START> i wasn't even born when this series was released in the usa it took about another decade before british tv networks laid hold of it br br in fact i was fortunate enough to see the very first episode in which the lone ranger was one of a <UNK> who ran into an <UNK> and got slaughtered was the only survivor although badly wounded he was saved by a passing indian called <UNK> i believe he took to wearing a mask in order to hide his true identity for fear of but instead he made himself all the more <UNK> <UNK> if he wore it in his sleep br br this was saturday <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of william <UNK> <UNK> a dash to the telly food still in hand though it very quickly became repetitive predictable <UNK> nobody ever <UNK> him nobody ever landed a punch nobody ever out shot him he was a little too good and just a little too camp in his dress for most kids poor <UNK> on the other hand became his aunt sally he was always getting <UNK> and tied up and kidnapped and stuff br br and what did he keep calling the lone ranger <UNK> was the general <UNK> where i lived it seemed to imply 'the big know <UNK> in indian speak but is sounded like something else as if mr had a speech <UNK> what the <UNK> that br br a later and less well duo called 'the range and <UNK> eventually won my vote this featured a naked faced jock <UNK> who got beat up pretty thoroughly in each episode and was altogether less camp less super and more believable br br still even today i can't hear william <UNK> without expecting the <UNK> of <UNK> and a <UNK> hi oh silver br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> race against fear has to be one of the most moving tv movies i've seen for a long time all of the performances from the main actors were superb especially that of <UNK> richards mickey <UNK> william coach kurt and susan <UNK> margaret <UNK> <UNK> in particular put on an extremely emotional performance with facial expressions to match she portrayed the emotions that mickey was feeling perfectly and you could easily believe that she really had been raped so realistic was her performance br br <UNK> is an incredibly realistic movie due to the moving performances from the cast came across as a rapist incredibly well and you hated him more and more as the movie progressed <UNK> also put on an emotional performance as the mother of the raped girl mickey <UNK> and you felt increasingly sorry for the <UNK> family because no one believed them about the rape br br all in all <UNK> is a great movie it is both moving and full of suspense as you are continually unsure if would be <UNK> for the rape due to the lack of witnesses evidence and belief in the claim i thoroughly recommend seeing this movie
<START> it's so depressing when film makers try to be cool and it's so obvious here this has below average acting laughable dialogue split screens that are difficult to watch and many goofs in it's attempt to be a period film and <UNK> this film should be avoided at all costs i was told not to go and see this film i wish i had listened
<START> this british documentary was recently shown on comedy central during their best <UNK> week and can also be seen on south <UNK> second season dvd i remember seeing many commercials for the dvd showing clips of this documentary most of which occurs with matt stone <UNK> parker and some other guy in a hot <UNK> it was funny when i saw it in the commercials but i was used to seeing it by the time i saw the actual documentary br br overall <UNK> down to south park is a fairly funny and interesting look at how south park episodes are made and of the <UNK> history going back to when matt and <UNK> came up with the idea in college however there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt sort of depressing it's not as fast paced rapid fire and as lively as the actual south park episodes instead it kind of has a slow dry wit style which at times can be funny but most of the time you're just waiting for something to happen if you get the chance to watch it by all means go for it but i don't think you're really missing much if you never see it br br my imdb rating 7 10
<START> the first half hour of <UNK> was rather boring and not absorbing but as the film progressed so did my interest in the characters and the plot several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to the story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern california they witness the murder of the owner malcolm john <UNK> and they take over the <UNK> for their own the three rather simple minded farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest while all of the time trying to convince everyone that malcolm is still alive while the movie had several faults and a slow beginning it turned out to be worthwhile 7 10 stars
<START> back in the 60's this grim study of joy a young <UNK> wife was the introduction to the career of ken <UNK> who became one of the most distinguished and respected british filmmakers of all time by then i knew very little about <UNK> politics or the reality of the under <UNK> and i was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film its free style its <UNK> color cinematography and monologues in front of the camera i was also much surprised to find that <UNK> <UNK> who had become a celebrity thanks to billy <UNK> the collector and modesty blaise had so little screen time although 20th century fox distributed poor cow in <UNK> <UNK> did not stay in mainstream cinema which this film hardly is and i lost contact with his films i just heard of his <UNK> <UNK> family life black jack until i caught up in the 80's the beautiful title song by <UNK> by the way is available in his anthology <UNK>
<START> seems like some of the previous reviewers has seen another movie than what i saw earlier tonight actually this movie is the reason why i <UNK> at imdb sure <UNK> phillips can fight and for that i give this movie a 2 but the rest of this movie is just pure crap the acting is bad the plot is bad the camera angles are bad and the effects are bad sure the actors are in physical good shape but they cannot act sometimes i enjoy watching bad movies for the laugh but this movie had no charm and after i saw this movie i was filled with regrets for seeing it sure if you would like to see mediocre fighting without anything else then this movie is for you if not then stay away from this film ps sorry for any spelling mistakes i am just tired as a cause of this movie
<START> excellent story of lives that need <UNK> one of those rare films that i could watch with my 7 and 8 year old daughters glenn close was excellent in the title role it was also nice to see christopher walken in a more normal role
<START> this space <UNK> was kind of dumb i guess it was supposed to be a shocker unexpected ending but imho it was just a huge letdown joseph <UNK> and the rest of the <UNK> actors do a great job in this one their performances are not done justice with such a silly ending though how this ending could ever have made it through any kind of review by the producers is beyond me the other comment on here is not correct the tongue in cheek vignettes only came in during the second season this thing was supposed to be taken seriously the producers and writers could have been a little more creative with the ending to do the rest of the episode justice
<START> many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an <UNK> part of world war ii on the eastern front characters well portrayed and unforgettable one episode leaves you wishing for the next pay attention to the closing credits were the thousands of are listed an <UNK> story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals sometimes brutal sometimes romantic always filled with real people and dialog produced with excellent sets and camera work heroes and villains criminals and priests <UNK> and <UNK> portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a most terrible time i wish to buy a copy for my own collection so to be able to enjoy the series repeatedly
<START> i loved this movie not because of the romantic story lines between women but for the <UNK> of human strength despair and <UNK> this film is a must see entertaining emotional captivating all the characters are very well written and portrayed by some very talented actors this story is a story of self discovery and sexual awakening a journey of the mind body and soul you find yourself <UNK> with the characters and at some points even the storyline br br i do have to say that i recommend watching the movie first then read the book if you read the book first you will be slightly disappointed the screenplay adaption cut out a lot and some things were changed some for the better and some for the worst
<START> i've been waiting for this movie for so many years the best part is that it lives up to my visions this is a must see for any <UNK> d or true jack black fan it's just so great to see <UNK> and lee on the big screen it's not a true story but who cares the d is the greatest band on earth i had the soundtrack to the movie last week and listened to it non stop to see the movie was pure bliss for me and my <UNK> we've both met jack and kyle after 2 different <UNK> d <UNK> and also saw them when they <UNK> with <UNK> we left that concert after the d was done playing nobody can top their show long live the d d
<START> ok maybe it doesn't deserve an oscar or a golden globe or any award for that matter the acting isn't outstanding there's no reason to give credits to the directing and its really just another semi gory 21st century slasher flick that most people will consider just decent or maybe even dreadful but in my opinion all of this doesn't matter a bit and thats because i had a great time watching this movie br br sure the first 40 minutes are pretty slow but as the movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like i was and anybody else should be when watching this movie and that is looking for 2 hours of fun mindless violence and a kick ass ending which i won't spoil yes there are many flaws in this movie but don't let the cast list on the front cover fool you hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming even her greatest <UNK> like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a strip <UNK> that wasn't as nasty as anything an online pop up would promise of her but still not so unbearable as to fast forward or turn off the dvd br br the violence in this surprised me nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about these new movies called and <UNK> but i could safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing br br in conclusion i'm not surprised house of wax didn't make a place on the imdb top 250 but it is definitely worth a look
<START> right this moment i am watching this movie on tv here in tokyo beautiful scenery beautiful sets of biblical proportions beautiful costumes beautiful color beautiful gina great climactic scene when god destroys the idol and a lot more with de at the moment when <UNK> and gina are about to <UNK> their love <UNK> does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines though he sounds a lot like <UNK> delivering his lines as or george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders given the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this role gina does a good job though by the time the movie ends she is completely converted into a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and looks likes she might be playing in a biography of mother <UNK> i guess will do that to you but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she <UNK> her own beliefs for her new religion the supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing the usual big battle scenes what passed for <UNK> dances in 1959 and an orchestra <UNK> out plenty of <UNK> calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of but none of it quite of <UNK> hollywood quality the final <UNK> between <UNK> and sanders is at the <UNK> low skill level of a junior high school play the film is one big piece of eye candy but not much more
<START> it's a thoroughly successful example of a 1950s biopic it has the <UNK> and handsome young hero well not so young anymore on screen superb if unlikely direction by billy wilder a stirring fully <UNK> musical score of uplifting <UNK> and when required heavenly strings by <UNK> <UNK> strong supporting players a gripping story stunning photography by hitchcock favorite robert and a narrative about a <UNK> historical event br br the film begins with jimmy stewart as charles <UNK> trying to get some sleep in a long island hotel before his epic solo flight across the atlantic from new york to paris and he can't sleep br br the flight itself is filled with flashbacks to personal history and the purchase and construction of his unique high wing the spirit of st louis st louis <UNK> is the home of the <UNK> that <UNK> the flight even in <UNK> money talked anyway the movie had to have multiple flashbacks and stewart's narration what's the alternative <UNK> the thirty three hours of watching jimmy stewart sitting <UNK> at the controls of his <UNK> airplane while days and nights come and go i found the script and the direction impressive for their time unpleasant things are of course left out so as not to introduce more ambiguity than the contemporary audience might manage br br my bet is that the howling mob that <UNK> <UNK> at le ripped the airplane to pieces for <UNK> and of course nothing about the <UNK> relief tube though it would have added more opportunities for humor some of today's viewers will find some incidents corny if they think too much about them <UNK> stewart <UNK> with a friendly <UNK> <UNK> fly that in its own quietly concerned way wakes him up by landing on his cheek at a critical moment later the st <UNK> <UNK> that father gave him <UNK> gently against the glass crystal of one of the <UNK> just as stewart is desperately trying to land the <UNK> stewart is saved twice once by a fly and once by god br br but never mind that it's an impressive film that landing at le with an exhausted stewart behind the joy stick confused by <UNK> with fear and <UNK> with <UNK> is really convincing i'm going to tear this airplane up he tells himself and we can believe him br br flying a light plane is not at all like driving a car there is no smoothly <UNK> highway to tell you where to go no <UNK> to provide <UNK> you're busy every second you must watch the <UNK> check each <UNK> to see that they touch the horizon <UNK> the nose and constantly watch up down and <UNK> for other traffic although that last wouldn't have been much of a problem for <UNK> he was all alone over the ocean br br why in one of the movie's moment stewart and murray hamilton two gypsy of the 1920s are <UNK> near their <UNK> in a <UNK> field what is it what makes us love flying so much asks hamilton no answer later his financial <UNK> try to talk him out of the flight five other have already died trying it but don't you understand it has to be done says an <UNK> stewart br br well that's not much of an answer either why does it have to be done now and why by <UNK> why not wait ten years and stop wasting lives in the meantime the answer dear <UNK> lies partly in our <UNK> pilots are a <UNK> and confident lot given to occasional <UNK> their chief problem may be an addiction to an internal rush of <UNK> just kidding some of my best friends are pilots still <UNK> must have been quite a guy he deserved to be treated as a hero not just because of the flight itself but because of his later demeanor quiet modest a family man we can easily forget his admiration for hitler since he more than made up for it by testing <UNK> fighters in the pacific and <UNK> the navy on how to <UNK> the <UNK> and get the best performance out of them br br see it if you have the chance if nothing else it's a history lesson told with visual <UNK>
<START> i liked the movie but it should have been longer the actors did a great job de <UNK> is a fabulous actress and <UNK> is a <UNK> he didn't look like john at 100 but he did favor him from a distance i look forward to seeing more of him on the big screen he didn't have john's charisma but he definitely has a charm about himself he has beautiful eyes and a great smile he reminds me of my boyfriend alot ms <UNK> was just too <UNK> for me she should have that <UNK> checked out im not going to comment on the <UNK> hannah character my mom always said if ya can't say anything nice then shut the hell up so that's what im gonna do br br molly
<START> okay for the most part and all its cheesiness this movie was actually pretty good for an mst3k flick but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the ending spoiler alert the film is very basic a rich <UNK> boy named danny meets a bum named and the two of them travel to a small town where meets a pretty girl named carrie who is so very now this film's basic premise seemed promising enough all they needed to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romance movie carrie loves loves carrie a creepy guy in town <UNK> for carrie now i know what you're thinking fights the creep and ultimately decides to settle down with carrie and danny returns home and they all live happily ever after right wrong because carrie gets murdered by the town creep because is too gay to commit there are so many homosexual undertones between danny and and then the whole town decides to lynch even though the town creep would've easily been the prime suspect then the town creep <UNK> to killing carrie without much <UNK> must've felt bad the poor <UNK> then danny brings home with him that's the film's happily ever after sad huh all i can say is thank god for joel and the <UNK> because they turned this horse hockey into one of my favorite mst3k episodes
<START> i <UNK> the contains spoiler box in case i say anything that is a spoiler and don't realise i've said it until i re read it after i've posted so it's just in case br br anyhow back to reviewing this film br br i saw this film on earlier on this afternoon and by the description sky gives you these people must be on acid it sounded pretty good but then when i actually got about 30 minutes into it i was appalled this film in my opinion has the worst <UNK> and actors actresses ever the young girl who falls in love with the boy from l a after about 3 hours is a really stupid lame character who has an annoying <UNK> voice and hair then there's her lover who's an idiot and is also very <UNK> actually maybe they suit each other then there's the boy's mum who's with him on holiday and surprise surprise she's a doctor and oh my god wait there's even more <UNK> surprises a virus suddenly breaks out on the island and she knows all about <UNK> o shock horror yeah right lol then there's this insane religious <UNK> who keeps going on about or something and how the lord knows all everyone on the island seems to love him yet he's actually a stubborn arrogant <UNK> <UNK> you really need to watch this film just for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a swim his head is like tiny and his body is massive it's hilarious <UNK> who's had way too much to drink br br anyhow after all these weirdo characters including a stoned looking taxi driver the religious <UNK> finally gives in to the doctor and she takes a blood <UNK> and they get straight to work on finding the cure from that because for some reason he's dramatically been saved all down to and god and oh my god yes there's another surprise you'll never guess what just in the nick of time with 11 minutes to go before everybody on the island drops dead in fact including her son and his girl she finds the cure and <UNK> everybody and it's all resolved what a pathetic film i mean i knew it sounded an obvious ending from when i first started watching it but i actually though it'd be good and have some sub plot twists somewhere but no no it was just boring and dry br br don't watch this film you'll end up like me stunned for 3 hours and then demanding the hour and a half you spent of your life watching it back
<START> a delight from start to finish br br if you don't like the muppets then i just have to feel sorry for you this terrific film doesn't simply cash in on the <UNK> popularity it's a well conceived and well written film in its own right it's got great songs and it has that thread of <UNK> melancholy that was always present in jim <UNK> creations and which is most <UNK> in the character of <UNK> the frog i always <UNK> to this as a kid and it's what makes the muppets still enjoyable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children drives me crazy br br a huge cast of big names appearing in cameos makes this film feel like a kiddie sized version of around the world in 80 days except that it's about 80 times better br br grade a
<START> victor <UNK> as the devil surely somebody must have been drunk when that casting decision was made that's not the worst part of this silly <UNK> mash of <UNK> haunted house devices but it gets my vote for being the funniest part of it while the film is by no means terrible it doesn't even approach other 1970's haunted house flicks like <UNK> horror the <UNK> and the legend of hell house the evil can be entertaining in spots but don't expect to be scared it's better approached as what it is a silly horror film made all the <UNK> by it's over serious approach
<START> young warriors 1983 br br while this is a deeply flawed and in some ways idiotic movie the way it continually defies expectations makes it decent viewing for the adventurous sleaze fan br br meet <UNK> college student kevin and his gang of lovable frat boy buddies in what starts out as a particularly <UNK> teen sex comedy we follow this bunch of jerk offs and their antics which involve among other things making <UNK> tie <UNK> to their <UNK> the movie abruptly shifts <UNK> when <UNK> high school <UNK> sister is brutally raped and beaten into a coma by a gang of <UNK> who apparently have nothing better to do when she dies in the hospital kevin <UNK> revenge much to the <UNK> of his detective father br br so far we've gone from <UNK> <UNK> through last house on the left territory into what is apparently <UNK> up to be your typical urban vigilante revenge flick however kevin and his <UNK> portrayal goes from vaguely sympathetic until they become kill crazed <UNK> it's to the film's credit that it doesn't <UNK> the fascist anti crime <UNK> that kevin continually <UNK> while still making it understandable that he would feel the way he does br br the mood goes from lighthearted to <UNK> and downbeat very quickly and by the end it's so over the top and exploitative that it'll leave you <UNK> and that's the strength of this film you never know what to expect next br br at over 100 minutes it's a little lengthy for this kind of fare but you won't get bored poorly acted for the most part with cardboard <UNK> for characters and some particularly ludicrous situations and rather stupid dialogue this won't be <UNK> anyone's list of forgotten classics anytime soon i got a kick out of it though and i'm sure anyone reading this knows if they're up for it
<START> i recommend <UNK> to everyone luke wilson is very funny the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard i had tears running down my face several times until the end when i took a breath and realized just how close we are to mr <UNK> vision of tomorrow br br keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the mac commercials justin long as dr <UNK> i found his performance oscar worthy especially considering what oscars have been handed out for in the recent past besides he's cute br br in short <UNK> is a <UNK> funny glimpse into a possible future where people are named after product brand names the <UNK> middle name is mountain <UNK> hospital visits cost 5 billion dollars there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it all and nobody cares about anything but money all because only stupid people are <UNK> sounds familiar to me somehow oh yeah it's what i think of when i see professional wrestling br br seriously watch this movie it's a good laugh and it will make you think
<START> although i am not a michael jackson fan i like some of his early songs and some from jackson 5 too <UNK> is one of his great songs and it comes from the best selling album ever with the same title as for the video it is awesome one of michael's best but also very eccentric and weird br br there is a story behind this video but it's so complex that even i can't fully understand it it's freaky the <UNK> things are jackson's transformation into a werewolf his evil red eyes at the end like a werewolf and those dead people dancing br br the video is very dark thrilling <UNK> and original there are great <UNK> and settings the music itself is full of life and rhythm characteristic from the good old pop from the 80's br br i like vincent <UNK> <UNK> he does a great narration with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laughter at the end is awesome my favorite videos of the <UNK> of <UNK> are <UNK> jean and don't stop <UNK> you get enough both among his best songs
<START> a respectable royal <UNK> event br br 1 edge vs shawn michaels br br 7 5 10 a very strong opener <UNK> performance was sublime as it was during the <UNK> event overall id say edges night br br 2 undertaker vs <UNK> match br br 7 10 a lot of people hated this rivalry though i liked it i thought really played his character well the match wasn't amazing in excitement that was until kane and get involved it gets better as it goes on br br 3 kurt angle vs big show vs <UNK> wwe <UNK> wwe title match br br 7 5 10 a surprisingly good match as there was only 1 really exciting in <UNK> in it angle of course very good title match good pace though a predictable end but aren't all royal <UNK> title matches predictable br br 4 triple h world title vs randy <UNK> world title match br br 6 5 10 actually not that good for the guys involved went on too many dry <UNK> <UNK> sold his <UNK> amazingly ending though was some what of an anti climax br br 5 royal <UNK> event btw during the other matches there were a few segments two which were really cool cena <UNK> on christian and <UNK> stealing <UNK> number 30 entry ticket the event was good 7 10 would have got a 9 if cena won but unfortunately my biggest enemy <UNK> wins though i understood why vince comes down and takes a drop and the whole <UNK> crack up in laughter
<START> valentine and joe the judge <UNK> join forces to clean up the mean streets of <UNK> thrill as they put the <UNK> on international heroin <UNK> polish <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> girlfriends <UNK> dogs and who are too lazy to bin their don't be fooled by the <UNK> <UNK> ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious art house flick this movie is 100 action
<START> here's one of the more <UNK> <UNK> 70's <UNK> <UNK> items it's a <UNK> low rent <UNK> <UNK> which comes across like a <UNK> version of the mack john daniels the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hero mr jonathan in the immortal black <UNK> gives an excellent <UNK> portrayal of the baron a ruthless business <UNK> forever on the make all powerful flesh <UNK> who much to the <UNK> of his bitter brutal italian rivals <UNK> supreme over the sunset strip when not <UNK> <UNK> with his fellow no count criminal pals or doing his best to avoid being <UNK> by the local vice cops daniels is leading a <UNK> average existence as your standard garden variety <UNK> dude complete with caring wife and loving kids in some typically <UNK> california small town br br the <UNK> absurd premise alone promises top rate trashy greatness of a decidedly grade b schlock picture variety george deserves kudos for his hilariously ludicrous script matt <UNK> <UNK> and tasteless direction delivers the <UNK> goods by the slimy <UNK> thus making this film a hugely enjoyable serving of celluloid <UNK> among the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to be <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> gratuitous female nudity coarse dialogue beautifully <UNK> me decade threads <UNK> tops felt hats <UNK> day <UNK> jewelry loud suits an intensely funky r b score by smoke some hopelessly pathetic acting the little old lady who lives next door to daniels is excruciatingly shrill a <UNK> nasty turn by patrick wright as a sadistic <UNK> a couple of cool action set pieces the climactic slow motion <UNK> massacre seriously <UNK> more lurid <UNK> footage of the sunset strip than you can shake a <UNK> <UNK> at said footage allegedly includes the actual <UNK> and <UNK> of the sunset strip in hollywood effectively cinematography by ken a few <UNK> sexual fetish <UNK> some raw explicit violence a prostitute has one of her breasts cut off and amusing supporting performances by familiar schlock feature richard kennedy and george buck flower as a pair of racist corrupt <UNK> police detectives sure this movie ain't art but it's certainly <UNK> enough to qualify as a deliciously <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> cinematic <UNK>
<START> in my opinion the movie was laughable bad dialogue whoever wrote the script please keep your day job it's definitely no godfather or <UNK> it's good to be on the of the table poor choice of words some of the characters were <UNK> but what do you expect from a low budget movie with no name actors
<START> this film is about a young indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself getting engaged to a woman the problem is that he is gay in order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay one lie leads to another until it <UNK> out of control br br this film is hilarious and got me laughing many times sally acting is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly the plot is outstanding as well i find the plot very realistic and i can completely identify with feeling of being terrified worried and upset on the other hand boyfriend jack is given much less attention in the film i would have liked him to be given more lines in the film and have more character development however as i guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film the love between <UNK> and jack was not developed in the film br br it is great to watch a gay <UNK> film furthermore this film <UNK> us to be accepting to other people's difference be it sexuality culture and the way of life this film makes viewers think hard br br we need films like this to give us a boost thanks for making this film
<START> not for those <UNK> <UNK> etc it's a good movie looking at after war <UNK> problem from the other point of view br br <UNK> <UNK> is great as a young man haunted by the demons of vietnam war causing problem in family br br <UNK> sheen is also good as a conservative father br br it all comes down to the problem how to deal with the past with whom br br character can't seem to deal and martin <UNK> character don't want do deal with br br protective mother looks at this problem with warm and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons
<START> from hardly alien sounding <UNK> to an <UNK> school style <UNK> crash is better classified as a <UNK> mix of fake blood and bare chest the almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of cohesive or effective story the acting however is not nearly as <UNK> many of the young aspiring actors admirably showcase a hidden talent particularly don and jamie who shed a well needed <UNK> of light on this otherwise terrible film would have never shown up on set had he known the terrible movie making talent of this small <UNK> town
<START> reading the other two comments i had to wonder if i had seen the same movie br br perhaps life is drastically different in australia but wow call it sci fi or fantasy but people just don't act like this br br i couldn't pass up this review without commenting on it myself it gets better after the first half hour but i doubt most could make it that far br br <UNK>
<START> this movie gives you more of an how <UNK> act even though the castle is a great australian movie it's a bit out there this movie is by far the best aussie flick i have seen haven't seen dirty deeds yet and probably would be my favourite movie the point is if you haven't seen it go see it if a crime action comedy is your thing
<START> i think its safe to say that if you only really watch box office standard films or any <UNK> production don't bother with this film as you will hate it if you are an overly critical film buff don't bother either if you love science fiction films and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future in then you'll be mildly entertained it is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the <UNK> scenes were terrible but it is quite obvious that they had some good support from a computer perspective as the planet scenes and the alien images were quite inventive the dialog is down right hilarious but acting not altogether poor as for the story well i'm not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth
<START> i was glad that this movie did without all the supposed depth of all too many pseudo serious <UNK> movies race was one issue yes but so was class and loyalty and honesty etc br br i also loved the idea that the love affair wasn't <UNK> solely in the aspects of either character's appearance aren't our divorce <UNK> on both sides of the atlantic i <UNK> filled now with enough couples who thought good together ' is all it takes to make a solid marriage in any case the <UNK> and <UNK> of both characters was thick enough to cut in love scenes that would have brought a <UNK> to any dreary day in other words a light hearted movie that's by no means a light weight
<START> <UNK> and jones <UNK> in this movie but not in the way we think of <UNK> today it's very subtle and under the surface yet <UNK> jennifer jones in particular is so sexually hot in this film much more than a caricature like monroe ever was because she creates a real woman with all <UNK> of <UNK> she's intelligent <UNK> <UNK> she's <UNK> and <UNK> br br there's a scene on that famous hill where she's lying down in the grass looking up at <UNK> and the expression in her eyes is x rated yet in the context of the scene and character in makes complete sense you don't need to have it all said in the dialogue spelled out like the crude <UNK> in most modern films it's all there in her eyes sexy yet elegant what a stunning under rated actress she was i saw her <UNK> <UNK> for the first time recently and was equally blown away i'll take her over bergman davis or the two any day
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br old detroit is back with the giant <UNK> <UNK> corporation continuing to swallow everything in it's path as construction of the new <UNK> city continues and a new menace to <UNK> with in the shape of cain a cruel drug lord with <UNK> of christ <UNK> a deadly new <UNK> on the streets called <UNK> as he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him the tin <UNK> hero sets out to bring this villain down only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of <UNK> metal with <UNK> out of action a ruthless business woman <UNK> plans for her new <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it which cain fits perfectly after a brief <UNK> in his system <UNK> returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with cain br br the original <UNK> is a film that always manages to <UNK> you each time you watch it no matter how many times you've seen it one of those films that just can't be done again that said it's not surprising a sequel was made it's even less surprising that that sequel really <UNK> compared to the original empire strikes back director <UNK> <UNK> has crafted an unpleasant slightly incoherent and overlong film that can't capture the magic of the first film no matter how hard it tries and it certainly does that the funny ads from the first film running none stop the corporate satire aiming to be that bit <UNK> and the action roaring as fast and furious as before but with blood gore even <UNK> than the first film the first film earned a name for some nasty blood <UNK> violence including a man's <UNK> being blown off and a man being <UNK> to pieces but while that was more memorable the violence gore on display here is of a more sadistic and gratuitous nature with a very unpleasant and mean spirited tone to it br br but overall the film leaves you with a feeling of general <UNK> why are you watching this when you could be watching the original again instead
<START> this film is about a teen who is struggling with his social status in school he is a good christian and feels that he is missing out on all the fun in high school so he wishes he had never become one after getting his wish and trying a <UNK> lifestyle he realizes that his quality of life has been dramatically <UNK> and wants to go back to being the person that he was good family oriented film with a positive message of being proud of who you are even if you're not the most popular
<START> very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad this movie is a prime example of present day england and the mindset there is no mention of jesus in this movie nor does the movie feature any type of <UNK> christianity as most know it br br i am also very surprised because this film is a bbc program and the bbc is quit well known for their quality <UNK> but it looks like the <UNK> attempt to rival the hollywood psycho drama films are failing completely br br poor acting poor plot poor culture that seems to be without religion i would not even bother buying this instead better to try to rent this one or buy it when it goes to the 2 dollar bin
<START> this second pairing of <UNK> e <UNK> and the road runner is a great as the first predictable maybe but i don't care and still laugh so much whenever i see it the <UNK> e road runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart so knowing that the second disc of the golden collection would not only feature 11 of this but they would be in <UNK> order 2 through 12 the first episode was on volume 1 made me get misty eyed i love this stuff this animated short can be seen on disc 2 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 it also features an <UNK> commentary by micheal <UNK> br br my grade a
<START> shameless waste of my time as a viewer this is one of the worst films i've seen in ages please do not rent it as you will regret doing so guaranteed i wonder how kathleen turner ended up in this she is a legitimate actress and people would perhaps be attracted to this film because of her but it really is better to act as if this title was never made it should not have come into existence
<START> this movie came highly recommended but i am not sure why i am not really and adam sandler fan though apart from in 50 first dates where he <UNK> from his usual angry man routine damon wayans is an undercover cop and adam sandler is the guy he <UNK> to be friends with for a year in order to bust him naturally sandler is rather angry about this betrayal cue angry shouting and silly <UNK> from the king of variety they end up on the run and of course they become friends again after a big <UNK> involving sandler shooting wayans in the head he survives thus he is <UNK> need i go on you will work out what is going to happen if you do watch it anyway when our dvd player kept <UNK> hey it was 80 from the supermarket ok it was commented that the player knew the film was boring and was <UNK> to play it
<START> i enjoyed the movie and <UNK> <UNK> performance immensely it's the kind of movie i can show my family and has an example of a young woman placed in extraordinary circumstances finding the courage to do the right thing in the face of extreme danger
<START> somehow i really thought that i was going to enjoy this film because i love pictures with mountain climbing and a great mystery in the plot i must say that the photography was fantastic and there was some scary scenes that captured my attention i thought that nicole <UNK> diana <UNK> thank you good night <UNK> played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets up with some characters who want her to guide them up the mountain marc singer angel blade <UNK> played a very unconvincing weird guy and over acted in many scenes with a bad temper that looked comical this film was a big disappointed and not worth watching unless there is nothing on the tv to enjoy
<START> don't get me wrong this was fun to watch it has some nice animation with exception of an odd looking bugs and some nice music and the standout scene was definitely elmer bugs and dance on the floor that was such a nice and fun touch as a matter of fact the whole cartoon is nice to watch but all in all it is not what i call exceptional like there are some very nice gags but they have been used before i feel and there wasn't much that i would <UNK> hilarious and <UNK> joining forces with elmer somehow seeing as he was a target of the hunter didn't it seem odd that he would be friends with him though i will admit it was nice having <UNK> there the voice acting was above average too but somehow i missed mel <UNK> br br all in all <UNK> but very nice cartoon 7 10 <UNK> cox
<START> the worst movie i've ever seen in my life from the amateur directing to the porn quality acting it looks like a home movie somebody decided to shoot <UNK> they had nothing else to do with their time br br unless you have no hope left in life absolutely avoid this crap br br
<START> this film has the guts to suggest that it might be best to simply accept your life as it is and keep smiling anyway as one who is more excited by the idea of taking charge of one's life and moving forward i felt slapped in the face but that's okay i don't have to agree with a movie to love it and respect it great acting by streep and hurt and everyone else really and some wonderfully quirky scenes a serious film and take a <UNK>
<START> ugly women of the flick <UNK> the bottom of the midnight movie barrel combining <UNK> sleaze with the <UNK> of girls in the shower clich√©s linda blair plays an innocent sent to jail we learn she was involved in running over some guy with her car facing hard time in the big house with some of the <UNK> characters this side of a russ meyer <UNK> blair is continually <UNK> at <UNK> raped <UNK> and <UNK> the dialogue is four letter word disgusting throughout and the flick offers no let up from its <UNK> of violence and stupidity still some viewers see this as a camp classic though perhaps its tongue isn't far enough in cheek from
<START> i have been a fan of the <UNK> for a long time read the biography watched the <UNK> and saw the karen carpenter story this movie really didn't show the real karen carpenter in the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner except for one girl friend the real karen carpenter was much different she was <UNK> and friendly she had lots of friends especially <UNK> <UNK> john the movie doesn't even show <UNK> attempts for a solo album and her meeting phil <UNK> and his wife itchy karen itchy knew the real karen carpenter in new york when karen was in new york she did see a psychologist but it was <UNK> and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room also karen was taking <UNK> to increase her so she could loss weight but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too also the <UNK> husband in the movie is named bob knight but in real life was named tom also karen wasn't divorced from tom but only separated karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died also <UNK> found karen naked in the closet unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white the music was very good that was the only thing i would recommend on seeing it
<START> i wish there were more films about middle aged people the intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing there seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men amy <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment reverse the roles and one could expect a <UNK> of <UNK> towards the man if she found her husband boring and <UNK> she could could have told him so left and waited for a no doubt large financial <UNK> upon divorce the country and london scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich while the <UNK> weather adds to the melancholy background superbly the ending is perfect so in tune with real adult life
<START> there are about ten minutes about half way through when one suddenly sees the <UNK> of an interesting idea themes of revenge and <UNK> come into focus during robert <UNK> brief screen time sadly then <UNK> its course as a thoroughly predictable and boring slasher film
<START> may contain spoilers in no way shape or form does this movie break the horror movie mold not by a long shot however it does deliver a creepy atmosphere believable enough characters and gore br br the story is simple and doesn't bother to itself anymore than it needs to a bunch of kids are killed in a mining accident back in the early <UNK> since then they have stalked and killed the <UNK> of their sleepy little <UNK> town in the mountains br br simple they want revenge on the man that caused their death years and years ago naturally his great great great <UNK> is in town and he's a real <UNK> br br along with that a mother and her two daughters <UNK> a run old house after the husband dies the <UNK> daughter is rebellious obnoxious a typical teen the younger is curious bright eyed and gets in with the ghost children br br the <UNK> part of this flick is the sheer of the children and they hack their way through victim after victim excellent acting it was so spooky i mean the children of the corn flicks are one thing but this topped any of those as for the creepy kids br br a look i bought it before seeing it and i was not unhappy but i'm a horror fan through and through
<START> donald sutherland an american <UNK> visiting england picks up a <UNK> <UNK> one evening two years later having discovered the man's address book in his car he returns the book to the man's <UNK> home only to find that the man's been <UNK> for murder nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the <UNK> <UNK> could not have committed the murder of his own stepmother because he was in <UNK> car at the time of the crime br br sutherland is the man's <UNK> but he's turned up too late out of a sense of guilt he tracks down the real murderer br br agatha <UNK> mysteries usually involve a number of diverse people all of them with one or another motive for the crime all of them suspect and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict time line there is often not always a sidekick with whom the investigator can talk things over br br because of the of the situation due care must be taken to explain each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer <UNK> is perfectly okay we have to keep the characters and the time lines straight <UNK> movies are of the rare kind in which the use of famous faces in <UNK> characters is actually useful <UNK> de oh yes that's <UNK> <UNK> but this version of ordeal by innocence is a <UNK> <UNK> production with all that implies in the way of production values a <UNK> prepared script and skill behind the camera br br the first few minutes in which sutherland discovers that an innocent man has been <UNK> are fine after that everything is <UNK> at the viewer in disjointed <UNK> often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing <UNK> that tell us nothing the script has a <UNK> quality as if thrown together by two <UNK> overnight few of the faces are familiar and that doesn't help at all everyone drops remarks about everyone else and the names become a hopeless <UNK> the musical score consists of four <UNK> doing irritating jazz <UNK> some nudity is thrown in to wake up the in the audience if dame agatha were alive she'd be among the viewers who needed to be <UNK> awake br br <UNK>
<START> as a true lover of film i must advise you to avoid this appalling effort god knows how funding was <UNK> seriously this is one cinematic experience which delivers zero dramatic tension and <UNK> along until nothing happens again and again and again the only <UNK> is two scares which at least keep you awake the worst film i have ever witnessed and the acting by the female lead is <UNK> on criminal intent one <UNK> with modern technology you can fast forward and watch it on and it will only last 25 minutes and you won't miss any of the plot br br no idea how people find this at all interesting and some are giving it high marks
<START> <UNK> east was a big disappointment for me but the saddest thing about this movie is that it turned out to be john <UNK> last film role he died just before shooting was completed on this there are only a few laughs throughout this western spoof and for a comedy that doesn't cut it if you want to see a <UNK> spoof of western movies the answer is obvious see mel <UNK> classic blazing <UNK> or if you want to see candy in much better material see summer rental <UNK> or uncle buck just to name a few these three movies as well as others shows us what a great comic actor he was <UNK> east does not what a shame br br out of four
<START> crossing the bridge the sound of <UNK> received one of the most <UNK> applause from the audience when it ended and very <UNK> so i did not expect too much from a musical documentary but the movie proved to be much more than that it was also a visual documentary of <UNK> with stark <UNK> of old and new western and eastern poor and rich modern and traditional black and white photographs of old <UNK> by world famous photographer were exceptional but of course main theme was music and by god what a variety of it it was in a way similar to <UNK> social club the love and the respect of the <UNK> alexander here replacing ray <UNK> for the musicians <UNK> from the screen and <UNK> us all the music was mostly very interesting the jazz session by a group of <UNK> <UNK> in a small western turkish town was mind blowing i will not be surprised if the travel agents start getting group <UNK> <UNK> for after the movie is released but i most loved who looked amazingly elegant in a sort of <UNK> way and whilst <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> my voice and i are <UNK> years old well done faith akin i bet there are many more turkish musicians who are feeling left out go for volume ii please
<START> this was the most thought provoking capital punishment movie ever it refused to seem one sided and the emotions felt throughout the story are as real as it can get this movie had one of the most <UNK> and i use this term in a good way compassionate religious character ever this movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book which is rare for me sister helen <UNK> more of a spiritual tone than a religious which is also rare and it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldn't feel that a point was left out and we have the director to thank for that this is not a film for entertainment but it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart i can't think of another film like it
<START> some slack might be cut this movie due to the fact that it was made in 1979 that much said it really is pretty dire br br never mind the laughable back projection or the awful awful camera tracking of supposed in flight objects it's the stunts that the <UNK> pulls off that will have you <UNK> in disbelief at the absurdity barrel rolls loop the <UNK> and violent <UNK> <UNK> left me wondering why the air forces of the world didn't just fly as their main fighters br br so here are the important lessons i learned from this celluloid cheese fest br br 1 the <UNK> is at least as <UNK> as a phantom 4 jet fighter br br 2 you can fire a <UNK> gun at <UNK> 2 simply by opening the <UNK> window and sticking your arm out br br 3 if the <UNK> gun fails to <UNK> do not drop it as it may then go off br br 4 the <UNK> can dodge up to two <UNK> <UNK> fired at it at once br br 5 a <UNK> will distract a heat seeking missile every time br br 6 switching off your jet <UNK> is a sure fire way of throwing heat seeking <UNK> off track if 5 above fails br br 7 when performing a crash landing in the <UNK> it is apparently impossible to <UNK> your fuel beforehand br br 8 <UNK> pilots are all combat trained veterans br br as you might imagine this film is not very realistic the effects are primitive by today's standards and that coupled with the nonsense <UNK> the <UNK> performs makes this a movie deserving of little but <UNK> br br not recommended not recommended at all
<START> first let me confess that i have not read this particular <UNK> novel so maybe i am directing my <UNK> unfairly at director and editor still my experience with <UNK> in other stories is that he writes as a <UNK> not an this is most certainly a film worth one's while but one is left sorely puzzled at the end was the colonel a fraud used by the lawyer for his own ends or for whose beyond himself or was the colonel not a fraud but used as <UNK> by the lawyer or did the lawyer truly try to serve the honest colonel the director and or the editor appear to me to have deliberately <UNK> these questions which doesn't seem like <UNK> the <UNK> at the same time the film does an excellent job of <UNK> the characters if not their motives and the cast and production is superb that opening battlefield scene is bound to haunt one's dreams still one wonders at the all too common <UNK> among contemporary film makers to favor ambiguity above all else weren't the problems and motives of all these characters complicated enough for <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i'm a fan of get <UNK> this is the sequel for the movie that needed no sequel br br <UNK> is back but <UNK> russo is gone without a <UNK> unfortunately game was played out in the first movie and rather than find an interesting personal arc for him they just have him stand around repeating lines from the first movie it's pretty tepid travolta looks old here it's like they move people around him because his bones are getting <UNK> his pink lip <UNK> and the blue eye contacts are very weird the 2nd bad role is edie played by uma thurman she's a music producer a role that requires her only to be the female <UNK> <UNK> hey these kids have a great new sound in any scene she strikes the wrong pitch or emotionally or both it's painful to watch despite it's <UNK> problems be cool gets better after a very <UNK> start br br i certainly got my laughs out of it vince <UNK> running around on fire cedric the entertainer ludicrous the rock a t shirt that says widow on it but it offers no great memories after it's over it's a <UNK> light love fest from the first frame there's no one as <UNK> idiotic as gene hackman in the first movie it's just about doing good in the world for a couple of kids who deserve a chance <UNK> the rock ho hum the first one wasn't preachy br br working in repeatedly gags lines from the first movie is annoying as is the dumb <UNK> to the <UNK> wrestling fans he raises his <UNK> twice as are the <UNK> inside jokes steven tyler saying i'm not the kind of singer that make appearances in movies <UNK> <UNK> br br the all star spectacular line up is part of the problem the first movie wasn't <UNK> by stars br br for a buck rental let's call it even
<START> because i would have never ever seen this movie through to the end although there are some but not many funny moments in this movie i couldn't understand more than about 15 the fancy english couple in the 3rd story included of what people were saying three short stories none with a real point with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people i could have imagined and a load of foul language didn't find it funny didn't find it amusing didn't find any sense in it 4 10
<START> a movie this dumb should never see the light of day the acting is lame the violence is just all over the place the <UNK> ending is just plain stupid br br it's all about a lawyer who saw a murder done by the r i c c o squad no one has never seen him not even the hit men themselves so he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this r i c c o squad before they find them br br then the movie goes on to a romance gun shooting and voodoo now how in the hell did voodoo come in this never see this film if your life depends on it trust me
<START> flat spoilers br br five <UNK> students nelson <UNK> sutherland david kevin bacon rachel julia roberts joe <UNK> william baldwin randy oliver <UNK> decide to attempt an experiment dying for exactly 5 minutes it is the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before being risk of brain damage br br almost everyone does this experiment randy being the lone exception but they begin to have <UNK> <UNK> david sees a little black girl shouting crude insults to him joe sees all the women he has had sex with and which he <UNK> asking him why from the tv screen rachel <UNK> her father's suicide and nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions br br why are they here and how will they get rid of them this tense and interesting movie set in an city and into a gothic <UNK> school is quite the experience both for the story and the characters played by then budding stars such as <UNK> sutherland julia roberts oliver <UNK> kevin bacon and william baldwin br br the director is joel <UNK> who had already worked with sutherland in <UNK> <UNK> and this second <UNK> is even better than the first br br a must for psychological thriller horror <UNK> and metaphor lovers this story is about forgiveness and <UNK> of past <UNK> this is one of the minor classics from the '80s that get respect even today like the mention by rebecca in <UNK> <UNK> or the calling episode which used the movie's premise br br 9 10
<START> i went to see this film at the cinema on the strength of its potentially interesting subject matter good cast a director who had previously done the highly rated once were warriors and my liking for noir ish films set in l a in the forties and fifties i would argue that i am reasonably easy to please in this film category i appreciate the classics of the genre but i will sit through and enjoy a half decent if derivative effort as well however i found this film completely unbearable br br despite a good situation in which to place the story nobody seems to do or say anything remotely interesting or entertaining in the whole two hours plus of this sorry mess good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassing the narrative is slack and drags <UNK> and none of the events it depicts is handled well enough to do anything other than bore the audience to death there is no drama no atmosphere no tension absolutely no entertainment value and by the end i simply didn't care what happened because i did not believe in anything in the film br br l a <UNK> came out a year later and regardless of whether one version of the story is more true to life the latter film deservedly gets all the <UNK> for its excellence in every department <UNK> falls by contrast fails in every department a fact made all the more tragic by the amount of talent involved if they ever show this on a plane i will still walk out
<START> first of all i hate those moronic <UNK> who <UNK> act if they had a gun pressed against their <UNK> all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like version of gangsters br br the movie doesn't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we're already at the warehouse there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie except for the homeless guy who is also the only one with half a brain br br bill paxton and william <UNK> are both hill <UNK> and character is just as much a villain as the gangsters i <UNK> like him right from the start br br the movie is filled with pointless violence and walter hills <UNK> people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no one everybody dies except from paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve br br the only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the <UNK> but they're actors by profession not annoying ugly brain dead <UNK> br br stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead at <UNK> they have characters you care about a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast
<START> robert deniro and eddie murphy what a team while <UNK> russo william and that guy from the everyday video are alongside for the ride this is a funny and a great movie not only is it that but it's a good buddy flick br br tom <UNK> shanghai <UNK> directs this hell of a movie from start to finish it was a masterpiece no slapstick humor here but good old time laughs making fun of all other cop flicks to name a few lethal weapon beverly hills cop fifteen minutes and etc br br if you want to see a movie see this one you'll love it it has a wonderful cast and crew so get off your a from watching cops and watch showtime for a cop film and remember they'll be your neighbor at um um oh at friday nights at 8 00 man everyone says i'm a bad writer
<START> blake <UNK> tried very hard to change julie andrews image in this film he tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was i think they were both still a bit <UNK> that julie had not been chosen to film her broadway success of <UNK> and was passed over as not being sexy enough unfortunately they chose this vehicle to try and <UNK> this belief it gets to the point where it is almost funny seeing rock hudson who we all know now was gay kissing julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie it seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that julie was a femme fatale but that rock was straight sadly they have absolutely no chemistry together and the <UNK> kissing scenes start <UNK> one out the other error they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making it is almost three separate movies there is the drama of julie as the german spy trying to get military secrets from rock there is an air war movie with lots of footage of wwi vintage planes <UNK> about and there is the stupid attempts at humor that blake <UNK> seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not in this case it was not the only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely dame julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell like soprano of course if you love her you may overlook the weaknesses of this film just because of her you can always tell yourself afterward that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through star
<START> i thought it was weird and just gory not scary i have seen a couple of the japanese horror films <UNK> and and loved them but this movie was a disappointment it never even explained anything about the curse i just didn't see any horror it wasn't scary to me at all the whole time i was watching i was waiting for to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now if this was some ancient curse why didn't it happen before father and it never told us what happened to her father i kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it just ended i was very disappointed
<START> my wife and i never got into the movie we thought it was way to and to many subtitles i understood they needed them for vietnam but took to long to get out of asia she wanted it off i said it's going to get better it never did yes they had a tough time trying to get to america but i wanted to see him looking and finding his dad not at the end but <UNK> a relationship did i mention it was i love to watch a movie to feel good not sad at the end i know they don't make many good movies now days i think action movies are the only ones to watch i have been renting a lot from netflix and now blockbuster maybe 20 are worth seeing i don't <UNK> realism or facts just a movie thats fun and makes you feel good gary
<START> <UNK> is one of those movies which sort of fell through the cracks but deserves better when i first saw it i had a luke warm reaction but over time it's really grown on me no pun intended the more i see it the more i appreciate it the writing is top notch as is the acting throw in a few surprising cameos and good direction and you end up with a great little film br br it's also good to finally see hank <UNK> get a chance to shine in a starring role and <UNK> delivers his usual quality performance even relative newcomer ryan <UNK> delivers playing a friendly innocent with wit and subtlety br br on a side note <UNK> is simply a must see if you're a billy bob <UNK> fan it appears stephen <UNK> was influenced by earlier <UNK> projects like one false move and <UNK> blade though <UNK> is certainly a lot more tongue in cheek than either and <UNK> role as a character who is both sophisticated and down to earth is a perfect match for the actor
<START> i was a still photographer working in europe the summer that jim shot the movie three br br i did some <UNK> pictures for him one of which i was told became the poster for the movie i didn't see the film until years later i thought it was bad a pity because the elements that went into it were compelling <UNK> girlfriend was as beautiful as <UNK> herself asked if i would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice i said sure but i had to return to ny promising i'd be back alas i never did get back one of life's <UNK> <UNK> br br i wish i could post the pictures i made somewhere br br <UNK>
<START> from start to finish this <UNK> classic two <UNK> from the hal roach studios seems to sum up what was fun about the <UNK> it stars the now forgotten comic genius <UNK> chase and was directed by the legendary leo <UNK> who was unknown then but would earn his keep with roach and graduate to <UNK> <UNK> in the 30's and 40's recently released onto video and disc this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages although today his star has virtually <UNK> <UNK> chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the <UNK> years of the <UNK> he helped the careers of stan laurel and oliver hardy before they were brought together as a team leo <UNK> and a host of other talents it is a shame that he is all but remembered today check out this little gem of a film once you do you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic he had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive <UNK> this lost giant of a film from a <UNK> era and its giant star
<START> where to begin this film is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of <UNK> however if you live outside the us and do follow the game it is laughable various <UNK> traditions such as the which is <UNK> by the new zealand all blacks and only by the all blacks the leader of the is usually the member of the team with the best <UNK> this is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been <UNK> and represented by the writer the film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over all execution that lets it down heavily taking into account is is based on a real story it does <UNK> a great deal of clich√©s in the storyline i would strongly suggest that any american interested in <UNK> watch this film then watch what <UNK> actually is on youtube because the <UNK> portrayed in this film has been distorted and <UNK> so far from what it really is
<START> made the same year as the first <UNK> films this is a much more dramatic short than the brothers attempted until the following year's the surviving print is very rough but this only adds to the visual violence as huge of water dash against a <UNK> <UNK> and seem ready to <UNK> the camera the viewer br br if you watch a number of these early shorts in <UNK> order and try to get into the mindset of the times there is a further shock in that unlike the single frame set ups of the <UNK> this film features an edit which for me at any rate was as <UNK> as the razor blade in <UNK> <UNK> br br unlike the <UNK> vision of the films paul opens up the possibility of multiple perspectives <UNK> the viewer from the power of nature <UNK> its grasp in a way the <UNK> never could the second shot features a similar <UNK> to that of <UNK> but is less frightening because by way of the edit we have <UNK> the danger in a film like or du nature stands indifferent and powerful by the camera basic film <UNK> puts an end to its supremacy
<START> now i watched this when i was <UNK> one sunday and my <UNK> and uncle were visiting one day with my 2 cousins one was 11 the other 9 we stuck on the tv and <UNK> to paris had just started my cousins both had said that they watch two of a kind sometimes and i said they could watch the film if they liked since i was in no fit state to get up i just stayed in the living room with them and ended up watching the film i have to say as a person who has no interest in those kinds of tv shows or films i actually enjoyed it it must have been the alcohol lol but i do admit it would probably only appeal more to girls aged between 6 and 13 but it was a movie to pass the time there's always a movie or a show that you don't think you'll like but for a laugh you enjoyed it
<START> perhaps the worst of the nemesis films and that says a lot this mess features so many flashbacks to part 2 that you might as well say that you've seen them both even if you've only endured this entry making matters worse are two <UNK> <UNK> who have absolutely no entertainment value in other words they are a perfect fit for this endlessly boring cinematic mistake
<START> most of the comments on this movie are positive so i thought i would try and <UNK> the balance i came out of this movie wondering what was going on i now know and still consider it to be a poor movie i <UNK> a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious i was glad that i had a free ticket to the movie or i would have asked for my money back movie reviewers and critics love this movie which only <UNK> to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film the 8 rating this movie has is so misleading in 20 years time this film will not compare to true <UNK> such as the godfather the film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isn't enough to save the film nor are the lesbian scenes
<START> stephen <UNK> <UNK> todd the demon <UNK> of fleet street opened on broadway on 1 march 1979 with <UNK> and angela lansbury in the leading roles although it swept virtually every award imaginable the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at performances fortunately however the play then went on tour and along the way was captured on film the result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring george who replaced and lansbury in a close <UNK> of the original broadway staging br br there is however a flaw simply stated stage plays do not film very well for a performance that works well on the stage must fill the theatre and is therefore very very large and when placed on film such performances often seem slightly static <UNK> aggressive or both <UNK> todd is no exception seen on film it has a stand and sing quality and while both and lansbury seem to have <UNK> their performances for the sake of the camera such is not the case with <UNK> <UNK> as joanna her larger than life performance reads on film as <UNK> frantic and her extremely operatic voice feels out of place when <UNK> with the voices of the overall cast br br taking this stage play on film effect into consideration however this really is an exceptional performance of a unique and <UNK> comic musical in the <UNK> style lansbury is astonishing a mixture of silliness stupidity and cunning <UNK> while truly owns the role of the psychotic <UNK> whose <UNK> go to their graves <UNK> <UNK> the overall cast is quite fine and although the film does not let us see quite enough of the set there is enough on display for it to be impressive and the music who can argue with what most consider <UNK> finest work the story itself is extremely well known particularly in england in <UNK> thomas <UNK> together several urban <UNK> for a short story he titled a string of <UNK> within a year or so it was adapted to the stage as <UNK> todd the demon <UNK> of fleet street and in an era that knew little of <UNK> law variations of the play were soon playing all over england each one however was more or less the same <UNK> todd a <UNK> kills the men who come to him for a <UNK> mrs <UNK> his associate <UNK> them up into <UNK> and <UNK> them to an unsuspecting public the <UNK> version is specifically based on a 1973 version by christopher bond br br the story is very grand <UNK> with a lot of blood bodies dropping down and grotesque humor at the same time however the music lyrics and subplot of an innocent in the <UNK> of evil open out the subject to numerous <UNK> charms one would not expect <UNK> lyrics are often ironic but never more so than here he <UNK> a great deal of wicked satire re industry and capitalism along the way and certainly one cannot fault the strange yet victorian elegant of his complex music br br like the concert version starring and <UNK> this particular film also provides us with several <UNK> that were cut from the 2007 tim burton film version most particularly the opening attend the tale of <UNK> todd which runs like a thread throughout the play it is also in my opinion considerably more comic than the film which tends to comedy in favor of a still greater show of blood whatever the case if you are a fan of the story this is the legendary broadway show on tour and it is a knock out recommended br br <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> ok at the time of writing <UNK> people voted for this movie bringing it to a 5 out of 10 rating my guess is that only the film crew voted so i'm here to bring some justice to it all br br never has a movie <UNK> the audience's intelligence more than this one given i laughed out loud quite a bit but the movie story absolutely didn't want me to br br i've seen a lot of bad movies a lot but man this one blows them all away br br speaking <UNK> computers ridiculous acting and wheelchair chases and we have young who can't get their ideas <UNK> <UNK> life's a cruel joke
<START> an unintentionally hilarious early <UNK> melodrama with kay francis as the <UNK> chasing everything in pants at the beginning of the film she throws back the for being too young before setting off for the <UNK> the high toned english set she moves in is such a clich√©d bunch of <UNK> that it's ridiculous but the <UNK> is basil <UNK> as an italian <UNK> with a <UNK> marx accent my how <UNK> i ever play <UNK> again my is cold it's campy beyond belief
<START> the recent dvd release of good humor man <UNK> the film as comedy it's hardly a comedy rather a dull indie film about a group of losers supposedly set in the 70s there is <UNK> attention paid to period details with overly muted color <UNK> taking its place the monotonous soundtrack only serves to <UNK> the <UNK> of the film perhaps that is the point but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience the <UNK> of losers only like to hang out at one location the <UNK> it seems like the <UNK> of the film as a comedy is meant to <UNK> people into renting or buying this film which is a complete waste of time
<START> the film opens with a cult leader attempting to <UNK> a dead member with his followers <UNK> for his <UNK> as the sun strikes upon them in the desert bill roy believes <UNK> in his power and gets so worked up that he <UNK> with what appeared to be a heart attack unable to keep him alive all those involved doctors and <UNK> are sentenced for attack with demonic spirit <UNK> the <UNK> body of nurse <UNK> big <UNK> jill <UNK> <UNK> each one using her as a tool of vengeance forced against her will with no memory of <UNK> such harm host body murders selected victims fortunately fellow co worker nurse tara marilyn begins a rather <UNK> romance with a <UNK> patient marcus washington <UNK> once a star football player whose mother was a <UNK> of voodoo through <UNK> knowledge passed down from mom tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save <UNK> before she murders everyone <UNK> meanwhile lover dr peter <UNK> geoffrey land <UNK> about her present condition and <UNK> br br well this was my first al <UNK> film and i must agree with his <UNK> that just from this film alone it seems he holds them together with paper clips and <UNK> <UNK> the animation with which we see the spirit take control of <UNK> is beyond awful and rather laughable a little soft core nonsense as filler some demonic possession thrown in the mix <UNK> actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed with naughty nurse behavior the three <UNK> focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free spirited and a little bit violence gore the film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast the sexual situations aren't that hard core and al often shoots them without revealing all that much the film looks embarrassingly cheap and there's an absence of thrills although the chilling score which sounds like something from dark shadows does help a little bit <UNK> and mary kay pass as nurse beth who seems to be a <UNK> if she'll even screw a nutty patient always complaining of <UNK> he really doesn't have with enough chest hair to <UNK> him a <UNK> aren't bad looking and <UNK> story line although <UNK> is somewhat coherent it seems he rarely directs films which are overall the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and <UNK> just can not overcome the <UNK> <UNK> or in my opinion create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story john f <UNK> has the role of the <UNK> psychiatrist who wants to commit <UNK> not believing the idea that she was possessed he constantly <UNK> with peter over her i watched the <UNK> lost version which i guess is the real version to watch of nurse <UNK>
<START> after seeing this film i felt sick to my stomach and if i had seen one more minute i would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit <UNK> dawn a sick film that was not funny and was not worth the money any money at all if anybody ever wants to see this movie don't your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week so if you value your child's education and want to <UNK> your child's mind please don't see this movie i beg of you don't
<START> with its by <UNK> films i've had a chance to watch the giant <UNK> for the first time without the deep cuts and <UNK> words of a late night horror <UNK> theaters guess what it's a pretty damn good movie br br the sets are authentic the acting in subdued and believable and the giant <UNK> is <UNK> powerful and i loved the subtle fantasy touches the enchanted wood luck charm etc and the of the god as a little less than <UNK> br br this movie is begging for a remake in the new century
<START> ok before i get into this let's go ahead and get the warning out of the way this movie is the quintessential cinematic definition of sleaze there are movies out there that can definitely out shock or out disgust this movie that have way more artistic <UNK> than can be said for this turd of a film so what makes it so sleazy let's take a closer look at wet wilderness for a moment br br made in 1974 for practically nothing this <UNK> has no real genuine plot to speak of other than portraying what would happen if a family went into the wilderness to relax and spend a day while being <UNK> by a fat dude in a <UNK> mask wielding a <UNK> looking for kicks the kind that end up with everyone being forced to have sex with each other while being <UNK> murdered by the masked creep so those sensitive to themes dealing with incest are encouraged to look elsewhere then to really either add a level of <UNK> or just demonstrate a complete <UNK> for the art of film making the daughter of the group runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black dude tied to a tree branch that fat sum bitch left me here for 3 days with virtually no explanation whatsoever he is saved or is he of course not they are caught before they can escape where our killer forces them to have sex as well while forcing the mother to join in ending up with a dead black dude courtesy of a <UNK> through the chest when all is said and done then our killer forces the daughter and mother to give him <UNK> sex when one of the women grabs the <UNK> and the movie abruptly ends just like that no warning no tied up loose ends it's simply over now there might be a proper ending to this film i honestly do not know but i have only seen the extremely crude <UNK> blue <UNK> version their version appears to have the ending either cut out completely or this is how it ends if this was intentional then in film making 101 i'm sure there is some sort of rule of thumb on how to end a film but it shouldn't be done like this fans of the film psycho should <UNK> upon hearing the soundtrack music as it's all through the film i'd be willing to bet no rights were <UNK> or anything also even though this is a violent film there's not a hell of a lot of it so <UNK> will find nothing of real use here none of the violence is <UNK> shown only the results one of the victims gets stabbed with a <UNK> right above the <UNK> area also the sex is some of the <UNK> sex i've ever seen the interesting thing about this film is it's too ugly a film to work as an effectively erotic porno or turn on anyone but those with a tendency to like things sleazy nasty and ugly but not violent enough to garner any real <UNK> with those looking for something really brutal like cannibal holocaust or other flicks like that the only notorious thing about this steaming pile is that violence was added to an adult film a fairly new concept at that time especially when you consider than porn <UNK> was all the rage and the <UNK> that filled <UNK> street played stuff like this to a most jaded group of porn <UNK> this wasn't and isn't mainstream porn at all br br if you were in film making school and there was a list of movie making this film would be a shining example of that lesson this cinematic <UNK> demonstrates what happens when <UNK> challenged filmmakers are given a budget in this case probably about <UNK> <UNK> it looks it and ignore all the and turn them into <UNK> yes this film is that bad one more thing those who get offended by racial <UNK> are also encouraged to watch something else the black man in the film is constantly being <UNK> abused about his color and the killer is obviously racist but there was no political correctness in the early 70's i'm not sure a film like this could be made today br br to be honest this won't shock anyone or <UNK> anyone but those who get off on <UNK> actually i got bored the sex is so ugly and mundane it's hard to watch with any sense of <UNK> so if you chance this you will thank god for the fast forward button the acting if you want to call it that is amateurish at best i mean it's even bad for porno with not one reason to care about anyone or anything in this if you just gotta see this anyway then <UNK> it as you'll really feel like a <UNK> if you buy this some things are simply that worthless and wet is the only thing more unpleasant than watching this film would be watching this film sitting in a theater and looking around at the others in <UNK> watching it too and suddenly feeling <UNK> probably not <UNK> greatest collection of <UNK> and <UNK> but if you're up for some stupid yet sleazy porn garbage give it a crack it's <UNK> minutes and yet it feels much longer would love this then again maybe there's something wrong with me for seeking this out in the first place lol <UNK> sleaze lovers
<START> golden boy is in my opinion one the sleeper lost <UNK> <UNK> out there a sexy comedy about a young man quest to find his in life and he <UNK> into all sort of odd jobs that somehow has this rather sexy girl who ultimately falls for him but he not really realizing it its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name but once viewing it will fall for the comedy silliness that lies inside truly a crime that only produced 6 <UNK> episodes and pilot movie were made however being unique as it is i'm surprised it survived to produce that many if you want a good laugh with high quality anime that is 100 cgi free check this anime out boy who one day may save the world or maybe not
<START> i found this film extremely disturbing is <UNK> and disturbed to the point of probably suffering from a mental illness the footage shown is him and not an actor but yet it is showing behaviour that ended in death is it appropriate to show actual footage of a suicide let's not <UNK> words the film shows footage of behaviour that directly led to his death br br for those who think that is some kind of hero think again the footage he shot is about him and not about the bears and <UNK> he claimed to be helping he did no meaningful research into their <UNK> or numbers and did nothing to actually protect them all he did was run around in the bush and convince himself that he was better than everyone else reality is by helping to the animals to humans he exposed them to great risk his self indulgent behaviour not caused his own death but also the death of his companion amy plus exposed his beloved bears and <UNK> to greater harm br br but i'm also concerned about <UNK> <UNK> actions in <UNK> this film the way he did br br a friend and i have had a long argument about this film who loved this film he believes that seriously disturbed people make for interesting subjects and he <UNK> the movie downfall as an example but in downfall they use actors we didn't see the real put <UNK> <UNK> into her own children's mouths br br there was something about using the real footage in <UNK> man which reminded me of that horrible football stadium tragedy where people were being crushed to death and the <UNK> who could have helped elected to simply keep recording the horror br br <UNK> film shows us that footage is more about but <UNK> has done the same his own personality and opinions are aired in this documentary which is supposedly about someone else scenes such as the one where he <UNK> to the tape are not necessary we already knew what was on the tape because the <UNK> had told us we didn't need <UNK> <UNK> a tear with one of former girlfriends it didn't add to the film br br the film showed us that was very self indulgent but it also showed us that <UNK> is as well
<START> <UNK> tales 1997 br br an excellent peace of work everything about this film is just perfect br br the film has a great cast as you can see from imdb the reason i brought the film was because of christine taylor and the love for horror films lets get to the main parts br br 1 there are 4 teenagers in this film after crashing their car they decide to tell some spooky stories 2 there are 3 stories and the main plot the 4 teenagers are the main plot 3 the best story is people can <UNK> too in my opinion the least scary story is possibly honeymoon or the 2nd story can't remember the name br br 4 people can <UNK> too is about a man pretending to be a 13 year old girl over the internet he starts <UNK> to a girl called amanda and then enters her house very creepy stuff this story will make you think twice of <UNK> to someone online basically a <UNK> enters her house and things go creepy br br 5 the main plot is sweet and simple teenagers crash tell stories try to freak each other out but there's a very cool twist at the end br br the only bad part of this movie is the teenagers crash their car into another couple but the kids don't bother seeing if the couple are ok they just talk about the couple who they've crashed into br br the men and women who made this film made it to scare people not to make money unlike scream and i know what you did last summer this film is created to scare you scream and i know what you did last summer were made to make big time cash br br even though this movie wasn't pushed as <UNK> as scream was it's still 10 times better than scream and i know what you did last summer br br the characters in this movie are great and have realistic characteristics the cast who play <UNK> characters are great christine taylor does a fabulous job with lauren doesn't go over the top with the acting the dude who plays eric <UNK> younger brother also does a good job of showing men or teenage boys can also get freaked out screams is like a spoof movie the murderer is a joke and the kids are dumb br br unlike scream and i know what you did last summer this movie has realistic people not a goof of a movie should of been more noticed
<START> that's the worst film i saw since a long time historic accuracy is totally non existent for example james <UNK> who his depicted as an anti french canadian is shown in london during the summer of natives are like indians of a bad hollywood movie of the 60's they wear clothes and ride horses the had never ride horses the film is taking place in <UNK> city but footage is set in showing the atlantic ocean br br the original scenario was supposed to include the battle of the <UNK> of abraham but the producers drop this idea saying that costs for uniforms and participants would be more than 4 millions dollars i think they never heard about re <UNK> br br all the movie is planned to be a new titanic an impossible love during an historic tragedy the fall of new france there's even a song performed by celine <UNK> at the end of the movie yes i stayed till the end of the movie but i deeply regret but the worst thing of all is that this movie cost 30 millions dollars i just don't know how they spend all this money br br sorry for my anger but i'm just too irritated
<START> right there good entertaining and accurate era feel to most scenes enough personality variations to cover the real people around those days without story <UNK> from the exceptions the credits show <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> california up the hill from <UNK> and south of <UNK> i lived there in the <UNK> hotel days pre next to that <UNK> kid bob cooper up on <UNK> where the alley was used to burn <UNK> that didn't work old were used on <UNK> <UNK> to roll down sidewalk waves things were different in each <UNK> decade as the cool innocence of the fifties broke into the warmth of the sun <UNK> freedom and <UNK> of the electric sixties and then into the innovative <UNK> and inventive <UNK> madness of the weird seventies the movie gives you a piece of that kind of magic moment in time in a place where the imaginary wave was real the source of <UNK> significant influences and btw there's another movie that has a similarly american street <UNK> to it and has the same genuinely unique goodness with laid back <UNK> that helps <UNK> that <UNK> eternal sense of cool two lane <UNK> with one of the best examples of attitude in west coast california history dennis wilson like <UNK> <UNK> did with that one thanks <UNK> for being right there with this one
<START> halloween the curse of michael myers is probably the best sequel out of all of the halloween flicks jamie serial killer michael <UNK> niece bears a baby who is then taken by the man in black from the conclusion of halloween 5 a kind nurse helps jamie escapes but myers quickly tracks her down and kills her <UNK> baby is found and rescued by tommy doyle one of the kids jamie lee <UNK> in the original film and myers arrives in <UNK> and begins to kill off the <UNK> clan living in his old house the film concludes with scenes revealing clues to michael's evil the identity of the man in black and a close to the whole dr <UNK> michael myers storyline i highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece br br halloween the curse of michael myers is rated r for strong graphic violence extreme gore brief sexuality language and brief nudity
<START> the use of <UNK> projection wandering soul to exist outside of body with the result <UNK> horrible death <UNK> the <UNK> of victims leading to broken spine and <UNK> organs on those close to the one with such ability is the threat of eternal evil providing karen black as <UNK> with another unique character to fool around with as a woman who influences a commercial director paul <UNK> winston tired of his <UNK> marriage and dull career in <UNK> she's dying and needs his body her spirit potentially <UNK> to his wife and son his son has a special friend who talks him into things even <UNK> himself at one point a detective <UNK> john novak investigating the unusual <UNK> concerning those killed by the <UNK> spirit <UNK> paul to the deaths and through him <UNK> <UNK> soon both realize that <UNK> must be stopped or she'll simply move to another human host what paul doesn't know is that his new secretary is lover both were actually older <UNK> featured in his documentary of <UNK> projection called wandering soul br br director george my bloody valentine certainly creates a weird atmosphere with this movie which contains a rather bizarre premise it seems that paul's boy can see the spirit moving in the shape of a blue man <UNK> the kid into <UNK> conduct black despite the star treatment rarely is shot close up taking advantage of her face which can produce the type of <UNK> evil her character <UNK> instead she's shot from <UNK> her voice dubbed and she never quite <UNK> herself with the proper menace which is an opportunity lost in my opinion for some reason despite the intriguing if oddball idea of <UNK> projection causing a spirit to kill folks from within the film just never takes off the soundtrack is very ish and the lighting and sound while at times moody and effective often is quite murky the pacing is a problem also as the story <UNK> along the cast is rather limp especially in the lead his performance <UNK> at best it doesn't help that there are few characters except paul's wife we could care less about and what really hurts is that paul himself isn't exactly the most lovable person in the world he can be quite difficult and moody his <UNK> career a reason for such behavior black should've been a more prominent figure in the film yet remains mostly in the background talked about in dialogue between paul and <UNK> but rarely does she get a chance to <UNK> us with her <UNK> which is a shame
<START> is a pointless exercise go to gold coast get drunk and have sex worthwhile ambitions maybe but not highly intellectual the plot is a simple as a few sentences assigned to each character and nobody is helped by the cliches <UNK> out here br br something that would help is the casting everybody looks too old these characters are supposedly <UNK> <UNK> out on their own in <UNK> steps to <UNK> yet they all look way too old to be believable in the role br br
<START> the plot starts out interesting however towards the end too many die in too short a time turning the thriller mystery aspect of the story into a slaughter br br the only true highlights were adam beach and <UNK> <UNK> who were once again their excellent <UNK> nice try with an inappropriate last third though a good ending
<START> saves <UNK> is comedian <UNK> christmas special film in this film ernest has to find a <UNK> to santa claus in order for christmas to continue along the way he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important of <UNK> i won't tell you what that is you'll just have to watch the film for yourself like most ernest films there is a lot of slapstick humor involved br br this film is probably one of <UNK> best films it's funny and it has some important lessons to learn regarding friendship and family and not being afraid to show love it's not the best christmas film around but it is a good one to get you in the christmas spirit it's a little bit sad that the film is a little dated now
<START> i guess when people say this is beautifully filmed they are talking about the close ups of <UNK> and the cooking of <UNK> it certainly doesn't refer to the set which seems to be composed of about 3 rooms with no outside shots at all also all of it is filmed too close up br br i got sick of the little boy who keeps <UNK> at or <UNK> hot wax over ants also do <UNK> spend all their time sitting on their kind of gross looking at least the way this movie depicts it one close up of it would have been plenty not a dozen or more br br then finally comes part two a chick flick for <UNK> girls with the perfect handsome rich man who spends all day playing the piano he is <UNK> the pretty maid steals him like the forbidden green <UNK> fruit deep br br except for a few nice close ups this film is a dud it is sort of a soap opera with out dialog it is <UNK> how is it beautiful the set looks completely fake br br no don't make the mistake i did and rent it because someone recommended it i was expecting beautiful shots of the <UNK> mountains of vietnam or something when i heard it was a visual gem br br i wanted to like this movie i like foreign movies even prefer them but this movie is dumb and dull it will leave you irritated that something like this won a bunch of <UNK>
<START> this film proves a theory i have had for quite some time in australia as long as a film deals with the right topic it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is aussie park <UNK> could not possibly be any worse the acting is beyond terrible the plot is basically a poor warriors knock off and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in australia an irish gang in twenty first century sydney the last time any irish gangs were in australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the <UNK> but because it's about ethnic rivalry one of four topics guaranteed to be a success in australian cinema along with struggling families minority groups and the biography of a famous australian it won multiple academy awards i've always suspected that australian critics will lap up any rubbish that deals with these issues but part of me thought or at least hoped that they had their limits this film proves otherwise so to all you australian aspiring film makers out there don't bother putting thought into your film or choosing people who can actually act or even getting your facts right just write a script about some poor family trying to make ends meet or someone of a foreign race coming to australia and having to deal with racial prejudice and stereotypes or if you want to take a <UNK> out of these people's book some ethnic gang fighting some other ethnic gang that isn't actually plausible in the period the film is set and your film will win five academy awards regardless of how pathetic it is
<START> blondell farrell are excellent blondell was <UNK> this was very funny and i laughed often throughout it great dialogue and its loaded with <UNK> i could've watched it for hours tremendous fun to watch
<START> this was a truly epic production that had all the elements that one would want in a fantasy film the <UNK> the music the cinematography all artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and provided a rich experience br br ted <UNK> best know for his tv roles in cheers and <UNK> was excellent in the role of <UNK> mary <UNK> time after time cross creek performed equally well in her limited role as his wife br br other performances i really enjoyed were james fox as dr bates <UNK> <UNK> as the queen of and peter o'toole as the emperor of br br this would make an enjoyable children's film but it also would definitely appeal to adults for it's deep social commentary
<START> bridget fonda is the sexually satisfied wife of handsome hart <UNK> one afternoon she comes home calls him honey and quietly <UNK> him a drink only to find that he's <UNK> minutes go by while she puts up with his <UNK> silence suddenly he bursts into a rage <UNK> her of infidelity in the complete absence of any reason to do so calls her the c word <UNK> her head against a <UNK> <UNK> her around and winds up <UNK> her off the second floor balcony breaking her hand and a couple of <UNK> br br she wakes up in the hospital where it is revealed she is deaf although we notice that she reads lips perfectly that avoids all the <UNK> associated with an <UNK> <UNK> or having her <UNK> words in a of language br br all right let me just lay out the basic plot elements this beautiful and devoted handicapped woman is beaten by her husband misunderstood by her elderly mother betrayed by her sister has her bank account <UNK> by unknown hands almost raped by a fat man who <UNK> her in a bar is thought to have murdered her now missing husband and is pursued by two cops <UNK> sutherland and steven <UNK> one of whom is interested only in justice while the other seems to dislike all women and is embarrassed by their presence the end finds her standing alone at a deserted bus stop with a hand full of cash alone <UNK> but brave br br now a pop <UNK> there is only one multiple choice question this story was written by a a man or b a woman not to sound sexist one could as easily pose a scenario about a <UNK> military hero and trained warrior who is captured by his enemies betrayed by his organization beaten and tortured escapes to exact revenge and winds up with the woman he loves whom he thought he'd lost long ago br br the direction is <UNK> and conventional when fonda <UNK> consciousness in a hospital bed we see from her point of view the faces of the anxious doctors and <UNK> looking down at her that is at the camera an echo of every scene in <UNK> second rate movies in which the <UNK> is being <UNK> <UNK> down the <UNK> and people wearing <UNK> white <UNK> and <UNK> with <UNK> over the camera br br hart <UNK> has played a number of evil people in an interesting way some of the characters are stupid die hard and some are rather more than plain rude and the sea will tell his <UNK> <UNK> has a kind of evil <UNK> to it it would be too easy to cast him as a hero nice intentionally bland performance by steven <UNK> as the dumb cop maybe the best in the film br br bridget fonda is interesting too her acting range is limited but it's on full display here what makes her an object of interest is her almost stereotypical beauty she's like a high school prom queen very feminine of course she can't help it if she <UNK> around or moves her hands so <UNK> neither can she do anything about her nose for most of its length it's perfectly normal and attractive but at its very tip there is a <UNK> <UNK> that follows the natural <UNK> of her <UNK> the tip of that nose is full of intrigue br br as for the movie
<START> bell witch haunting aka the haunt is an american horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period to br br this is not to be confused with bell witch the movie a movie starring <UNK> <UNK> based on the same events however i can say that i wish i had seen this other movie instead of the one i saw i enjoyed <UNK> chilling performance in friday the 13th as such i believe that even on a bad day she'd pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as the haunt br br with regard to my heading this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing it is painful to watch because it is just downright boring br br reading the positive reviews for this movie i could only identify three possibilities the first possibility these authors were involved in the production in some way the second possibility the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed the final possibility none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts <UNK> br br the setting for the plot is robertson county <UNK> james <UNK> receives a visit from two <UNK> eager to hear the story of the bell witch the story is told as a series of flashbacks a series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of john bell and his family it soon <UNK> that a vengeful spirit is behind it all br br on the surface the plot appears to be a standard <UNK> affair albeit one based on real events br br where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong and then some br br first the acting the acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board this factor does the most damage to the production <UNK> any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer the voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing <UNK> intent i almost laughed when i heard some of her lines unfortunately this voice began to become very annoying very quickly i may not have been alive in the <UNK> but i find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ghost does br br second the direction the direction is <UNK> and very uneven some scenes show promise but potential is <UNK> by the clearly inexperienced director nothing is done with the camera with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary the atmosphere is equally flat a vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural <UNK> yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them i'll give one example in one scene the spirit attacks someone see the scene for yourself it's almost funny almost br br third the script whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real <UNK> it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story this movie is far too <UNK> on conversations to advance the story whilst this style was also the case with british movies from the british horror <UNK> of the 1960s and 1970s it cannot be denied that the dialogue <UNK> were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works peter cushing for example could read a <UNK> <UNK> and still hold attention of the viewers the same cannot be said of the actors in the haunt br br finally the humour the ill guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating an <UNK> boy is the butt of many jokes one particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet this scene should never have been included but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing br br the only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes the decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity the costumes were also well chosen br br overall the haunt is an appalling movie it is not even in the so bad it's good league it is instead just boring i advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague don't even bother seeing it for free br br i have never seen the other movie about the bell witch but it really couldn't be any worse than the haunt could it i'll give this other movie a chance if i can track it down br br in the meantime i would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting the legend of hell house the <UNK> <UNK> the grudge japanese original and one missed call japanese original are good places to start
<START> i think i watched a highly edited version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as i expected based on the other reviews that i have heard br br other than 1 being written by the same person who wrote the original <UNK> 1974 <UNK> 2 the lead character being a sexually free spirit and 3 being set in the exotic locale of asia <UNK> doesn't have the same flair as its predecessor br br i just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that i'm really not that interested in i e the <UNK> open relationship between <UNK> and nick i'm just happy with whatever brings her pleasure something along those lines i cannot relate to this mentality and the film characters don't really shed any light br br the second half about finding the <UNK> tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film one that i didn't care for by that time i was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interest br br maybe i just didn't get it br br i'll leave it at that
<START> i caught this a few times on tv in the late 1970s it only played late at night past midnight br br peter lorre plays a kind happy man whose face is <UNK> in a fire he is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and filled with despair he turns to a life of crime and eventually becomes very successful he makes a mask to hide his <UNK> features and falls in love with a beautiful girl evelyn <UNK> who is blind he tries to go straight for her but he can't escape his life of crime or his hatred of his own <UNK> face br br a no budget b film very short runs only a little over an hour but well made and superbly acted by lorre this has a lot more depth than you would expect from a <UNK> b picture especially takes the <UNK> girl role and makes her character fresh and appealing this has sadly disappeared from tv and was never put on video or dvd as far as i know tcm did show it recently and it was great to see the movie still holds up br br highly recommended
<START> no or like of sand is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are this movie isn't about homosexuality but it is about sexuality br br an <UNK> girl will definitely make the viewers <UNK> who is behind the <UNK> girl does she love <UNK> or does she love <UNK> or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the incident i doubt it br br and what about <UNK> does he realize that he loves <UNK> in the end well we all know he loves him as a friend but you'll never know once you see this movie haha in the end along with <UNK> delivers an exceptional message to the audience which is that it does not matter if you love a boy or a girl and i have to tell you i'm so dense that i didn't get it at first it's because of the whole no talking scenes you have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and not by what they say especially the final part <UNK> boy that was confusing it's a confusing story but it is beautiful nonetheless this movie is certainly one of the best japanese movies i have ever seen and trust me i've seen plenty
<START> a pity nobody seems to know this little thriller masterpiece where bigger budgeted movies fail <UNK> choice delivers lots of thrills shocks and bloody violence a little seen gem that deserves being searched for in your local video shop that anonymous guy beneath is quite right when he says you'll never trust <UNK> again it is that effective good ending too not really a twist but it doesn't end the way one thought it would yep that's ellen <UNK> in an early role
<START> amazing astounding brilliant superb those are the four <UNK> that prop up in my head when i start describing the <UNK> runner book adaptation had already captured many minds in fact it is <UNK> that he himself broke down in to tears after watching the <UNK> i must say before i even start that i had read the book before i saw the advanced screening of the <UNK> runner so my judgment and views may be slightly biased br br firstly let me say it that even though in my opinion the book was better than the final product of the movie it is by no means a bad adaptation i mean for a two hour movie it's got the deserved response things do appear a tad fast in the final twenty odd minutes but apart from that it has succeeded what the book did it has captured the minds and imagination of millions all across the globe the magic woven by to give us a sense of <UNK> of joy of sadness of pain of loyalty is <UNK> in this adaptation especially in the very first scene when young <UNK> says if you tell me to eat dirt i will but i know you won't ask me to such a touching line is bound to capture the hearts of many the two young actors were brilliant absolutely superb especially the boy who played the innocent but loyal <UNK> a boy who refuses to give up a <UNK> he caught because he promised his best friend that he would bring it to him only to be abused by large bullies who beat him up and use him sexually and then to be <UNK> by his best friend as a coward the entire act is so touching that it cannot but wet your eyes br br the entire movie is well placed save the last bit the point when <UNK> learns of his true relationship with <UNK> and reads <UNK> first and last not to him when he breaks down in tears feeling helpless lonely and <UNK> that appeared a bit rushed and felt that <UNK> was behind a <UNK> in the book had dedicated some 10 12 pages to describe state of mind in that position but that his made up for in the <UNK> segment of the movie when <UNK> stands up for <UNK> boy his nephew in front of his commanding father in law the ending was well deserved and i am sure will be well appreciated it felt witnessing the torch pass down from one generation to another br br coming over to the technical aspects first of all the acting just one word superb from start to finish young <UNK> and <UNK> their father his friend khan everyone has been superb especially young <UNK> second the direction was amazing coupled with some brilliant camera work the background score was also impressive right from the start credit track to the end credit and i especially loved the one when <UNK> is in the <UNK> in <UNK> the western and <UNK> <UNK> made that extra special br br all in all this is definitely one of the better movies and it's a welcome break from all those iran inspired movies that we have floating all over this year 9 10
<START> this ladies and gentlemen is truly a modern b movie the dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden <UNK> the premise is predictable there are a few decent twists and characters remain <UNK> for most of it and yet there is a certain charm wwe wrestler kane brings to life the sick twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years and so i'll find it quite amusing when people say it's not much of a reach for him but <UNK> <UNK> is apparently quite the nice guy so actually it is in any event he's cast perfectly as the <UNK> <UNK> and the deaths are suitably over the top jason would be proud but i heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes frankly go into this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and a <UNK> oh it is quite the <UNK> the r rating is richly deserved and i actually got a little <UNK> during some of the more graphic times in any event a very very fun but fairly bad movie
<START> <UNK> and unnecessary sequel to a <UNK> classic an american werewolf in london was <UNK> a gem of a movie humorous demented with just a dash of romance and so very very british it made me want to stand up and sing god save the queen every time the movie ended then came this abomination you know you are in real trouble when the leads are so utterly unlikeable you are glad when they are slaughtered and actually start cheering for the tell you the truth folks i only got about half way through this <UNK> travesty before losing the will to live and turning it off absolutely pitiful and a <UNK> waste of anyone's time
<START> four lovely young <UNK> in their last year of <UNK> school experience all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives sweet susan <UNK> brunette <UNK> tries to comfort the bitter <UNK> ill greg a moving performance by <UNK> <UNK> eager but neurotic lovely blonde karen <UNK> romances handsome jim <UNK> <UNK> lawrence <UNK> free spirited hippie <UNK> the stunningly gorgeous barbara leigh gets <UNK> by laid back drug dealer les the solid richard <UNK> and compassionate <UNK> nicely played by farrell helps out angry mexican revolutionary victor charlie the excellent <UNK> <UNK> despite the fact that this film was made for roger <UNK> legendary exploitation outfit new world pictures it's anything but your standard mindless piece of <UNK> soft core schlock instead it's a very pleasant charming and even often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political <UNK> of the <UNK> early 70's the subplot involving <UNK> and the <UNK> is especially potent and provocative special kudos are in order for director stephanie who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material moreover the four attractive and appealing female leads all turn in sound and <UNK> work <UNK> <UNK> likewise <UNK> as wise <UNK> ms <UNK> and <UNK> 70's trailer voice guy ronald <UNK> supplies the off screen voice of a psychiatrist <UNK> polished cinematography the fantastic rock soundtrack and the <UNK> score by <UNK> b grass iii are all up to speed a real sleeper
<START> a show about an incredibly dumb man child and his <UNK> hot wife 99 of the plots revolves around doug doing something unbelievably stupid and then comes a <UNK> a either he hides it from his wife or b tell his wife she him and then it's up to the father in law arthur the <UNK> character from seinfeld to <UNK> the situation br br and the writers dare to say it was influenced by the <UNK> an absolute classic and that the plots are drawn from real life situations unless you live in a cave you know that's not true br br anyway let's just put it this way if kevin james had been thin the show would have got canceled the pilot if you're 12 or you're fond of fat jokes be my guest watch this show or any of kevin james movies for that matter br br i've noticed some posters compare this travesty to much superior shows like friends seinfeld and everybody loves raymond i'm still wondering how could anyone do that
<START> after viewing still life a short film directed by jon i was genuinely excited for his feature film debut jack brooks monster <UNK> still life had perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of the twilight zone and i was eager to see what could do when taking on the horror comedy genre the campy nature of the name and <UNK> <UNK> suggested something along the lines of evil dead or army of darkness a fun gory 80's style horror flick with lots of monsters while that was what was going for he utterly fails at capturing any of the fun or entertainment value these movies had br br the problem with jack brooks monster <UNK> is that it completely lacks an understanding of what made these horror comedies that it tries to evoke so great in the first place two thirds of the running time is primarily devoted to the film's hero jack brooks a <UNK> and college student as he goes to class and attempts to deal with his <UNK> bursts of anger there's <UNK> a monster in sight for the greater part of the film barely even a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything horror related even if evil dead or dead alive had subsequent amounts of the gore cut out they'd still be entertaining jack brooks isn't it's plain boring which is the worst thing a film of this nature can be jack brooks himself is not all that interesting at least not enough to warrant the amount of screen time he's given all one needs to know about him is revealed in the films first ten minutes and from that point on whenever he's not beating the pulp out of a monster and he rarely does he's not worth watching the movie goes nowhere following him around on psychiatric sessions and <UNK> with classmates br br eventually things do pick up jack brooks battles a few monsters some heads are crushed a few humans are slaughtered and then it's over just like that all within the span of about fifteen minutes it is a good fifteen minutes the monsters are all fairly inventive and done entirely in camera and there's some great gore gags the best being a zombies head crushed in but after sitting through <UNK> five minutes of pure tedium fifteen minutes just isn't going to cut it br br that's really all there is to it i could <UNK> on about the acting which is fairly well done especially horror icon robert englund in a non traditional role and how the creature <UNK> are a nice <UNK> to the days when films didn't use cgi but it really doesn't matter jack brooks monster <UNK> is utterly boring and while jon obviously does have the talent to create a good film once again the last fifteen minutes are killer and still life was amazing ¬ñ check it out jack brooks completely misses the mark it has its <UNK> acting make up but those don't change the fact that it's not very entertaining at all the screening i caught this at had the director and cast in <UNK> one piece of information i picked up was that a sequel was in development and that this time it would focus more on fighting monsters as opposed to the creation of a hero my advice skip this one and wait for the sequel
<START> when i read the synopsis 3 people lost in the wild battling against a huge crocodile i wasn't exactly drawn in it sounded like the typical yawn movie horror formula of a bunch of people stalked by a monster except in this case there are only three of them so we wouldn't even get the macabre of watching them get picked off one by one br br however i watched it couldn't sleep nothing else to do and it turned out to be much better than expected the acting is great the atmosphere tense and you really get that rare sense of a low budget winner br br horror as it should be done first rate film making it's not perfect but it's well worth seeing i give it a 7
<START> sweeping and still impressive early <UNK> western of <UNK> days other contemporary films in the same vein include the covered <UNK> <UNK> the iron horse <UNK> and <UNK> 1931 ¬ñ none of which i've watched though i do have the latter on vhs it was simultaneously filmed in the standard <UNK> ratio and in an experimental widescreen process called <UNK> but only the former has been released on the bare bones fox dvd one can only <UNK> how it would look in a wider ratio but the careful framing ¬ñ not to mention the splendid cinematography ¬ñ is evident enough even in the standard version br br young john wayne is surprisingly commanding in the lead a role which however didn't lead to the expected stardom ¬ñ as he'd <UNK> in <UNK> westerns for the best part of the next decade before john ford came to his rescue with <UNK> 1939 anyway he and <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> daughter 1936 make a nice couple ¬ñ despite her somewhat tedious character supporting characters include a variety of stock types veteran <UNK> comic relief sidekick with a <UNK> for making noises with his mouth <UNK> and <UNK> villain played by <UNK> power sr his two slimy <UNK> a mexican and a <UNK> the latter also filling in as wayne's rival for <UNK> hand etc also among the members of the <UNK> party is a <UNK> <UNK> full of optimism for the promised land but who's continually put down by his <UNK> mother in law and later wayne regular ward bond br br the episodic narrative <UNK> itself into a number of alternately <UNK> lyrical and action packed vignettes ¬ñ as we see the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the elements the indians and themselves the film however has a completely authentic feel to it which <UNK> over its essentially dated and static quality also the editing is somewhat choppy particularly during the second half ¬ñ little wonder since the dvd edition of the film is only <UNK> minutes long against the complete <UNK> minute <UNK> version
<START> this movie was terrible the acting was awful the script was awful what was even worse were the camera shots and sound half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different <UNK> the worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross shaped building the building had to have been 50 stories high and probably 100 feet wide however when the actor was on top of it in another shot they had <UNK> the top of the building the <UNK> <UNK> had been reduced to about eight feet wide how could a building hundreds of feet high be eight feet wide i know the film was low budget but it is <UNK> the movie itself just pushed ideas about a rapture then actually having a storyline or point this reduced the script to mere rubbish the characters seemed to be selling ideas in their lines rather than conveying emotions and moving the movie along in a direction it was a complete waste of time watching the movie gives christians a bad name if it is one of the current best christian films out there
<START> if i had never seen the first road house then i guess this movie might get one more star but even then that makes it a 3 star movie for that matter i was really surprised as to the relatively high rating it currently has br br in reality i was not able to finish this movie as it was painful where it went wrong at least the most obvious way is that it pretty much parallels the original exactly even though the original plot is still <UNK> this doesn't really make sense and doesn't work also the acting is weak i never felt like i was into the movie yet i felt like i was watching people act even good actors like busey don't work out probably due to the screenplay or maybe the awkward editing the strangest thing is that the movie feels like a mid 90's b movie yet is made in <UNK> i am not sure as to why but then again this often seems to happen with sequels for some reason the music the look and the whole overall feel reminds me of movies you saw 10 years ago on <UNK> late at night the strangest thing of all is that i am also expecting <UNK> rule to come in at some point often it reminds me of more current movies with <UNK> as actors br br the most irritating thing is love interest girl who's character seems like a total rip off of the lois lane character on <UNK> which is also quite annoying and lets not forget the <UNK> sounding southern accents i have heard since walk the line i realize this is common place in movies but no accent at all would work better than attempting to sound like you are from that universal <UNK> place on tv where anyone from any southern state or <UNK> and <UNK> sound exactly the same sure people in desert towns in <UNK> sound just like people in <UNK> states 2000 miles away that was wearing thin 10 years ago in the b movies where technique came from why do writers directors make such decisions br br bottom line i would truly not recommend this if you are a fan of road house or if you like good movies also if you have not seen it yet don't spoil it by seeing this version first the original road house was one of those accidental classics that people love and watch over and over it was an unexpected success like american <UNK> <UNK> and confused and more recently office space fast and furious only the first one and <UNK> dynamite why did they spoil it br br they should have never made a sequel to road house other than a high budget version with the right actors director sure you can never top the original ex bad news bears the longest yard etc but at least if you can do it right it will be <UNK> as is the case with the examples i mentioned but to make a low budget off network self production of road house is criminal
<START> i had never seen the original death wish in the book either death wish i film however death wish 3 was the very interested film the well known vigilante paul tried to visit his friend charlie but he only visited him for a couple of minutes before he died because of charlie didn't pay the protection to the huge and infamous underground gang <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> after some <UNK> during his time in jail learned that <UNK> who he fought with in jail had his own agenda to make the new york city in the <UNK> and also his influence by sending his henchmen to set the crime every time everywhere and everyday due to the chance given by <UNK> richard who know his profile well and like him very much decided to set the war with <UNK> and his gang br br i accepted that death wish iii was one of the most and extreme violence action film which i had seen from the past this movie used the very way to tell the story no <UNK> story telling and less unnecessary scenes which was the one merit of the movie on the next issue violence was used <UNK> in the film i believed that many of viewers could like the action scene of death wish iii because it showed the crude extreme and blast of action for every minutes of the movie especially the climax scene of the movie and the death of <UNK> <UNK> which i thought that it was the maximum action scene br br for about the cast i think everyone was good and get through their role charles bronson made everybody believe that he still be great as paul he didn't look like the big old cat but the great vigilante <UNK> also did his job very good his main villain role in the movie made him look nasty and look like the big bad guy however the role of kathryn davis in this movie was pathetic she didn't look like the main character i thought that she was appeared only two or three scene before she was killed by <UNK> and his <UNK> to make a heat on paul she could have more role to appear br br for my comment the style and extreme violence made this movie great for extreme action film fans fast paced with back and forth style made this movie very interested to watch nevertheless this movie had some silly scene and some plot hole first the scene when <UNK> faced paul for the first time it was very corny because you attacked your favor guy before you want him to help it similar to how you punch some guy before you try to borrow him some money haha that's like a joke although i liked the plot twist when <UNK> was shown later that he helped because at first looked like the villain very much due to his act to but when the movie went to the climax everything was <UNK> that he had no hidden agenda with br br in another case the ending scene of the movie set back me it stumble on everyone's feeling because it ended too easy gang members looked unbelievable after they found that <UNK> was dead before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape finally <UNK> allowed paul to fly out from his town before the police caught him i thought that this style of ending scene could be found in many cannon film's movie but i dislike it br br for the summary i am ok with death wish 3 due to my explanation i <UNK> first the cast and the action was very good and so extreme even it had some scene i don't like and extreme of violence could be the best short description of this movie
<START> the whole <UNK> for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are blue the blue state mentality this is supposed to get us off the hook for what is was happening during the last few years in our country the usa it doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better as though we aren't <UNK> in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a us citizen gets just by being a us citizen br br but i'm so sick of <UNK> about this it doesn't do any good i haven't taken much action lately and i wonder how many people have maybe i'm just down because my job was <UNK> last month and now i'm looking for work in the <UNK> tech support field where most of the jobs are quickly going to india and other places overseas i'm thinking that soon it's not going to pay off to be a citizen here with the screwed up <UNK> and the <UNK> job market and the obsession with war these days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and <UNK> about there <UNK> anyway back to this review usa the movie is an obscure dvd that makes me realize that some people have taken action whether it's through politics <UNK> or arts or media the filmmaker is obviously passionate <UNK> willing to go outside the norm frustrated unique <UNK> etc br br i looked through the whole site that's linked to the dvd and got lost in all the <UNK> <UNK> etc that are there the dvd does that too has references to different times views and historical points sometimes someone does something out there
<START> i have to tell you i've been a fan of star trek <UNK> since i was a kid br br well sometime ago i gave a friend of mine some <UNK> episodes and i asked him br br hey man what are you watching lately because i'm done watching all <UNK> episodes he said well i got these episodes of <UNK> i said ok let me try it i was pretty sure at that time that i wont like it because i was just watching <UNK> and found it great br br i had 3 episodes viewed those but the show didn't impressed me very much i found it childish initially and i thought its just another tv show nice adventures but regular music was a little bit different neat special effects though and i had the vague impression that the actors didn't fully get into the characters skin br br i watched another 3 episodes thinking that 3 <UNK> were not enough to decide i like or not since then the show started to get me i got a good grasp of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor <UNK> the rest is history br br i think i mostly like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action unlike star trek where everybody slept when they were supposed to do and way too much high tech <UNK> br br the show got better with each episode very interesting story line what can i say this movie its like poetry br br i highly recommend it
<START> i remember seeing this a long while ago and i knew most of the concept but no detail so i'm glad i watched it again from director frank oz the muppets take manhattan <UNK> basically new star cameron drake matt dillon has just won the academy award for his latest where he plays a gay soldier and he does the usual thank <UNK> he even mentions his past school english teacher howard <UNK> golden globe nominated kevin kline and he outs him as gay howard is determined to clear his name and get out of the media spotlight as a denying gay man especially as his marriage to emily <UNK> oscar and golden globe nominated joan cusack is on the way so it comes to the wedding day and when it comes to howard saying yes or no that is when he outs himself and admits to himself and everyone that he is gay this of course gets him fired as a teacher but everyone stands at the <UNK> day to out themselves in support and cameron even shows up to clear things up so that everyone especially school head tom <UNK> bob <UNK> knows it's okay to be gay also starring tom <UNK> as peter <UNK> debbie reynolds as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as frank <UNK> gregory as walter <UNK> glenn close whoopi goldberg and jay leno the highlight of the film has to be when kline can't help dancing to diana <UNK> version of i will survive that must have been what convinced him of his sexuality kline is always good cusack is a surprise oscar <UNK> and all supporting cast members do their bit too in this very funny comedy very good
<START> midnight clear has a great premise a group of over educated overly bright <UNK> are sent out by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to <UNK> around an isolated farm house on the eve of the battle of the <UNK> the <UNK> encounter a group of battle weary german <UNK> and it becomes clear that they don't want to fight anymore br br <UNK> lies the problem it's really pretty simple if the germans want to surrender they do so and that's the end of the movie if the germans want to fight they do so and that's also the end of the movie so instead of doing either the <UNK> and germans play games with each other even throwing <UNK> at one point interesting for one or two scenes but it soon becomes very annoying after all these are germans the enemy nothing in this film makes me think they should not be either taken prisoner or shot the film does noting to make them more human in fact much of what the german characters did made me want to shoot them including one scene where the german officer refuses to deal with a jew or to surrender to a mere <UNK> man why should i care about such characters just shoot them and let's move on to the battle of the <UNK> it's much more interesting anyway br br one good scene the <UNK> are returning from a <UNK> of the german position where they had the germans in their sights but did not fire while walking across a <UNK> they realize a group of germans have their <UNK> at them the germans are about 100 <UNK> away the <UNK> then do something i've never seen any <UNK> do in any movie they throw down their <UNK> and throw up their hands unusual as this may be in films it is an entirely sensible reaction to having a rifle aimed at you from that distance though it seems far in reality it's point blank range for those <UNK> i'll lay odds that someone working on this film was a

<START> <UNK> look out is that a <UNK> you're wearing or are you expecting an assassination attempt <UNK> what are you a <UNK> or what ok way to go you guys feed <UNK> he's our hot man do you know they use the most sophisticated training methods from the soviet union east west germany and the <UNK> olympic power <UNK> oh <UNK> you old make out master what no <UNK> oh my god his nose is bleeding it's gonna get even bigger now our political <UNK> henry <UNK> will appear is gonna come out spend a weekend with the kids just rap with them br br these and many other great lines make <UNK> a hall of fame comedy only in <UNK> is bill murray funnier he probably ad <UNK> half the lines the high school actors seemed to have a blast being in the same movie with him br br hilarious movie to watch any time of year not just the summer
<START> definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over think their movies br br lots of action lots of great dialogue e g fun to quote a little intrigue and stuff blowing up all over the place samuel l jackson and <UNK> davis had great chemistry violent but not gory the fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn about br br have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films <UNK> every 3 or 4 months i initially rented the movie because samuel l jackson was in the film but was caught up in the events surrounding <UNK> quest to regain her memory and have never looked back br br all you cerebral folks out there suspend disbelief for once take yourself a little less seriously you might actually enjoy yourselves
<START> i think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must've come on and rated it because i'm telling you its just awful the acting is worse than bad the effects are like something you'd see out of a 1970 episode of doctor who the story is well there is no story and they keep using the same 2 minute song over and over and over again and the werewolf its like the muppets they used in wing commander the giant cats remember how bad they looked the werewolf is that bad seriously the guy who directed this thing is terrible and should never get to direct anything else again except maybe his son's school play but even then he should have to pay the audience to see it is nothing but a bad joke
<START> i enjoyed some of the older doctor who many years ago so when the new one came out i just had to check it out i was so pleased with the characters the story lines the updated look i became hooked from season 1 27 for the old fans through to season 2 28 it just keeps on getting better it ties in nicely with the old shows too although you don't have to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version br br even though there has been a change of cast i highly recommend doctor who with chris <UNK> and with david <UNK> br br i like that they've given the characters so much depth the doctor seems more vulnerable in this series maybe because he is the last the range of emotions which chris and david show are truly remarkable and i felt their pain anger and sense of adventure right along with them br br <UNK> <UNK> rose brings a very human element to each episode although she is much than i would be with her talent <UNK> will go far in the industry
<START> hair is one of my favorite movies of all times even not being part of my generation i already watched this movie 9 times and i can't get enough with the beautiful message of understanding passion beauty and love this movie is against the vietnam war and shows how people should be united independent of the color origins <UNK> and classes i love the characters <UNK> and <UNK> and i think central park of the 70's one of the most beautiful places i already saw in my life br br by the way i still have this music in my mind br br when the moon is in the seventh house and <UNK> <UNK> with mars then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars br br this is the <UNK> of the age of <UNK> the age of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br harmony and understanding sympathy and trust <UNK> no more <UNK> or decisions golden living dreams of visions <UNK> crystal revelation and the <UNK> true <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br ps i am surprised to see that the director of this movie is the same director of <UNK> i just love both movies
<START> <UNK> honour for the <UNK> is the fifth entry in a series of tv movies focusing on an english army <UNK> during the <UNK> wars and based on the books by bernard <UNK> which i strongly recommend reading if you were to start by watching this particular one though you'd get the impression that <UNK> is not so much a soldier as the very <UNK> force which the rest of the army revolves around should that be the case i'd recommend starting with earlier chapters like <UNK> eagle or <UNK> company but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing br br the story this time is all about the espionage side of things with the french army <UNK> in <UNK> from spain major the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round by <UNK> the murder of a spanish on richard <UNK> hero of the british army the fragile british spanish alliance will start to <UNK> and things will turn around again when the spanish <UNK> come to <UNK> crying for <UNK> blood though the english general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so <UNK> his death and soon he's off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who <UNK> the plot surprisingly enough for a <UNK> film as well there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the way fancy that br br what this results in of course is a more adventure style approach the concentration is less on the <UNK> of the english military with <UNK> as the <UNK> and concentrates more on his <UNK> in the countryside <UNK> french <UNK> <UNK> with the spanish <UNK> and getting involved in daring escapes from <UNK> military positions sergeant <UNK> his loyal right hand man <UNK> him naturally but the rest of the remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive strangely enough though they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of <UNK> baby br br this slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode but is only a good thing in the long run and should anyone be worried that there won't be the standard battle at the climax <UNK> not because once again the poor old french get a right kicking furthermore makes a fantastic <UNK> to as the bad guy you love to hate he is a <UNK> <UNK> and absolutely evil son of a female <UNK> and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of <UNK> of the lost <UNK> elsewhere stands out quite <UNK> as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born even if he does look like a member of iron maiden who got <UNK> backwards in time by accident br br in short then another strong chapter in the <UNK> series <UNK> remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film it's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to <UNK> that we don't normally get to witness the action hero rather than the professional soldier and if that's not enough to get you tempted it's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an <UNK> sean bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns
<START> where do we go from here that is the <UNK> question of this film and make no mistake etc ' the 2003 effort from director john <UNK> asks far more questions than it answers but none so <UNK> or so <UNK> as this one br br much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies and i'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own <UNK> of drunken <UNK> however one of the many <UNK> of this film is that we are rarely given an answer questions are raised ¬ñ everything from the mundane to the profound ¬ñ but <UNK> <UNK> forces his audience to examine and answer these questions ourselves with little to no help from the characters br br side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully <UNK> <UNK> of non linear segments to introduce us to the main characters we meet them on the morning of april 8 1994 ¬ñ the day kurt <UNK> committed suicide and it is the death of <UNK> and the journey to his wake two days later in seattle that serve as the backdrop for the film in exploring life music and death the characters attempt with varying degrees of success to understand and come to terms with their own lives br br there are some aspects of the film that are what you might expect from a low budget indie film the performances range from decidedly mediocre to outstanding with the strongest performances coming from jessica scott holly and <UNK> wood daniel some of the dialogue is admittedly a bit stiff but never completely <UNK> into the unreal and there are some minor sound problems particularly once we get on the road that make it difficult at times to follow the action on screen br br but despite its shortcomings etc ' is a solid deeply affecting piece of cinema amid moments of haunting <UNK> laugh out loud humor and intimate turmoil <UNK> <UNK> weaves all of the character threads together and <UNK> their own struggles while at the same time making them accessible and engaging for us and because we can see <UNK> of ourselves in one or more of these characters we can identify with the questions and issues they're struggling with and we're able to look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994 when for many people the world changed br br while <UNK> takes credit for the writing editing and direction of the film kudos must be given to his photography as well with an uncanny eye and amazing ability to capture and draw us into each of the characters' worlds <UNK> managed to produce shot after shot after shot that stuck with me long after the credits rolled br br and no review of this film would be complete without a nod to the amazing soundtrack the music in this film is used to amazing effect at times subtly <UNK> the action at other times taking center stage but never getting in the way or <UNK> into <UNK> music video the soundtrack plays like the ultimate greatest hits though i suspect that label would probably not sit very well with the director br br the new double dvd archive edition offers some deleted scenes trailers music videos and a <UNK> documentary the deleted scenes offer some insight into the making of the film through alternate opening and closing sequences and it's certainly a treat to have the rare and beautiful <UNK> kind video the <UNK> documentary is fine if a bit worse for wear and certainly more extensive documentaries are available for the hardcore fans <UNK> absent is a director commentary and i can't help but wonder if <UNK> has plans to re release this at some point with that tasty <UNK> attached br br suffice to say that the next time you're looking for a strong piece of work from a talented filmmaker i recommend you get on board
<START> here in germany it was only shown on tv one time today as everything becomes mainstream it's absolute impossible to watch a film like this again on the screen maybe it's the same in usa or especially <UNK> the message is a brutal truth find friends to make your ideas come a bit closer to reality or you become a loser if not an <UNK> instead br br the whole film is not particularly as simple as it may seem here every little scene every sentence every behavior of the characters show a sharp look at what could happen when one person is not accepted in a sadistic crowd which calls itself normal br br very well played by all this is a must seen who is the main character john not cox folks remember <UNK> <UNK> who still is bimbo decide and you will get the plot as it is intended br br a bitter look at what society becomes in a <UNK> system kind of <UNK> in the <UNK> and lord of the flies thought to the very end br br the final maybe change your own mind word
<START> the one is a very <UNK> name show mostly because it comes close to being the only network shows on in prime time that barely more than one person is watching br br when i first heard of the one i thought to myself another sing song show we don't have enough of those and then <UNK> to <UNK> on my helmet and run about my home hitting my head on blunt objects and sharp <UNK> because in all honesty the constant year round pain and suffering inflicted by having only one or two talent based reality shows running just isn't enough we needed another one and not just any one the one the one with slightly less attractive contestants with slightly less talent the one with slightly less of a point though it's hard to imagine a scenario in which that's possible the one with pointless footage of the contestants when they're not performing included because i care what johnny sings a lot does in his off hours i really do now you may be thinking hey on the entire continent of north america less than 4 million people watched the first episode doesn't that mean this show sucks well to that i say less than 4 million people in north america have <UNK> so sometimes low numbers bring good news now don't they think about it br br in the end the one may be horribly unoriginal a show that even the airing network couldn't be bothered to promote because they too realize how absolutely worthless it is but it's still not <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i say this if you want to see art you go to an art gallery if you want to see a movie you go to a theater trying to <UNK> art and film proves disastrous in where the heart is an interesting cast is totally wasted in this embarrassment you like <UNK> coleman see short time you like <UNK> glover see <UNK> you like uma thurman see kill bill above all if you like christopher plummer see the silent partner because his character here is a terrible embarrassment in fact this entire production is an embarrassment sure the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes so make a short but do not subject an audience to pointless nonsense <UNK> as filmed entertainment <UNK>
<START> a lot of actors have a <UNK> of good movie roles in their soul some a handful others maybe a couple br br then there's linda blair the exorcist that's it br br when you see <UNK> heat and watch linda blair in it you have to wonder what if anything was running through her mind br br certainly not oh boy oscar for best actress here i come br br just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the '70s this one actually has names you may recognize john <UNK> plays the dean i mean the warden with a hot <UNK> in his office wonder what he told the <UNK> stella stevens pops up even henry <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> show how bad they needed the work br br and special mention of course for our heroine <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> prisoner who puts the moves on poor blair to <UNK> <UNK> is as <UNK> does and everything <UNK> does is done perfect makes you forget what a terrible movie you're watching br br almost br br two stars one for <UNK> and another for trying to pass off linda blair as a sex symbol whatever could have possessed them get it
<START> i just recently bought the big trail 1930 it's an awesome amazing film i knew it by reputation but never expected it to be so magnificent my version is the one shot in <UNK> and i'll speak of that again later when one thinks of the western myth in film the names that come to mind are john ford and john wayne well you have only half the team here but the entire myth is present <UNK> walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the true plot is the struggle of the <UNK> of the nation br br there is a plot <UNK> on a romance between <UNK> coleman wayne and ruth cameron margaret <UNK> with the main villain red <UNK> being <UNK> played by <UNK> power sr but this has an almost incidental quality as the <UNK> train struggles forward against incredible natural and human examples are the crossing of the river the indian battle and <UNK> the burning desert the aftermath of the battle is given a <UNK> touch when a doll is placed on the grave of a child killed while a faithful dog lies down on its <UNK> grave br br magnificent <UNK> are filled with energy and activity the opening scene as the <UNK> train <UNK> to leave the square dance <UNK> and the great buffalo <UNK> are some that spring to mind marvellous use is made of location shooting throughout another feature of this splendid film is the fact that men and women are given equal credit for their parts in the great struggle women work fight and confront the terrible <UNK> with the same <UNK> and strength as their male counterparts the finale has a <UNK> uplifting experience as coleman and cameron meet in the gigantic <UNK> <UNK> forest to start their new life br br the acting is quite acceptable throughout i've already mentioned <UNK> <UNK> scene stealing performance <UNK> marshall is excellent as <UNK> sidekick and <UNK> <UNK> convincingly portrays a woman who develops an inner strength as she encounters her own problems as well as those <UNK> to herself the comic relief is the weakest aspect of this film but these scenes are not common and are <UNK> up in the tremendous <UNK> of the film br br i've read much criticism of wayne's even going so far as to blame his wooden acting for the failure of the film at the box office i think this is unfair wayne was in his first major role and certainly had not developed the charisma of his performance in <UNK> but he still does a <UNK> job in a role which is certainly going to play second <UNK> to the great over <UNK> theme after the big trail wayne played in a large number of low budget b westerns i have a number of these and one can see the developing actor in them when <UNK> came he was ready for it and the big trail was a significant part of that <UNK> br br i mentioned earlier that my version is the one shot in <UNK> it's still impressive but to get some idea of the effect of the <UNK> version i set the tv screen to 16 9 which doesn't cause any <UNK> while not having the complete effect of the <UNK> version it was good enough to make me want to get the latter in addition the film shot in <UNK> has a few extra scenes not in the form made for ordinary theatrical showing br br all in all this film deserves to be in any list of the greatest westerns ever made
<START> br br i was fascinated to read the range of opinions on <UNK> from awesome breathtaking and most things between right down to golden turkey <UNK> i find myself in the latter camp br br the producers obviously thought that if they mixed plenty of over the top violence with <UNK> of four letter <UNK> they'd have another lock stock and two smoking <UNK> on their hands a pity that they forgot to include wit style charm and flair and it was certainly a mistake to feature a visit to welles' classic the lady from <UNK> thus serving to remind us how much better cinema can be br br john hannah gets his shirt off at every opportunity a huge american drives around in a mini minor as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for cult status and even the beautiful amanda <UNK> can't add any class to these proceedings br br if you want to see a good brit film try the sublime <UNK>
<START> surrender cinema has been known for their extremely erotic almost explicit sci fi films while they generally do very well at these 1 2 virtual encounters this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape any number of girls some recognizable and others not are in this film in all stages of nudity there are also several clips from other films which are outstanding unless you've seen those other films there are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things some playing basketball others talking still others playing with themselves the only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene a short but erotic girl girl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable sandy and a more subdued not highly recommended
<START> i watched this film because i thought it would be a classic amy adams movie wow this movie is so bad on so many levels it <UNK> the imagination it is poorly constructed for one also the script and the acting is just awful but hey even johnny <UNK> has a slew of bad films under his belt the upside of this movie would be amy singing and even on that score i believe better songs could have been chosen amy is of course beautiful to see and if you are a die hard fan of hers you will probably watch this title no matter what just don't expect too much i wish i could have found more to like but it was just painful to watch i recommend sunshine cleaning or doubt
<START> i have waited a long time to see this movie <UNK> finally ran it one night i thought it would be something like <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> wrong this film doesn't recreate that underworld of <UNK> dirty smoke filled character filled bars you associate with his stories it also fails to capture that <UNK> attitude that mickey rourke did so well in the above mentioned film that natural smart ass attitude fans of charles <UNK> will enjoy seeing scenes from his books on screen but those unfamiliar with his books could get the wrong impression about his works this film looks like just another <UNK> of the week about a drunk and his relationships if you want to get a better idea about charles <UNK> world watch <UNK>
<START> greta garbo stars in a very early 1930 mgm the first time <UNK> is a powerful movie but not for everyone the movie is filmed like a stage play short on sets and cinematography long on dialogue and dramatic characterizations eugene <UNK> who wrote the play is known for his dark work and <UNK> character anna christie is a bleak figure with a tortured past br br the sound quality on the dvd was mediocre not helping matters is that george f marion who plays <UNK> estranged dad chris is <UNK> hard to understand marion gives a good performance as the old drunken <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on insanity with his <UNK> of the evil <UNK> <UNK> but his dialogue is written with a very heavy swedish accent this is true to original play marie <UNK> dialogue as <UNK> <UNK> is equally hard to understand <UNK> <UNK> portrays a broken down old drunken women a her dialogue also is true to original play as is charles <UNK> as the irish <UNK> matt burke who <UNK> anna in a troubled relationship garbo is actually the <UNK> to understand br br the films strong point is greta garbo she delivers a gut wrenching performance as the victim of neglect and abuse leading to a life of prostitution garbo was a huge star at the time and considered one of the most beautiful women in hollywood here her look isn't glamorous it's tortured her body <UNK> nearly <UNK> over in agony she her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen garbo conveys these angst ridden feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery br br this is dark subject matter and garbo brings it to life <UNK> not light fare not fun not for everyone is strong emotions <UNK> up from the depths for examination this is one <UNK> ride
<START> <UNK> was in itself a decent 80s horror flick no classic by any means but an enjoyable piece of fluff why then have we now been treated to a fourth film in this franchise is beyond me as in previous sequels there's nothing here to really connect the films except for the monster the witch and ed <UNK> lance <UNK> this time out we follow the <UNK> between the and the <UNK> part of the film is a romeo and juliet romance as a young mccoy boy and his <UNK> lover decide to run away to be together soon however they are torn apart and the boy's sister is killed the boy escapes to the woods and gets the witch to <UNK> <UNK> for some vengeance the acting is passable at best amateurish at the worst the titular demon doesn't even really show up for almost forty minutes and when it does its a pale comparison between it and the original design overall blood <UNK> fails to impress it may be worth a watch once but certainly not an addition to the collection
<START> i like <UNK> <UNK> my cable <UNK> summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again br br the early part is difficult to follow but later it <UNK> up i believe the screenwriter did a good job of <UNK> up the loose ends br br some of the acting is unconvincing but maybe that's because i was always expecting some kind of double cross in that case the poor acting would be the <UNK> of the characters <UNK> with each other so it fits very well br br the important theme is the carnival owner <UNK> is <UNK> money for a local casino his snake <UNK> wife wants to steal it she complains to <UNK> <UNK> how terrible her life is and how he could help her get out of it br br there are 3 or 4 plot twists which is probably the reason for all of those loose ends and just when you think you have solved the mystery something else will happen br br my 8 10 score is mostly for the plot br br i won't say any more i don't like spoilers so i don't want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time
<START> i became a fan of the tv series homicide life on the <UNK> late in the show's run but became a fan very quickly it was a cop show unlike any other visually different in its use of hand held cameras taking the viewer everywhere with its <UNK> and <UNK> cast and their varying and fascinating personalities and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department including the corruption and personality <UNK> that bubble up to the surface br br homicide the movie the reunion follow up to the series is as good as a made for television film can be after lt <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> now a candidate for mayor of <UNK> is shot the <UNK> cast members are back to help find the killer in addition the cast members who left the force and those who died also manage to have their place in the film the intensity and fire that marked the series return and the script <UNK> with the same fire that marked the series all in all a terrific tv movie br br vote 9
<START> this is a really really bad movie that may seem like an <UNK> a <UNK> childish <UNK> comparable to a petty <UNK> insult the truth is there is not enough i can say about the confusing senseless plot the really atrocious acting i'm talking nasty here folks or the random images of violence toward women that make up the chaotic <UNK> of <UNK> horrendous film making mistakes that <UNK> this <UNK> to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema <UNK> human culture please take my word for it don't watch it ever i'm serious stop you'll thank me for it later
<START> james <UNK> <UNK> didn't expect that he would be the next prime minister unlike in america the party is elected in britain while we americans vote for candidates regardless of their party despite the differences paul <UNK> performance as minister turned prime minister almost overnight is helped by his senior <UNK> sir <UNK> played by another knight sir <UNK> <UNK> and veteran actor derek also returns to the scene as well now instead of pleasing some people he has to please the nation rather than his now he has a hard job to do even more difficult than before now he must <UNK> the <UNK> list and work with her <UNK> as well on a regular basis <UNK> is not the <UNK> type he is rather than the every man who we like and don't want to dislike and turn into a villain of sorts or a vicious dictator now we see the prime <UNK> point of view and all the pleasing that must go on as well as handle strikes
<START> just watched this today on tcm where the other reviewers here saw it br br sorry that i was the only one to find davies a weak actress with a truly awful attempt at an irish irish american or otherwise accent as she's the star it was sort of hard for me to get past that especially as the other reviewers have said that this was her finest performance br br another particularly terrible davies performance was in <UNK> <UNK> which i also watched today in this film given a 9 of 10 rating here her accent switches from that of a correct french woman to an odd combination of italian and swiss br br interestingly in <UNK> one hour bio of davies captured on film the true story of marion davies 2001 film <UNK> <UNK> basinger claims that one of the things that you note about marion davies in her sound work is how good she is at doing accents of course this bio also includes commentary by fans make of that what you will br br davies was a very attractive young woman and by all accounts a terrific <UNK> in real life br br and because a part of her <UNK> added <UNK> to the real life answer to joseph character's search for the meaning behind <UNK> final word in the opening scene of the great citizen kane she's earned her spot among the great stories if hollywood's history br br but i think welles <UNK> got it right for the most part with the susan alexander <UNK> of the real article br br don't bother voting as to whether you agree or disagree with this post as i really couldn't care less
<START> although the plot of cover girl is very flimsy and tired it does serve well enough as an anchor for the <UNK> and gershwin musical numbers following her signature role in <UNK> hayworth <UNK> to star in this musical that seems <UNK> made for her besides looking as gorgeous as ever she <UNK> with her dancing as well gene kelly who was on <UNK> to columbia from mgm matches her in dancing and the sequence where he with his own shadow was nicely done the supporting characters were also competently acted personally i didn't enjoy cover girl as much as the musicals hayworth made with fred astaire however cover girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend my score 7 10
<START> i found the first 90 minutes of this film to be very interesting even though a few parts of it were ridiculous i e philip seymour <UNK> character the last 60 minutes were <UNK> and i began to lose interest in the film the last hour lasted forever it seemed br br the movie is nicely acted and i can see why <UNK> <UNK> won an academy award since her character was so interesting the movie also is beautifully filmed and the story is an emotional one however i found the message to be a bad one not surprising these days in hollywood in this story jude law <UNK> the <UNK> army during the civil war his reason his girlfriend misses him and wants him home he's also getting <UNK> with war can you imagine if every soldier who was in a similar boat deserted the army in the two world wars br br yet in this film of course all of that is perfectly acceptable then again what liberal filmmaker has ever had a nice thing to say about the u s military to add to their left wing <UNK> they portray a vigilante like <UNK> going after as cold blooded sick killers well in the world of films as we know good is portrayed as bad and bad is good and only <UNK> would portray as heroes
<START> possibly john cassavetes best film to date and definitely his funniest seymour <UNK> plays the young <UNK> smitten with real life wife of cassavetes gena rowlands excellent as usual a must see gem of a film if you can locate it
<START> something does not work in this movie there are absolutely no <UNK> between the actors in fact their very acting seems frozen sometimes amateur also the script is not convincing and not reliable
<START> the one thing that can be said about running out of time is that it's an immensely clever film it's interesting to note that the film's writers are french which may explain the movie's out of the norm vibe as it doesn't really fit in with what is <UNK> called hong kong cinema br br the movie concerns a thief who plans revenge on some criminal types using the assistance of an equally clever cop but first he has to convince the cop to join his personal <UNK> and so begins a series of games where the thief the cop into his plan br br quite a clever movie br br 7 out of 10 br br go to www <UNK> com for a more detailed review of this movie or full length reviews of other foreign films
<START> although at times i was the only one in the cinema who was laughing this is the main pleasure i took from the beautifully shot <UNK> laughter although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy the <UNK> of black humour <UNK> through at regular <UNK> br br it helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful and that i was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady who was <UNK> elegant no matter how blood <UNK> and <UNK> she became br br i read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong i didn't think so in fact the last scenes moving and hilarious i mean the brown shoes by turns were among the best in the film
<START> i must be honest i like romantic comedies but this was not what i had hoped for i thought ellen <UNK> was having the biggest part which should have been because i didn't like the two struggling bed partners it was awful poor tom <UNK> he had to act with someone who was that much in the picture while it should have been him and ellen to be in most of the film they were the only believable ones and the only really funny parts starred them not kate <UNK> and that everett guy cool that mummy is coming out of the closet i thought that was a nice surprise br br i'm just glad i saw it on the cable and i didn't pay any money renting it
<START> okay so this was made way back in 1993 directed loosely by robert and written loosely by john it's supposed to be based on a true story hard to believe anyone could be so stupid and blind to the truth for certainly it was obvious from the beginning that this dame was after all she could get br br tim <UNK> looking somewhat older than i remember him played the empty headed man who was looking for romance in his somewhat dull and empty life well it came to him in the likes of tracy <UNK> a somewhat <UNK> looking girl with kinky sex as her means of <UNK> her guys br br come on phone sex even in the 90s was old hat can't believe someone would fall for that old line but mr <UNK> seemed to buy it and it cost him plenty br br the hardest scene to take was when he finally threw the dame out of his apartment putting all her junk in the <UNK> in front of his apartment and then had the stupidity not to change the locks that's when i had enough of this trite movie it made me want to wish the dame had tried it on me so i could have the satisfaction of telling her to take a <UNK> br br i give this <UNK> a 1 out of 100 that's how bad i thought it was i guess you can't blame the actors but they were awful did they actually try to play this with a straight face
<START> as i read the script on line i thought capote needed a <UNK> having just seen it on <UNK> i can tell you it wasn't <UNK> it was butchered like that poor family example in the script truman <UNK> shawn adorable one here he is mr shawn br br bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de flame capote and bash his circle are we to really believe they thought so little of they <UNK> her little <UNK> like an obnoxious in joke they turn perry smith into this oh so sensitive victim even as he's shown <UNK> the <UNK> it's one thing to <UNK> the facts it's another to drop the ball the <UNK> were carried out between 12 45 1 19 am april 14 truman is shown at the prison 22 hours later br br i was totally <UNK> by the acting <UNK> doesn't even try to sound like an <UNK> native the way cooper kept shouting alvin i was waiting for the to show up hoffman gives us not the charming <UNK> but a pathetic suck up who sees an horrific act as his ticket to the big time when hoffman <UNK> about being tortured by the endless appeals i wanted to give him a shotgun so he could do us both a favor and blow his brains out
<START> i could not believe what i saw once brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should never of been made the plots are dreadful and the dialogue at first i thought it was a spoof and the acting abysmal everything about it is bad from the cheap sets to the phony backdrops a bunch of paintings <UNK> respectable <UNK> struggle to get their vision realised yet this <UNK> pathetic attempt at a mini series makes it to our <UNK> with 3 oscar winners making appearances i can only guess everyone involved somehow hurt the writer and director and were forced maybe at <UNK> to star in this worthless t v trash
<START> what a <UNK> br br it must have been made for tv or cable br br look forget the screenplay forget the bunch of forgettable actors excuse me continuity the <UNK> whatever or whoever he is an agent takes off in an <UNK> is shown in an <UNK> his guts up and later the aircraft shown is an phantom <UNK> wish that i could be so <UNK> br br apart from the male actors the women are <UNK> blue eyed and long <UNK> and eventually get to cry about the heroes who save them even when a solid <UNK> could save most of the <UNK> <UNK> the blond drops the <UNK> tool duh br br as an sf movie one out of ten as a movie per se 1 2 that's a half point they should have <UNK> the space station and headed for mars br br major <UNK>
<START> it starts off pretty well with the accident and the decision not to return to la but everything falls into place too quickly there is a decent plot twist towards the end but so many scenes that don't make sense randy played by brian austin green comes home angry and ready to confront people and he takes the time to put on the club when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere i don't want to spoil it for anyone who does decide to see it but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous even the acting which wasn't bad early on turns bad towards the end don't bother unless you want to see how bad it is
<START> okay i admit i like <UNK> <UNK> in an <UNK> way i just have a thing for tall women with swords there i said it br br what's wrong with the movie just about every mistake you can make was made you take a successful movie series conan and you drag it through the mud with a bad script bad casting bad effects and the worst thing of all you put a cute kid in there for comic relief this kind of thing almost killed the indiana jones series ya know cute kids are for disney movies not real movies <UNK> at least took the movie seriously even though it seems nobody else did the plot had <UNK> repeatedly pulling red <UNK> fat out of the fire and that <UNK> her character considerably a warrior woman doesn't need a dude to get her out of a mess thats her job to not re use the conan character in this movie was a crime <UNK> the movie never set the proper mood and its pacing was rather disjointed and sloppy unlike conan the barbarian which had multiple story lines that <UNK> <UNK> when it comes to fantasy movies its okay to have cheesy costumes its okay to have <UNK> style animation its okay to have silly <UNK> sets that make no sense but to have a horrible script is unforgivable br br this movie could have been a classic but the script felt like it was written by a 12 year old
<START> my god the things that passed for entertainment in this country br br this is not the tom and jerry you may have enjoyed on saturday <UNK> featuring a hapless cat and a clever mouse this is a much earlier animation series featuring a pair of <UNK> and jeff <UNK> who get themselves into various <UNK> that result in any of the then typical dancing <UNK> type gags that made up so much of early animation br br this particularly vile outing apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of actual black stage comedians of the time has the pair crashing in the ocean while flying to africa <UNK> black face make up exaggerated <UNK> <UNK> and don't fail me now situations br br it only shows that in the 70 years between <UNK> and this film the american view of <UNK> hadn't progressed much then again at least one of them apparently had a <UNK> license
<START> with all the dreck out there this is a gentle movie about young love yes it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves but why aren't people down on romeo and juliet paul and michelle are models of good behave compared to them br br yes they run away and set up an ideal life but this is a movie not real life paul is more sexually interested than michelle who has been come onto in a bad way eventually they have sex but no one is forced into it the movie does let kids know that sex can cause babies br br one thing there is nudity in the movies the camera does not focus on it but it is there br br the ending of the movie has paul in good chance of being found out in paul and michelle they separate for a time if you don't like the ending of a movie think one up yourself alternative endings are not just for dvds
<START> after two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film we see a dark haired obviously rich beauty in the back of a <UNK> her driver stops at an odd location on <UNK> drive which is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> two lane road full of <UNK> <UNK> los angeles just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the <UNK> only the dark haired woman survives she works her way down the <UNK> to sunset <UNK> and hides in a <UNK> woman's apartment shortly after betty <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> woman's niece shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman who now has <UNK> the bulk of the first part of the film is betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse this is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about hollywood producers and directors with occasional <UNK> into a land of <UNK> and prostitutes br br the above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed but that's not the half of it the film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation it's basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around even if you have a lot of experience with like minded films such as <UNK> 2000 <UNK> <UNK> 2001 the i inside 2003 and the <UNK> effect 2004 you may not understand it on a second viewing either the studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director david lynch write 10 clues to <UNK> this thriller and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the dvd lynch being of a particular <UNK> these clues are almost as <UNK> as the film itself it doesn't help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex it takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be real and there is a complex <UNK> of flashbacks in some sections with only <UNK> clues that they're flashbacks br br but is the film worth watching or worth trying to figure out that depends on your tastes obviously on a surface level the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of <UNK> although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers but those qualities and many other <UNK> aspects of the film are typical of lynch a prime <UNK> moment is the old couple in the beginning <UNK> smiling almost as if they're alien <UNK> people trying to put on a front if you're familiar with that style and like it you'll find much to love here although in many ways <UNK> drive is fairly understated for lynch it's also worth noting for viewers <UNK> primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects that <UNK> drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene it's not gratuitous although i have no problems with but is instead an important <UNK> in the film br br like all of lynch's films it's easy to become <UNK> in his unique approach to every aspect of <UNK> art and his attention to detail any serious student of film including <UNK> students <UNK> should study <UNK> drive many will love it lynch doesn't let anything pass <UNK> he includes brilliant color schemes such as the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> with important symbolism he makes unusual use of sound such as the <UNK> <UNK> carrying over into the section of score that follows it when betty first arrives at the airport he directs his actors to deliver their lines in a <UNK> of bizarre ways such as his characteristic odd pauses he lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through such as the name and the hot dogs made for <UNK> sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism br br lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important subtle clues throughout the film to help one <UNK> the meaning it's interesting to note that lynch even apparently demands that the dvd programming be unusual there are no chapters on the disc you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or <UNK> to get back to particular points br br if the <UNK> and <UNK> meaning of the film are attractive to you or if you're just fond of <UNK> then <UNK> drive is well worth watching for that aspect there is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film at least on a broad <UNK> level i won't <UNK> the standard interpretation here it is worth <UNK> but only after you've seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions many <UNK> and have been written on the film and interpretations there are even <UNK> dedicated to it br br for my money however although i generally love lynch and find many things about <UNK> drive attractive it is not quite a 10 for me at least not yet i have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings to me though the twist aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as the i inside and the <UNK> effect <UNK> drive is more attractive to me for its surface <UNK> touches but the plot doesn't carry them as well as some of lynch's other films br br still <UNK> drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd if you're serious about film and do not mind having to think about what you watch as if those two would not necessarily <UNK> you shouldn't miss this one
<START> radio <UNK> is one of my most loved american movies br br the really great job of two boys joe and <UNK> wood in spite of terrible performance of t hanks at the beginning and ending with marvellous script of d m evans and powerful and emotional directing of r <UNK> plus absolutely incredibly <UNK> music score of h <UNK> allowed the radio <UNK> to win one of the first places in my family's rating of movies br br it's so pity that that very good movie was by some movie critics br br i just can't help waiting to see it on dvd
<START> i've seen just after i've seen all roger moore films and i must say that it felt so good to see connery again he proves for all times that he is the one and only bond br br the film itself isn't really a masterpiece but it is really worth watching the jokes sit much better here the effects are funny and interesting connery is connery and <UNK> is really a good villain but von <UNK> is just wasted and the score is not often good and there are a few scenes that seem pretty unnecessary br br 7 10 2 5 4 3 1 6
<START> when a friend and i saw this in the recent releases we decided to get it despite the fact that neither of us had heard of it before we both like <UNK> <UNK> and it had james coburn so we figured it couldn't be that bad we were wrong it was it was really that bad no actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing it was like taking titanic the <UNK> adventure and some nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and <UNK> it all together br br i must admit that there were a couple of chuckles i did laugh when the head cabin boy is asking alan <UNK> <UNK> if he's some <UNK> marine the other laughs this film got though had nothing to do with the writing i would <UNK> love to know how the people making this movie thought that you could have a cruise liner knocked upside down and have it remain steady it isn't <UNK> or anything br br if you are looking for something to watch for <UNK> <UNK> james coburn or any of the rest of this cast move on find something good that they did
<START> i found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic it tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system but it doesn't even present a positive solution i guess i didn't feel really for the kids i totally can understand what their <UNK> were and i know how poor the state of schools are but i found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of if this comes on tv don't waste your time watch short circuit again for the time
<START> william h macy always gives a good performance he never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else in short he's what more actors should be like a slight case of murder is directed by steven who went on to do two more great films with macy door to door the <UNK> cap br br television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting poor cinematography and sub par scripting that's why it's so refreshing to see a tv movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for to tell a small story not a simplistic story that does not require viewing on the big screen br br a slight case of murder is light entertaining fare and an great watch br br 7 6 out of 10
<START> this movie based on a true story of <UNK> is one of the best films i've seen on race relations in south africa a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's south africa i put it in on the scale of american history x as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> and how the certain segments of the christian church taught a false <UNK> regarding race to justify an injustice br br it's strong message of forgiveness and redemption is one of <UNK> in films today the violence is well done as to show the <UNK> of crimes and greatness of his transformation br br one word about jan <UNK> who played <UNK> he carries you through the darkness of <UNK> to his <UNK> transformation he went to some dark places as an actor and is to be <UNK> on his performance br br another standout performance was that of <UNK> who plays <UNK> one victim of crimes he was able to pull from some places of pain that really touched you as you watched his performance br br very good movie to show the teens
<START> although my exposure to world cultures is limited i do try this was a film that i tried and hated worst of all after hearing so many people <UNK> the <UNK> of typical hollywood fare and its stereotypical caricatures i saw characters too outrageous for <UNK> being <UNK> as realistic br br clint wants out of the drug life and to do this he <UNK> to be a <UNK> aim high i always say brad or a <UNK> photo of him or quite possibly a curly wig on a stick it was hard to tell offers to hire clint if he gets a pair of shoes br br clint and a huge <UNK> apparently wander the whole of england trying to get him some shoes eventually they end up at a suburban home whose isn't clear mum helps a girl shoot up oh now there's some realism for you mrs brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of american <UNK> but she never helped <UNK> tie off and find a vein good god dad comes home and sings some elvis tunes and then chases the kids away br br why didn't clint borrow some money and buy shoes at a second hand store why didn't he go to a church and ask a kindly nun for some help why didn't he hang out in front of a shoe store and <UNK> i just don't know none of these things seemed to be beneath him <UNK> groups like <UNK> and the salvation army have stores to help people i know people who work there if someone with no money showed up and needed shoes the staff would give the person some shoes maybe not <UNK> or <UNK> but some form of foot covering not many of these groups hand out cell phones to the <UNK> but shoes are usually no problem what a dumb concept the world or at least the western part of it simply isn't that cruel in england maybe it's from the <UNK> royal charity rather than <UNK> but people who need shoes do get them br br aside from the quest for shoes there was no <UNK> plot to get in the way of the action not that it made the movie any <UNK> or more bearable mind you despite checking the tape jacket several times i was not watching the 20 hour extended version it only seemed that way br br did clint get his shoes did the cardboard <UNK> of brad <UNK> hire him at the restaurant did i ever watch anything else foreign ever again br br spoiler yes yes and yes br br as for the fate of this particular film i decided to end it all i took out my s w 45 and shot a half inch hole through the <UNK> <UNK> i made sure to <UNK> it first i put it back in the tape <UNK> returned it to the rental store and amazingly no one ever called to ask about it meaning of course that no one else rented it for at least the remaining three years i lived in that city others knew something that i didn't live and learn br br btw if you rent something you've never seen before and someone has actually put a bullet through it take it as a sign and if you work at the video department i'm just kidding br br <UNK> this classic has yet to see the light of day on dvd for which we should be <UNK> thankful to the digital gods
<START> in <UNK> in a small village in japan the wife of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has an affair with a man twenty six years younger <UNK> <UNK> becomes jealous of and plots with to kill him they <UNK> and dump his body inside a well in the woods and tells the locals that moved to tokyo to work three years later the locals <UNK> about the fate of and is haunted by his ghost the situation becomes unbearable to and when a police authority comes to the village to investigate the disappearance of br br <UNK> no is a surreal and supernatural love story the <UNK> and the guilty complex of make her see the ghost of her murdered husband spoiling the perfect plot of her lover the cinematography is <UNK> by the quality of the vhs released in brazil but there are very beautiful scenes <UNK> <UNK> and the american remake the ring use the view of the well from inside in the same angle the performances and direction are excellent making <UNK> no a great movie my vote is eight br br title brazil o da the empire of passion
<START> dracula john carradine visits dr <UNK> <UNK> stevens who believes everything can be <UNK> by science he wants to cure his <UNK> <UNK> agrees then lawrence <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr pops up looking for a cure for his turning into a werewolf <UNK> frankenstein monster is discovered too but doesn't really do anything br br very ambitious plot for a universal horror film from the 1940s trying to cure the monsters by science is actually an interesting idea also this movie has beautiful sets love the castle to doctor lives in tons of atmosphere is very well directed great use of shadows and has pretty good special effects br br the acting is all good except for carradine he tries but i could never accept him as dracula also lionel <UNK> pops in playing as always the chief of police this is pretty much forgotten and <UNK> as a stupid film but i think it's very good it's also to last time the universal monsters were done seriously the next film was in 1948 in <UNK> <UNK> meet frankenstein it's a great film but the accent is more on comedy br br the only real flaw here is there's a lot of plot for <UNK> minutes and some gaps in logic why does dracula try to bite lovely martha when he's being <UNK> and why and how does the doctor get into his castle still these are small complaints recommended
<START> two hands is a good addition to the australian film <UNK> br br it is that curious mix of real life surreal life comedy tragedy and love the <UNK> have developed on their own br br heath ledger is basically a good if naive guy wanting to get on he falls in with a local big man bryan brown but at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets alex rose <UNK> here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected after getting on the wrong side of accidentally things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little <UNK> help this would have been a short sad film yes jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes <UNK> in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it although there is a <UNK> theme through the story it is not <UNK> and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives br br heath ledger is excellent as jimmy innocent and <UNK> at the same time rose is hypnotic as alex and bryan is marvellous as usual this is a small ensemble of characters are believable and i found myself caring about the good guys and <UNK> the baddies br br this dvd is usually in the cheap <UNK> so i would recommend adding it too your dvd collection it would be money well spent br br 8 out of 10
<START> its a good film set in vienna about a cab driver toni donald who steals a <UNK> identity when the passenger is shot whilst sitting in the back of his cab this gives him an identity as he is an illegal immigrant but he needs to play out the role of the victim until he catches a flight to the u s with a ticket in the <UNK> name mrs joan <UNK> him but she is accused of having mental problems by her husband claude francis <UNK> a concert <UNK> as a result toni is let off the hook claude does not want to part from his wife but she runs away from him there are several plot twists and eventually both toni and mrs make a run for it together they are both trying to escape from their lives in vienna there is a tense exciting build up to the finale are they going to get away br br unfortunately the picture quality isn't fantastic and there is a line that runs down the middle of the picture for a while the cast are all very good in their roles especially francis portrayal of claude also important to the story are <UNK> <UNK> as the cab company owner marie <UNK> as hometown girlfriend and the inspector <UNK> <UNK> br br its a good film
<START> well i like patricia she is a beautiful lady and an extremely gifted and versatile singer her acting in this film is more than competent and from my point of view about the only redeeming of this film she very gently captures the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious problem however what i tremendously dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well known french chain of <UNK> the other thing is that the story seems to <UNK> for way to long without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be on a positive note you may argue that the film is not predictable but you could also say it's <UNK> boring because of the lack of <UNK> there are some nice shots in the film you can't help thinking that all the parts just don't add up to anything at all it really is a pity really shines in this film
<START> for <UNK> of bad movies <UNK> is a true gem with truly horrid dialog acting and directing it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre it's priceless for a good laugh in particular the scenes involving the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> motorcycle cult are especially good and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh br br sadly the scenes with dorothy <UNK> really fail to deliver but since she's playing an <UNK> i suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting br br bad movie lovers don't pass this one up
<START> the message of hero is quite clear the idea of greater china is more important than the death and the suffering of millions at a time when china is <UNK> its war toys over <UNK> it is <UNK> for western viewers to <UNK> this piece of over produced government <UNK> <UNK> trash br br particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media roger ebert of chicago <UNK> david of <UNK> charles taylor of <UNK> and many others have <UNK> <UNK> hero in so doing they have <UNK> <UNK> its <UNK> political message the only critic that i know of who saw through the film's glossy <UNK> was j <UNK> of the village voice who wrote of the film's <UNK> <UNK> and its <UNK> of ruthless <UNK> and self sacrifice on the <UNK> of national greatness i for one sign my name under final <UNK> hero is nothing more than fascinating <UNK>
<START> definitely worth renting good clean family entertainment my 4 and 5 year olds and i loved it kept them on the edge of their seats i recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this as it can be quite suspenseful for them it's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children and so this is a rare find some of the acting realism isn't quite there at times or maybe is a little corny but children don't seem to notice or care they love it parts are predictable but other parts are not like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are the movie doesn't have any really scary creepy stuff and so i doubt it will give children nightmares it does inspire children to dream which is something we need to encourage and foster more in our children rent and be blessed
<START> another great musical from <UNK> golden age i liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from broadway and all its <UNK> although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform gene kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers rita hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she's given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine trouble begins for gene kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town phil <UNK> plays one of the three friends and does a good job of course there is the music and the dancing one dance performance by gene kelly stands out he is walking along the street at night alone and he see his reflection in a shop window his reflection soon starts dancing along with him in the streets great cinematography don't miss this one great entertainment
<START> the mystery and its solution was a great noir <UNK> i do have some questions though maybe i wasn't paying enough attention br br who killed the neighbor and why who killed the replacement girl and why br br and some minor <UNK> they should have shown the at the hotel for the switch not that they should have shown the switch but they should have shown jim and the girl going in the hotel jim going to the bathroom coming out and being told by the bartender that his girlfriend went to the car without him br br then jim getting back in the car and seeing the sleeping woman and little girl in his back seat br br this would have given the viewer a sporting chance at <UNK> out the solution br br i wish i taped it though i'd like to see it again
<START> i think <UNK> black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever he gave us the awesome at it's time lethal weapon shooting mel gibson to super stardom then followed that up with the second best movie bruce willis has ever been in the last <UNK> stumbled a bit with the last action hero but redeemed himself with this one the long kiss <UNK> br br if you're a fan of action films this has it all action comedy thrills then tops it of with more action comedy and thrills <UNK> davies is great <UNK> l jackson is even greater don't miss it br br 9 10
<START> i caught this film at an screening in los angeles in july 2006 it's rough around the edges sound recording in particular is <UNK> and often very funny the script is rather <UNK> episodic and ends abruptly but ash christian <UNK> the film with lots of genuine heart it's also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay film that doesn't star underwear models obsessed with <UNK> and chasing straight guys props to a <UNK> sympathetic jonathan as mr cox a <UNK> spirit to rodney ash christian the lively and spirited ashley as <UNK> best friend and deborah as <UNK> mom who is given the best one liners in the script and steals her every scene the film is like its writer director and a bit odd but also very sweet
<START> it may be hard to explain how but this film is a masterpiece perhaps because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry the true poetry and <UNK> of human passions and obsession <UNK> is amazing and needless to say that <UNK> is <UNK> as a perfect scenery dark sinking and dreary just like soul and classical music is more that a simple background <UNK> to human feelings in my opinion a classic masterpiece of european film making
<START> this film was made right in the area where i grew up and now live i know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film as a teenager i worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with ron <UNK> <UNK> and the car i am told that <UNK> and ben allison are are natives of <UNK> i was fortunate to see it at a local showing at that showing was one of the people who helped <UNK> locations and secure props such as the bus 1938 <UNK> used in the movie the bus had no reverse gear and during filming the driver missed his stopping point a few times and had to drive several miles to return to the proper point those details of the technical issues added to the enjoyment for me the film accurately depicts life in this area during wwii a well done film and i <UNK> <UNK> the dvd <UNK>
<START> michelle pfeiffer stars as a mob widow who seeks a normal life but has her hands full with the new boss and an undercover agent a lighthearted <UNK> film with some good laughs and pfeiffer in a comical role that she has fun with on a scale of one to ten 8
<START> best in show tracks the stories of a handful of human contestants as they prepare for one of the biggest dog shows in the <UNK> any amateur psychologist would say that an <UNK> love and obsession with a pet is a sign of something missing in someone's life and each of the characters in some way fills this cliche there's the former high school <UNK> who's now married to a geeky man the <UNK> label obsessed <UNK> couple the <UNK> <UNK> the young wife of a wealthy old <UNK> along with her short haired dog <UNK> and the gay couple br br what makes this film so funny though is the way it these stereotypes in a completely believable way almost <UNK> in many cases every ridiculous thing one of the characters does or says with their dog as an innocent <UNK> seems like the kind of behaviour you'd totally expect to see at a dog show br br the biggest laughs come from the commentary team of an all american style sports <UNK> comparing moments in a dog show to parts of a baseball game and his english <UNK> academic foil br br the trials of the geeky husband as his blonde wife meets an astonishing number of men from her past is also always good for a chuckle as is the demented behaviour of the <UNK> couple as the pressure builds while their <UNK> stays completely br br well worth watching even if cats are more your bag
<START> i enjoyed this film and after it finished it still makes you think about it i believe jeremy brett is brilliant in this role although his death acting was a little over the top but as its jeremy brett i didn't mind br br this is a good piece of drama and does follow oscar novel very closely if you enjoy this film then i recommend you also watch an ideal husband with jeremy brett as lord <UNK> br br this film gives a great insight into oscar way of thinking and while watching it the viewer is reminded of how in a way <UNK> grey is lord alfred douglas and basil is oscar <UNK>
<START> this movie is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work paul sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players that against all odds took home the championship 20 years ago they have all met for a reunion terry plays james a junior high principal and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for me role vincent <UNK> as phil plays an obnoxious businessman with just the right amount of money <UNK> tony <UNK> is george the current mayor of the town and appears to be on the verge of some sort of breakdown gary <UNK> plays tom a writer turned alcoholic and in my opinion is excellent in the role while they are all suppose to be celebrating their championship conflicts jealousy and fighting abound as the men come to terms with what was and is now they are forced to look at their lives in a non pleasant way it's unusual to have a group of men talking and crying about what could have been and i found it interesting watching them relate to each other it's not the best movie i've seen but it's certainly good enough for a viewing
<START> i accidentally happened upon this movie when i was looking for something to watch while eating lunch i actually turned to the we network because it said it had the last 20 minutes of some movie about the importance of sticking it for some <UNK> team i figured cheesy goodness well i got cheesy alright br br first i missed a good 20 40 minutes at the start of the movie luckily most of it was fairly quickly especially in the bedroom scene where crystal admits that she felt responsible for the death of her rapist br br i love jenny <UNK> and will watch her in just about anything she's just so pretty and i want my <UNK> to look as perfect as hers always does she looks great throughout this movie and doesn't really age over what seems to be more than a decade br br overall i felt bad for the actors as i watched this movie all of them tried to sell their parts but all were so poorly written that it was a constant struggle frankly i was surprised to see terry farrell and mitch ryan <UNK> dad from <UNK> greg in this br br but the writing was not the worst part of this movie about a half hour before the end her mother dies and when they show the <UNK> the death date is 1979 having missed the beginning i had gotten the impression from the wardrobe that this was taking place in the 80s not one <UNK> suit or bell bottom in sight shame on the person who did wardrobe for this film don't get me wrong all the outfits in this movie were beautiful but they were completely wrong for the time period it almost makes me wonder if they told the wardrobe person that it was a period piece br br bottom line good for a laugh or to feed a <UNK> <UNK> fix
<START> ok this <UNK> film was meant to be a joke right please tell me it was supposed to be a joke then i'll understand br br a big <UNK> bird with giant <UNK> or one claw anyway <UNK> down on unsuspecting folks on the ground and <UNK> them up <UNK> and jeff <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in order to keep things interesting but at least you'll enjoy a <UNK> <UNK> when you see the <UNK> it looks like a cross between a deranged chicken and <UNK> br br either director fred <UNK> just made this picture in a hurry and knew the bird looked utterly ridiculous or he really thought his film and creature were genuinely frightening i prefer to think and hope it was the former br br p s the bird needs a <UNK>
<START> i thought i was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie but at the earnest request of my friend who is an <UNK> fan of <UNK> i decided to turn up for the movie going at this cheap theater really bothered me <UNK> i had seen king kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town the movie starts of and surprisingly i wasn't complaining br br a great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> part <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> spare me the spelling who <UNK> thing all the time <UNK> also gives a stellar performance br br the story is that <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> and after getting brutally raped on her field job as a reporter her levels really increase her fianc√©e leaves her for the person she became in all her world comes down upon her <UNK> <UNK> her elder step sister takes care of her and in her imagination believes that she has been married to her fianc√©e has 5 children and they stay in <UNK> park <UNK> which really is a place in new york the plot goes on as becomes <UNK> as she believe no one believes her and she is being held captive in her home from her husband as fate would have and her fianc√©e meet up when they both are out on a trip 11 years after the brutal rape her fianc√©e has no existence in her real world she cant recognize him her fianc√©e now married and a father of two children feels it is his duty to correct the wrong he did 11 years earlier and he promises to take her to park <UNK> and he does he takes her to a place in which supposedly looks like her husband's home as <UNK> <UNK> her fianc√©e is talking on his cell phone he loses track of everyone comes looking for her but she is nowhere to be found she finally gets what was denied to her her family her own imaginative family in her own world at <UNK> park <UNK> br br i must say that it touched my heart i myself am now a fan of <UNK> direction the camera work is superb and the quality of performance is spell <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gives a solid performance as the <UNK> child <UNK> <UNK> gives another mind blowing role as the <UNK> elder sister who has the load of keeping the family <UNK> another neat and quiet role i don't know why this guy doesn't get big breaks he has so much potential lastly <UNK> she still <UNK> the audience even if she is not in front of the camera and behind it br br a very well deserved 8 10
<START> this satire is just really really dead on and nobody is <UNK> but even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of hitler here cleverly <UNK> as and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo german the general tone is pretty sad maybe because of the movie's place in history and the actors aren't even <UNK> that much i suppose one of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the jewish ending speech if only things could have ended in that way it's not even really the character talking anymore it's chaplin saying something he really wanted to say if you ignore the technical aspects the movie doesn't feel dated or old it actually moves at a pretty nice pace and the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die the only thing i don't care for is the slapstick but that just comes with the era i suppose this is an incredibly daring harsh take on <UNK> it's so hard hitting still after all these years
<START> the title comes from an <UNK> an adolescent <UNK> in a <UNK> facility makes on the front cover of his school book on government titled the united states he adds of his name br br many characterizations in this movie work well the scenes between <UNK> ryan <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> malone pearl don cheadle and father fitzgerald spacey as well as with <UNK> <UNK> and sister julie michelle williams among many others br br but the central thread of this movie the on which everything hangs is the character and motives of <UNK> he's a somewhat shy passive nice high school student who <UNK> introduces himself to <UNK> whom we find is going to an alternative school because of a past history of drug problems in <UNK> family she has a sister julie who's just <UNK> from high school and preparing to go on to college <UNK> boy friend <UNK> age and whose parents' had recently died is also living with them br br <UNK> lives with his mother his father kevin spacey and mother have long been divorced and his father is a famous novelist <UNK> is very <UNK> the young boy in the sixth sense saw dead people <UNK> sees teenage lovers and <UNK> that years later they will divorce that pain is going to follow many people's present experience of happiness but for reasons that are never made explicit his <UNK> gift seems to operate some times for some people some relationships and not for others br br parts of the movie feel a bit like a derivative <UNK> <UNK> from american beauty the sixth sense the graduate and possibly some others i didn't recognize that wouldn't be bad if only the character of <UNK> worked br br i think <UNK> did a great job of playing <UNK> but the script and the story <UNK> limitations would such an <UNK> <UNK> young man ever be homicidal even for <UNK> reasons nothing in the film gives a reason for this i'm a retired <UNK> with much experience working with families and teenagers while many of the reactions shown in the film work this part this most essential element certainly does not br br and there is at least one other element which in my experience would not fit with real life although it's not as critical the reason for the differences between the sisters <UNK> and julie are never hinted at but that's okay once two <UNK> begin <UNK> different roles one the all good girl the other the troubled one the roles themselves can begin driving each other to more extreme positions for the troubled one <UNK> it's kind of what do i have to do to be loved around here give up being me and become julie and the pressure to live up to being the all good parent pleasing child is no less intense on julie so why would she break up with her boy friend of long standing and of whom her parents so obviously <UNK> br br don cheadle was good as teacher all others were good in their parts 98 of the scenes were good what was missing was that crucial slip in understanding human nature br br good acting flawed story and psychology worth seeing not a total loss
<START> this film was different it took a sort of typical thriller story and reached for a more interesting in depth look at an individual character's struggle with faith of course it helped that the main performance by andrew mccarthy was quite excellent the other performances were also quite interesting although not as consistent the ending was a bit of a let down but there were lots of good moments the film makers tried something different here they didn't just go for the obvious chills and scares this is a dark film not for everyone but if you want to be entertained and not talked down to try this one
<START> i am probably a little too old for this movie 16 and being a guy the story is a little too <UNK> but i really thought it was a cool movie overall all the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses from <UNK> to <UNK> to to <UNK> all the way down to the cute girl that plays little sister rachel i am not a huge pop star fan with the <UNK> songs but i thought that aaron carter did a really great job in this and seems like he was really into this movie and made it seem real my mom liked all the older <UNK> that she grew up with so that's cool too i kept thinking that i liked a lot of the people and wonder if i will see them again a sequel would be cool i rented this but i might buy it too since i have a ton of dvd's and like to go back to see something that i missed i couldn't buy it at blockbuster though so i don't know where i could buy it right now but i'll look into that anyway i am a 16 year old guy i already said that i know but i would totally take a date to see this it's really good for all ages really i think even my little half sister who is 6 could see this that's what is so cool about it that it is something that all ages can see i'm sure that was done on purpose but it really works girls can dream about being with aaron carter and guys like me can dream about all the hot chicks in this movie there is something for everyone
<START> i'm not the biggest fan of westerns my two personal favorites though are <UNK> and <UNK> this movie though i loved it was great the plot was well done and it was a fun movie everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent i even think it beat out both movies in <UNK> well not really <UNK> because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run i do think it beat out <UNK> though both had its strong points for instance they both had excellent well known casts very good plots and very good filming but <UNK> beat out <UNK> in four ways in my opinion first the characters were more unique in <UNK> the music was better in <UNK> the idea was original in <UNK> unlike <UNK> <UNK> and the biggest difference the action sequences oh my gosh <UNK> was a western with really good action sequences i mean really good the action was fast paced like modern day based <UNK> up movies the action had big budget explosions too the <UNK> were pretty good also mario van <UNK> was great in this movie i suggest buying this excellent movie
<START> obviously the comments above that <UNK> over the movie were made by someone who's on the crew i don't recall ever seeing a movie that's more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching in my 30 years of watching movies this is the only one i have ever walked out of bad humor bad jokes bad gags bad editing bad plot etc br br note to producer it's never funny to hunt humans based on race great that you tried to be politically correct by <UNK> all races but you're still hunting humans based on race and that's sickening
<START> i get a kick out of the new who fans who call it excellent their entitled to that opinion but the new series isn't quite there yet it's getting there it's definitely good br br first the good things the special effects are obviously better nearly 20 <UNK> later since the last episode of doctor who battlefield was aired br br one thing the bbc has always liked is doctor who except when they tried to <UNK> in the 70's and 80's however the anticipation and the pressure was great but i think the new series has passed the test it's good it's still not excellent because it does have it's flaws some of the stories <UNK> were very poor i assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the <UNK> character or never bothered to watch the old series br br aliens in london was by far probably the best episode so far it started a new storyline about aliens which has lasted across several episodes including <UNK> br br now the other bad things the companion rose <UNK> <UNK> isn't great she's actually quite annoying but as is dr who a young <UNK> <UNK> had to be eventually chosen and she got the part br br christopher <UNK> is pretty respectable he's started to catch his <UNK> he tried to play the character straight then funny always missing the right punchline but he's taken it much more serious and it shows br br continuity wise there still some issues that didn't get resolved well paul <UNK> was still the doctor before this but he didn't get put back br br aside from that though the series overall is pretty good i haven't missed an episode and it never gets boring so i recommend any doctor who fan to check it out and see the new doctor who series
<START> if this is the best commander hamilton movie i have no curiosity about the others br br a movie actor's greatest tools are his eyes but when peter <UNK> wants to show great emotion he <UNK> his so for five or six seconds we get to admire his <UNK> while his feelings remain unknown behind them lousy acting technique br br <UNK> also <UNK> sometimes when he fires a gun turning his head away and his eyes shut watch carefully james bond can rest easy with competition like this br br there are some interesting supporting performances from other actors but not enough to hang a whole movie on the cinematography is good looking doing a fine job of capturing the <UNK> cold even the <UNK> winds up looking cold perhaps hamilton carries his own climate with him br br there are some individual good action sequences here unfortunately the only sense of humor on screen belongs to the villain which turns the hero into a big <UNK> james <UNK> jokes may not be particularly good but at least he doesn't look <UNK> all the time br br one positive point in the movie's favor is that the psychotic <UNK> vicious hatred of israel in books has been left out what has been kept in is worship of a noble heroic <UNK> that he shows us <UNK> in <UNK> without the dictator knowledge or <UNK> this fantasy is hard to believe since actually threw the <UNK> out of <UNK> for four years at a time and at the end of the film hamilton gives the <UNK> a very disturbing gift where will they use that gift hamilton doesn't care br br we're a long long way away from for whom the bell <UNK> here br br commander hamilton will remain a local phenomenon while books sell well around the world jan will never have the same success br br as for this film
<START> my taste in films continues to <UNK> me and probably <UNK> readers of my reviews but to each their own and i have a weak spot for crazy horror slasher flicks and see no evil happens to be exactly that and more i think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a wwe film and starring kane wwe might have a big following but it's a very very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and sorry folks kind of trailer park sport and those who don't love it it it would make them steer clear of an otherwise typical gory slasher flick that people would come out in <UNK> to see see no evil doesn't break any new horror ground it's exactly play by play typical horror with some over the top horrific bloody scenes that honestly make your screen crawl they really drive it home and go for gratuitous violence just cause there is no psychological aspect exactly although being chased by this monster has some fear elements to it br br kane the wrestler also known as <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> and physically tortured man <UNK> <UNK> he's the ultimate cross between <UNK> and jason <UNK> he's not an original killer and even his kills don't really go for the unique or original with the major exception of <UNK> a girl to death by forcing her to her cell phone he does a good job and the man is <UNK> enormous he stands at 7 feet tall and without any special effects is monstrous <UNK> <UNK> penny samantha noble michael j <UNK> luke christina <UNK> <UNK> taylor all play the typical group of think they are <UNK> <UNK> teens who will <UNK> become victim to the serial killer the story is that in exchange for a month off their <UNK> sentence for petty crimes ranging from <UNK> to drug possession they are sent to an old hotel to do community service by <UNK> it up turns out a serial killer lives upstairs and he's <UNK> his victims eyes to <UNK> them of their sins luke stands out as a <UNK> bag who in the end becomes a hero of sorts even saving his ex girlfriend who he used to beat up on the rest of them all play their perspective roles quite well but it isn't a great stretch of acting ability br br sadly porn director yes porn gregory dark does a good job putting together the modern day slasher flick he even goes into a bit of history with the killer and although his back story is not unique either in fact it's a little stale it's still interesting enough and in the few shots where the film goer is actually seeing through the killer's eyes it's interesting to hear the voices and see things distorted like he does he throws in the obligatory soft core nude shot and the grotesque blood <UNK> scenes and turns everything up a notch it fits nicely and for a horror fan like myself it's entertaining <UNK> serial killer is horrifying and he stalks them all down with brutal intelligence and a silent horror the film is being <UNK> and <UNK> on and i don't blame anyone because it's pretty crappy but isn't that the point it's a horror film and i thought it was exactly what it should be it made me jump it made me cringe it even made me turn away at several parts impressive by any standards it's entertaining with a decent story and plenty of set up to see no evil until the <UNK> installment if they wanted to and i say bring it on it's true the film is full of plot holes laughable details but the deadly gore and horror over rides it all it all comes down to do you love horror films really love them if yes then you'll think this is a terrific slasher if not you'll hate it plain and simple 8 5 10
<START> with nurse betty 2000 acclaimed indie film maker neil <UNK> in the company of men your friends neighbors makes his breakthrough into the big budgeted <UNK> 24 million as opposed to <UNK> <UNK> 25 000 mainstream realm and yet remains true to his roots while his cast is now composed of a list hollywood names <UNK> <UNK> morgan freeman and stand up comedian chris rock his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features proving that he just may be the next big thing nurse betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years and considering its <UNK> box office and critical success perhaps <UNK> weren't as dumb and <UNK> as we though they were the story follows both <UNK> and literally a naive waitress <UNK> who has fallen in love from <UNK> with a handsome soap star as good as it greg kinnear but is trapped in a <UNK> marriage to a slimy car dealer aaron who made his big screen debut in company when her husband is <UNK> murdered by two freeman and rock she's sent into shock and <UNK> sets out for hollywood to meet her object of affection unaware that he's only an actor when freeman and rock discover that the car she took contains 10 of cocaine they hit the road as well and <UNK> ensues fans of <UNK> previous work might have a hard time <UNK> out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed in the company of men a <UNK> about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf co worker but when you think about it the connection is rather clear in company a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being <UNK> taken advantage of in betty a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she's chasing thinks her genuine <UNK> is nothing more than a joke some might begin to wonder if <UNK> is really some sort of <UNK> himself considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women but personally i think he's coming to the defense of the fair sex and dealing far more <UNK> with the <UNK> in his pictures than the abused one of the many charms of this film is that it's absurdity is full <UNK> most directors when handling a script such as this one would leave the story at two chasing a woman chasing a dream but <UNK> knows better and has one of the freeman fall <UNK> for betty as well this was an interesting role for freeman to take because it allowed him to play off of his trademark this is the last <UNK> character see <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> stinker hard rain the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo <UNK> glover back to the future allison and mad about <UNK> kathleen the script written by first <UNK> john c richards and james is <UNK> over the top honestly have you ever seen a comedy or any movie for that matter in which a man is <UNK> in his own <UNK> room you could argue that the ending is a little too perfect but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint if nurse betty is any sign of what <UNK> has in store for us next you can bet that i'll be <UNK> up for whatever he decides to follow it up with br br grade a
<START> sleeper cell attempts to swim both sides of the pool terrorism patriotic muslim americans and it does neither very well br br i had put off watching this show for a very long time because i had a feeling it would be too predictable but after a year in my netflix <UNK> i finally moved it up to the front br br the show is about an undercover muslim man working for the fbi in an attempt to <UNK> a terrorist cell operating in the united states the undercover agent in the show actually is a muslim so we see his conflict resolution between his <UNK> and his religious beliefs personally i would have rather watched a drama about a <UNK> american family living in the united states but it is <UNK> that an america tv channel cable or network will ever produce anything that shows muslims in a <UNK> light br br i am not a muslim but i have a lot of muslim american friends and i can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love america br br sleeper cell comes close to <UNK> stereotypes of muslims but it also focuses on the worse muslim stereotypes in the first episode we see an honor killing which is a very poor portrayal of islam but in the 3rd episode we see a very respected <UNK> muslim <UNK> teaching the viewer that the real <UNK> is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to <UNK> violence towards others br br if only the <UNK> muslim <UNK> had been the main character of the show br br americans need to learn a lot more about islam sleeper cell helps a little bit but it comes up far short of giving the america audience what it really needs to knows br br that said the acting in this show is superb and the drama is extremely engrossing if only they had made this show about islam in america without the terrorism it would have been first rate
<START> i really loved seeing this movie i think it's a brilliant underrated alfred hitchcock movie everyone is familiar with the famous statue of liberty scene but there's a really great movie before that robert <UNK> is great in what i consider to be his greatest role and the beautiful <UNK> lane shows that she has a lot of talent too but i think norman lloyd gives the best performance his character <UNK> is so evil and <UNK> even though he's not in it for very long the movie wouldn't be the same without him br br <UNK> is a great movie that every hitchcock fan should see i give it a 10 out of 10
<START> my sisters and my cousin female forced me to see this chick movie its not the kind of movie i would prefer to see but it really wasn't that bad i wouldn't want to see this movie but after watching it i couldn't say it was bad just not my kind of film it was very accurate in acting out what woman really talk about and do in certain situations as a guy i wasn't too amused by the jokes but man the women sure were they related to the movie and yeah it was funny to see themselves on the big screen oh em gee i do that to haha i've never seen the original nor would i care to if you are a girl this is a must see but maybe girls would say this movie sucked probably i don't see a 13 year old going wow i remember going threw that when i was 30 br br no man would have this in there collection but i can't say it was horrible so <UNK>
<START> even as a big fan of the low to no budget horror genre i <UNK> find this disaster mildly amusing with horrible acting a painfully generic plot and no dimensional characters no matter how bored and drunk you are this one is not worth your <UNK> minutes don't make the same mistake i did rent something else anything else
<START> there is not much to add to what others have already commented the movie fails hard where it shouldn't it has no depth in the planning of the heist and the characters are so unbelievable br br one thing that got me thinking was that although the rest of the gang is trying hard to remove the <UNK> from the doors of an <UNK> truck because there is supposed to be no other way of opening it the guy inside the truck with great ease manages to remove the floor of the truck which happens to have a hole in it so he can get out and then get back in without being noticed by anyone because no one else could think that he could get out from there or even better that they could have gotten into from there br br promising but not quite there
<START> this movie had such a good premise to start with suspense slashers a secret society and you really couldn't figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie br br but it contained so many dumb clich√©s from the worst of the old american slasher horror movies now i love slasher horror movies but there are all the old clich√©s that have long disappeared from american cinema for example the old i hear noises in the basement and i'm home all alone and the basement light doesn't work so i'll go down to investigate clich√© br br three examples of these clich√©s just really <UNK> me to no end br br 1 when <UNK> finds out that there may be a secret society at work at the medical school <UNK> up live bodies she proceeds to ask questions and tell everyone very <UNK> in essence she is saying i found you out come kill me because i am telling everyone your secret and then she wonders why she finds blood <UNK> all over her bed and is brought her severed finger in a <UNK> br br 2 even after one guy she met two weeks ago ends up on the <UNK> table and she finds out about this secret society <UNK> live people she goes to the lab where all the dead bodies are <UNK> 2 3 more times by herself at night to investigate br br 3 her roommate gets killed she gets chased by the killer whom she knows doesn't report him to the university or the police then leaves the school to go home to visit her parents then she returns to school apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will let be and not try to kill her even though she knows his secret she was of course wrong br br for someone who was supposed to be so smart she was studying to be a doctor in the best school in germany she acted like the clich√© bimbo in a horror movie br br these things just made a potentially good movie very frustrating and made me wish the ending would come even sooner halfway through the movie i stopped <UNK> for her and wished that she would end up on the <UNK> table too
<START> okay first of all i missed like the first 15 minutes of the movie so i missed credits and stuff so when i finally got to it i was like who the hell is this dude i found out it was <UNK> like hours after watching the movie br br <UNK> didn't look like michael jackson not one bit he couldn't dance like him or move like him the only thing he almost had was the voice people commented on elizabeth taylor but i can't really comment on that because i don't know much about her br br the whole movie was like just plain <UNK> the dialogue sucked the cinematography if it can be called that sucked the soundtrack sucked the acting sucked yes even <UNK> i'm so upset about it though i didn't want it to suck i'm so sad that <UNK> got told he can get away with it but the whole thing looked like dress up you know it's like nobody looked like they were supposed to except for joseph jackson br br the concert sequences just sucked i'm sorry but <UNK> just can't dance like michael i mean like what the hell was <UNK> thinking the makeup didn't even match like the time of whatever michael was going through for example in the movie he was still dark when <UNK> got <UNK> the first time around in real life <UNK> was white as hell there was some sort of stupid <UNK> in his skin br br the movie wasn't boring well for me it wasn't it wasn't really anything i was just so upset about everything that was wrong with it i wanted to see how it turned out and if <UNK> could redeem himself he didn't really the only part i found like a bit interesting was the whole lisa marie thing when they fell in love that was nice but i had to turn my face away when they <UNK> <UNK> and only two parts made me collapse with laughter the first time was when they cut from michael with short hair you know the thriller era to michael with long flowing hair from the dangerous era and he was still black that was funny the second time i laughed was when they showed all of the posters and <UNK> of michael but they had face instead it was so funny br br overall this movie was cheap trash it was simply two hours of dress up and could have been so much better but no <UNK> is cheap watch if you want but this movie is not funny considering the <UNK> of it i came out of it feeling angry and when i found out it was <UNK> i just started to feel so bad so watch if you want
<START> boy oh boy does this movie stink this movie is one of the worst pieces of trash i have ever seen in my whole entire life please even if your life depends on it do not and i repeat do not under any circumstances view this horrid piece of garbage only watch this thing when it comes on as a <UNK> 3000 episode that was the only way i could sit through the whole thing if i had to watch it without that show i would've stopped watching it before it was over it does have one use a cure for <UNK>
<START> i think that the basic idea of any movie is to entertain or to inform if you want information you are looking at true life movies and historical movies sometimes these are one of the same the other side of the <UNK> is to entertain did <UNK> entertain me yes it did okay the formula is standard boy meets girl or in this case boys met girls they get together have a falling out then get back together however the way it happened in this movie was refreshing i particularly liked the bar scene with <UNK> and sara the albert romance was a delight to watch unfold most real men are shy when it comes to <UNK> the woman of their dreams and had i had <UNK> advice i would probably have got my wife up the <UNK> in half the time i read the first comment on this film that appeared to suggest that this movie was played safely and good have had a few more laughs i tend to disagree there are so many laughs you can pack into a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce besides relationships have there serious moments all in all i found <UNK> quite entertaining the actors did a good job i will be looking out for them in other movies and <UNK> is a film that i am very happy to have in my dvd collection
<START> i like ali <UNK> show i believe the guy has comedic instinct but hasn't yet developed it to a talent br br the movie is a little worse than i was expecting i don't find ali g offensive just stupid jokes for 5 year olds some good some terrible br br if you want to watch a movie that seems offensive but is actually funny see tom <UNK> <UNK> got br br 2 10
<START> was my favorite movie in the later part of the 80's when it came out my dad taped it for me i watched it all the time until my step mom taped oprah over it my heart was torn i would love to know if or where i can get it from i have been looking for it i believe they even came out w a 2 it wasn't as great as the 1st but i would like to have all of them if i could find them i do not think all that it was a bad movie it was a very interesting movie with a lot of action yet it had somewhat of a love story plot to it the actors actresses in the movie were great it also helped me to understand that this is not just a man's world but it is also a woman's world many women can do the same things if not more than what a man can do women deserve much respect for their duties as well
<START> i first saw this on demand or on tv i'm not really sure but this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever i mean this movie has blood gore laughs and chills through out the movie i recently ordered monster man from amazon and i've been watching monster man ever since i got it trust me you will love this movie br br p s the commentary on the dvd is way funny they also said something about monster man 2 during the commentary let's hope they make monster man 2 if you have the chance rent the movie or buy it you will absolutely love it this is the best movie that has come out in 2003 br br 10 10
<START> this movie is extremely funny the character of <UNK> keeps me returning to the movie time and time again i can't get enough of her dry lines like when she tells her son owen to bury his friend in the back yard before he <UNK> up the place and her suspicion that owen is trying to kill her by giving her <UNK> nuts it's hilarious br br if you like movies such as national <UNK> vacation uncle buck or planes trains <UNK> this has similar humor it's a great wholesome laugh a must see
<START> i've been watching a lot of asian horror movies lately but this one has to be the worst so far it started out interestingly enough but lost momentum after the first 15 minutes of the movie the added drama scenes flashback sequences and serious plot holes left me hanging what really happened in the tunnel just something terrible who started all the killing if it wasn't the ghost what did she want returned to her no answers whatsoever overall not very scary at all and the movie makers need to come up with a lot better ideas than this br br one positive was the cute actress but that's about it br br not recommended
<START> by <UNK> hollywood decided to remake the al <UNK> first talking classic br br this time the son was played by danny thomas coming home from the army it is expected that he follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a <UNK> however young mr has quite a <UNK> for show business br br at this time he meets peggy lee an aspiring singer she acts very well and her rendition of her favorite song lover is remarkable the film writers were smart not to plug the obvious jewish guy and non jewish girlfriend relationship if anything this is <UNK> over in his anger for <UNK> his <UNK> to become a <UNK> his father makes the traditional jewish sign <UNK> of a loss in the family this would not be done under circumstances of breaking a <UNK> it would be done if among the <UNK> an inter faith marriage would take place br br thomas does a really good job of playing the son his singing is up to par as the film ends on a positive note br br am surprised that technical <UNK> did not realize that women do not carry <UNK> into <UNK> on the <UNK> or at all during that period
<START> this movie is not for those expecting a martial arts <UNK> as for historical accuracy i will leave that issue to those better informed on that subject i thought the performances were wonderful <UNK> li never disappoints as the <UNK> and initially loyal <UNK> of the king of zhang showed a lot of <UNK> portraying a <UNK> <UNK> into madness he chose the <UNK> <UNK> route rather than <UNK> to <UNK> for me the best performance was from wang as the marquis the character came across as very <UNK> but in a subtle sir <UNK> <UNK> yes minister kind of way br br the cinematography is the standout feature of this film the scene when the marquis and his men <UNK> the palace was breathtaking there are also a number of wonderful battle scenes therefore this film is highly recommended on the big screen
<START> the problem with this movie is that it is trying to <UNK> a 6 hours movie into 2 hours the result is clear it seems too forced unclear and too simple minded br br the only plus side is the beginning it explains well why and how <UNK> was born the rest of the movie was just <UNK> <UNK> that is put together it has a potential to be a great movie like lotr if only it is not forced into 2 hours br br the acting is not very convincing either ok not all is bad but most of them are special effects are stupid and look like it is made ten years earlier although the 1st monster is pretty good overall i give it 4 out of ten for the reasons i described above
<START> this is without a doubt the worst sequel i have ever seen i've seen plenty of them to make that conclusion the plot is simply ridiculous i can catch a ball run around a field too why can't i play in the <UNK> yes i know this movie was intended for children but there are just some plots that even children can realize are totally dumb unrealistic the first air bud movie was pretty good but this one was a total crash disney is <UNK> it if i controlled who won the <UNK> awards i would give this one a couple have a nice day
<START> people must learn to watch what is up there on the screen this is a great film that is based on a slow careful gathering of details which serve to establish the personalities of these two men the <UNK> of the country cousin is well described by his fear of talking to women he has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and loses all of them he has many decades of ahead of him and maybe <UNK> as well br br is a different case he got out of the small town by working very hard we imagine and his <UNK> of <UNK> like is <UNK> he leaves <UNK> on the expensive carpet the <UNK> we are shown a group of friends talking about <UNK> among other things and we note that feels regret but only slight regret that his work has become commercial over the years the <UNK> between the cousins just gets wider and wider the mouse trap theme is wonderfully vivid it brings out the compassion and confusion of and the cold blooded problem solving of br br i was reminded of two classic films of men driving each other nuts les cousins by <UNK> the rich boy with <UNK> <UNK> played by is always in my mind and kiss of the spider woman william hurt can't figure out why everybody's so mean <UNK> takes his place among the dozen important directors now active i just hope that in future he will come to rely on <UNK> instead of directing writing and shooting his films himself
<START> anyone who thinks <UNK> moe dee carol <UNK> and corey <UNK> <UNK> a list of good actors must be smoking something i'd love to try sometime where to begin lousy soundtrack hammy acting action in places this is the typical <UNK> written hack fodder that washed up has been and never <UNK> love to star in i actually felt embarrassed for the stars in this film the only <UNK> missing to top this turd was gary coleman who if he would have been in the movie would have made it at least somewhat <UNK> bad rather than just plain bad br br there was one part in the film where carol <UNK> screamed do you think i'm an idiot yes carol i do your agent does and please for the love of all that is decent and holy go away and stop <UNK> yourself like this this film is something anna nicole smith would take part in br br i would tell you what the plot was but that would be one more sentence <UNK> to this article plus my mind <UNK> many times during the movie anyway so i barely paid attention
<START> i only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish my aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time and money wisely br br i also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage and want to <UNK> the fact that the director producer of these garbage films can't get away with it for very long we will find out who you are and will vote with out feet and <UNK> br br this film clearly falls into the garbage category br br the director and writer is john it's always a bad sign when the writer is also the director maybe he wants two pay <UNK> he shouldn't get any so remember the name john and if you see anything else by him forget it br br i won't say anything about the plot others have already i am a little worried by how much the director likes to zoom in to the poor girl's face when she is crying and screaming these long duration shots are a little worrying and may say something about the state of mind of mr maybe he should get psychiatric help br br enough already it's crap don't waste your time on it
<START> this movie was released in all major cinemas in australia i watched the movie on the weekend of <UNK> <UNK> and i thought is was absolute nonsense and i am using that word extremely how it got released to every major cinema no idea the plot seemed simple enough about the world being divided into and people needed identity cards and the actor tim robbins playing an investigator who goes to shanghai to investigate a employee stealing id cards which turns out to be the actress samantha <UNK> br br you think from that summary the rest of the story should but it doesn't it just <UNK> the audience even more with different storyline that don't relate br br if you thinking of seeing this movie let me save u the trouble do not get this movie
<START> it is hard to put the devastating beauty of to words partly because i am still <UNK> to comprehend it myself several hours after my second viewing first it must be said that contains some of the most <UNK> and <UNK> haunting scenes i have seen in a film or television production the acting is excellent particularly that of bill <UNK> as a british minister <UNK> with his heroin addicted daughter and an aid deal to <UNK> that <UNK> on drug issues another plot line describes these drug issues at a ground level in <UNK> and revolves around a struggling <UNK> <UNK> farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin <UNK> the third main storyline involves the <UNK> of a <UNK> drug and the <UNK> efforts of his wife and two german detectives while he is under trial it is a profound accomplishment that the interaction between these stories feels natural <UNK> the forced plot <UNK> often found in hollywood movies it is an even greater accomplishment that a work spread over three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and enthralling without having to <UNK> it is devastating bleak and brutal but never <UNK> in short is a rare work of film that handles challenging subjects with <UNK> compassion and clarity
<START> this is a case where the script plays with the audience in a manner that serves only in <UNK> this story to 90 minutes story starts out in 1969 where a young girl named faith cameron diaz travels to europe with her boyfriend wolf christopher <UNK> but she dies under mysterious circumstances then in 1976 <UNK> sister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> decides to travel to europe as well and try and find out what happened to her sister in france she looks up wolf who has stayed there and she wants him to help her <UNK> the steps her sister took and answer some questions he is reluctant but decides to travel with her along the way he fills in the gaps of the <UNK> and tells <UNK> that faith had joined up with the red army who are an <UNK> group that is involved in terrorism <UNK> and wolf engage in a romance and this <UNK> the trip to <UNK> where faith died their is several things wrong with this film and it all has to do with the script first the romance between wolf and <UNK> is all wrong and does nothing for the story it rings completely false and comes across as forced it seems weird that wolf would engage in a romance with his dead girlfriends sister secondly wolf knows completely what happened to faith but only lets out little <UNK> of information every 15 minutes or so wolf will look at <UNK> every 15 minutes and say there is something i didn't tell you gee thanks a lot wolf if wolf had come clean the first time he talked to <UNK> then the film would have been over in about 30 minutes another thing that bothered me was that i don't think this film <UNK> the 1960's at all diaz wears hippie clothes but the time period just didn't ring true i did enjoy a few things like the authentic locations where the film was shot it is a very good looking film and the scenery is beautiful the performances are all good especially by <UNK> and diaz besides the fast and the furious i had never really seen <UNK> in anything but after watching her performance in this film i came away very impressed she's very good here and i hope better roles come her way the script is told in a very contrived way and the film never comes across as believable
<START> this film was terrible i thought it would be ok but it just got worse and worse from the starting scenes it seems to be heading in the direction of another safe predictable <UNK> com but the moment he arrives at the house it just <UNK> none of the characters have any depth and the only person who was anywhere near believable was tom although the way he became so easily distracted just annoyed me after a while the dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost completely non existent in an insulting attempt at comedy the writer director introduces a new character or event in practically every scene none of which are realistic making it very confusing to keep track of what is going on the plot is barely an excuse for a movie guy likes girl house sits fathers home to get to know girl destroys house gets girl a complete waste of time
<START> hello there i would just like to say how much i enjoyed your review and comments about that excellent film in the <UNK> i believe that the points you made were insightful intelligent and totally valid it's also a shame that this film is hardly ever shown on tv these days and that it isn't available on dvd region 2 i live in england once again many thanks for your review the actor <UNK> was in another brilliant film <UNK> man with a which also starred kirk douglas and lauren bacall that was a very <UNK> and stylish film with some superb music i wish that someone with influence could release the entire back <UNK> of films like <UNK> 'i remember and 'the on dvd region 2 we love these movies in great britain i'm not of age i'm still reasonably young and my family and i love classic films films like these were so beautifully made and they bring back wonderful memories anyway many thanks for your comments
<START> at school i was taught how some shots were called and there were two directors constantly mentioned orson welles and <UNK> m <UNK> i didn't care that much then i was a kid but now i know why <UNK> is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938 where as almost more than a half century we're stuck with countless blank movies some say this movie isn't worth the genius of <UNK> then they have to watch it over and over till they can say anything bad or even worse that it is just some for the russians let's say it as it is it is indeed pure propaganda for <UNK> but isn't saving private ryan or the longest day so i could sum up so many movies in where america is being raised to the top so why not russia and besides every war is fought for <UNK> why else would they raise <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture perhaps it's all <UNK> but i am in wonder why this isn't included in <UNK> top 250 where as there is so many overrated in it as well
<START> angel a is a change of pace for <UNK> <UNK> and rather mediocre it is well photographed on location in paris although <UNK> readers should note quick fire dialogue and good cinematography may make for frustrating viewing br br this film is no wings of desire or wonderful life despite its shared themes heavenly <UNK> suicide angel mortal relationships ensue does nothing to <UNK> or inspire us even the well acted <UNK> moments rapidly <UNK> into toe <UNK> sentimentality br br the film's flawed ideology <UNK> an angel whose message of love and respect for self is constantly <UNK> by her own violent and <UNK> behaviour a happy ending which <UNK> the hero's supposed journey from <UNK> to self <UNK> and independence br br verdict quite nice to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages <UNK> the film precisely where it should shine 4 10
<START> fantastic movie one of the best film noir movies ever made bad guys bad girls a jewel heist a twisted morality a kidnapping everything is here jean has a face that would make bogart proud and the rest of the cast is is full of character actors who seem to to know they're onto something good get some popcorn and have a great time
<START> attending this film was an excuse to escape the work i had to do for my classes but it turned out to be one of my best experiences here in france the film makes quick work of building <UNK> characters and has an excellently smooth storyline the characters really did have the voices you would expect reading the graphic novels and the artistic talent <UNK> my expectations the music was catchy and the comedy <UNK> and lighthearted almost a inclusion of modern items in playful manners the film was attention grabbing cute and action packed at the same time a wonderful tale <UNK> expertly i'll be showing it to my french students
<START> i saw this movie on the shelf at blockbuster and thought it looked cool the dvd case <UNK> so many great actors and i wondered to myself why have i never heard of this movie then i turned over the case and saw the director lee and thus the answer began to explain itself br br first of all i want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie but more importantly i think i should explain why this movie is so terrible okay the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters this is the worst role i've ever seen <UNK> <UNK> play and i'm surprised he would do something this ridiculous however under appreciated yet talented actors must earn their money <UNK> plays a one dimensional police detective who comes off about as dumb as a c movie mob henchman him along with the lead detective the poorly directed nolte the great but simple michael madsen and the late chris penn whose role along with <UNK> was completely thrown away make up an elite squad of la detectives <UNK> to rid the city of <UNK> sometime in the late 30s or 40s the movie introduces this squad as cops who will break every law to make sure those who think they're above the law don't operate in their city at the beginning of the film the cops rough up a local restaurant grab an alleged mobster william peterson and take him to a place they call the <UNK> falls they toss him off one of the <UNK> on <UNK> drive and this is supposed to demonstrate how serious these guys are about <UNK> the city of crime whatever this was nothing more than a cheap excuse to use a crappy title that's designed to make you think of la and its famous sites somewhere later on they find the dead body of jennifer <UNK> and the plot begins br br on to the direction which was nothing short of amateur and weak aside from the fact that the characters were b movie quality the overacting by those such as treat williams the guy who plays the chief of police and the awful daniel baldwin are just a few highlights that made this movie seem like it was lee first film there's not one good performance in the movie aside from maybe <UNK> griffith who some might argue was the worst in the movie she won a <UNK> for this film in the end it was her character that was not that great and she really didn't have much to work with br br as with any bad movie it all begins with the writing and this script was no gem plot is <UNK> simply on the basis of setting up the next scene and never takes into consideration characters' motivations the way the characters <UNK> was unbelievable cops taking the law into their own hands is believable within the right circumstances see la <UNK> but in this case it looked like these guys could get away with anything including murder and never bat an eye about cleaning anything up i guess we as an audience are just supposed to assume that no one saw anything and that people won't ask questions everything about the story is predictable and is <UNK> fed so well that we understand everything that's going to happen a good while before the characters do however it doesn't make us feel smart but rather makes us angry at how stupid the hero is despite the fact that there aren't any heroes in this movie br br in the end the best <UNK> of the movie was the great score by david from the beginning it <UNK> a since of <UNK> which quickly faded when i realized how unbelievable just about everything in the film was it didn't surprise me to learn that it made a <UNK> eleven million in the box office what i will say is that this film is worth watching for a few laughs nick <UNK> acting is like an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dog and i laughed every time he tried to be serious i also nearly fell on the floor at each of the slow motion shots used in the film i think there are three with one during a key fight scene when you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment you clearly have some problems so even with my negative criticism i will recommend this movie solely for the purpose of <UNK> laughter that is if you appreciate the good movies like la <UNK>
<START> wow i think they made this movie to torture people there are no words for how much i hated this film i could have been cleaning my room instead i love bad melodrama as much as the next person but come on
<START> i have a old daughter and before this movie she was all about the disney <UNK> now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is princess <UNK> and all her sisters i definitely recommend this movie for all young girls this movie is one of the best from the <UNK> collection it shows all the good values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls with the great songs and dance moves it gets my daughter up and trying to <UNK> the moves the extras are also good one even works on how good your memory is i would definitely have say it is a must see for kids and grown ups alike
<START> the film <UNK> directed by claude <UNK> was not a film to be honest i had ever really heard of until the film forum in nyc said that they would have a 2 week screening of the film with new english subtitles when i also read that it was in the vein of the classic french crime films ala jean pierre <UNK> i jumped at the chance to check it out at best it would rank up with his great works and at worst i would get some good popcorn in a great theater it was well worth the admission as <UNK> is one of those kinds of french films that is just waiting to be re discovered or discovered for the first time with terrific tense <UNK> <UNK> keeps the suspense at a tight pitch for the first forty minutes of the film keeping a good if not great middle section and then ending it up with what is always expected with these films but with fascinating motivations by way of the characters with a film in the vein of this sort you know how it will end but it's the cool <UNK> journey that counts br br the film features a performance with some real truth and honesty amid the old school <UNK> code by <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> who at the start of the film one of the best <UNK> to a film in this genre and country steals a <UNK> amount of money with his partner in crime when there is a sudden ugly twist of fate on a beach late one night <UNK> is again on the run with two little kids he gets the aid of eric stark jean paul <UNK> a role in tune with le only with a <UNK> more humanity and charisma who is also a thief and drives him into paris but there are some problems with some of old business <UNK> and one old score may be just the right ticket a couple of times the plot may seem to be <UNK> but it isn't like <UNK> <UNK> doesn't allow any fat to his story and it's a very tightly structured film with some good doses of humor here and there i was sometimes <UNK> at the <UNK> of the criminals in the beginning chase sequence and also with a particular woman who had a <UNK> thing with her cat and a fish br br along with a fine score by the great george <UNK> exceptional cinematography and a mood that is seldom met let alone matched now <UNK> is a reminder of that bridge between the real old school film noir and the latter day crime films gangsters in these new sort of thug life movies have a of the class and honor of the thieves in this film and is a second banana to the works of <UNK> and jules <UNK> a compliment i assure you that it has a good realistic moral edge helps as well
<START> well for this abomination of a film i wasn't expecting anything good i find steve carell annoying and bruce almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel somehow this film was even lower than my expectations even when i didn't have any br br does anyone remember the disney movie <UNK> with tony <UNK> well let's just say that <UNK> almighty completely ripped it off in way too many ways for the movie to remain <UNK> actually <UNK> almighty was had the exact same plot outline as <UNK> with the exception of a few <UNK> it was nothing but a <UNK> copy of a far superior movie that was actually funny br br another thing did anyone get sick of <UNK> <UNK> stupid unfunny redundant one liners that were literally in every single scene it was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie down more and more br br despite the fact that i basically had already seen the film ten years earlier <UNK> <UNK> almighty has to be the most predictable movie i've ever seen i figured out the entire movie from beginning to end within the first five minutes and eventually realized that it was ripping off <UNK> left and right br br in conclusion if you're a little bit unsure of whether or not you want to see <UNK> almighty and are already sick of <UNK> hill playing the same role in every single movie he's in liked bruce almighty and don't want to see a predictable dry unfunny movie with steve carell trying to act like jim carrey then please don't see this piece of garbage

<START> i remember watching this movie when it came out as a t v movie of the week in the early 1970's br br although i haven't seen this movie in over 30 years i remember how creepy it was the sister's dead body in the basement the storm raging outside the creepy house with no electricity and a killer still on the premises br br they just don't make t v movies like this one anymore elizabeth <UNK> was a very underrated actress and i liked her in not only but several of her post <UNK> roles such as this one and <UNK> the legend of <UNK> <UNK> br br i really wish that someone would come out with a dvd that has several of the 1970's t v movie of the week on one dvd wouldn't it be awesome to watch when michael calls bad ronald don't be afraid of the dark <UNK> farm etc all on one dvd i know there is a market for a dvd like this for all of us baby <UNK> who grew up in the 1960's and 1970's maybe if we are lucky someday someone will offer us a dvd with a great selection of t v movies like this

<START> <UNK> bad movie <UNK> about a who wants to be a writer and the incidents that make up casino life moves at a <UNK> pace dull dull dull virtually everything about this movie is amateurish and unconvincing with one very notable exception the performance of clive owen who is like a rolls <UNK> <UNK> through a <UNK> advice for the casino sequences were allegedly provided by a professional but judging by the way in which they are handled they were completely ignored by the director while casino staff may very well be a different breed to the rest of the world they are nowhere near as witless and <UNK> as the characters presented in this script odds and ends are thrown into the script in an attempt to provide it with convincing background but would appear to have been <UNK> down in a list on a cocktail <UNK> for anyone who makes a living in the casino business as this writer has for the last forty years this is a poverty stricken depiction of their world which even in the <UNK> and most obscure reaches of england has never been this wanting an appalling insulting mess of a movie that <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> along to an idiotic and unconvincing ending american critics loved it
<START> watch this movie it's truly a good ride through the difficulties of making a indie movie and what happens when it blows up in the film <UNK> face there's a lot of stuff about punk rock and the philosophy behind that movement and it's relationship to this project so if you're into old punk american punk you'll dig it but beware there's a ton of bad acting bits from the failed project that are <UNK> yet they do come off funny at times and actually some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in movie making <UNK> and what they went through in the three year period that it took to put this together so anyone out there that's about to make a film especially if you haven't been to film school or worked in the field you should watch this and learn from the film <UNK> mistakes
<START> how awful is it let me count the ways 1 it is a bait and switch movie that starts out being about a <UNK> investigation then turns into a high pressure sales job for christianity c'mon if the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message why disguise it it <UNK> non <UNK> and pushes fence in the opposite direction 2 it's not even a good sales pitch if the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them i'd run like hell in the opposite direction they're scary 3 the acting is terrible they all behave as if they were in an educational film about <UNK> in the <UNK> 4 the cinematography is home movie bad wait actually its not even that good 5 script bad bad bad all dialogue no action like a <UNK> match they <UNK> back and forth between the talking head close ups 6 direction what direction oh there must have been a director there somewhere i challenge you to figure out where br br believe it or not i have some positive comments about this movie the editing seemed professional but couldn't make a difference a good edit of bad material is still a bad movie the opening theme music was actually very good very scary and <UNK> ish too bad the movie wasn't about <UNK> br br if you can't tell already here's the bottom line i wasted my money seeing this movie and it made me angry if they had not disguised what this movie was really about i could say it was my fault
<START> and in this series i've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay <UNK> remember my friend <UNK> who got all the good lines in the books well in this series his one liners put mr freeze to shame remember our uber evil nemesis <UNK> three he's a bald guy with inane <UNK> remember rachel <UNK> the warrior princess and cassie my sensitive and caring love interest they've been turned into mindless <UNK> by the 10 writers who decided the original characters weren't cool enough for tv remember the awesome extra <UNK> <UNK> who was cool intelligent and really really liked <UNK> <UNK> in this series he's the token alien with an extremely annoying voice remember the witty banter our team had in the books in this series our dialogue is so dreary and stupid it's obvious the writers were <UNK> to the lowest common <UNK> br br so forget everything you thought you knew about the it was cassie who became <UNK> to <UNK> not rachel thought speak is supposed to echo and <UNK> three and <UNK> rarely if ever appeared as no it has nothing to do with the budget br br i'm not crazy and i'm not lying the <UNK> are all around us and if you're unlucky one of them might adapt one of your favourite books or series or graphic novels into a really awful tv show you've been warned br br finally television worth watching the very bald <UNK> three br br r <UNK>
<START> every american who thinks he or she understands world war two should see this movie few hollywood films about the war have <UNK> the stereotype of japanese soldiers as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> orders without thinking we like to think that every japanese man was ready and able to fight to the death right up to the day we bombed <UNK> fires on the plain shows a different reality troops <UNK> and <UNK> to the point of <UNK> they refer to human flesh as monkey meat the movie and novel on which it was based also put to death the myth that japanese soldiers all preferred death to surrender they had good reason to believe that their enemies were in no mood to take prisoners to me it raises a question most americans would rather avoid if the japanese military was so beaten down at this point in the war why was it necessary to <UNK> <UNK>
<START> not much to it but a <UNK> of small town values and the <UNK> of a mentally challenged young man into its heart br br i read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the <UNK> it <UNK> i felt cuba gooding handled the part with dignity and respect unlike sean <UNK> <UNK> fool portrayal in i am sam br br the fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming sports are taken seriously in small town high school america and elsewhere i suspect and i felt the portrayal of these <UNK> students opening their hearts to one less fortunate <UNK> true at least for me br br the coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and radio but rather came gently to the decision himself under <UNK> loving and open ways very well done to all 7 out of 10 br br debra <UNK> we need more of you in pictures
<START> by mistake i ordered a series from the bbc their new version of robin hood very disappointing in comparison with <UNK> terrible <UNK> and backgrounds while i enjoyed the sheriff who took <UNK> from the nick grace character the rest of the cast left much to be desired as a for instance <UNK> <UNK> looked <UNK> like it came from <UNK> and sir guy well he looked a bit like a character from an outer space movie <UNK> has stolen the spotlight probably forever in the telling of this tale cast <UNK> story lines scenery filming and soundtrack by are all superb as is <UNK> by all the <UNK> <UNK> some 26 years on <UNK> is a timeless classic my thanks to all who made the series
<START> the <UNK> were the best of times and worst of times for james <UNK> he starred in one of the best cult horror comedies with return of the living dead and a year later he acts in this piece of this bad movie a sequel to but not really has a group of fairly unlikeable characters attempting to make a movie in <UNK> through design or sheer <UNK> the line between the film and the <UNK> within a <UNK> is not only <UNK> but <UNK> non existent from scene to scene which would be confusing if i were just interested in anything happening in the movie in the first place unfunny would be too generous a term br br eye candy <UNK> and many numerous extras get topless brenda <UNK> shows some t a br br my grade f br br dvd extras just trailers for american high school strike virgin territory comes in a double feature dvd with the first film for the <UNK>
<START> this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the only advantage seeing this movie is that the next movie can't possibly be worse it's childish as hell but children aren't allowed
<START> this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen it's a thriller with a rather ridiculous ending i watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something truly bad the movie starred two actors that i like very much rebecca and antonio <UNK> sure they had decent chemistry together but for what the movie's premise was bad to begin with and the execution just made it even worst br br miss plays sarah taylor a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense <UNK> on multiple personality disorder that pretty much will give you a hint to where the movie is going and the identity of the killer early in the movie she gets an unexpected visit from her father this being made in the 1990's when the bad daddy was the in thing in hollywood is another clue to the ultimate conclusion br br mr <UNK> plays a mystery man named tony <UNK> who comes into <UNK> life the whole first meeting and first encounter between tony and sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing it makes you wonder how it even got shot and there's a sequence where the two of them are supposed to be knowing each other that is so sappy it doesn't seem to belong here one thing that i would admit was that there was a sex scene that's very hot anyway creepy things start to happen after he arrives weird <UNK> arriving things falling off the wall that could kill sarah incident that say things aren't normal anymore br br overall the movie was badly conceived the editing at times seem <UNK> and the conclusion was laughable another thing that <UNK> me about this movie was the whole <UNK> music playing in the background a more subtle musical score would have been better i have to say this no matter how bad the ending was miss was very good in that sequence it's sad that she never got first rate <UNK> in her career she's that rare combination of talent and beauty
<START> let's get the flaw out of the way right off the top the movie should have been much longer ray charles was a brilliant fascinating man who lead a complex challenging life there was simply no way to fit it all or even touch on it all in a standard length movie given that the makers of this film did an admirable and i'm sure quite <UNK> job of putting together a film that could not tell the whole story yet managed to set forth a representative <UNK> of the man and his music ray <UNK> strengths were evident throughout the film and his weaknesses were neither <UNK> nor sugar <UNK> we could have wished for another hour <UNK> his life after 1980 but i suppose that would have tended to turn the film into an homage and while it would have also allowed for the resolution of several things that were left hanging at the end on balance i guess it was better as presented br br now for the big question what are the <UNK> for an oscar the wife and i have seen <UNK> numbers of films in our years but we immediately agreed that we have never seen a performance the equal of jamie <UNK> the line between actor and character was not <UNK> but rather it disappeared completely we had heard much of the hype before seeing the movie but this was uncanny foxx was ray charles you didn't watch the movie with the feeling that you were watching foxx do an outstanding job of portraying ray charles you watched it somehow believing or understanding that you were watching ray charles himself i don't know how else to put it we were completely blown away i'll admit that we haven't seen all of the other performances up for an oscar this year but that really doesn't matter foxx took this to a whole level one which we've never witnessed before and doubt that we may ever see again i can think of no other movie i've ever seen in which a person playing a part so completely and convincingly became the person portrayed we <UNK> you mr foxx we understand that the <UNK> of an oscar has to do with much more than the performance but whether or not you win we want you to know that you have done something that is in a class absolutely by itself and you should take enormous pride in your <UNK> achievement br br p s the music was naturally great i <UNK> to the wife that if there is one moment in the history of music to which i wish i could have been witness it would have been the <UNK> in kansas city wasn't it of i say the film did a wonderful job with it just wish i could've been there
<START> most of wayne's b westerns are kind of fun in a naive way but this one really stinks the editing is terrible and the direction and pacing is completely <UNK> most of the cast stands around waiting for the mute guy to write down his thoughts on a pad of paper and i was bored sorry duke but this gets a 1
<START> i saw this movie last night at the <UNK> as part of the competition it was billed as the world premiere of the movie by the host though it seems that people here have seen it previously i have to say i still don't really know what to make of the movie i am unfamiliar with the book purchased the ticket only two hours beforehand and had only limited knowledge of the plot not enough as it seems as i had problems getting into the movie the movie is sometimes being narrated by jones' character but somehow that perspective did not fit for me and i really cannot say if some of the laughs the movie got were <UNK> or not the cuts were abrupt and <UNK> the scenes seemed somehow slapped together and the storytelling did not always make sense right away even leaving out the supernatural parts the actors were really good but could not really save the movie somehow it was entertaining but sometimes only in the sense that i sat there thinking about technical details of movie making and what went wrong with this one i still do not know what kind of mood the director intended the movie to have it was a strange mix of light dark supernatural it sadly did not draw me in at all and i rather watched it with a technical eye but thinking about what is wrong with a movie while watching it is the best sign that a movie somehow has failed i would have definitely expected something else with these actors involved too bad
<START> some martial arts <UNK> think that comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the old school kung fu flick and it is true that the introduction of comedy into the genre <UNK> the end of the chop <UNK> period in hong kong film but the fact is one can only carry on a primarily physical <UNK> of <UNK> for just so long then everyone gets bored with it and that's really why the chop <UNK> died and how the hong kong new wave action film was born the producers the actors the directors all just got bored with hitting people for ninety minutes straight br br given that and given the fact that liu <UNK> <UNK> is a professional director with a considerable list of films in his resume this film has to be seen as something other than just another kung fu comedy rather it is a comic film within the martial arts genre and in fact one of the best ever made br br what liu has done with this film is really a pleasant surprise he has taken a martial arts plot and re constructed it along the lines of a hollywood style musical complete with episodes of singing and dancing it was around the time of the making of this film that some film makers and film fans began to recognize that the cinematic performance of martial arts really derived from the <UNK> of the chinese opera has more in common with dance than with fighting i will continue to point out this connection until most americans realize what they are actually supposed to look for when watching a martial arts film well choreographed body movements using the plot of an action film as an excuse for their performance at any rate quite clearly liu <UNK> <UNK> made this connection and decided he would explore it close to its limits br br the result is an incredibly charming entertainment filled with <UNK> human characters attempting <UNK> kung fu and <UNK> over their own as often as not when they do so and the film being set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries allows liu the opportunity to explore the nature of the and <UNK> of china that contributed so greatly to the making of the china we know today so the film has considerable historical <UNK> as well br br also fans of stephen <UNK> recent kung fu <UNK> should really watch this movie carefully as <UNK> clearly learned from it before the making of his own film br br a very amusing well made film oh yes and the kung fu in it is really really good br br <UNK> won't admit it but this is probably director <UNK> best film
<START> this movie is not very bad but one cannot find anything new about the personality of marquis de <UNK> from this movie the movie tries to stay on the borderline between erotic and insightful and it cannot succeed at either the cinematography is really bad to video quality br br
<START> this movie even calling it a movie is an <UNK> is ridiculously horrible normally a huge fan of eric roberts in b list movies this tragedy of a flick makes me question his real b list <UNK> and charlie please go back to hoping for a <UNK> murder revival rather than this you can't blame the <UNK> eye candy beauty <UNK> members for <UNK> in this weak movie but you are a former tv star man pull yourself together don't even get me started on stuart <UNK> for the sake of all that is good stuart you should have seen this was not necessarily a real movie bryan michael <UNK> absolute genius only in the fact that he was able to <UNK> anyone into <UNK> in this picture money or time br br really this was no parody or spoof movie although it tries on a 2nd grade level mostly it is poor writing and acting and camera work and editing and well poor everything i watched it because i read an article in some <UNK> about agent <UNK> involvement and my interest was <UNK> due to the <UNK> in which he was involved i now wonder if the only reason they show him from the shoulders up in the movie is because he like at the trial showed up wearing <UNK> and barely <UNK> wait a second is he ever really considered <UNK> i <UNK> and agent <UNK> is that the best they could come up with for a name for his character <UNK> what a startling piece of originality or maybe that was supposed to be funny putting <UNK> into the movie was a nice touch at first but overdone and annoying after all is said and done br br spare yourself the grief of watching don't say i didn't warn you
<START> hey all i just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie i was actually one of the make up fx artists that help create the beast for this movie and i have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing i remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor br br what actually happened though was that jason <UNK> did the original make up for the sasquatch but for some reason they had to go back and re shoot much of the creature the sad part was that jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the re done creature was no where near as awesome as the original one br br for me it was quite sad because this was <UNK> final movie and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad re shoots anyway i thought you guys may find that a tad and if you would like you can head over to com and check out some behind the scenes photos br br later jeff
<START> seeing that this got a theatrical release nowhere around the globe it only serves as a reminder of were the careers of those talent free ladies denise richards and <UNK> <UNK> went it also is a particular grating kind of movie the kind that think they are smart funny and original while being poor in every aspect full blame can go to brian burns who wrote and directed this <UNK> his script takes a quite unoriginal situation and goes exactly nowhere with it the situations develop completely without any inner logic besides that of a desperate scriptwriter characters are thinner than cardboard <UNK> behave stupid and without any real motivation nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of mrs richards we don't believe her relationship with david character for one minute and the way she is brought back into play after the one hour mark is particularly pitiful why would anyone fall for a <UNK> self obsessed arrogant b <UNK> like this in the first place much less a second time especially after having supposedly found his <UNK> true love and if any of these things aren't enough to completely sink this movie than the central couple is the <UNK> of and <UNK> is only slightly more believable or developed than the richards one but it is to no <UNK> there is no chemistry no spark nothing that we might loosely accept as a credible couple worse these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating doing annoying and irritating things the viewer finally has no interest in whatsoever br br overall a very poor showing even die hard <UNK> com fans might want to pass on this one as there are dozens of movie made with more skill or more charm
<START> i have seen a number of horror movies to know that this one was one of kind full moon pictures has a knack of giving this fan an entertaining night for all the cheesiness of most vampire films this is the one that has not only a good premise but has two good sequels a must see
<START> ok so by minute 15 in the film there's still no dialogue br br this film arrived to me in a padded sack from down under with <UNK> info on the front i am a <UNK> from a north american fest and <UNK> love was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential <UNK> having at the far away <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br straight away i thought this film is not for us no dialogue by minute 15 but kept watching anyway well well well it built and built and built and half way in i was involved in this film because like when you go to the <UNK> at first you're <UNK> but by the time you get to the dangerous snakes bit you're totally <UNK> br br this film has a not at all like the much hyped wolf creek but because it is so totally <UNK> in every way shape and form and seems to <UNK> a web made up of all the fantasies of most independent first time ie gloomy weather red neck intrigue odd <UNK> eerie music and a plot which though <UNK> and basic has a bit in common with one of the <UNK> aussie <UNK> ie the cars that ate paris by but modern love is actually not really a very aussie movie in the sense of <UNK> and playful self <UNK> that <UNK> many of that country's films it works on a more nightmarish realm from the start no cell phones no brand names no i <UNK> no gritty urban middle class angst just a dude married to a good <UNK> an old <UNK> and a little boy son who has weird teeth and <UNK> stuff around oh and it's set in weird sea side village where people all look slightly <UNK> ' photographed by nick <UNK> 2 <UNK> and music by tom ten <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> succeeds where many movies fail ie it stands up without regard to the god <UNK> country that it comes out of instead it <UNK> in a <UNK> but entertaining <UNK> which the film itself cannot solve and <UNK> lies the weak link what on earth does this film have to do with modern love the final minutes of the film seem to give an answer or at least hints at one and as i sat and <UNK> a coffee and ate my <UNK> afterwards all that i could <UNK> was that this film's <UNK> alex will <UNK> have a lot of fun with this one
<START> danger watch for falling spoilers br br boy was this a bad movie i know that they were going for a true love <UNK> all kind of thing but about all this film <UNK> was about 3 which felt more like 9 hours of my afternoon which i will never get back the movie is about two young lovers named <UNK> and who live in a remote town in a fantasy world <UNK> is the much abused <UNK> at a hotel owned by father at first ignores advances but she eventually <UNK> up to him much to the disgust of you guessed it father as if this <UNK> wasn't enough to overcome an evil snow queen shoots a <UNK> of glass in eye and he becomes a mean person treats poorly <UNK> is eventually taken to the snow <UNK> <UNK> which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice because the good people at hallmark like to go all out and sets out on a mission to get <UNK> back along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way but escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way all the while you will want to turn it off but can't force yourself to do it it's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the snow queen anyways i will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it so in conclusion the snow queen is an incredibly boring movie which takes the fan out of fantasy
<START> this is one of the most outstanding horror movies i've ever seen in my life time forget the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies out there john carpenter as made a tour de force horror epic with outstanding special effects great performances from kurt russell and co and a great soundtrack that will haunt you for ever the greatest thing about this movie after 17 years is it dated it looks fresh and new and you don't get many movies like this back in 1982 this was up against e t and of course it and was a box office bomb over the years the thing as made a cult following from video and t v sales and as many new fans in the end this movie kicks ass and to me it as never loss it's edge to scare the pants off of you and to me that a horror movie long live john carpenter
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this film which in many ways as hitchcock did on several occasions was a first attempt at a plot which he re shot later in his career possibly the most amazing thing about it however is how <UNK> the lead characters are after watching one remembers murray as the <UNK> truck driver <UNK> touching turn as a blind <UNK> the unforgettable traveling freak show and of course otto <UNK> as the suave and sophisticated villain all of whom completely <UNK> bob <UNK> as the rather wooden fugitive compare that bridge jump to harrison ford's similar stunt in andrew <UNK> the fugitive and <UNK> lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards <UNK> is never quite believable br br the other major support player is of course hitchcock himself who <UNK> the film with 2 extraordinary stunts many people <UNK> the older films for their lack of realistic special effects my feelings are that with lack of technology to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement br br obviously this film carries an anti fascist message made at the time of the second world war but being a hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action well worth checking out especially for the support roles
<START> a surprisingly beautiful movie beautifully conceived beautifully directed beautifully acted beautifully acted and most beautifully photographed the cinematography is nothing short of splendid it is a war movie but is epic in it's scope and <UNK> romance tragedy and comedy into a story that is as harrowing as it is provoking
<START> i don't normally write reviews but this film was special i couldn't turn it off i don't believe i've ever seen a worse movie but there i sat watching it was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway it was disgusting but i couldn't turn away where do i start the movie seems to think it's a sports thriller but it's so utterly ridiculous it can only be a comedy but it's not funny not even in a dumb silly way it's like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get it's painful to watch but at least it's only for a minute or two second string went on for over an hour br br whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again the writing directing acting and everything was just terrible the problem is i can't describe how bad it was you just had to see it and i'm sure this will never be shown again so unless you saw it you're out of luck i mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other bad film i've seen over my lifetime and for every film i see in the future that i can't stand i will think to myself well at least it wasn't bad as the second string
<START> give me a break how can anyone say that this is a good hockey movie i know that movies tend to do a pretty p poor job of portraying hockey to the general public and yes this was made back when the u s hadn't <UNK> our sport to the extent is has today but really i have played hockey all my life and have watched even more and this my friends is sheer <UNK> the scenes on the ice were <UNK> <UNK> the particular instance to which i am referring is the sword fight er i mean the stick fight at the end of the film during which everyone is just standing around and watching not with fascination that this is actually happening but in wonder as to who will win the duel between <UNK> and his nemesis yes the story off the ice is a little better i do stress little br br i don't know maybe there is no point in going on i mean let's face it the film is right hockey is just one big battle on ice oh yeah with a little piece of rubber <UNK> around occasionally into what is loosely <UNK> a goal <UNK> is either appalling or hysterical i can't figure out which maybe someone else will have more luck
<START> a wildly uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller to me the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one and they should have gone for an all out comedy for example rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy the scene where <UNK> husband gets <UNK> is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy an even better example is the hollywood <UNK> writer preaching to us <UNK> through <UNK> character early on about the plight of the indians i mean yawn they should have given freeman something funny to say in that segment but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring pc speech br br there is yet more new age pc <UNK> in the form of the ending the girl not only doesn't get the boy she gets no boy at all in fact the message is that the girl needs no boy at all bit of a feminist statement there the first half hour is weak but the movie gets better ironically once <UNK> gets to kinnear i say ironically because i'm not much of a fan of <UNK> though he's solid here <UNK> is very cute as usual she has the sort of all american cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy and i have to wonder why more of such women aren't represented nowadays instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars such as diaz roberts aniston lopez or barrymore br br since the movie tries to be very serious at times i have no choice but to criticize <UNK> character which is the <UNK> equivalent of the movie world's hooker with the heart of gold there is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between freeman and rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son
<START> excellent entry in the rko saint series with well written original script good camera work and transitions good directing to handle some twists in the plot good editing to keep the flow constant and good acting george sanders is suave and witty jonathan hale simply is inspector <UNK> paul plays a mobster who goes straight and drinks milk because he cannot take the pressure he will return in a later entry in the series story begins on an ocean liner headed to the u s where the saint meets but cannot connect with <UNK> she eventually <UNK> to the charms but she breaks his heart in the end the saint <UNK> inspector <UNK> clear his name from a frame a few bodies fall along the way good entertainment and above average for this type of film watch it
<START> i have very few to add to what all the other reviewers already made more than clear this movie is awful beyond awful in fact so <UNK> that they have yet to come up with a term to describe the awfulness that is <UNK> man in case you expect your movies to feature a minimum of logic and plot you should stay as far away from this as <UNK> possible sure loads of people are getting killed by this <UNK> puppet wearing a ridiculous cape but nobody ever bothers to properly explain what he is where he comes from or why he's so angry with the world he looks like a <UNK> between <UNK> from masters of the universe and the <UNK> from sleepy hollow and runs amok in some <UNK> wilderness the setting of <UNK> man is another totally retarded aspect for nearly half an hour i assumed that the movie took place at a small isolated island but it simply plays at the <UNK> where fancy <UNK> cross the forest and power plants are located at the end of the woods huh why does everybody pretend to be trapped when there are like a million escape <UNK> anyway after a couple of totally random killings a special <UNK> squad led by poor washed up michael <UNK> arrives to come and hunt a monster they don't know anything about really hilarious is how every member of this squad introduces him herself as the expert in a certain field we have a sniper <UNK> a tracking genius a <UNK> <UNK> yet they all die before any of them is able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful skills the horror gods must really hate casper van <UNK> as he's present again as well portraying an heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason crashes on the highway but somehow gets <UNK> back to the middle of the woods to die there right that makes sense furthermore the characters steal cool one liners from predator the horse constantly changes colors <UNK> are brought down with bow <UNK> ordinary bullets cause trees to explode and completely pointless vietnam flashbacks haunt michael <UNK> i say we all combine forces and vote this pathetic flick into the imdb bottom top 100 <UNK>
<START> i saw this film for the first time last night i have been thinking about it all night and this morning i cannot say that it was my favorite film at least not yet i need to see it again br br the cinematography is stunning each shot has a <UNK> that one would expect in a film that has <UNK> <UNK> name attached to it br br it is always <UNK> to see de in any picture of <UNK> of orders <UNK> into the <UNK> but in this case the <UNK> fits in many ways the figure of <UNK> walking through the fog and wind of echoes the shadow of the off <UNK> statue that <UNK> <UNK> in the major works of the <UNK> greek painter he is slightly menacing a presence who watches and in his capacity as a film director <UNK> influence on the entire story br br the dedicated <UNK> fan cannot help but think a little bit of and wandering through the streets of berlin watching all but not directly <UNK> with the inhabitants and following the <UNK> uber berlin metaphor the angel or in this case <UNK> the director gets to interact with one of the stories br br at this point i have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far i need to see the movie again i am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring monologue together br br perhaps his <UNK> and are pretentious empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be <UNK> into real communication maybe that is the whole point of it no one can make that judgment with any degree of <UNK> or authority until having done his <UNK> br br we must be careful when throwing around the word pretentious it is easy to write off anything that <UNK> of the intellect as <UNK> but that leads to a terrifying mental state one in which the only conversation seen as genuine <UNK> or authentic is the most banal when we <UNK> all discussions of philosophy god existence meaning and all that brain candy we are setting our culture up to die a slow stupid and ugly death perhaps this is the warning that <UNK> and antonioni are giving us it certainly is not the only theme of the film but i think that it cannot be ignored br br the other and most obvious <UNK> is that of satisfaction there is a lot here on that and a <UNK> review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this <UNK> would well <UNK> the 1000 word limit for this review br br my advice is to see the film but i offer a <UNK> it is not an <UNK> film at least i don't think so yet some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the <UNK> before approaching the film par les is one of those films
<START> i still wonder why i sat through this entire thing it only had about 3 minutes of actual entertainment the rest of it was just a total bore the acting isn't that great and the action scenes are <UNK> cheesy it's not even funny i kinda wish i could say something good about this film but i can't think of anything right now there probably was somethings in it some can enjoy but the ending of it is gotta be the dumbest idea ever what type of person would get a little toy remote controlled helicopter with a burned in machine gun in it to <UNK> the president this idea could have never been done in the first place let alone have anyone dumb enough to try it i guess the writer must have been to obsessed with the toy car scene in the dead pool but actually tried to make this look serious
<START> storyline drags drug <UNK> a beautiful women and a determined cop nothing not already done a hundred times before the boat will be well worth the wait <UNK> is the perfect city to pull it off the <UNK> and put you on the edge of your seat i would say the same as did the car chase in <UNK> very intense
<START> an excellent <UNK> produced historical drama well played <UNK> written shot in ways that convey accurate visual images of the <UNK> and with more than a few moving moments especially for those who care about the history of africa and <UNK> however a fair amount of worthwhile content gets lost in translation and because names and so forth are hard to follow so i would strongly recommend checking a neutral source such as <UNK> to get a basic sense of the story being depicted and the subsequent history before enjoying the film if you have the dvd version there is also some useful historical background there is a point towards the end of the film where the name of a character who then speaks with an american accent is actually <UNK> out a simple <UNK> search of film <UNK> or something similar will reveal a truly fascinating and perhaps disturbing twist regarding the production of this important film this film if coupled with a little outside research helps dozens of other films relating to central east africa and or <UNK> e g hotel <UNK> shake hands with the devil various adaptations of <UNK> heart of darkness and even ali when <UNK> ali visits
<START> try as i might i just simply couldn't get into this one perhaps it was the washed out tones perhaps it was the drawn out approach i'm not really sure but though this was by no means a bad movie i didn't really find it to be very much of an effective movie words that i understand are so much more <UNK> than their common uses br br so basically the deal here is that a series of adolescent <UNK> deaths sets off an investigation and anxiety in a small <UNK> town <UNK> a witch hunt what do the <UNK> death have to do with the mysterious sexy woman who has appeared in town is the crazy <UNK> woman involved is it voodoo the story is a mixture of crime drama and horror as the various <UNK> are all suspect and corpses keep appearing while bloody violence ensues br br good enough but to me most of it fell a little flat oh it had it's moments the one boy walking in on a beautiful naked <UNK> was pretty good and the scene where the fathers beat the <UNK> was a bitter commentary even if the effects themselves failed considering her skin seemed to <UNK> off as if they were <UNK> her with red hot <UNK> br br my biggest issue was the ending i've already put spoiler <UNK> on this review but be warned here's the big spoiler i don't believe it i don't believe that a priest could convince himself to kill young boys for becoming sexually aware without some hint of that <UNK> appearing earlier with other boys with a history or some other personal affect the movie didn't really earn its ending end spoilers br br nonetheless fulci is a big name and i'm more than certain there's an audience out there for this i definitely need to check out more that he's done because this may have been a poor introduction most italian giallo is hit or miss anyway so i'm waiting to see what else this guy can do before writing him off br br <UNK>
<START> rabbit fever is one of those film <UNK> it's an enjoyable 90 minutes demands little of the viewer and delivers as much and on any <UNK> television channel even in a prime time <UNK> i think that rabbit fever would be rather well received which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas br br the movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who have am <UNK> relationship with the rabbit <UNK> the film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed <UNK> quality to the famous sex aid product the narrative is 100 tongue in cheek throughout br br the storyline is strong an introduction to some well rounded and likable characters some enjoyable back story <UNK> characters and situations develops into an engaging story and pleasing conclusions sadly there's nothing that feels clever or new br br rabbit fever has some sharp moments a few switches that hint at what the writers are capable of and all credit to them it's not just 90 minutes of <UNK> gags and innuendo i could probably watch it with my mother but there's a <UNK> about some of the scenes that holds it back those moments went you are up for it when you want it to be outrageous and all you get is a <UNK> of sit com br br i <UNK> i left the theatre feeling empathy for the characters but i also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90 minute reel of made for tv light entertainment and tried to put it into national cinema br br i think rabbit fever achieves some of what it set out to do it's a quirky subject a rounded storyline a well presented cast and a good <UNK> for 90 minutes but there's nothing in this that can justify the <UNK> of a movie theatre environment quite the opposite a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer chance to grab a breath of life that rabbit fever seems to lack
<START> by the time the <UNK> franchise was reaching it's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin dr paul <UNK> bruce <UNK> is a scientist in the future whom while prisoner <UNK> his <UNK> of the story of how his <UNK> all played by <UNK> had first built the evil <UNK> <UNK> puzzle box that sets evil upon the world and how his <UNK> had subsequent dealing with said box the film is a <UNK> with lack of continuity in regards to the other films and lack of <UNK> in this one yes this could be due to a combination of <UNK> massive cuts in the original version of the film or what have you but i'm reviewing the film as is and not what it was or could have been and as it is now it's a mess sure the franchise will go on <UNK> with direct to dvd sequels but this one was pretty much a death nail to it's chances of getting a new one released <UNK> ever again br br my grade d
<START> there are so many <UNK> <UNK> lists which could easily fit the dead best screen drunk best literary adaptation best use of music not specifically written for the film best use of poetry best screen speech best ensemble cast and finally perhaps best film ever made this was john <UNK> last and greatest film adapted by his son tony from james <UNK> short story and set on the evening of the feast of the <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> it is confined largely to one setting the home of the sisters and not a great deal happens in conventional terms they entertain their guests there is singing dancing and much small talk but watching this film you can't imagine anywhere else you would rather be than in this company br br finally of course it is much much more it is about love loss and regret those stable <UNK> of great drama in the film's closing scenes the <UNK> <UNK> frank <UNK> sings a song 'the <UNK> of which <UNK> up in the mind of <UNK> <UNK> huston wife of gabriel <UNK> <UNK> the ghost of her first and probably greatest love a boy who died in all <UNK> of a broken heart at the age of <UNK> and suddenly gabriel realises he has never really known his wife and that he has not been the great love of her life after all emotionally these scenes are incredibly powerful firstly as <UNK> <UNK> the circumstances of her <UNK> death and then as the voice in <UNK> head sums up his own feelings this is great cinema the monologues superbly delivered by huston and <UNK> br br but then all the performances are extraordinary this is ensemble playing of the highest order and while it would be <UNK> to single out one performer above another has the screen ever given us a more likable <UNK> or convincing drunk than <UNK> <UNK> or has poetry ever been delivered with such passion that sean the ira man in the quiet man brings to his reading of lady <UNK> translation of here added <UNK> is to be had of course from the knowledge that huston himself was close to death when he made this film which seems to me the <UNK> of his life's work death may well be its central theme but viewing this film is a life <UNK> experience
<START> i have read a couple of reviews of this film which has recently been released on dvd by <UNK> apparently the opening titles are <UNK> but the remainder most is full screen the first release in 1982 by planet video is completely <UNK> though it was a primitive release it did get the compositions right later releases had <UNK> and better picture quality but they were <UNK> as the dvd is any release of this film should be <UNK> as it adds significantly to the visual experience of the old planet tape
<START> i endured this film just to satisfy my curiosity it has to be one of the worst films i have ever sat through i am amazed that this film currently has a 7 5 star rating the acting is awful script is non existent and the characters are so predictable and hollow for a funny film i cannot remember even <UNK> once and fail to see how it could be defined as a comedy do yourself a favour and stay well away from this <UNK> and check out some more worthy <UNK> that would give you far greater pleasure check out films like the holiday or 27 dresses these movies would offer a far more satisfying cinema experience i sincerely hope more educated film goers vote <UNK> for this film in the manner it genuinely deserves there bye giving it a more realistic rating that other film buffs could base their judgement upon come on folks let's be fair to everyone concerned and give those involved with this film a true reflection on what it is they have produced an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly
<START> well this was a complete waste of celluloid the preview was promising but after watching the movie it looked like the preview was the whole movie no plot no clear storyline just some misplaced suspense it looks like the director tried very hard to create an atmosphere of <UNK> and fear but still there are gaps to be filled why the drugs why the number 11 11 btw as sarah the library the clock says 11 14 what's the connection to the murder on the parents what's the role of this woman is she one of the children or not who are those children anyway there is a lot of material lying around to create the ultimate cult movie like the omen but the director just leaves them lying on the floor without digging into the story even the project was more scary than this one all the gaps you hope to be filled like in the <UNK> effect stay open as the credits start rolling ok off to the next movie
<START> was a college acting class exercise filmed and released as a movie the formulaic <UNK> and stylized drivel of a horror soap opera for people who don't like horror films but wish to be able to tell that friends that yes they did see a horror movie it even features soap opera music br br do books falling off library shelves scare you do doors <UNK> <UNK> you then this flick is for you have you ever been kidnapped yeah most of us have when you were raped was it simply ignored because the rapist was the cool kid what's scary is not this movie but this <UNK> view of the world br br and then the little twists aren't even original this is a film for people who've never seen a horror film before who don't want to see one now and who want to see another flick about everyone <UNK> against the weird kid
<START> father hood is an overlooked little gem of a road movie fine performances by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lloyd and brian <UNK> two really fun over the top ones by diane <UNK> and michael <UNK> br br and a downright outstanding one from patrick <UNK> the movie is helped by an unconventional storyline but badly <UNK> by it's flashback framing which results in a abrupt ending father hood would have worked much better without these <UNK> nevertheless the movie brings up important issues of family <UNK> and the consequences of state <UNK> as long as the foster system <UNK> state <UNK> for not placing children such <UNK> will exist br br pick this one up it's worth the ride
<START> the production value of can be described by one <UNK> awful br br the script is ridiculous even in the fictional area of what are the good for on the ship why is the predator cleaning up all signs of his influence and than wasting precious time with and even presenting the body of an insignificant human cop why is the predator alone why is the predator himself only on earth but on his home planet why does the predator make his job so uneasy for himself by hunting down the aliens rather than bombing the whole countryside like the humans do in the end why is the predator dropping more more of his few weapons rather than collecting them to keep them together after using one in the end he is even dropping his armor before fighting the in hand to hand combat what a bad <UNK> of the first <UNK> final fight between and the predator the gestures are so exaggerated that he is moving more like a japanese <UNK> than like highly skilled <UNK> <UNK> hunter as one can see immediately the whole story is a mess but it gets even worse because this <UNK> up job is filled up with boring <UNK> of senseless <UNK> like a lengthy pizza <UNK> episode or some detailed information about the criminal past of the two brothers dallas ricky the sheriff is of course the friend of these two criminals who he puts regularly behind bars not convincing absolutely superfluous for the plot br br in addition to that the cast of actors is horrible compared to the high class of directors actors of the former aliens or predator movies is an embarrassingly bad piece of crap br br at last the action of the movie is really poor there is not a single scene of action combat in which the audience can see the whole set each and every fight is filmed in short shaky bursts with close up zoom at nearly full darkness that results in an atrocious experience for the audience because one can mostly see nothing but a dark shaky screen br br i suggest the two directing brothers to buy themselves a <UNK> and get a lesson in modern cg so that the next film contains some visible action of visible figures and might not need to disguise their bad directing abilities in such a manner br br i would advise anybody even die hard fans against watching this film prefer the first one or the original aliens or the original predator films but avoid disappointing yourself by wasting your precious time on this failure
<START> this movie is pretty good as it is but the <UNK> <UNK> cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original <UNK> story is handled differently the death scenes are done 10 times better there's more footage of ritual type stuff giving more story about micheal jamie and her baby there is also an alternate ending which is also better why they didn't release this version instead i have no damned clue if you can find this version see it
<START> solo is a poor film that cannot be ignored the acting for the most part is very wooden the only exception is <UNK> <UNK> performance as <UNK> creator bill and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it whilst you where watching the film that said such films are more about the action than the plot acting and as such live or die by the action set pieces that after all is the point of such films to give 14 year olds something to smile at whilst the adults watch films of actual substance and even on this solo fails to deliver what little action there is is poorly done dull and uninspired after seeing the trailer for this on television i was hoping for something along the lines of predator with a robot replacing the instead i got a fairly lifeless action film with a poorly constructed attempt at depth by taking on message that robots can feel too watch terminator ii or predator instead both classics that this film desperately wants to be except it lacks the inspiration or to be fair the budget
<START> my god this is funny stuff yes it's <UNK> in the extreme but also rather witty here's the page with all the on it it's a little early for us i'm afraid well what are you doing up then and the fight sequences are second to none despite what you may have heard the laughs do keep coming and at a surprisingly generous rate the sheer comic abilities of and adrian help keep it <UNK> funny <UNK> every drop of comedy from the script i can only compare it to fear and loathing in las vegas you either find that film hysterical throughout or not at all the same applies here it's probably the funniest british film since <UNK> and i but to say it's an acquired taste is something of a gross <UNK> understatement
<START> what can i say about the series dubbed the new outer limits hmm only that this was one of the best tv series ever assembled you have actors of all ages the actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot everyone playing their part to exact perfection these shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time if not all the time is very true you can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying <UNK> not only do these shows have great story lines they also throw you into them get your mind racing and your blood <UNK> the original outer limits was a black and white in the 60's right these shows made a <UNK> comeback the likes of which i have never seen the new twilight zone with forest <UNK> was fun to watch but the new outer limits is where it's at if you have not seen i <UNK> you to please check these episodes out and you will see exactly what i mean long live the new outer limits
<START> wow i swear this has never happened to me i only watched golden temple <UNK> yesterday and already i haven't got the slightest <UNK> of anything that happened in this film that's how brilliant this movie is i guess by now i only remember being <UNK> into watching it because of the incredibly attractive dvd cover art showing a <UNK> drawing of a <UNK> amazon preparing her bow to fire at an <UNK> target i often get fooled by appealing dvd covers ¬ñ especially jess franco ones ¬ñ and i still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences oh <UNK> after reading the other user comments some parts of my memory returned although i still suspect to confuse this film with another jess franco masterpiece i watched the day before namely <UNK> of the and yes that one had an awesome dvd cover as well br br golden temple <UNK> opens with a <UNK> of hot white african <UNK> ¬ñ i am aware of the <UNK> but don't blame me ¬ñ <UNK> the parents of a fragile young girl because they were <UNK> the <UNK> with the intention of stealing the golden <UNK> from the temple several years and <UNK> changes later the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge she's accompanied by a bunch of sleazy <UNK> who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldn't mind taking some gold back home the <UNK> premise is obviously secondary to all the <UNK> of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze eva and the other <UNK> <UNK> are all regular franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed you better enjoy <UNK> at all these perfect female <UNK> as the rest of golden temple <UNK> is a boring and incompetent mess there's hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler bits and pieces of national <UNK> documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff the awesome dvd cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection but opening the box is utter pointless
<START> this <UNK> laid back low key casually paced aussie crime thriller <UNK> with a casual ease and relaxed self confidence that's a delight to behold eager <UNK> working class kid jimmy an <UNK> <UNK> heath ledger <UNK> to make something out of his <UNK> ordinary life jimmy gets his big break when local crime <UNK> an outstanding bryan brown <UNK> him an easy <UNK> gig which <UNK> delivering 10 grand to an old lady jimmy finds himself <UNK> deep in serious trouble when he loses money writer director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> simple tale of how things aren't always what they're <UNK> up to be young love all actions having consequences and that <UNK> old <UNK> about how crime doesn't pay works like a charm thanks to a wonderful wealth of well observed minor quirky details a strong subtext concerning man's duel capacity for both good and evil a nice sense of <UNK> irony the <UNK> matter of fact way the violence is presented and the marvelous <UNK> of the <UNK> drawn low life characters in an instantly recognizable and totally believable banal day to day reality e g <UNK> is shown playing <UNK> with a <UNK> and at one point <UNK> a business conversation with a fellow hood to talk with his son over the phone judging from his finely <UNK> and two <UNK> portrayal of the cunning not to be <UNK> with bryan brown undoubtedly qualifies as one of the finest actors to ever grace celluloid a <UNK> and satisfying little sleeper
<START> a fare to remember is a totally derivative almost ridiculous movie but has a warmth about it that makes it a very effective and upbeat holiday movie it stars a pretty newcomer as a high powered ad executive who right before her wedding has to rush from l a to seattle to keep a client who has rejected every other presentation she has <UNK> difficulties from the beginning and seemingly no money this is the first dumb thing were there no anywhere she must make a fortune at any rate she meets a cab driver warner who looks like a homeless man and he drives her to her presentation and when she emerges with a huge box of <UNK> jerky the <UNK> product he's there to take her to the airport all <UNK> are canceled so in order to get to l a for her wedding she hires him to take her there br br along the way they bond and learn from each other it's a very sweet movie though there is absolutely nothing new in it it combines six days and seven nights and a few other films but the chemistry between the stars is good they're likable and the acting is good look for jerry springer as the head of the <UNK> jerky company and a cameo by karl malden br br this is a nice film to take in over the holiday season it's on lifetime
<START> one of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is short a mad tale of how a <UNK> intellectual board game could <UNK> even the most carefully planned central <UNK> such an <UNK> comedic subject as chess found an earlier <UNK> in this delightful short two young men play the game <UNK> against an artificial background a painted set this is in contrast to earlier <UNK> shorts such as or du <UNK> the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting the difference in activities natural feeding baby <UNK> garden artificial chess is possibly significant br br the main contrast in this film is between this background and the <UNK> <UNK> game of chess and the fierce passions this latter causes as <UNK> of cheating lead to a most <UNK> the intellectual game becomes a gross physical <UNK> just as the <UNK> of arty filmmakers are forever <UNK> by the demands of audiences br br what is most amusing about the film is not <UNK> this descent into slapstick but the way it is filmed its <UNK> long after the initial joke has been made the way the camera refuses to <UNK> the fight with anything like attention focusing instead on the set while we catch glimpses of <UNK> feet and <UNK> clothing the film's <UNK> to edit is <UNK> so that the humour seems to <UNK> from something else other than the fight <UNK> our need for physical contact over intellectual <UNK> our to let go br br what is especially brilliant is the denouement as these upper class <UNK> are caught by the <UNK> who picks them up like two <UNK> <UNK> as if he is about to box their ears if masters can't be expected to keep their place with <UNK> than <UNK> going to have to do it for them
<START> this film was so bad it became enjoyable if you want to see a soap opera cast decide to do an action film this is for you overacting irrelevant incidents implausible dialogue it has it all the main character has a split personality and can not make up his mind whether he is thief a loving father or a hero who will risk his life for others he is plausible in none of these roles this sets the standard for many of the other characters the boss of the company whose building is set <UNK> displays the same <UNK> and so does his wife and the punch line who has taken the chip <UNK> belief i found myself laughing <UNK> and for that reason i recommend you watch it
<START> by the time it opened <UNK> gate had become to its <UNK> more a cultural phenomenon than a motion picture at a time when concern about excessive budgets and directorial arrogance were growing it was a convenient target as it was a far over budget work by the latest auteur to hit hollywood who had not yet established the track record that would have given him the benefit of the doubt among critics and the industry alike as someone pointed out at the time no one was going to jump on warren <UNK> even more <UNK> and dark <UNK> because beatty was one of us while michael <UNK> had not achieved that status br br but <UNK> gate was also affected by a cultural change taking place at that time the political move and toward a more <UNK> and of the myth of the west and the western a few years earlier <UNK> of the frontier might have seemed <UNK> fresh and a necessary but by 1980 in the wake of the reagan revolution it was thought of as nearly un american br br which is a shame because the film seen from the <UNK> point of several decades away is a fascinating and thought provoking look at that particular time and place as a world where life was in words nasty <UNK> and short kristofferson plays james an upper class who in search of adventure becomes a sheriff in <UNK> where he finds himself having to lead a resistance by the <UNK> and <UNK> against an attack by a <UNK> death squad hired by wealthy <UNK> including <UNK> best friend in a more innocent time and his <UNK> tag army of poor <UNK> would emerge <UNK> but this is anything but a traditional western and when the u s <UNK> joins the fight here it isn't on the side of the good guys br br much like the deer hunter <UNK> previous film <UNK> gate spends a great deal of time building up the details of the lives of its principals giving the film an at times <UNK> pace that nevertheless leads to a gripping conclusion with excellent acting a fine musical score and the visual <UNK> that makes one believe one is actually seeing the old west through new eyes <UNK> gate is a film that <UNK> repeat viewings i only wish that mgm would put out a new dvd with an improved transfer and a commentary by <UNK> nonetheless the current version is satisfactory enough to let viewers see what critics in 1980 possibly <UNK> by the film's cultural <UNK> managed to miss that <UNK> gate is a great film
<START> lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice <UNK> surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an <UNK> function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white low budget original nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great <UNK> stable
<START> i give it a 2 because of the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> otherwise it would be 1 when nicholas cage came into with his first lines i thought he was just kidding cage as an italian i'm sorry but very wrong actor who's acting is also bad not to mention his accent the story is very loose it might have been good but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay the camera is great photography also but why the hell did you cast nicholas cage and penelope <UNK> for the role please don't get me wrong i don't have anything against cage he has some really great movies but he obviously isn't for every role it's really a pity that the cast wasn't better set because the story has potential
<START> kim basinger and mickey rourke star in this controversial story of a wall street <UNK> and an art gallery employee who hook up and begin a very experimental sexual relationship while the acting by rourke and basinger is ok the <UNK> doesn't allow their characters to truly form allegedly there was a lot of film left on the cutting room floor that <UNK> deeper into the characters and the effects of the relationship on them <UNK> character considering suicide that would have made the characters more involved for the viewer as is it is a glossy well produced with mtv style editing piece of soft core <UNK> 4 of 10
<START> this movie was sheer slow plodding torture not being a fan of slasher films and <UNK> classic horror i may not be the best judge slasher fans may enjoy this as an early entry into the slasher genre i really would like the 90 minutes i spent watching this back the only reasons to watch this are 1 a young white pre wheel of fortune who has about 3 minutes of total screen time 2 an early role by scream queen <UNK> <UNK> with nudity and legendary beauty <UNK> as the school secretary who added a bit of humor and sex appeal otherwise an 80's band called makes an appearance which while interesting drags on way too long just like the movie i had to keep checking how much time was left and couldn't wait to graduate to a better film
<START> maybe it was the excessive weight gain seagal had put on or maybe it was the horrible acting of wayans in an action flick or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two leading characters these and other <UNK> lead me to conclude that seagal should have never made this acting nightmare true the story line was good yet as an avid <UNK> of <UNK> career and background his physical appearance was inconsistent with his genre of clean pure healthy <UNK> <UNK> living notably in his on screen discussions with wayans then again his real life affair with the <UNK> was inconsistent also br br if seagal wants to become a more <UNK> actor then he should do what a fellow action figure did in <UNK> cop put humorous material or situations in the script where the actor has no choice but to react in a comical way otherwise leave the wise cracks and the <UNK> attempts at humor out of it while chasing a serial killer seagal is not a natural humor type of guy it did not work br br
<START> excellent performance there still are good actors around also great directing and photography very true to <UNK> and a <UNK> for all <UNK> fans <UNK> jason connery moved me to tears with his final <UNK> out brief candle out he gave the <UNK> of moral <UNK> and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting helen is a very credible lady <UNK> who can be very at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil if you love death and <UNK> and lyrics this is the one
<START> i cannot believe this show was okay ed first off j p does a horrible job filling in for david spade and voice is too deep compared to john <UNK> the theme song is so annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid the only good thing about this show is that <UNK> <UNK> and patrick <UNK> remain as the voices of and this show is a waste of money and a waste of your time half of the episodes are copied of the movie in my opinion the <UNK> new groove was one of the best children's movies in years but they ruined by making new groove and this show you should watch such shows as <UNK> fairly <UNK> danny phantom or kim possible but not this show
<START> now i love italian horror films the <UNK> they are the better however this is not cheesy italian this is week old spaghetti <UNK> with rotting <UNK> it is amateur hour on every level there is no suspense no horror with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are in fact watching a horror film the special effects consist of the lights changing to red whenever the ghost or whatever it was supposed to be is around and a string pulling bed sheets up and down <UNK> can you feel the chills the dvd quality is that of a vhs transfer which actually helps the film more than hurts it the dubbing is below even the lowest bad italian movie standards and i gave it one star just because the dialogue is so hilarious and what do we discover when she finally does look in the attic in a scene that is daytime one minute and night the next well i won't spoil it for anyone who really wants to see but let's just say that it isn't very novel
<START> world war i gets a glossy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in jean pierre <UNK> relentlessly whimsical a very long engagement <UNK> trademark style consists of mechanical almost clockwork like narrative construction <UNK> with lavish chocolate box production values and seasoned with faux naive humour it's an approach that worked pretty well with his previous picture the romantic fantasy <UNK> thanks in no small part to the <UNK> contribution of audrey <UNK> in the title role applied to vastly more <UNK> material <UNK> method <UNK> rather badly br br <UNK> <UNK> up again here in a variation on the same sort of <UNK> off beat character as <UNK> she's an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an <UNK> rural setting determined to trace what became of her child sweetheart <UNK> <UNK> several years after he went missing in the war was one of five soldiers court for self <UNK> in <UNK> at and sent over the top into no man's land as a punishment he's presumed dead by all but who <UNK> the hope of finding him the film follows <UNK> quest to find out what really happened and as she <UNK> deeper she <UNK> a sad even shocking story of high <UNK> corruption and <UNK> must <UNK> the facts from the <UNK> that <UNK> from various <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> accounts of what seem to be final hours br br all this should be poignant and gripping but it's more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal clutter with which <UNK> <UNK> his audience there's simply too much going on at any one time including an <UNK> narration that adds precisely nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters without a <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> i felt denied the space to reflect on quest or the room to engage with it on my own terms <UNK> busy camera <UNK> and <UNK> and circles <UNK> every surface <UNK> of his <UNK> designed production but it <UNK> fails to <UNK> to the soul beneath the story's skin the result is deeply <UNK> and worse grotesque the first world war was a particularly dark hour in human history imagine it re created as one of those <UNK> commercials for a well known <UNK> <UNK> and you have the measure of this film
<START> i am a big fan of <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> russell she really was the perfect actress to play that character br br i've heard angela lansbury was very good on stage in <UNK> but it's hard to imagine anyone <UNK> <UNK> russell br br lucy was such a great <UNK> that her comic bits <UNK> her performance in this movie where i think she was miscast really they should have dubbed her singing voice hearing these songs sung at a faster <UNK> and with strong voices really changes the whole effect br br i just saw the stage revival in washington d c and i think christine <UNK> was very good as <UNK> harriet harris the nasty chain smoking agent on <UNK> played vera and she was particularly good br br both would be good casting for a tv movie of this show maybe if that production makes it to broadway they'll consider filming it br br also i think tracy <UNK> would be good as <UNK>
<START> dad <UNK> and i <UNK> both had a good time watching the flick today for a guy primarily known for serious roles de niro is a <UNK> comic actor of course it helps to have his past film images to play against consider that one of those roles 15 minutes was a cop having to deal with the <UNK> of the mass media and you have an interesting set of compare contrast performances br br murphy plays another of his <UNK> <UNK> sort of characters shatner plays a <UNK> of himself a parallel world self who was best known for <UNK> hooker and not star trek br br it's interesting to watch how the film comments on the <UNK> between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in tv and film shatner <UNK> on the proper means of <UNK> across a car hood de niro points out <UNK> scratch the hood finish ironically as the film progresses de <UNK> character begins to <UNK> the <UNK> of tv cop reality into the real world case he's working br br the film draws its inspiration from a gamut of sources so one could make the comment it is derivative well so what satire needs to <UNK> its humor in order to exist and besides the film does have quirky moments of originality for example i'm reasonably sure the method of the <UNK> death has never been done before br br one <UNK> about the reality of the weapons involved shouldn't those guns have had some kind of <UNK> in order to <UNK> steel those bullets had to have enough <UNK> to <UNK> and any highest level of <UNK> is at the moment of firing so firing a <UNK> of these tank killer bullets should have driven the <UNK> back onto their <UNK> oh what the heck it's a satire maybe the lack of <UNK> is itself a satire on the b f guns used so casually in thrillers br br
<START> i rented this movie because i love and i've watched her on many tv shows and since she's having her 15 minutes of fame nowadays with her new movie i wanted to check out what other movies she has been in br br she's just ok in terms of acting not good and not bad either she makes up for everything by being extremely gorgeous br br rodney <UNK> was quite a surprise as the hero he provided the only solid good acting in the movie he's a very good actor and should probably be an action star br br besides being ok and rodney being really good everything else about this movie is garbage in its <UNK> form br br a computer <UNK> <UNK> into the system of a plane from the ground and using a <UNK> he tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant or something and of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and ruin his game br br this is one of the worst scripts i have ever seen and no wonder it was a low budget flick br br what's shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and it has way too many similarities to the september <UNK> <UNK> br br why do they make movies like this in the first place br br panic one star a waste of too good actors also a waste of time also known as air panic
<START> i recently rented this film on dvd and thought it would be an interesting choice seeing as i am both from the north of england <UNK> and also interested in film making however it soon became apparent that this film seemed to lack a decent level of development script wise the characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance the subject matter could be an interesting basis for a film however the delivery of this appeared naive and <UNK> br br the ending felt as though it was casting judgement on the characters <UNK> and rewarding where the filmmakers felt necessary this felt a little awkward and silly and seemed at odds with the <UNK> used in the style of shooting for me the film dealt with the characters and subject matter in a rather heavy handed and clumsy manner it felt as though the writer had already decided how he wanted to end the story and set about crow <UNK> everything else in to fit it br br another point that i feel strongly about is the watered down ken <UNK> feel the film had i get quite upset that uk film <UNK> can't see that there is more to british films than it has become almost a safe option film is an infinitely wonderful <UNK> for imaginative ideas and it is not being exploited by uk feature film producers there is a lot of talent here in the uk it's unfortunate that most of these individuals end up either making music videos and commercials 100 of the time or they go to america br br love hate would have worked better if it had been cut down to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a one off tv drama
<START> the worst movie i've seen in a long time this whole thing rings false and the billy <UNK> character especially so the potential for a good story is there but this movie never comes close to delivering every plot element just <UNK> away
<START> this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the be all end all of movies look no further the story of a man bent on revenge and how better to get it i know i'll suck out their brains with great sound effects and impressive special effects i can't recommend this movie enough
<START> br br this movie sucked the first one was way better no one from the first has returned in this dumb sequel and in some way that is a good thing because of the bad acting but the characters in this film are not even better <UNK> in the woods come on give me a break i'm <UNK> friend the blair witch didn't show up to make a cameo bad acting bad story and just plain out silly and boring don't waste your time
<START> when i first heard that jack black and kyle <UNK> would make a movie about their band i was freaking out i love their music and i hoped that this movie would be really funny now that i have watched it i can't really say that these hopes weren't satisfied but i think i expected more the movie is full of <UNK> <UNK> great music and i really loved listening to all of it there are a lot of great jokes and i just love the story at least the first bit i don't like the way the movie ends the ending is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have extended that a bit more br br overall i think it is a good movie to watch everyone who likes rock music should watch it it'll give you a good laugh
<START> this film was shot in randolph county in central north <UNK> in 1968 when a film crew in the state was a rare thing the locations were the of liberty and and the surrounding rural countryside it is not a particularly good movie it did have <UNK> <UNK> and it brought life to the <UNK> for a few minutes br br the plot is standard the cinematography is that fuzzy stuff that came out of the late sixties and early seventies the local folks were thrilled to be a part of the enterprise br br if viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this film a record copy is available in <UNK> br br actors not credited include ben jones <UNK> <UNK> tommy <UNK> bill <UNK>
<START> for one used to the comedies on television now whether sketch sitcom or animated it's nice to watch something truly refreshing br br the <UNK> has to be the best comedy of this decade seinfeld being the triumph it follows the <UNK> urban <UNK> to fix situations do road and try to get the facts from our politicians the good old fashioned way br br despite being very controversial at times the shows excellent quality from the well made and truly funny opening credits to the sketch style <UNK> sketch style only in time they are not scripted at least not the ones at the other end of the joke is certainly worth watching even the most cynical and intellectual viewer won't be disappointed and the show deserves ten stars br br all in all well done to the abc for showing this and i recommend it highly
<START> proof if ever proof were needed that hammer should have left their vampires firmly in the victorian age after all <UNK> is all about repressed sexuality so the concept is irrelevant in <UNK> london with its thirty something pretending to be randy teenagers br br remember by this time hammer was <UNK> badly the public had tired of the drawing room horror of the 1950s and 60s so the studio was trying everything to bring them back including ample nudity lust for a vampire et al and <UNK> their characters neither of which apparently worked as hammer was pretty much <UNK> in it grave just two years later shame br br but i still have a great <UNK> for the classic hammer period from 1957 1965
<START> in my personal opinion <UNK> is one of the best steven seagal movies br br i've heard people say it's the worst one ever it's not like ss etc i disagree as a highly spiritual person a great master seagal established a good tradition in action movies he always has a good background great action high <UNK> and a clever message this movie has it all you have good shooting scenes great <UNK> although there isn't a lot of it it shows us its peaceful side this change in his film making only proves his spiritual growth he doesn't kill buddy in the end br br <UNK> is definitely one of the best films from the point of view which i have seen lately you have great <UNK> shots of montana we see real american nature and beautiful <UNK> among others horses and flowers the soundtrack also deserves a few words during the film i had a great opportunity to listen to classical american cowboy western music not country though similar music was heard in to the future acting has greatly improved since his last films his role is unfamiliar to him unlike cops <UNK> but he does a good job playing the retired doctor from the government his acting is convincing and his lines are good br br i was really pleased with the cast jones proves that life death walk the earth together <UNK> yellow <UNK> plays a beautiful and clever scientist <UNK> belle makes a great appearance as daughter br br mr seagal <UNK> the much <UNK> tradition and the <UNK> <UNK> providing his own point of view he likes the <UNK> just fine but <UNK> <UNK> men have nothing to do with it also good points are raised regarding the eastern western medicine system and nature br br <UNK> best and opening new <UNK> in his film career br br
<START> if you haven't seen this movie than you need to it rocks and you have to watch it it is so funny and will make you laugh your guts out so you have to watch it and i saw it about a billion and a half times and still think it is funny so you have to yes i have <UNK> the whole movie and could quote it to you from start to finish you must see this move it is also cute because it is half a chick flick if you don't watch it then you are really missing out this movie even has cute guys in it and that is always a bonus so in summary watch the movie now and trust me you will not be making a mistake did i mention the music is good too so you should like it if you enjoy music this is a movie that they rated correctly and it will work for anyone
<START> for those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining bollywood indian production beware no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to <UNK> the mood in this rather tired story of arranged <UNK> in the british indian culture with a few variations thrown in as written by <UNK> the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine <UNK> tactics <UNK> directs like a traffic cop trying to hold together the <UNK> subplots to the point of <UNK> cop tactics br br <UNK> chris is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover jack peter ash and they live with jack's <UNK> alcoholic loose morals aunt vanessa sally and <UNK> <UNK> daughter hannah <UNK> <UNK> family is visited by the <UNK> family from <UNK> who bring their beautiful daughter <UNK> to england to find a husband parents <UNK> and massey and his grandmother <UNK> decide is the girl for <UNK> to marry and <UNK> an engagement and wedding in the <UNK> of indian ways without <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> discovers the plot and is too <UNK> not to go along with it a decision which <UNK> jack and <UNK> vanessa hannah tells a <UNK> to that she is daughter and the wedding is off when parents visit house they discover the drunken vanessa are <UNK> by her but eventually decide that for happiness they will go along with the fact that vanessa has given them a and decide to use the marriage <UNK> as a wedding for <UNK> and vanessa <UNK> convinces the very reluctant vanessa to go along with the idea and before long vanessa is dressed in a <UNK> prepared for a wedding and <UNK> terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents includes jack as his best man at the wedding the truth comes out and to surprise his family <UNK> to true self and the day is saved by simply being truthful br br the cast <UNK> with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances chris and peter ash are attractive men and play their roles well albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of <UNK> between the two men sally provides most of the laughs as vanessa the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles they've played countless times in indian movies this is not a bad film it has its moments but it is just too superficial and tired to make us care about any of the characters
<START> this movie was recently shown subtitled not dubbed on <UNK> special <UNK> service i thought i read here that there is sometimes an <UNK> that revenge of the rats is a sequel in fact the rats are getting revenge for something that is done within this movie or in human history there is no prequel as far as i know br br now let's get the <UNK> <UNK> of out of the way perhaps this tale crossed my mind when i was watching the film but that's all there was the use of the word <UNK> at the end of the movie a <UNK> mayor tries to justify her actions by saying the <UNK> were empty <UNK> isn't a word you hear around much these days unless you read folk tales to your children as i do since seeing revenge of the rats i've read two versions of the <UNK> <UNK> of now i see the comparison a <UNK> fat but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford to get rid of the rats this is about as far as i can follow the <UNK> the children are not led to a door in a mountain with one lame boy left behind to tell of a land of <UNK> horses and <UNK> where it is always spring and everyone is always happy br br there's a lot that is quite mainstream about this movie the romance and the resolution especially the female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are really quite <UNK> where this film is quite rebellious as compared with american cinema is that it is anti <UNK> the helicopter pilot is <UNK> by the mayor for doing good the mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and <UNK> to big money finally it is left to one doctor in <UNK> to solve an <UNK> of a fatal and <UNK> disease apparently there is no national <UNK> <UNK> authority to co things or send in back up br br i'm not a horror <UNK> so any horror i do see is usually <UNK> with humour right from the rat in the blood bank you can see this is going to have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers the huge number of rats is impressive and the horror fans seem to be satisfied too
<START> this almost documentary look at an <UNK> boy who lives in the body shop area outside of new york is real all the way real lighting real sound less editing in the whole movie than in 1 minute of most movies and while there is very little script there is a story shot in primary colors almost all red white blue and yellow we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing he has a place to live that he makes his own has a good job and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe the people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which i didn't know about they mostly seem decent and pay <UNK> what seems like daily seeming truly concerned about his well being the actor i think playing <UNK> says more with one facial expression than one can imagine this reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish it shows what kids are capable of even without much support and love definitely recommend
<START> yes this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes over the years the plot lines became over the top melodramatic and very unrealistic however it didn't matter because the show is great you really get involved in the characters and every character no matter how minor or major is perfectly cast br br i can't imagine anyone else except simmons play the neo nazi racist rapist leader nor anyone else playing <UNK> except lee the transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is amazing however the character that made oz oz was chris <UNK> played by christopher <UNK> he didn't have relations with anyone else in prison except well except <UNK> but that was only to get <UNK> to stop playing around with <UNK> lover boy their relationship <UNK> <UNK> and tom <UNK> actually made us care about those two and want those two to be together br br i loved soft spot for his kids in the show and how <UNK> made sympathetic characters out of all these <UNK> criminals that we grew to adore even simon br br however some plot lines were totally unbelievable and unrealistic a guy building a bomb in oz guys standing in a spotlight in their windows in their <UNK> looking at other men plotting something in their mind too over the top drugs getting in oz everyone in the <UNK> group used or sold drugs and sister pete never helped anyone in six years people getting killed in the gym supply closet and kitchen no one hurting <UNK> mom no one fighting <UNK> outside the boxing ring except <UNK> of course two inmates with tools being left alone in the elevator <UNK> and one of them dying with no investigation karl <UNK> guard gets killed and no one <UNK> <UNK> holds all his press <UNK> at the prison all an <UNK> needs to do is say i want to see glenn or i want to see <UNK> and they are taken to them no questions asked people die every week in oz on the outside people kill someone and get 20 years up for <UNK> in eight but if they kill someone on the inside they go to death row almost immediately there is no on site paid staff in the kitchen or mail room inmates run both <UNK> no questions asked aging drugs for inmates to substitute as time served ryan has no friends or associates but he never gets hurt killed <UNK> raped or beaten the guys never <UNK> the <UNK> when they go to the bathroom or throw up an <UNK> <UNK> comes to the prison to <UNK> for an <UNK> player yeah right br br however with all these flaws this show is still awesome it's gruesome brutal sexy edgy raw and innovative dean winters scott william winters simmons christopher <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> adele the guy that played simon walker lee terry <UNK> male alexander ll cool j etc etc etc all are awesome and made the show worth watching br br i highly recommend renting this on dvd season six comes out 9 <UNK> next month first five seasons are on dvd watch them and then watch them again with audio commentary i loved the director's commentary with <UNK> <UNK> the sequence with andy running down the <UNK> tables and then falling into the hole was an awesome top notch shot kudos and kathy bates directing family business and the famous wrestling scene between and <UNK> simply amazing brilliant <UNK> have to be so weird for <UNK> to touch private part in front of an icon like kathy bates in that one scene wow pulled that off beautifully pun intended br br i'm waiting for oz the next generation like with star trek etc c'mon let's get it started
<START> forced <UNK> formulaic do these <UNK> make you want to run to rent his <UNK> hopkins was brilliant in the original dr and mr hyde a few other early movies of hers notably the story of temple drake are never shown but said to be excellent br br here she is <UNK> <UNK> and thoroughly unappealing ray <UNK> as a village <UNK> not at all convincing br br the two child performers are creepy and also bear no relation to the village as it was then br br speaking as a native of <UNK> village i find the setting <UNK> generic and phony not that i was around for a couple generations but my relatives were there in <UNK> it isn't funny it isn't remotely authentic we don't care about the characters br br so many movies were made about the struggling masses vs the <UNK> at this time and done with <UNK> easy living comes to mind it didn't take place in the village but it rings very true this rings with a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is black and white distorted images it looks like it could have come from the <UNK> century however the sound is crystal clear minus the sync and the addition of calm nature sounds br br this movie was very critical of the struggles of life it shows a single mother and child in a violent world that <UNK> on the innocent the mother is very oblivious to her surroundings this leads to lots of torture pain and death you may watch it many times and see different <UNK> plot devices and basically what does it mean br br if you appreciate art in movies then you will love it otherwise don't bother
<START> one of the greatest movies to come out of the 80's dirty dancing was a low budget film with high budget returns with a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance to a love story that all of us wish we could live at least if you're female this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again br br the music which is what drives the movie is upbeat and flows well with the emotions which are drawn from the viewer from classic <UNK> hits like love man by <UNK> <UNK> and big girls don't cry by frankie <UNK> to pure <UNK> hits like eric hungry eyes and frank <UNK> dirty dancing is a mix of fun and sensual showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teenager into a <UNK> <UNK> all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and wish turned into more br br the dancing in dirty dancing is not to be forgotten <UNK> <UNK> shines in her role as penny a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and <UNK> <UNK> patrick <UNK> does more than a fantastic job and shows off more and more of his skills not just as an actor but dancer and singer as well and jennifer grey shines as baby while her transformation in dancing portrays her transformation in status as well br br all in all dirty dancing is one of the best movies of all time and well worth watching at least once it's <UNK> that the first beats of the be my baby in the opening title won't <UNK> your attention and draw you in to a magical world of sensual dance and musical <UNK>
<START> i want to believe all new horror films coming out of japan these days are edgy and make for enjoyable watching br br spider forest is neither br br it is seldom that i finish watching something and end up off for the waste of time but spider forest was an exception in this regard i was very off the makers of the film succeeded on one level throughout the film i could not stop because i wanted to see the answer to the mystery <UNK> by the storyline i could not stop watching that's why i was so angry when the film finished they dragged me all the way through 2 hours of tedium for this warning spider forest is another one of those japanese ghost stories though you don't realize that going in br br i never want to see a japanese ghost story again they're phony and contrived it's a ghost story has become like a big <UNK> under which to <UNK> any and all plot holes you have in your story telling
<START> the name of bad <UNK> greatest hits album is called 10 from 6 you could have just turned up this album and cut the sound on this movie most of the songs played in the movie were from this album i guess <UNK> during the 1970s were probably tired of all the period pieces made then about the 1930s and 1940s that's how i feel about movies made about the 1970s the characters in the movie looked like they were <UNK> for danny why is it that movies have to <UNK> the 1970s the only good period piece i liked was freaks and <UNK> they cut that television show it was exactly like things were in high school when i was there back circa 1980 i was old enough to remember the 70s and no small town was like this it was totally youth dominated there were no <UNK> talking about the hippies and about the inner city of <UNK> that was more the 70s that i remember as a kid this movie was very dull and cheesy at times i was falling asleep i don't know why an actor who was acting during the 70s appeared in this one he was probably trying to lend it some credibility walken didn't even show up until the second half i guess the only true thing about the movie was the baby <UNK> were are a spoiled lot all the kids in the movie were spoiled <UNK> i don't know what they had against their father
<START> i really enjoyed this movie i have a real sense of justice and <UNK> eye for an <UNK> and this movie delivers that in <UNK> glenn ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the big <UNK> in the valley then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot <UNK> help him make up his mind about when the ranch hand dies and the sheriff refuses to do anything ford seems at first reluctant to do anything his men to not take things into their own hands but that's just what he is about to do i knew this movie was about to catch fire when he went into the saloon and faced the guy richard <UNK> one of my very favorite bad guy character actors who had killed his ranch hand after a gentle exchange of dialog with him glenn ford <UNK> his face and shoots him dead kind of a neat added bit of justice he kills this guy with the gun that had <UNK> to his murdered <UNK> in short order we're treated to ford letting his ranch be burned so his men are justified in <UNK> the crew from the other ranch then ford and his men <UNK> all the horses and cattle of the big bad guy's ranch then they show up and burn the and the big fancy house to the ground talk about getting even big time lots of action in this movie there's more to the story than this but i'll just recommend you watch the movie glenn ford was someone who showed time and again what can happen when you <UNK> someone and i really enjoyed watching him get justice the old fashioned way
<START> about as hilarious as 50s british comedy can get the <UNK> of st has almost a gag a minute and at <UNK> minutes makes for a terrific time other films i equally recommend of the same period are the <UNK> <UNK> and the green man in fact any film with <UNK> <UNK> or terry thomas george cole richard or <UNK> or any combination is a delight in st we get a double dose of <UNK> playing two roles with that hilarious disdain he constantly lets <UNK> across his face <UNK> as ruby gates oh dear that name plays her hockey <UNK> <UNK> to hilarious perfection possibly the best laughs come from george cole as flash harry who comes out of a bush when <UNK> at and various visits to <UNK> by ms <UNK> <UNK> to explosions <UNK> poor betty or science lab <UNK> production just send a few <UNK> of that up to my room ' every part of the film is funny from the characters their costumes the antics and the setting there were sequels but the first three are the best including this one blue murder at st and later in color the great st train robbery
<START> warning this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids br br the artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter unfortunately in so many ways this guy was also a jerk in so many ways some of this was the artistic <UNK> and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art but other times he was simply a drunk jerk especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist late in the film his being annoying <UNK> and needlessly cruel seemed to have <UNK> while all this didn't make him a particularly nice man it is important to capture on film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist br br i really found the movie fascinating and loved how the artists actual works were shown throughout the movie like in lust for life i really wish i could show this to my students i teach at a school for the arts but can't because there is just too much adult material yes there is nudity but even more <UNK> for any audience particularly younger ones is when he hmmm i don't think imdb will even let me describe what occurred but it was very graphic and involves <UNK> <UNK> not only a nasty and disgusting scene that did not need to be seen but a reason to keep junior from watching this otherwise wonderful film it's a real shame
<START> i think this was the most outstanding edge of your seat thriller that i have seen in a long time the research for the film was <UNK> the writer kelly sane has left no loose ends the cast was seasoned fantastic performances all round omar was outstanding br br the cinematography is poetic music enchanting and the overall effect highly satisfying br br rendition goes into territory that even the media fears to <UNK> it is really a <UNK> call for those involved with espionage and the legal web that is the war on terror br br a woman walked out of the theater and asked me does this really happen that in itself speaks of <UNK> <UNK> masterful achievement
<START> the plot is very basic but acceptable a young us soldier having studied asian martial arts puts this to good use in <UNK> of the <UNK> daughter and falls in love with her unfortunately the three main acting <UNK> soldier girl rebels combined iq amounts to 3 one point for the soldier one for the girl a large number of ninja fighters have to share the third point among them to be able to lose against the former two
<START> what symbolism <UNK> a woman as we <UNK> the theater after viewing the polish brother's <UNK> to <UNK> bergman some symbolism is there all right but not much <UNK> adds up to some fine acting <UNK> by dreary cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a muddled story that <UNK> rather than <UNK> br br <UNK> is a town facing <UNK> after a new <UNK> goes into operation it's the early to middle 1950s and a squad of <UNK> dressed state agents all looking as if they had just answered a casting call for the <UNK> have the job of <UNK> <UNK> who fail to appreciate both their immediate peril as well as the <UNK> bounty for moving an exciting anti development movie is always a possibility but let's get real rural is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and a <UNK> economy in american history can be built without forced <UNK> not in this country br br but this film is less about the plight of <UNK> than it is a <UNK> creation of a dying young boy's <UNK> imagination nick nolte is the priest who tends to the <UNK> and much of what he says might have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear br br <UNK> between the black suited <UNK> agents working for land when the <UNK> creates that valuable and a <UNK> collection of <UNK> the film develops neither theme <UNK> or even interestingly br br the cinematography is poor a washed out subdued and <UNK> color <UNK> the whole film to little dramatic purpose there is no reason for this vast <UNK> to be depicted so <UNK> indeed a contrast between largely <UNK> natural beauty and the massive and grim <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> and power plants would have been very effective br br 4 10
<START> charlie's <UNK> war demonstrates with <UNK> <UNK> just how <UNK> wars can be especially to the very people who spend countless hours and <UNK> to <UNK> them <UNK> performances and remarkably memorable characters teamed with a <UNK> sarcastic script <UNK> the film <UNK> by the continuously unpredictable mike <UNK> to the top of the year's best politics has never been so much fun br br charlie wilson tom hanks is a texas <UNK> who is credited with almost single <UNK> winning the cold war hanging around plenty of drugs women and <UNK> he also takes an unexpected interest in the events in afghanistan and the <UNK> of the soviet union in the 1980s <UNK> the help of <UNK> philip seymour hoffman a <UNK> cia <UNK> mission expert and <UNK> julia roberts a wealthy <UNK> he raises money to provide afghanistan with the rocket <UNK> and <UNK> they need to cause serious damage to russian military eventually by the end of the 80s the cold war would come to an end and the <UNK> would immediately be cut thereby <UNK> all help for the <UNK> country to <UNK> and <UNK> br br the acting is exquisite although it's to be expected from the more than accomplished cast a large part of that however should be attributed to the script which allows each character to be undeniably well developed and memorable and a <UNK> helping of that credit goes to the novel of the same name which is hilariously honest tom hanks delivers yet another <UNK> performance as charlie wilson the man who did so much for so many and yet still remains relatively unknown philip seymour hoffman plays <UNK> a character that is vividly <UNK> in both his <UNK> and his <UNK> cynicism the <UNK> hoffman once again shows superb range in the characters he portrays julia roberts is perhaps the only weak link of the film with her generic <UNK> character and not subtle enough accent and then there's <UNK> squad of young <UNK> that <UNK> about to keep him happy led by the always delightful amy adams each supporting role has its moments br br <UNK> the soviet union was not an easy task especially considering the many <UNK> goals between the various political leaders why is <UNK> saying one thing and doing nothing <UNK> a disgruntled politician tradition mostly returns wilson everyone appears to want the cold war to end yet a blind eye is being turned to the atrocities taking place in afghanistan it takes a trip to the war torn <UNK> camps in <UNK> to <UNK> wilson as well as with his main financial source doc long ned beatty wilson uses <UNK> ties with <UNK> to raise funding of <UNK> in afghanistan from 5 million to 10 million with a simple command but the president of <UNK> <UNK> at the idea of winning a war for such a trivial amount by the end of the wilson campaign 1 billion is sent to the <UNK> to shoot down russian <UNK> the first step toward victory as wilson predicted beyond the scope of the film the <UNK> turmoil in afghanistan led to further less problems which wilson presumably br br during the course of charlie <UNK> war the main characters travel from the united states to <UNK> to afghanistan to <UNK> to egypt but wherever they go sarcasm always follows there's a surprising amount of comedy in the film considering the political undertones are generally serious hoffman provides jokes with almost every exchange of dialogue as does hanks with his naturally witty woman chasing ideals a scene early on featuring <UNK> being continually <UNK> in out of <UNK> office as he tries to <UNK> out a legal issue with his <UNK> of gorgeous <UNK> you can teach 'em to type but you can't teach 'em to grow tits reminds me of a slapstick routine from the marx brothers br br with the press focusing on the drug <UNK> against wilson instead of the important issues of the cold war and the <UNK> desire of officials to budget their help it's clear that by the end of the film the politicians are still oblivious to what's really necessary and since the screenplay is so quick witted and <UNK> some audience members may not be able to keep up with all of the dialogue <UNK> events but as demonstrated by the politicians who are ignorant as to the difference between <UNK> and afghanistan it's essentially another argument to support charlie <UNK> point br br mike
<START> horrible all i can say is that is movie was horrible i came to watch this movie half expecting some good acting all i got was a horrible movie this movie deserved to stay on the cutting room floor i do not recommend this movie to anybody i have seen better by the actors
<START> my friends and i rented this movie <UNK> it for another one about <UNK> <UNK> steve <UNK> as an action hero is hilarious the movie is so incredibly predictable and over the top that it ended up being a laugh fest even though i gave it a 1 10 this movie should be seen especially if u manage to catch it on tv anywhere
<START> i can't praise this film enough it had a lot of that hand held first person shaking camera which i love and some hate because it makes them sick like <UNK> <UNK> and blair witch project br br it is a long movie for its kind but i didn't even notice because the film was so interesting by just showing the footage from a <UNK> <UNK> work the movie keeps up the pace making it a real time experience for the viewer br br while i would never call this film the scariest horror ever made i'd have to say it's certainly one of the best i've seen the fear factor here is constructed by details in the images camera <UNK> events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie the horror is more in what is not shown but left to our <UNK> the ending is perfect and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards a second viewing is highly recommended though br br watch this one alone in the dark don't expect anything and you'll have fun
<START> at times the mainstream news media seems to be driven by a bunch of no brain <UNK> in that they just listen to each other and report what others report br br this documentary shows what can be found if some more effort is put into the task of <UNK> about something br br true <UNK> should be about providing the people with different perspectives on things that happen so that they have a fair chance of creating an own opinion br br this documentary together with mainstream media reports will help you with this at least for me it provided a lot of relevant information regarding the purpose motivation behind the nowadays frequent world wide <UNK> at different political
<START> i was lucky enough to watch this film in the recently <UNK> international film festival here i was actually able to watch another south korean film the power of <UNK> <UNK> but christmas in august caught my attention more the story is simple enough the usual boy meets girl or shall we say girl meets boy what made it special for me was how it was rendered we can say that the movie was quiet and endearing we don't have flashy and contrived romance here only two ordinary beings made wonderful by their friendship and <UNK> love for one another i also loved how the movie used pictures as expressions of relationships past and present i wished that this was shown here as a regular film i'm sure it would call out to a bigger audience
<START> wow where to start br br this adaptation of sarah <UNK> third novel is one of my all time favorite movies br br i'm not to big on fiction novels seriously i never read fiction but the book is just as fabulous as the film or should i say the film is just as fabulous as the book i just love this story br br anyway i put off watching this three hour long film 2 part series on dvd 3 part series on tv book for about a year and half it simply did not look that interesting boy was i so wrong br br i became immediately immersed into the rich and suspenseful plot utterly enthralled just like the book you cannot stop watching reading it <UNK> your attention for the entire 3 hours and when it does end you wish it hadn't br br the story just flows so beautifully and you'll be wondering where the time went br br the lesbian subplot was just <UNK> on the cake the parts i love most are the subtle facial expressions and <UNK> eye contact between the two characters you really feel their desire for one another and yet they cannot act upon it until they must br br may i point out that the lesbian theme is an important part of the film obviously at the heart of the film is a genuine unexpected love story but it is most certainly not what the whole movie is about for me that's what makes this story so unique and intriguing i've never read or heard of anything like it sarah waters is pure genius br br the twists and turns it takes leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat seriously my hands were on to my couch with every surprising plot twist and i even <UNK> out several times oh my god no way that did not just happen did it i never do that br br the only negative thing i have to say about this film is that i wish they'd added more from the book but obviously having the adaptation be <UNK> by time they couldn't add everything that i would've liked how awful it is though i think i'm just being brutally selfish now forgive me br br the last 20 minutes does seem a little rushed however they put all the important bits in where even if you only watch the film and choose not to read the book you will be most satisfied with the outcome br br the actors are just superb brilliant even sally <UNK> sue and <UNK> cassidy <UNK> have such great on screen chemistry they steam up your television set simply electric the emotions the desperation the struggle each of them feel is expressed seemingly <UNK> by these wonderfully talented actresses rupert evans plays such a good bad guy as gentleman i found myself <UNK> every time he came on screen but loving it because he's just so damn cute and somehow still charming even though you want to <UNK> his neck <UNK> <UNK> gives yet another fantastic performance as mrs she's such a <UNK> actress you cannot help but love her even when the character she's playing isn't as delightful everyone else in the cast were perfect they really represented the characters well and were just as i imagined them to be after reading the book br br this is a must see for any film buff actually anyone and everyone should see this movie and read the book chances are you won't be disappointed br br 10 10 stars from me there are only four other films i have given that same rating too its very rare for me to actually enjoy a film so much that i give it 10 10 this is one of those films is truly a masterpiece
<START> the spirit of st louis is billy <UNK> film tribute to one of the best figures in <UNK> history remembered for the first <UNK> solo flight across the atlantic ocean in may <UNK> with james stewart a little too old for the part playing charles <UNK> br br as a tribute it is <UNK> enough and although a few nice liberties may have been taken with historical fact the motion picture describing the detailed odyssey before and after the paris flight on may 20 21 in the spirit of st louis br br although the lengthy internal monologue employed during the journey may be disappointing to an audience the truth is that it helps keep the picture focused tightly on its essential point stewart <UNK> the portrait of one of the greatest <UNK> in the air the world has ever know <UNK> in a highly <UNK> single engine from long island new york to paris france br br no action is depicted in the trip only some flashbacks to break up the <UNK> of the long flight but there is superb determination of the ordeal of a brave and talented pilot decided to fly alone his <UNK> is simple less weight one engine one pilot would increase fuel <UNK> and allow for a longer flying range but with so much risk claim to fame was doing something that many had tried and failed br br even though wilder has <UNK> put it upon the screen in a calm <UNK> fashion it comes out as biography of intense restraint and power but it is james stewart's performance controlled to the last detail that gives life and strong heroic stature to the principal figure in the film br br from it there emerges an awareness of a clever firm but truly humble man who <UNK> a task with resolution plans as much about it as he can makes his decisions with courageous <UNK> and then <UNK> with only one thought in mind to get to paris in his efforts to cut off the <UNK> weight any item considered too heavy or unnecessary was left behind br br the record setting flight proved not only to be a fight with the elements and a test of <UNK> but also a long battle against <UNK> a busy schedule and an active mind kept <UNK> up all of the previous night still he managed to stay conscious enough to keep the from crashing and landed at le near paris 33 hours and 30 minutes after leaving new york br br stewart gives an able portrait of a brave pilot who <UNK> legendary status <UNK> the intention and <UNK> resolution to fly <UNK> 5 <UNK> 3 miles across the atlantic br br photographed in <UNK> and <UNK> and backed by <UNK> <UNK> beautiful music the film effectively captures the <UNK> spirit of the era and the hero's ultimate achievement since he takes off that day from <UNK> wet field and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the end of the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> love and death command the <UNK> of life by the end of 19th century in a remote japanese village a young man and a married woman older than he fall in love with each other and decide to kill her husband to be free to enjoy their love but they never enjoy that freedom since <UNK> begins to haunt them beginning as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple the woman of course <UNK> in an atmosphere where dream nightmare mixes up with reality the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman but then also to the man it also <UNK> the dreams of the other villagers creating a climate of suspicion and <UNK> around the couple which is <UNK> by the arrival of a police officer that comes to investigate the disappearance of the murdered husband but which makes this movie more interesting besides this almost common story of adultery is the evolution of the <UNK> feelings in a shakespearean deep psychological and dramatic development of <UNK> anguish and fear which turns their love relationship into a nightmare until their final doom the <UNK> so dear to japanese theatre or movie acting is also present in the <UNK> performances but not in an exaggerated form just only in the necessary measure to show more effectively the most deep feelings of the depicted characters this is indeed a solid good movie
<START> i absolutely loved this series and was very sad to see it go yes it's christian based and <UNK> as well it deals with some tough issues as the other reviewer points out but i guess it depends on your viewpoint on these matters and as a teenager growing up and now as a mother myself i was so happy to see a tv series that was clean and well quite frankly wonderful i unlike the other reviewer was <UNK> to see how they dealt with the <UNK> deal instead of hearing the typical <UNK> about <UNK> they showed the son actually working at being <UNK> and <UNK> it to his later relationships which were pure and <UNK> because of it and a lot <UNK> because of it 100 br br after watching this entire series you become extremely attached to all the characters in the family and outside the family once they settle down more <UNK> and the moral values they teach in each episode are just priceless i found touched by an angel made by the same producer to be cheesy here and there although overall i liked it but this series in my opinion was a lot better made and had better acting and was more interesting as well it was good for the entire family and was interesting for the entire family which was a huge plus the family wasn't outstanding they had their own faults but in the long run they did what was right and you saw them grow and change and struggle like any true family does it was my favorite show at the time and will always be near the top of my list i hope it comes out on dvd
<START> people don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time the same type of people that see a movie with <UNK> top on the cover surfing through a <UNK> office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations is <UNK> top funny of course not was this movie anything special of course not it was a dumb movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about mr top movies like this or <UNK> or killer <UNK> from outer space and pretty much any movie <UNK> shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously and because of this they really shouldn't be considered some of the worst movies ever made you watch them either expecting a dumb movie that's hilariously bad or you are like six years old and genuinely think <UNK> top is hilarious br br please people if you ready know <UNK> top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review don't watch this picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> squad is at a very low point with its confusing plot line and horrible acting br br first let's tackle the characters <UNK> brooke continues to hold an outrageous <UNK> anger throughout the entire film which is due to her overwhelming passion to become prom queen however it becomes completely unknown to the audience why <UNK> wants to become prom queen in the first place before the nominations are even read off she <UNK> around the school with a constant <UNK> upon being there and shows no interest in the place or its students to begin with why does she care so much to be their prom queen brooke apparently presents an acclaimed performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry face <UNK> around killing people maybe it's just me but i think if you handed any young actor actress a script that only requires him her to act insanely angry you're not asking for much you're also not allowing the character to develop very well br br <UNK> character played by jennifer is even worse shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her character whatsoever when being <UNK> by her principal she knocks him down after several seconds with no feelings of disgust or shock or anything equally <UNK> her lines are read like she is reading trivia off the back of a <UNK> box br br throughout the rest of the film the students in charge of his kidnapping sound more like they are planning a <UNK> than deciding what they will do with their principal sitting tied up in their basement br br meanwhile <UNK> is off killing several female prom queen candidates and no one even notices or cares yeah i get it i get it the whole town is worried about prom very realistic at least you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops but that might be asking too much for example right after <UNK> drives by the school and shoots down a handful of students beth is found being interviewed by the local media the reporter mentions the <UNK> in a way that makes it seem like no one knows who killed these innocent students but then one second later asks what do you think about guns in the hands of <UNK> or something to that effect where did the reporter jump to such conclusions br br at the end of the movie after <UNK> kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over with the media showing up again beth simply adds that she understands need to be heard and walks away with her friends smoking <UNK> in a calm <UNK> mood no one is even <UNK> by the fact that they just witnessed a murder br br not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town julie living in a large house with no parents present and the bizarre party at her house maybe i'm a little left out of the scene but last time i knew high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for <UNK> and everyone <UNK> in their i'm so indie and <UNK> attitudes <UNK> <UNK> horrible acting with her mother acting over the top and her father simply <UNK> at everything the mother has to say and not in an entertaining way either along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after <UNK> as she tries to shoot her with a gun yes very realistic br br the only compliment i can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful the angles are <UNK> and the screen is very clear and crisp with each shot br br too bad the acting and script aren't
<START> i really don't know why i'm this i think most people agree that this movie is bad well let me say this br br when i first get done watching some movies i like them then as time goes on my opinion changes about the movie this happened with end of days i liked it the first time i saw it i thought it was entertaining but a few weeks later my opinion has changed so to resolve this i watched it again at a friends house well it's bad br br i'm a logic person if i see a logic hole in a movie i try to ignore it if i see two then i start to get annoyed more than two and i'm p ed off end of days made me p ed off after my second viewing br br first off the movie is a bit depressing everything about it is sad everything from <UNK> acting to the movie's colors but dark looking movies don't bother me but some thing else did br br if satan can <UNK> his wounds how can you possible kill him in his mortal form if you shoot him his skin grows back if you cut off his head a new one should pop back up so question what's the point of even trying to kill him i'll tell you why because this is a stupid movie that has a recycled villain this isn't the devil my friends this is a human being of those bond villains who give away there entire scheme to the hero br br like i said it's worth a look but don't see it twice because it's crap
<START> this movie is filled with so many idiotic moments that you wonder how it ever got made for example they get into the <UNK> from the <UNK> and while they're in the <UNK> you can see signs pointing to various government buildings and then they come up in the middle of the street i highly doubt that government buildings would provide public access through the city <UNK> system anyways i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 just because of its comic value i laughed the whole way through at the idiocy of everyone involved in this movie
<START> ten years before the matrix and hot on the <UNK> of they live came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making if you like bizarre unconventional intellectually challenging david lynch meets john carpenter style movie making you'll love split there are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards the plot involves a man named who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream similar to they live 1984 and the matrix it is based on the premise that we are all constantly <UNK> by shadowy big brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot <UNK> constantly <UNK> the city this is all revealed pretty early on in the plot possible spoiler has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with his <UNK> budget the other highlights of this film are the monologues i challenge anyone to not be <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the classic quotes from this movie for years to come
<START> i really couldn't get into this movie the plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so long that he is <UNK> she dies and he is left in the basement to <UNK> months must pass and a family moves in the daughter is blind because of an accident caused by the father well anyway this guy in the basement who for all rights should be long dead is still around he eats a cat and now is <UNK> he now wants to eat people and have sex and when a hooker dies father gets the blame i always dislike movies where someone else is blamed for the killings because you always here the typical lines i didn't do it i could never do such a thing blah blah blah and the family storyline could be a lifetime movie storyline
<START> i rented this pile of <UNK> waste hoping for a few good laughs with a title like zombie <UNK> from and with dead alive productions <UNK> on the front cover you would think that this could be a funny gruesome film but no this is the worst movie i have ever seen and yes i have seen all of the police academy movies the story this is a joke within itself and the dialogue are atrocious the make up of the so called zombies looks like they used one of those two dollar make yourself look like a <UNK> <UNK> that you buy at k mart br br i would rather watch beverly hills <UNK> while listening to the <UNK> boys and be whipped by a novelty birthday card model than to sit through another single minute of this pathetic excuse for a dvd honestly i could make a better movie with 3 some <UNK> sticks and a <UNK> i feel as if 90 minutes of my life were stripped away from me and taken to the land of i know that <UNK> on the dead alive production doesn't guarantee a great flick but you do expect to get your <UNK> worth br br the only thing that made me happy save returning the horrid mass of elephant <UNK> was that it wasn't titled biker zombies from i feel for detroit folks that wasted their hard earned money on this one unless you have been <UNK> ¬Ö do not buy rent if you must ¬Ö but ¬Ö you will regret it
<START> it's a short movie for such immense feelings the last 20 or so minutes are among the most intense in the recent years of the industry huston john is dying and only love can make the difference the actor's work in the long evening scene is absolutely marvellous
<START> okay i just had to sound off on this one like a tremendous mental <UNK> i've just sat through this film in its entirety br br you'll note that the trivia section of imdb points out that portions of the raising of the <UNK> were borrowed from airport 1977 this really doesn't scratch the surface virtually all exterior shots of the plane <UNK> the ocean landing in sinking and even the at rest shots are borrowed from airport <UNK> all of the raising shots are pulled from <UNK> including most of the interior <UNK> clips with the exception of dennis <UNK> drowning i couldn't help but wonder if olivia <UNK> might come floating by at any moment or maybe a dead tom sullivan another eye roller dennis <UNK> name in this film is stevens which is to compensate for the fact that airport plane is owned by the stevens corporation headed by <UNK> stewart of course br br this is a <UNK> of actors who don't work much or at least haven't worked in a while which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinker br br i've rated this film a 2 it's quite worthy of a 1 but if this film can't offer any other redeeming quality at least somebody helped <UNK> max <UNK> <UNK> and dennis weaver make their car <UNK> that month
<START> jessica is a young <UNK> and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch jessica is also a powerful psychic capable of retro <UNK> and <UNK> when young and handsome gordon <UNK> comes to visit he is instantly skeptical of <UNK> powers until her skills <UNK> a lost <UNK> and <UNK> an ancient treasure chest however the treasure chest holds the severed head of a centuries dead <UNK> named <UNK> drew whose powers are far stronger than <UNK> despite her <UNK> of the evil in their midst drew manages to mentally <UNK> everyone unfortunate to make eye contact with him but drew wants jessica most of all he needs her skills to <UNK> his body so that he can rise from the dead and rule over the human race will <UNK> powerful de <UNK> combined with <UNK> love ward the ancient evil off before it can destroy them all br br this isn't a very interesting movie it certainly could have been the basic story is interesting and imaginative but the acting is <UNK> and the whole thing moves much too slowly to hold interest jessica is also too innocent almost annoyingly so and gordon her love interest is wooden stiff and totally <UNK> none of the characters are very likable and the low budget is painfully obvious a rushed ending also doesn't help matters avoid unless it's the mst3k version
<START> the 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful film it is based on an absolutely charming book by charles kingsley it has a truly talented cast from the likes of james mason bernard and david not to mention the vocal talents of david jason and jon pertwee there is also lionel <UNK> the director of wonderful classics such as the <UNK> children and the amazing mr and while the film is good on the most part it was also a little disappointing i had no problem with the performances particularly those of mason and as and sir john harriet respectively and tommy and samantha gates are believable as tom and <UNK> the voice cast is also commendable especially jon pertwee <UNK> charming characters in their own right i also liked the incidental music it is so haunting and beautiful and the script was fairly faithful and in general well written particularly at the beginning the characters especially the water babies are very charming and the villains are sinister and funny at the same time i loved the part when tom and his friends help the water babies escape seeing the shark chasing the electric <UNK> with an axe was very funny however i will say the film does look dated especially the animation sequences the live action parts weren't so bad if you forgive the rather dark camera work the character animation was rather flat and the backgrounds sometimes were a little dull though there were some nice moments like the scene with the and of course the first meeting with the water babies i also had mixed feelings about the songs the water song was beautiful but i found the first song forgettable when tom ends up underwater hi is an example of a song that is like <UNK> you either love it or hate it i personally don't know what to make of this song it was fun to listen to at first but once it's in your head it is perhaps annoying as much as i like lionel <UNK> and his films his direction just lacked the wonder and the magic it usually does all in all certainly not a terrible film but could have been better artistically 7 10 <UNK> cox
<START> whether you're a fan of the series which inspired it or not there's no denying this is a <UNK> piece of work but in the best possible sense keen to get away from the <UNK> of old sitcoms which made an uneasy transition to the big screen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> have gone down a different road addressing the problems of dealing with their success along with adding other creations and inevitably <UNK> some of their best loved characters it's a pity they didn't stick to just a more consistent league of <UNK> movie because as inventive as including themselves in the screenplay is it <UNK> the finished movie well worth renting though
<START> for comedy to work there are many factors involved br br 1 don't be afraid to take risks 2 if anyone or anything deserves to be <UNK> fun at do it and continue to do it br br but most of all br br 3 be funny br br the war on everything succeeds in all those three things in fact the show proved to be so popular and so funny that already only months after it's first episode a dvd of the first season was released i picked it up within days of it being released and hit the floor laughing and had so many fu ing tears in my eyes it's that well good br br in short and to save me <UNK> on about the show watch it buy it it whatever will make you watch the fu ing best show in the world br br go the <UNK>
<START> this film is one of the classics of cinema history it was not made to please modern audiences so some people nowadays may think it is <UNK> or stilted i found it to be absorbing throughout has exactly the right presence to play alexander just as he did when he played <UNK> <UNK> the terrible several years later the music was beautiful br br my one complaint was the poor soundtrack that was quite <UNK> although i only know a little russian it would have been nice to be able to pick out more words rather than having to rely almost 100 on the subtitles i was watching this on an old <UNK> from the library though perhaps by now a dvd version exists on which the sound has been enhanced i would like to know whether the actors were using <UNK> russian or even old church when they were speaking the subtitles were strangely <UNK> and it's hard for me to tell whether this was to reflect an older manner of speaking or whether the subtitles were just somewhat poorly done
<START> the problem i have as a <UNK> is that most of the actors in this movie are in every <UNK> movie i have a feeling that <UNK> has only like five actors i think that if you're not from <UNK> you really like this movie as a refreshing novelty br br this movie is about a dreadful chain of events that affects a few people quite <UNK> alcoholism cold climate and darkness may all be clich√©s but they're still very real in todays <UNK> society a lot of people in <UNK> have depression especially during winter br br the tone of the movie is very <UNK> i enjoyed it and directing was again very solid i liked this movie a lot only negative thing is that you see the same faces that you've seen over and over again
<START> we really liked this movie it wasn't trying to be outrageous controversial clever or profound it was just entertaining and was what it said on the box a charming romantic comedy every other brit film maker seems to want to change the world nice to see one that just concentrates on telling a good yarn with elegant style
<START> slasher movies started may be 30 to 35 years before this movie but believe me this one among those pearl that will stay longer after you turned of tv set especially if you are a person easily scared this is the movie for you for which you wouldn't have stomach to take it full even after so many years the movie hasn't lost its charm and thrill br br no blood no gore but the thrill will for sure chill your spine out the movie starts with the bang and it stay with the same pace till its end <UNK> is nerve cracking and i remember this was the one copied in many indian movies those days kings favorite no wonder why thats the only reason i wanted to see this and it didn't let me down don't turn off the lights <UNK> you wont find <UNK> but may be a smiling doll sitting right behind you beware not for the <UNK> hearted br br two <UNK> up and i am going with 8 out of 10 which is pretty low but still i <UNK> my ratings for dramas
<START> this movie is certainly worth a watch it's full of action it's also humorous you'll laugh until your stomach hurts if you watch this movie this movie also includes lots of hi tech things hence the name gen y i recommend you to watch the prequel of this movie which is gen x
<START> it beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly it is no understatement to call it far fetched how the guy managed in such a short space of time to <UNK> a wooden <UNK> of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since jesus the <UNK> sheriff played by <UNK> <UNK> looked like a <UNK> from the jerry springer show and i found the blonde female lead jennifer jason leigh rather plain we have an expression here in the u k done up as which suits her perfectly it wasn't all bad however i enjoyed it immensely when the end credits rolled and 'the <UNK> came up was quite brilliant for this <UNK> <UNK> of a t v movie which if it had been a cinematic release would have been put on video and in <UNK> stores in no time at all
<START> i don't usually like to comment on the acting in a movie because it is the one thing that people who have agenda against a film will go after in this movie i will make an exception the acting in this film are below average all around i mean halfway into the film i wonder how the hell did the producer and or the director gets around casting such an ensemble of people who can't act even though the production value was good the ill written story just <UNK> on top of the bad performance of the actors and there is even a half hearted attempts to a twist to the ending of the movie which ends up quite confusing is all the spanish horror films this disappointing
<START> it's a good watch if u have time deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight and get into serious trouble they find themselves fighting some shadowy people and can't deal with very very disturbing portrayal of japan the <UNK> of modern life some intense scenes but a bit of a <UNK> br br the spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on english sub titles obviously i don't know japanese br br the only other japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa who is a different and far <UNK> than this modern genre so can't really compare otherwise it <UNK> better with most hollywood blockbusters for story plot and <UNK> br br
<START> spoilers the third and mercifully last of the aztec mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star besides the mummy actor <UNK> gay as dr <UNK> was <UNK> down by the <UNK> husband of a woman he was having an affair with on may 28 1960 still that didn't stop gay in him being edited into them from his previous films from being in a number of future mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death br br in robot vs the aztec mummy we have the once again mad scientist dr trying to get his hands on the <UNK> golden and <UNK> in order by having them <UNK> to find the treasure that's been secretly buried somewhere in modern mexico city over 500 years ago robot vs the aztec mummy is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous aztec mummy films that take up over half of the films running time br br after getting introduced to the movie's cast members some who have been killed in the previous aztec mummy films we get down to the real <UNK> gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane dr also know as the bat dr who looks like a wild eyed and crazed orson wells is a man with <UNK> visions of <UNK> in him not only <UNK> the long lost aztec treasure but now unlike in the two previous movies he was in creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world an idea he must have gotten from watching ed <UNK> 1955 atomic superman classic bride of the monster br br unable to handle the mummy in his two other encounters with it where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly dr had created a robot with a human <UNK> stuffed in it to the job of doing in the mummy for him with he mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local mexico city cemetery dr has his robot man <UNK> into the <UNK> crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its <UNK> of deadly radiation br br spoilers the big built up to the aztec mummy robot man confrontation turns to be a big let down with the mummy having no trouble at all <UNK> the tin man in less then 30 seconds together with its creator dr all this while both dr and his friend and assistant who came to the <UNK> aid have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action now without the mad and off the wall dr annoying it the mummy can go back to its eternal <UNK> place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large like dr that it has really no interest in
<START> i have seen quite a few action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever there are very few films which i even consider watching several times and this is one of them everything in this movie is just right clint as the superb leading actor <UNK> russo as his non stupid female partner this is a very rare combination sad but true of course john deserves a lot of praise for his excellent villain but let us not overlook eastwood s initial buddy played by dylan mcdermott who in my view fits the role perfectly the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic but sadly never released on an original soundtrack cd shame on the producers the plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace the audience is kept in constant excitement of the outcome of the duel between eastwood and i give this one 10 stars
<START> as a big fan of tiny <UNK> adventures i loved this movie it was so funny it really captured how cartoons spent their <UNK>
<START> okay enough every time i think i've seen a film that is so <UNK> so bad in every way that i think that no one could possibly find something to praise i just come to the imdb where i'm <UNK> with the usual inane <UNK> masterpiece great film i mean honestly what movie are you people watching because it's certainly not the mess i just watched on the new fox mgm <UNK> dvd there are about three amusing lines and a plot that gives <UNK> a new meaning and then after ninety three interminable minutes it just stops and the end credits begin then there's another scene the dvd is fairly wretched which suits the film the source material is almost completely faded to an ugly brown it's hard to imagine this film followed get carter the critics and the public got this one right back then it was <UNK> and a box office disaster and rightfully so but you <UNK> keep on trying and i'll keep on trying to find a movie that doesn't have someone who <UNK> about it
<START> there's hell to pay when you cross <UNK> female <UNK> and a dangerous group of thugs including their sadistic head <UNK> and his equally <UNK> lady operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist does just that hell <UNK> no fury like <UNK> and a determined detective seeking revenge for <UNK> his arm after her will do whatever it takes and that includes <UNK> anyone who might know her <UNK> to catch <UNK> <UNK> finds an ally in hooker <UNK> <UNK> who provides her a temporary shelter <UNK> has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during a job and must take care of him in a disturbing revelation regarding incest she also provides his sexual needs she in <UNK> keeps him locked up in a room while working the streets meanwhile <UNK> is targeted by a vile neighbor once she finds a place of her own she works as a <UNK> and he threatens to turn her into the authorities <UNK> was an escaped convict who <UNK> a subway from the cops if she doesn't supply him sexual <UNK> his wife <UNK> a tea <UNK> of <UNK> water all over his face and body resulting in death the prostitution clan come looking for <UNK> to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization that's when <UNK> lee the <UNK> lover and <UNK> realizes that the one responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a former <UNK> of hers <UNK> <UNK> her with an <UNK> <UNK> drug placing her in a bird cage <UNK> <UNK> in her <UNK> what ultimately <UNK> rage is watching a prostitute die outside her cell a victim of a forced late term abortion left to bleed to death finding a <UNK> in her hand from the operation room <UNK> will break free from the cage and prey upon each member of the clan responsible for the <UNK> death the series of <UNK> murders provide with an opportunity to catch <UNK> and he'll trap her in the underground <UNK> below the city but can he catch or kill her especially if <UNK> comes to her aid br br trust me when i say there was no <UNK> <UNK> director <UNK> or his film making team because female prisoner <UNK> beast stable is yet another perverse deranged and ultra violent entry in the very entertaining series <UNK> with fine production values and a visually <UNK> talent for capturing all of the madness in imaginative ways <UNK> pulls you right or he did me into the twisted drama that always exists when <UNK> is on screen when you have a <UNK> opening credits sequence where your anti heroine is fleeing through the crowded city streets with a man's severed arm <UNK> to her the viewer has to know what they're in for the incestuous sub plot is simply bizarre and it's shot in a soft core way with the retarded brother <UNK> his <UNK> cold sister with dead eyes staring ahead and the entire abortion sequence is rather hard to sit through but the abortion angle as disturbing as it is provides motivation for revenge despite <UNK> ways and her criminal nature you would rather see her take these <UNK> out than vice versa interesting angle with detective as well is willing to break the rules and he becomes a force of nature towards anyone who stands in his way of capturing his mortal enemy his fate at the end visiting another enemy of in an isolated cell while she looks on perfectly <UNK> what makes these films so ridiculous yet so entertaining the <UNK> murders is a montage of <UNK> <UNK> in various places the <UNK> <UNK> from flesh with <UNK> leaving the crime scenes very driven to wipe the whole clan out in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances while the film is essentially a comic book adventure there's a sadness that <UNK> and few characters come away without flaws i imagine many will walk away from this <UNK> at how unrealistic female prisoner <UNK> beast stable is specifically how <UNK> is able to escape capture time and time again <UNK> her goals of revenge paying back all those who have <UNK> her but i looked at it as a violent action cartoon much like the later 80's films and enjoyed it for what it was as always this film features some beautiful asian actresses and some colorful <UNK> almost always reserved quiet yet <UNK> staring down her enemies with violent intent is in fine form in more ways than one and lee as her cross eyed <UNK> <UNK> runs away with the picture as a perfectly realized abusive <UNK> worthy of psychological torment when both are in prison ways of torturing her are sweet my favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot but is so wonderfully wrong features a dog discovering <UNK> severed arm walking through a street eventually finding a <UNK> place to chew on it
<START> code <UNK> is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love and in fact will <UNK> you if you try to <UNK> with the wrong person the <UNK> and the have <UNK> live in completely separate <UNK> the powers that be can remove your memories etc we've seen this stuff before but that's ok no movie is 100 original this kind of premise is always fun to contemplate unfortunately just imagining such a future is more interesting than actually watching code <UNK> the characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting maybe that's commentary on a <UNK> future but it's still dull to watch it's <UNK> br br at times the imagery is nice but usually coupled with its <UNK> soundtrack just looks like a <UNK> <UNK> commercial code <UNK> also sometimes uses the kind of television camera work that i find annoying you know two characters talk as the camera <UNK> <UNK> on one side two seconds later it's floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attention br br my friends liked this movie if they tried to get me to watch it again i probably would not do so unless they agreed to pay me 50
<START> there are only a few movies which can be called must <UNK> and is one of those films in many ways it was ahead of it's time and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several better known films copied by many <UNK> by none this truly is one great movie br br the story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity the story takes place in a post apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos <UNK> c thomas <UNK> is a one who <UNK> the <UNK> for various religious leaders by killing off any <UNK> members of the society the whole idea made me think about our society it's really a brilliant social commentary which is more than i can say for certain recent sci fi action blockbusters matrix <UNK> and <UNK> didn't make one feel that any real <UNK> was taking place just dull video game effects but shepherd scores on the action scale too br br not once does this movie let the viewer catch their breath peter <UNK> proves himself to be one of the few genius action directors we're talking 100 high grade down home kung fu fighting it was excellent really good special effects shoot outs bleak futuristic <UNK> punk noir the film really has its own elements br br when talking about shepherd it's impossible not to mention how much style it has the vision of this city is really stunning it recalls images of tim <UNK> very memorable vision of <UNK> in batman and these sights are photographed by <UNK> with a degree of skill that puts gordon willis and conrad hall to shame even the special effects proved amazing <UNK> the scenes where fighting occurs are <UNK> in all of filmmaking this movie is a ballet of awesome visual display br br still at the base of it all there lies an interesting story carried through by a strong cast the acting especially <UNK> <UNK> and the plot are both great and excellently directed in contrast with loads of futuristic films made with a strong artificial flavor the characters are believable and the dialogue is natural and full of wit i'm always proud to see a great film like shepherd come along it's a damn shame that it didn't receive good distribution and made nothing in the box office it's a <UNK> worth searching for this movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times <UNK> for having seen it
<START> this thing it shouldn't be called a film is almost worse than <UNK> but you just have to see it it's hilarious if you see it at video store rent it if you see the <UNK> <UNK> edition yes there is a special edition for under 10 buy it if your friend has it borrow it you just have to see this the acting is so bad and the gore is is so fake after viewing this you'll be asking yourself why did they make this insult of the art of film that's assuming your face doesn't melt off like the in <UNK> if you manage to see this be sure to vote this movie as 1 awful so it can make the bottom 100 it really deserves a spot there i'm surprised it's not number 1 right now
<START> i enjoyed this programme immensely it is exceptionally well written with finely judged performances and clever visuals br br it is also very frank and honest refreshing compared to the <UNK> representation of drug use in films and television br br <UNK> one of the finest television shows of recent years and triumph on all <UNK> for channel 4 br br 9 10
<START> this self important confusing b w film watches like an <UNK> on a very bad acid trip you're dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting <UNK> that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away on its own down the storm drain there's no room for plot when you've got visceral imagery and subtle allegory to me it seems like the director tries to make the next great art movie while begging for intellectual <UNK> i didn't bring my <UNK> either watching this i felt almost insulted since the film does such an effective job of <UNK> itself from you
<START> a <UNK> <UNK> attempt to push to the film going non wrestling fan what could be worse than hogan in the movies bad actors in the wrestling ring and this film produced both as tiny lester made his way to the wwe that summer in the mother of all <UNK> <UNK> see the <UNK> under <UNK> as a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when i came out i immediately checked into h a <UNK> i am proud to say i have been off the hulk for 17 years now and have never had a <UNK> since since this was made to bring in more fans to the <UNK> that was the wwe in hey day one has to wonder if there weren't more fans like me who turned to other past times that did not poison ones mind like this offense to celluloid did such as <UNK> gas or russian <UNK>
<START> richard <UNK> shows off his liberal <UNK> with this <UNK> <UNK> simplistic attack on the politics of south africa it's not as if america is the cradle of racial harmony and <UNK> love and further irony is added by the fact that the movie is set in the city that was the home of rodney king and <UNK> the police department that did so much towards community relations with their brutal racist behaviour so <UNK> salt and pepper pairing who clearly have a late developing teenage crush on one another do their own thing with fine disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and no one <UNK> because the bad guys are white south <UNK> surely a worrying example of police racism in itself inside <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> office the <UNK> is designed and lit to resemble as far as possible the and just in case some rather dumb <UNK> miss the point he and his men are referred to as nazis at regular <UNK> for me the only bright spot in the movie was when mel gibson turned up at an anti apartheid <UNK> carrying a <UNK> bearing the <UNK> end <UNK> now the intensely irritating joe <UNK> is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the <UNK> shoulders by following them around <UNK> <UNK> like a badly trained puppy this would be bearable if there was the <UNK> possibility of him ending up in a <UNK> <UNK> but sadly he survives to <UNK> another day miss <UNK> <UNK> seems in a world of her own perhaps not believing her luck at being cast opposite mel gibson who has little trouble sweeping her into bed in his mobile home which appears to have been washed up on a beach somewhere shortly after their affair they come under fire from a number of <UNK> that fire enough rounds into <UNK> <UNK> to keep the u s army in iraq going for six months fortunately he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause <UNK> just as they are going for seconds and his <UNK> warns them of the <UNK> attack i hope he got a special bone as a reward the film <UNK> without <UNK> from <UNK> dog on a <UNK> ship bound for nazi germany sorry south africa when mel and danny murder so many members of the master race that i lost count despite <UNK> around like bonnie and clyde under the impact of a <UNK> of bullets mel survives <UNK> up in his <UNK> arms like a small child with a wise and <UNK> father take that apartheid
<START> i've seen the previews everywhere before deciding to watch it and what do you know i actually liked it it has a new twist of the 18th century england although the music in the dance scene were obviously <UNK> and also the colors of <UNK> <UNK> although it is pretty it fit quite perfectly br br if you just want a good time you should check this out very different from other 18th century detailed films
<START> <UNK> this movie stinks it's a dull and <UNK> drag that never lets up it's a wonder anyone even bothered to make <UNK> up in his bizarre trademark <UNK> and mustache as he has nothing witty or outrageous to do or say throughout this bore <UNK> must have been so <UNK> that he forgot to use his italian accent br br only <UNK> provides a grin or two and there's precious little of that to go around here anyway figure in a <UNK> hotel manager and another obnoxious co comic in frank <UNK> and the road gets even br br a real misfire
<START> this is a fantastic film the acting is some of the best i've seen is obviously very beautiful and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting the the cinematography was extremely ahead of its time watching it i could see parallels of cinematography used today this is truly a groundbreaking film because of the cinematography and acting the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes it's a very touching and powerful piece my friend told me it was must see and i definitely agree with her this is one of those films that you watch and never forget everyone should see this intensely moving film this should be put on everyone's movies to see before whatever list
<START> my wife and i saw this in the theater when it first came out br br there were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same time br br this is the only movie i have ever walked out on br br it was just painful to sit through br br the theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a <UNK> br br never had that happen before or since do not rent this you will really regret it i am really by the vote summary perhaps personal has something to do with it
<START> i really enjoyed this film i'm not usually one for fairy tales or make believe but this film captured my attention br br i first saw this film on the uk channel hallmark which usually shows <UNK> tacky films but then snow queen came along and i was loving it i really really admire bridget fonda in this movie she plays the snow queen brilliantly and <UNK> br br i won't explain what the story is about as other people have already done so so there is no point repeating br br i would just suggest that if you want to watch a fun fairy tale journey get this film but if you want to purchase it and you live in the uk you might have a hard time i've bought it from south korea brand new english edition of course
<START> when one watches romantic comedies one knows what to expect we've seen enough of them over many many years to know how they go there's a formula one which almost always <UNK> movies that become popular with the <UNK> audience not always in relation to their actual quality how to play around with that and create something more interesting this movie has a suggestion and it works relatively well instead of simply following a lead we follow him <UNK> helping the unfortunate men those who lack the attractive <UNK> that would allow them to reveal the unseen good qualities that they possess to the women they are in love with the plot follows smith as he works on his self <UNK> most difficult such case kevin james alongside his aid of james we also follow <UNK> who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want one particular scene that <UNK> great respect of smith's character is him meeting one such jerk and putting him in his place after seeing smith helping the disaster that is james we see him with <UNK> and in spite of his talent for helping others he <UNK> up badly with her making a marvelous point about love and how falling in love affects us for a romantic comedy this mostly avoids the <UNK> of such at times almost <UNK> on feeling like a spoof of the genre though the last few scenes has the <UNK> and the emotions of this type of films whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review the pace is quite good it never really slows down and seldom moves too fast the acting is great as far as pretty much everyone goes the characters are nicely developed and come off as real people the humor doesn't always work there are occasional gags that are less than fortunately executed and one or two jokes that seem forced however for the most part the film was funny i recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or have been in love those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes 7 10
<START> i decided to watch this show and give it a go but i found it to be boring and more importantly dull dull br br there is far too much sarcasm and the characters are all dull there is far too much talking and the character just keeps talking on and on and on during a second glance felt like <UNK> the characters the banter doesn't work and the whole love and romance thing just ruins what is already a crap show i can't believe this show survived past the pilot this seems to be a show which forces the to your parents' line no actual drama exists br br should have stayed a pilot and a pilot alone
<START> i think this show is awesome i love it and i love <UNK> not in a romantic kind of way but if i was there i would totally support <UNK> like <UNK> did and the other girls yeah i mean if they're why don't you want to fight them back <UNK> is the only who have guts to confront people and say what he thinks not just stay and suck it <UNK> 100 i love <UNK> too because <UNK> like a normal girl who doesn't want to be with <UNK> and bugs and grass everywhere and sleep in a warm bed with servants i mean if you have the chance and the money why wouldn't you do that and <UNK> too <UNK> brought pizza and just like 2 or 3 people said thanks i mean he spend money
<START> this movie was advertised as a comedy but was far more serious than the trailers made it out to be don't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but was expecting more laughs great performances from robin williams and laura <UNK> worth seeing but don't go expecting to be rolling on the floor the movie left me wondering what it would be like if robin williams character was a real person that was running for president would we <UNK> a comedian i doubt it unfortunately that kind of stark honesty is something greatly lacking today this is a movie that i will be adding to my dvd library as soon as it comes out on dvd the movie has heart
<START> this is an unusual film because although it was made by <UNK> century fox because it's one of the few <UNK> of barbara stanwyck and her future husband robert taylor barbara stanwyck had been making films for many different studios rko paramount and <UNK> at about the time she made this is my affair but taylor was an mgm contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was <UNK> to fox something studios occasionally did during this era br br the film is interesting because many real life people have roles in the film though the piece is otherwise pure fiction you'll see actors playing william <UNK> teddy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i can't recall any film with <UNK> or <UNK> in it as a character though i do remember <UNK> from the wind and the lion and a couple other films three cheers for seeing a lesser president in a film as a major character br br the film begins with <UNK> taking a young lieutenant robert taylor aside and asking him to be a special agent for him and telling no one not even the secret service that's because the president fears that someone within the agency is <UNK> off a gang that has been making a long string of <UNK> all based on inside information so it's up to taylor who is not known for his <UNK> roles especially at this stage of his career to pose as a thug and find the gang responsible and the inside man br br however there are two serious complications first while he is able to find the gang members one of the gang <UNK> step sister is stanwyck taylor finds that he's fallen in love with her but he must also do his duty and turn them in to the authorities second because <UNK> is the only other person who knows the truth serious problems develop when <UNK> is <UNK> and taylor is on death row for the crimes br br the film did a nice job of creating a story and placing it within a historical context while today most people don't remember <UNK> nor remember that he was <UNK> the film is set in this interesting time period the acting is pretty decent as the stars are supported by victor mclaglen and brian <UNK> though i must admit that role was pretty tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles overall it's very interesting well written and not too sappy in the romance department a good outing for all
<START> jean claude van <UNK> movie career seems to have gone to hell in a so how ironic to see him playing a character who meets the same fate in a literal manner at the very start of the movie it's also interesting to note how very very similar the plots of his movies play out regardless of who the producer director or screenwriter are van damme usually plays a character who is living in france then due to a set of circumstances finds himself in another part of the globe where he has a brother who dies and it's up to van damme to get revenge helped by a character he's just met look at <UNK> or or many other films that feature the <UNK> starring jean claude van damme and they all feature nearly the same type of story structure this doesn't mean they're identical of course just very similar and if you've seen one van damme movie you've basically seen them all it's the same with maximum risk
<START> <UNK> is quite clearly a <UNK> film the kind where bullet <UNK> good guys and bad guys are everywhere so much so that you really aren't supposed to see them as human the <UNK> between the lines from wayans and sandler are extensive indeed they try hard but alas and persona itself does not a good film make jimmy <UNK> plays a nifty villain but he's always had that redneck edge at the ready my <UNK> scene is the repeated clips of a tv ad in which <UNK> reveals the virtues of america can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in every garage aside from that it's a buddy movie with guns for brains pass on this one
<START> of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plot script and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie w waste br br take for example about two dozen fbi local law officers surround a trailer house with a <UNK> <UNK> inside the <UNK> is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the <UNK> with gary and company <UNK> away at them the cops fall like <UNK> and the <UNK> with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet <UNK> ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed damn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the six <UNK> held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle
<START> i haven't read the source richard <UNK> novel the brick <UNK> which i hope is not as as its title but i understand the original villain was a not an anti <UNK> and to be honest sam <UNK> is written as a gay guy who picks up a drunken soldier but okay you have to go with the flow consider <UNK> not even anti <UNK> has been treated on screen yet many of the people responsible for contemporary movies were themselves jews but anti <UNK> had been <UNK> for years because it was considered unpleasant so we can hardly blame the makers of this film for not leaving the victim a homosexual now that's really unpleasant and besides there might have been many among the audience rooting for robert ryan to get away with it we are by no means free of prejudice but we've still come a long way since <UNK> br br watching this again for the first time in years i was impressed with the rather slow pace of the first half of the movie the many shots of two people talking the shadows the time that passes between the question and the answer the uninspired editing but i could live with that because of the film's subject matter and because of a few other things br br one of the things that keep me glued to events as they unfold so deliberately is robert <UNK> performance the guy does a splendid job at times he can seem thoughtful <UNK> <UNK> and helpful to the police any way i can help yes sir then alone or with another soldier the <UNK> hatred rises to the top not so much through what he says but the way he looks that <UNK> that <UNK> stare those dark eyes <UNK> wow br br the film has taken a lot of heat because of robert <UNK> preachy speech about his <UNK> murder that doesn't bother me at all although i guess didn't have to have young <UNK> his face into the camera while talking about and still taking the context into account it's one of the more shocking moments of the film part of its impact is due to <UNK> almost casual delivery of the message and part of it is due to the not having been heard on screen before br br another feature of the film that transforms it almost into the surreal is the paul kelly character and his relationship to the whore gloria <UNK> holy <UNK> what <UNK> conversation kelly is given to you know what i told you all those things i just told you they're all lies his character neatly crosses pathos with creepiness it's impossible to know what to make of him he adds virtually nothing to the plot but the movie would be a lot less without his presence br br it's a moody murky film its people live in the dark and there is murder <UNK> practically no one screams or shouts the horror that these men have experienced and that some of them still carry with them like <UNK> seems just beneath the surface br br see it if you have a chance
<START> my age 13 br br <UNK> played by damon wayans and <UNK> <UNK> played by adam sandler are the best of friends and have been for a year what <UNK> doesn't know is that <UNK> is really jack carter an undercover cop who is waiting for the right time to bust <UNK> and frank <UNK> a major criminal who <UNK> is involved with when <UNK> and <UNK> find out that <UNK> is a cop <UNK> wants to kill <UNK> but he gets away after shooting carter in the head which does not kill carter <UNK> is found by the cops and is taken for proof of <UNK> <UNK> but when the cops including carter are about to <UNK> him across the country on a plane all the other cops are killed and <UNK> and carter are alone in the desert carter has to stay alive as well as take <UNK> in br br a fairly average action comedy <UNK> has a fair plot but a lot of the film is just plain stupid for a comedy i found most of the jokes entirely unfunny but as an action movie it has a few fairly good action scenes not being a good fan of either adam sandler or damon wayans i found the acting and therefore the characters well below par the climax isn't really great and the film is so unrealistic it is not entirely bad but also not too good and it is far too short running below 85 minutes i though there was another 15 minutes left before it ended but there wasn't and the film felt too short overall not a complete waste of time but i still wouldn't recommend <UNK> br br australian <UNK> ma 15 medium level violence sexual references medium level coarse language br br rating <UNK> out of 100
<START> the <UNK> of the <UNK> tragedy is <UNK> presented in the end note of the movie in the battle of <UNK> more than one million people were killed in action <UNK> to death or died of <UNK> russians <UNK> italians <UNK> germans <UNK> of the <UNK> 000 surrounded men of the sixth army <UNK> were taken prisoners of whom only 6 000 returned to their <UNK> years later br br what the story does not tell was that who <UNK> did not share all the <UNK> of the <UNK> of his men he had a special treatment as the highest <UNK> taken by the soviet army when during his presence at the <UNK> trials he was asked about the fate of the <UNK> 000 prisoners he <UNK> that they were fine he was freed after the war and died in the east germany br br the film only presents the first part of the tragedy the actual battle of <UNK> however for an entire picture the fate of the <UNK> 000 should also not be forgotten
<START> this is a multi <UNK> insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a <UNK> patient their and our perception and realities although the main theme revolves around a <UNK> young woman the story delightfully <UNK> with physics medicine religion and even politics as it questions our <UNK> about what is true and what is real <UNK> <UNK> beautifully conveys that the world is living in is as real to her as <UNK> is to us within that world she is logical and her thoughts are <UNK> consistent not the <UNK> that they seem to us in our world br br here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie don't worry these are not spoilers i absolutely loved the way <UNK> <UNK> these <UNK> into the story br br the references to quantum <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> with the witch doctor in hindi performing his religious <UNK> that he believes will drive away the ghosts sitting in brain br br the doctor shock treatment as a solution that is believed to work br br windows of perception the scene about the review of book br br the <UNK> to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for <UNK> br br news footage of george bush telling the whole world that there is no doubt in his mind that there are <UNK> in iraq now that is not as much about <UNK> perception who i suspect knew the truth as the <UNK> <UNK> perception about <UNK> in iraq br br one of the best scenes in the movie is where tells <UNK> <UNK> sent this man to beat me and <UNK> <UNK> it as a matter of course <UNK> did a fantastic job bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a <UNK> brain when her world and the real world clash br br <UNK> was bold but not bold enough to pose one big question is nearly all of mankind <UNK> to believe in god she could have inserted some scenes about normal healthy people praying to and <UNK> for a being that no one has ever seen or heard from in all of human history the ritual <UNK> scene doesn't go far enough that would be the ultimate question what is normal who's reality is right the or the br br imho this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the <UNK> mind than a beautiful mind it looks at the minds of not just the sick person but also the healthy and does so from many different angles and <UNK> our understanding of our own minds and our world if the former got 4 oscars this deserves more at least one each for story screenplay direction <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> it was truly a treat to watch this movie and i'm glad i bought the dvd for my collection br br this was a story very well told indeed
<START> this film is about the complicated friendship romance and <UNK> between two men and two women during the world war ii br br a lot of effort has been put to make the edge of love look the right period however i find this effort too excessive particularly in terms of the tone of the colours most of the first half of the film is <UNK> so much to have a strong <UNK> tone it's hard to make out who's who in this tone br br another <UNK> point is the fancy use of image splitting lens there are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing such as three <UNK> knightley smiling face or four <UNK> of arms in embrace that simply makes the film confusing and hard to follow instead of being artistic br br as for the plot it is plain boring the way the story unfolds is not engaging at all <UNK> <UNK> unstable character is annoying in fact all the main characters are annoying and unlikeable <UNK> <UNK> accent is impossible to understand making it a further <UNK> to understanding the plot br br i strongly advise avoiding the edge of love unless you watch a film only to appreciate great costumes nice sets and lighting
<START> i totally disagree with the person who first commented about this movie to me this storyline is about a man with growth <UNK> disorder trying his best to look for the love he is yearning for trying his very best to fit into the society who doesn't seemed to accept him br br he then met someone who treats him with best friend's love and was shown the way to receiving the love he always wanted to have the man who created all that happiness in returned received something important from the giant which is family and <UNK> love br br and the comedy it's just part of making the audience feel some laughter bugs at certain part of the shows br br and i must admit it made me tear a little
<START> the storyline of the is a simple one of <UNK> love that despite the passing of decades still remains strong now 50 years old <UNK> <UNK> lives alone and works two jobs ¬ñ one as a <UNK> clerk in a supermarket the other as a doing her daily round on the hills of <UNK> one of her stops is at the house of a government official who tends to his <UNK> ill wife <UNK> and used to see each other as school children but after the death of mother and father who it seems were having an affair together their own relationship was destroyed lying in her sick bed <UNK> knows however that her husband's feelings for the aren't completely gone and for the sake of after she has died she attempts to engineer a means of bringing them back together br br while the story might be simple the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them is really where the heart and beauty of the film lie the film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters their actions being recorded by an old lady who is writing their story for a book while looking after her own husband who is showing signs of <UNK> in the process it depicts the social circumstances of people from different ways of life how they interact with each other on a daily basis how relationships form and how past and present can <UNK> the director handles this <UNK> with a strong structure and visual style it's only later in the film that the story starts to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path as if it is indeed being constructed to fit the narrative structure of the book that is being written it's all <UNK> by the emotional depths the film touches represented most effectively in the exceptional performance of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> formulaic to the max neither title reflects the <UNK> actual content fighting nazis in <UNK> actually the ranch the plot is just to fill in the <UNK> between <UNK> the <UNK> claims over 40 in 15 chapters that's at least three a chapter aside from seeing <UNK> <UNK> cast as a spanish <UNK> frenchman watching how much furniture is <UNK> <UNK> thrown burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about when the protagonists start fighting you can bet that everything in the room will be in it too so kudos to the fight choreographer who is the real star of this serial br br two positive notes the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights and best of all we have the girl side kick often a journalist as she is here actually <UNK> in the mayhem mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys yet to come is linda <UNK> killing the main villain in <UNK> of mystery island 1945 on the negative side there are just too many jump out of the way escapes before the <UNK> falls before the car goes over the cliff before the <UNK> explodes before the building explodes before the truck hits you etc etc br br it is claimed that this serial partially george lucas to make the first indiana jones film but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the <UNK> development br br rod cameron as a moving rock a role he played in all his films other than watching all the furniture getting <UNK> there's nothing really going on here compared to other serials that have fewer fights more story better actors and more developed characters br br i give it a 3 for all the furniture <UNK>
<START> typically spanish production slow moving but with great <UNK> and sexuality <UNK> from the lead actress paz vega watch her in <UNK> great sets lots of colour you get to see <UNK> spanish mountains and countryside the plot tends to <UNK> here and there but if you follow closely i managed to even though the film is in spanish you'll get the <UNK> of it br br it's about how one very highly sensual young gypsy woman carmen uses her feminine <UNK> to seduce men to do her <UNK> carmen is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow at the <UNK> factory where she works she <UNK> jose the soldier in charge of taking her to prison to let her escape jose <UNK> to her charms because she speaks <UNK> he is and speaks the same language jose is <UNK> by 1 month in jail and to foot soldier he later meets carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers but carmen refuses to commit to him and continues her <UNK> and <UNK> lifestyle in a jealous rage jose kills a fellow soldier who has been with carmen they then have to leave town life on the run turns jose into a <UNK> carmen meanwhile remains the same a wildly <UNK> woman in the end jose loses his mind and ends up killing carmen br br the story is told by jose in prison awaiting to be executed the person he tells the story to is <UNK> a french writer and <UNK> whose fancy watch it plays <UNK> fur <UNK> was stolen by either carmen or jose br br worth watching for the sets and for the <UNK> paz vega
<START> there are no spoilers for this film as nothing could be written that could make it any worse the <UNK> definition of <UNK> should now read sex lives of the <UNK> men unless that is you like dog poo and in which case this is the film to see johnny vegas et all what were you thinking
<START> if you are a fan of either of the two origin <UNK> aliens predator duh and even if you liked or disliked flick in <UNK> you will hate this movie the <UNK> plot holes <UNK> and unbelievable human characters terrible special effects and even worse directing and fight scenes make this one of worse films i've ever seen br br one of the hundred huge plot holes included the alien hybrid going from chest to full grown bad ass in seconds it takes off on an <UNK> predator ship killing spree and <UNK> out a ship of before the ship even breaks earth <UNK> as if in the first we saw a ship of sr hunters drop off three <UNK> hunters going on an <UNK> their <UNK> hunting party and then in the end saw them picking up the <UNK> body of the juvenile that was left over at the end of the flick are we expected to believe that the single chest hybrid killed all these sr hunters before the ship even broke <UNK> also and this was extremely cheap production value on the director <UNK> parts <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> of face <UNK> somehow magically appeared aboard the ship even though the entire temple complex and queen alien were destroyed in the flick these face <UNK> end up playing an part in movie of course and how about all these face <UNK> becoming full grown aliens in a days time what a joke although there were many many more plot holes i don't think imdb would appreciate me filling up their <UNK> by writing them here br br on the <UNK> and unbelievable characters well where should i go boys and girls where to start almost all of these goof balls are clich√© people from other films or tv shows the town bad boy who left to avoid jail time but shows up just on the day everything happens to save the day where did i see that oh yeah last season on <UNK> then there's the 20 something town sheriff a former trouble maker himself who was best friends at one time with the bad boy where did we see that oh yeah <UNK> and walking tall then there's the generic soldier with no rank coming home from some generic war front that isn't met like a long missed loved one and hero at the airport or bus station but at her own front door by her daughter and husband and who is this soldier what did she do in the army air force marines navy coast guard we don't know because the movie never tells us but she was some kind of soldier <UNK> marine sailor that knows how to drive a <UNK> <UNK> vehicle and magically a helicopter this character is just a generic copy of every coming home service person except that she brings home a set of night vision <UNK> to her daughter that cost several hundred dollars these are things soldiers have to sign for and don't just bring home ugh br br the special effects and fight scenes are what <UNK> <UNK> me off the worst though these are the things i enjoyed the most in the first movie watching and aliens go at it the way this was filmed though the action sequences were so dark and filmed so close up that you couldn't tell what was going on you couldn't see who was doing what and what was going on as they were fighting it out all in all these hundreds of items are going to kill this franchise and the no one is going to care anymore about seeing their favorite sci fi movie monsters and can only guess that the series will go down from here as producers won't like dump millions of dollars more on a sequel
<START> it is apparent that director writers and everyone else knows nothing about their own religion or the people who practice it this movie is endlessly flawed and overall a complete <UNK> br br for instance there is a scene where the <UNK> enters the woman's ritual bath while a naked woman is bathing puts his hand on the head of a woman there and <UNK> her this is complete mockery of the laws in this scene alone some of the laws broken include modesty a <UNK> would never enter a ritual bath house while there are woman in it br br <UNK> contact a <UNK> would never put his hand on a woman's head not to mention that it is not the way a <UNK> is given br br the woman from the ritual bath is <UNK> a naked woman by pushing her head under the water the laws regarding ritual bathing require the entire body to make direct contact with the bath water this means nobody should be in contact with the person bathing certainly not pushing them under br br there was more just in that scene alone like <UNK> 13 times where does that concept even come from not to mention the rest of the movie was a total <UNK> it is scary what ignorance can <UNK>
<START> put this movie out of it's misery and burn the <UNK> what am i saying the whole movie was negative fortunately only a very few would find this movie the least bit appealing this is what the vast american majority would call too much sex and violence it will probably show up on some non <UNK> cable channel someday just for the shock value but after editing out the nudity most of the violence will stay all that will be left is 45 minutes of really bad acting interspersed with 45 minutes of commercials there are just too many starving actors in hollywood
<START> the actors were not believable the story was really weak total <UNK> and completely predictable really disappointed in depardieu it was a shame that they did not focus more on the struggle of the canadian fight for independence we have seen this love story many times before only with better actors we had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a small sense of drama the soundtrack was totally disturbing the <UNK> hit you over the head with sentimentality but really over the top the only thing we found ok was the fact that they let the indians speak their language and we found the cinematography of the indian village relatively realistic
<START> spoiler mind <UNK> <UNK> i had just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and had just found out about <UNK> <UNK> i thought <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> done any horrors so i checked into it i saw the <UNK> mind <UNK> i checked on my <UNK> for it there was an air date on sci fi so i was set i got my pop corn ready came in and set on the couch and what the hell is this a <UNK> bold guy in blue sweat pants running around yelling nothing is scary about this movie at all if anything its funny funny how low the budget is funny how predictable it is funny how bad the acting is and funny how much money it didnt make ok <UNK> <UNK> is a good actor but this movie is dumb it is so stupid they killed him at the end and then they go on this plane and the monster is on it they shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls a long way to the ground and br br gasp the killer ending its still alive scary <UNK> fat sack of crap waste of 2 hours br br bottom line you have somewhere to go and you need to kill some time mind <UNK> <UNK> the suggestion i'd rather sit out naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time br br overall grade f
<START> watch this movie only to truly appreciate how good the original is i'm not real hard to please but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br it hurt me deeply because i like chevy chase jackie mason and <UNK> cannon the writing was just terrible i thought chevy would have at least ad <UNK> some better stuff than he did there was hardly anything to laugh at in this movie i went into it wanting to enjoy it i wanted to laugh but nearly cried br br in the beginning credits it read special appearance by chevy chase this worried me from the start chevy is actually in more than i thought he would be it's more than a special appearance too bad the appearance wasn't special <UNK> character would have been a good secondary character but got old as a main i would rather have seen more much more of <UNK> cannon at least her character was fun if not well written i also missed the teen sex scene mr <UNK> went from being cute and innocent to a <UNK> <UNK> that deserved to be blown up jonathan silverman is the only character that interested me and we didn't see enough of him br br i take it back try to watch half of this movie then remember the <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> i
<START> i was really disappointed after viewing <UNK> revenge the other night i had a good <UNK> that it was going to be a bad one but i didn't think that it'd be as bad as it turned out a wooden puppet of a murdered boy falls into the hands of an <UNK> eight year old daughter from there it is a murderous path for anyone who gets in the way between the puppet and the little girl we've seen movies like this before i e the child's play series which is by the way far better however it was good to see actors like james w quinn and todd allen both of which have worked under kevin <UNK> before in any event i encourage viewers to check out night of the demons and the original <UNK> these are titles that tend to bring out the best in kevin s <UNK>
<START> i saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe i have ever seen br br completely unfunny low budget boring rubbish script terrible acting the entire audience young and old sat through the film <UNK> without laughing for most of it there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire movie br br many people left halfway can't blame them i stayed thinking that the film would pick up however it never did and i wish i'd left br br the humour was really lame and i am surprised that this ever made it on to the big screen i am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all it just wasn't funny the people who made this movie really don't deserve your money so please don't pay to see this film br br this isn't even funny enough to be shown on tv let alone cinema br br i wanted to give it 0 out of 10 but the system won't allow it
<START> first of all i'd like to start by saying it's a refreshing start to see a british drama that finally looks and feels believable br br patrick stewart does the role justice as ian hood the government science <UNK> with his constant and <UNK> views on authority and thoughts about the future of real world science and how he feels it's either being used or abused by others br br not only is the casting thoroughly <UNK> all the way throughout the series but it makes it's characters seem more believable than most other british <UNK> br br ashley <UNK> also delivers a first rate performance as dr <UNK> <UNK> bodyguard <UNK> young she brings a refreshing take on the <UNK> <UNK> everyday views of science and her constant battling with hood makes for some very funny and memorable moments between them br br the way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic i find positive and more engaging than the <UNK> we are so used to in other fiction or science fiction tv shows br br there are however notable <UNK> with the series every time an episode ends i find myself disappointed that they didn't seem to cover all aspects of the plot and sometimes leaving open ended stories br br although bearing in mind that this is still the first series i hope that we see a return to form in the near future where these open ended stories can finally be given a significant conclusion they so rightly deserve br br for those who enjoy more slow paced science related plot lines this is the ideal show to watch as it always manages to stay believable and more importantly to the point
<START> shame on fox for <UNK> this movie it was a total riot and i only hope that it will find a second life on dvd and cable br br this is a hilarious satire it takes the what if situation to an extreme and it doesn't pull any punches or kicks to the <UNK> it makes you think what is to become of this empire once we've gotten totally to lazy and stupid everyone gets hit in this one <UNK> a number of major <UNK> and even fox news takes a punch which is probably why the movie never had a proper release other than the marketing department over thinking the campaign and not knowing how to market it so we'll just give up some may find the movie <UNK> due to the <UNK> kicking and <UNK> but the movie is much more than that you either get what mike judge is saying or you don't most of the negative reviews i've read seem to come from people who just don't get it or are film <UNK> br br it'll probably play for one week in the selected <UNK> so if you miss it keep an eye out for the dvd it'll be worth the rental and i will eventually have it in my collection br br good job mike judge it's a shame that you got screwed but you made me laugh out loud and i look forward to the next movie you do
<START> rko radio pictures made a real classic in <UNK> and even managed to get it nominated for the best picture academy award the acting script continuity et <UNK> are all just about perfect and the story is well worth the viewer's <UNK> minutes although the picture soft <UNK> the true life story by making the murder victim a jew rather than a homosexual most viewers will see the victim as a jewish homosexual such <UNK> never work perhaps weren't intended to br br i could <UNK> pick about a few details but just for fun there was no all night movie house in washington <UNK> in <UNK> and if there was i wish robert mitchum and his pal wouldn't talk through the show there weren't any bars where a <UNK> could pick up a pretty blonde none if robert ryan wanted to read the latest murder scoop he ought to have bought the daily news not the times evening star and certainly not the know nothing washington post but these little things take nothing away from this classic br br the film benefits a lot from the absolute lack of a musical score except during the credits i've only seen this done in a few films br br on the negative side since 1995 it comes with a <UNK> introduction where some liberal about what the public was ready for in <UNK> blah blah blah as if this fool has any business judging his <UNK> i'd say the ex <UNK> in <UNK> the greatest generation were much smarter and had better values than some <UNK> film <UNK> or other wise mouth in 1995 put a <UNK> in it
<START> <UNK> a lone <UNK> living in the desert and acting as an agent to other <UNK> <UNK> how his life turned out to be as it is it started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead causing him to leave his home town one of the <UNK> is <UNK> who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister but the sister wants to hire a <UNK> to have <UNK> <UNK> and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person br br comments i've seen the <UNK> version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994 how the two versions <UNK> i can't say but the <UNK> is very heavily stylized in the way of chinese <UNK> action that is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie a <UNK> story but true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director <UNK> <UNK> wong therefore there are lots of colorful very beautiful scenes that are completely unrelated to the story br br the editing and <UNK> of the story is also <UNK> much is left out in the scenes the time line is broken and <UNK> in a confusing way very slow and calm scenes are suddenly <UNK> by surprisingly brutal and seemingly <UNK> fights only to themselves being <UNK> by something else and unrelated the result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie br br thanks to these brutal but very few fights the movie is put into the action genre the poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action the other couldn't be <UNK> away from it the movie in its entirety is very slow dull and hence very boring not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so <UNK> from the rest of the movie br br i might say that i'm not a fan of this chinese style since they often seem to be <UNK> of these same problems most importantly that the visual is more important than the story but <UNK> of time <UNK> is perhaps the worst example i've seen br br 3 10
<START> nicely filmed a little uneven nobody is a good <UNK> entertainment the plot is simple enough three <UNK> get into a <UNK> with a group of strangers in a bar and it turns out to be much more than they <UNK> for the acting is decent and there are a few unexpected twists watch for the completely unbelievable like the 10 shot revolver and 25 shot semi automatic <UNK>
<START> a gentle story <UNK> at fury with a <UNK> message and glorious celebration the photography is <UNK> well executed <UNK> look at this kind of film to <UNK> their craft not just for what the eye can do to enhance a story but what the right camera <UNK> can do to <UNK> an emotion feeding the soul is by definition what this movie <UNK> but with an <UNK> and grace of delivery that simply doesn't not happen much anymore at least with this degree of taste restraint and <UNK> if you care about story and character development this is a also a great movie to see as an example of what simple lines and the right delivery can do to completely fill out a character's impression match all this with a film score that is almost <UNK> in character and also perfectly conceived and you'll get this movie
<START> now first let me say i love god awful movies especially horror films mainly i watched hundreds of movies on mystery science theater 3000 with no pain but this is the absolute worst film on the planet i had to turn it off it was so bad it was unfunny and just plain unwatchable give me 3 back to back viewings of <UNK> the hands of fate or monster a go go over this any day avoid this film like the now excuse me while i go <UNK> out my eyes to <UNK> them of the filth i had to watch to get a decent judgement for this film only one decent gag in the part i watched was the now are an <UNK> pair for <UNK> even that wasn't to great of a gag
<START> this was a thoughtful and well shot and directed tv movie that took on a huge subject with <UNK> and intelligence and gives it a film treatment that would look great on a bigger screen the palette is a little muted for tv if you're looking for a war action film or <UNK> <UNK> this isn't for you it's about an ordinary woman who took on an extraordinary challenge for humanity if you want to learn more about the conflict and how the work of one woman influenced the world in a massive way watch this film when it comes your way i don't see that a lot of other tv films have dealt with the issue of <UNK> and ethnic hatred at this level the story avoids obvious <UNK> of the bad guys and instead shows the denial and everyday hatred that resulted in deaths of thousands i was moved at several points and not in some manipulative hollywood way with driving music and flashy <UNK> en scene but allowed to discover the horror and <UNK> along with the characters this is a film brave enough to let the content speak for itself and keep the visuals understated to support it with dignity br br the actors do a <UNK> job at bringing the intense dramatic scenes to life the scenes where victims give their <UNK> before the war <UNK> are powerful and wendy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are excellent william <UNK> british accent is awful no one else has given him a chance to play a brit and when he finally has it he blows it and although john <UNK> body was born to play a soldier <UNK> he's a little too gee <UNK> nice although he does a good job
<START> a truly terrific touching film female melodrama at its finest with a lot of comedy great dialogue characters and writing any woman can relate to the story because it's a classic you're in love with mr right but he has no interest in you until some guy who seems completely wrong comes along and you fall head over heels in love but of course it's not that simplistic the characters are real and all of the performances are perfect the movie is hilarious as well every scene <UNK> society i'd recommend this film to anyone who loves a well written screenplay of humor and melodrama you can relate to every character and the plot moves in unexpected directions a great underrated movie
<START> long before <UNK> brought the issue of living as a <UNK> to the public view a day in the death of joe egg dealt with it alan bates plays <UNK> a <UNK> whose daughter is almost completely he and his wife sheila janet try all sorts of dark humor to try and get on with their lives but they can't escape the facts at one point they even consider <UNK> the question <UNK> them and their friends is what will ever become of this <UNK> br br with this movie alan bates continued his streak of really good movies <UNK> by <UNK> the greek the king of hearts and the <UNK> we can safely say that he will be sadly missed
<START> <UNK> is a movie that is representation of the american system at it's worst the <UNK> system was initially set up as a stepping stone for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet the movie showed an accurate portrayal of how the <UNK> system breaks down the family unit in other words if the father or any male figure is in the lives of the women and children their financial support from the system would be <UNK> if not <UNK> the struggles of the poor can be seen throughout the world i would like to see a <UNK> of this movie back in the stores for all to rent or buy for their library collection
<START> i didn't like this movie for many reasons very boring it was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this but seriously i was very bored watching this there was hardly any action although the classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice the visuals were very creative whenever this movie pops on tv i feel like changing the station instantly not because it is a bad movie just because i know what i am in for when watching this complete and total boredom it is a movie i saw when i was young but i never got into the science fiction thing because it simply wasn't real just like this movie very unrealistic i never understood half the movie anyway
<START> my mom would not let me watch this film when i was in grade 2 because she said it was too violent well years later and the only reason i remember this film is because of my mom i stayed up and watch it on <UNK> well maybe the build up after all these year lead to the big of this film but i found it lame it did not age well and this made the acting choppy huge unbelievable holes in the script but there is a few cool scenes like car chases and a big gun fight i will not stay up for this film again
<START> i was really surprised that my mom watched whole movie without leaving to iron clean or some other things like these and i was almost shocked when she said it was very funny and very interesting and i think so
<START> i saw this film when it first came out and didn't know what to expect exactly what followed the <UNK> was one of the most <UNK> <UNK> experiences i have ever had a lush score of songs and music by leslie of doctor <UNK> <UNK> and the chocolate factory fame as well as making his mark on the broadway musical scene and scored by the <UNK> john williams there's not a bad song in the entire film plus some of the most exquisite cinematography costume design and filming locations i have ever seen in one film not to mention the academy award nominated performance by peter o'toole and the equally strong performance in my opinion by the wonderful clark now given that peter is not the same caliber a singer that is he still manages to sell his songs to the audience and that after all is what it is all about this is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by james hilton and deserves to be <UNK> for generations to come i recommend this film for family viewing though most men will consider this a flick but if you like a truly great film musical then this film is for you but be warned that a <UNK> box of <UNK> is just as important as popcorn for your viewing pleasure
<START> back in the 1960's those of us who were bad movie <UNK> thought that plan nine from outer space was the worst movie ever made and would remain so for all time to put things in perspective though we also thought that 3 000 was a lot to pay for a new car br br as we grew older our innocence was gradually stripped away as we were exposed to movies like <UNK> in new york and <UNK> at the memory bank which completely <UNK> the bad movie genre in this context last night my son and i saw alien from l a which pushed the <UNK> to an extreme <UNK> just a generation ago to call this movie bad or wretched or <UNK> completely fails to do it justice as does any other label existent in the english language even if there were words with which to accurately describe this movie it would be of no consequence since they would be banned in <UNK> society br br the alien referred to in the title is played by kathy ireland who apparently took some time off from <UNK> <UNK> for sports illustrated to kick off her cinematic career her casting might seem some sort of recommendation until you actually see the movie the makeup artists earned their money by making kathy look so drab and <UNK> you would not want to touch her with the far end of a <UNK> no mean feat to put it <UNK> in this movie she has a face that would freeze <UNK> even worse than her look though was her voice which was so <UNK> that i initially failed to credit it as <UNK> with a human being throughout the movie i found myself longing for a <UNK> to drag my nails across to cover the <UNK> <UNK> of her dialog at the end of the movie kathy finally gets a <UNK> and finds herself in her beloved <UNK> i suggested to my son that the movie would have been better if they had put her in the <UNK> at the beginning of the movie so at least we would have had something to watch my son <UNK> pointed out that if they had then removed the <UNK> and stuffed it into her mouth it would have considerably improved the movie on two counts i <UNK> to the plain brilliance of his observation if you have any doubts compare this dreck to <UNK> in which a competent filmmaker shows how to exploit the <UNK> of an <UNK> beautiful leading lady in the fantasy genre br br of the plot itself there is little on which to comment since there was so little in evidence it is said that if a million monkeys <UNK> for millions of years eventually one would come up with hamlet by the process of <UNK> the rest of the time they would come up with something this screenplay imagine if you will a modern day alice falling into a hole and dropping 500 feet onto a rock <UNK> following which she gets up herself off and starts looking for her long lost father in the city kingdom of atlantis once in atlantis she spends most of her time running fighting or climbing stairs and <UNK> and basically trying to keep out of the hands of a general who seems to have no soldiers to do his <UNK> and who would make tiny tim look macho this <UNK> as <UNK> as it appears is probably longer than the shooting script br br on the plus side as you <UNK> in the production values and take in whatever you can of the sets and costumes through the smoke and <UNK> you realize that this is one movie in which you can actually see on the screen where all 20 of the budget went br br the thought that kept going through my mind was that filmmakers ought not be given access to drugs and alcohol while they are shooting a movie or perhaps prior if it leads to results like alien from l a though in fairness i have to acknowledge that i don't know whether they were actually involved in substance abuse or were simply brain dead at the outset of the project
<START> i just got back from the film festival at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in ny a friend told me about this film audience response was very positive lots of good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of realization top notch in every area a movie that makes you think and then makes you realize how lucky we'd all be if we could turn back time and live without shame or guilt i imagine this will come close to if not win the audience favorite award what was most surprising was the fact the the movie appears to start off as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the very group it started to <UNK> there isn't any mean spirited humor at the expense of one group just a slow realization that we would all be better off if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started off with
<START> the <UNK> of all lousy jaws rip offs was <UNK> made by one of my all time favorite directors <UNK> <UNK> here under his john old jr <UNK> you know how it goes in these cheap european <UNK> right they only want their monstrous animal to be be bigger <UNK> and more threatening but this more than often results in the opposite effect <UNK> creature is a <UNK> sea devil and it's more than just a shark we're <UNK> dealing with a <UNK> monster here with the jaws and <UNK> of a great white but it also has <UNK> like an <UNK> it's up to a couple of <UNK> loving to discover how this monster was able to survive all these thousands of years and why exactly he only started his killing spree now the script of monster shark makes few to no sense and most of the action takes place on the <UNK> the shark itself is an unintentionally laughable creation and it was a wise decision of <UNK> <UNK> to only show it vaguely and in quick flashes the acting performances are above average and the underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well handled the twists in the plot are predictable and you'll probably have the most fun <UNK> detailed facts about the characters for example count all the <UNK> of beer dr hogan drinks throughout the whole movie
<START> a group of <UNK> bag teenagers go up to an old mining town in hopes of finding gold <UNK> the one <UNK> in the hair <UNK> scheme is that the ancient supernatural <UNK> whom the gold belongs to doesn't wish to part with his treasure so easily and so begins to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> br br literally clich√© dialog horrible acting some insanely terrible and a lame <UNK> killer who resembles <UNK> <UNK> without the <UNK> of young boys naturally combine to make this stinker just about unwatchable even cult legend actress karen black in a small role can't save this <UNK> br br eye candy <UNK> madison shows badly lit t a br br my grade d br br where i saw it
<START> directed and written by the famous infamous edward d wood jr using a <UNK> daniel davis playing the lead role of <UNK> glenda this is an almost radical documentary about <UNK> wood himself being a <UNK> with a fetish for <UNK> <UNK> it seems miles of stock footage and an incoherent bela lugosi is used to stretch this odd and awkward film to <UNK> minutes police inspector <UNK> <UNK> seeks enlightenment from a psychiatrist dr <UNK> timothy farrell to better understand the emotional and <UNK> of <UNK> br br also in the cast <UNK> fuller tommy captain and <UNK> sister evelyn of note farrell also acts as narrator and fuller later helped write songs included in the elvis <UNK> movies blue hawaii cousins kid
<START> i admire the effort of trying to reach out to the rest of the world with this tragic story however the movie is done so badly that most people i know couldn't sit through it the movie was relevant to me since i lived in <UNK> when these events took place but it is written horribly and fails to capture the attention of someone who knows nothing on the matter the music choices do not flow well with the movie it seems as if someone just turned a cd player on in the background to put the actors in the mood the acting well what acting the only people acting are <UNK> <UNK> and donald sutherland even though <UNK> seems uncomfortable in this role as far as the relationship development goes between <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and julia greta <UNK> it is like watching a train wreck there is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their sincere moments this is not a good movie there is a difference between trying to get a message out could've been a documentary and trying to make a good movie this is a failure and anyone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it as a matter of fact as a native of <UNK> i am offended by this miserable effort this tragedy deserves more than just a <UNK> low budget ghost chase excuse of a movie this could have been much more
<START> i went to see this because i have some friends in the <UNK> but the film moved me beyond what i expected by turning out to be a perfect blend of belly holding laughs <UNK> strange use of english <UNK> comedy and <UNK> <UNK> on depressing i loved the range it made me want to jump in to an old car and hit the road for the <UNK> alex plays his guide part perfectly and provides a great <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> poker faced <UNK> the film shows the positive side of humanity when <UNK> of <UNK> cultures can bond and do the right thing when they feel the sincerity of the situation even when they went into it with <UNK> notions and prejudices and how this can open up <UNK> into deeply buried memories there is a lot in this film
<START> the title suggests that this movie is a sequel to an american werewolf in london none of the characters from the previous movie return and aren't even mentioned in this movie by name so as a sequel fails one would say br br i dare to say the opposite br br an american werewolf in paris is a charming effective horror movie it's one of the better werewolf films i have seen in a long time too and i have seen quite my share such as an american werewolf in london the howling <UNK> the <UNK> and the underworld trilogy br br the story tells of three americans visiting paris on a vacation at the top of the <UNK> tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide what starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that <UNK> in the city are revealed br br i really liked the acting in this film especially the two stars of the movie the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her they have good chemistry together but the other two americans also play their roles nicely i didn't really find anything annoying about the acting so thumbs up for that br br the effects on the werewolves are nice it doesn't look too cheap or fake to me of course the opinions are divided about this subject but let's just say that i wasn't disappointed br br there's also a good amount of humor in this movie there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time br br so to sum it up an american werewolf in paris might not be a direct sequel to it's predecessor but it's still an enjoyable movie perfect for fans of werewolves 7 out of 10 stars
<START> i first saw a poster advertising this film on a street in <UNK> <UNK> in june of 2000 what caught my attention was the proud <UNK> <UNK> all readers that the movie although itself french had been banned in france upon returning home to new york i discovered that one of the art house movie theaters in the city was screening the film and so with my <UNK> <UNK> decided to see what all the fuss was about boy did we ever br br from the comments read here and the reviews i knew the movie was violent and sexually explicit not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions i went with an open mind to see what had <UNK> the sensibilities of our <UNK> cousins presumably as anyone who is reading this will know the story involves two women who <UNK> on a crime and murder spree in france the movie has english subtitles the resemblance to thelma and louise however ends with that the sex is unusually graphic and in <UNK> supply as is the violence a lot of <UNK> to death and a lot of blood and other <UNK> matter <UNK> after bullet impact br br on an intellectual level one could make the case that the film's very essence is the relationship of sex and violence as <UNK> by the only sex these women know one is a small time prostitute and the other has earned money from time to time by performing in pornographic films when they during their descent into crime and murder have the upper hand over their sexual situations they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand it is important to note however that the victims of their rampage are not only creepy men interested in creepy sex of which there are several but innocent <UNK> a woman at an <UNK> for example as well br br i myself do not really understand why the repeated porn movie shots were all that necessary except to depict the physical contact as cruel and <UNK> and the <UNK> gore did get rather tedious after the first few violent <UNK> br br it is a coarse and crude movie but in fairness it is dealing with coarse and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances from one point of view the lives of the french is explored and it's pretty grim a <UNK> for france it definitely is not perhaps that's why the french banned it br br
<START> got back from <UNK> then where my dad was attached to the german <UNK> when the film came out in europe took all my girlfriends to see it show them the beauty of the country where <UNK> had played and stayed where the hippies stopped after leaving <UNK> and before joining <UNK> sean combs just celebrated at a friends restaurant in recently the el was much wilder in those days than it is now the stones went there earlier brian recorded in so it's memories and family entertainment and i'm glad my son will get to know about the north of africa watching this movie <UNK> <UNK> looks beautiful and connery is pretty funny indeed and teddy <UNK> as played by brian keith quite impressive
<START> <UNK> is a hit and miss film set in the australian suburban lawn <UNK> club of mick plays a who has been <UNK> free parking spaces at when the club is put under pressure to <UNK> poker machines in it's premises they need to raise <UNK> to keep this from happening the club needs new members to help and this is where mick character comes in and has to bowl to save the club with many up and coming and aging australian actors <UNK> is a hidden gem be warned though most of the jokes are for those with a knowledge of lawn <UNK> but there are many amusing sight gags that provide comical relief sam johnson and <UNK> lucy co star overall the movie should be recommended for people who play lawn <UNK> or have played but there is enough other material in there for an amusing play if you have a slight understanding if you enjoy australian humour i suggest you get you're <UNK> whites on and head on out to the theatre because this is the premiere lawn <UNK> comedy of the year also the only one
<START> forget what i said about <UNK> ray is the most irritating personality on the food network and all of television if you've never seen 30 minute <UNK> then you cannot possibly begin to comprehend how <UNK> annoying she is i really truly meant that you can't even begin to be <UNK> by her until you've viewed the show once or twice and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you the problem is mostly with her mannerisms as you might have guessed ray has a goofy mouth and often <UNK> the parrot if you love something or think it's awesome a word she uses roughly <UNK> times per <UNK> just say it and she's constantly using horrible unfunny <UNK> like extra virgin <UNK> oil shut up what's worse is ray has two other shows on the network i think this is some elaborate conspiracy by the terrorists to drive us mad give me more tyler <UNK> ray is lame
<START> this was a fabulous premise based on lots of factual history but the serious lack of character development left us not really liking or caring about any of the characters especially the she did not get any sympathy she seems like she deserved his own black cloud the songs were great to a point but became repetitive after a while
<START> i went into this film really wanting to like it it <UNK> a film festival earlier in the year and <UNK> an all star cast but and you could tell there was a but coming it's a failure of a film outstanding character acting by sarandon and walken is destroyed by editing and the antics of the supporting cast <UNK> performance is lackluster and most of the comedy is <UNK> the recurring puppet shows are pointless and a few scenes are completely out of place br br that said there are some wonderful moments <UNK> in the film a genuinely touching stage moment several of the <UNK> and a few of the comedic color actually work out unfortunately they're overshadowed by the incoherent script and some bad acting
<START> when i first saw this show i thought to my self what is this its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered huge then there's <UNK> this complete <UNK> for her friends and well her family <UNK> completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she <UNK> high school students to animals like what is that also they made her another <UNK> clone yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those <UNK> also very perfect like most tv girls are which makes me sick so please this is a stupid show it makes no sense just skip it unless you liked <UNK> <UNK> or any other shows like that
<START> i saw it last week and the sketch about the korea towns was funny very tongue in cheek and suitable to the political climate full points to the writers and spike for that the part where he makes the <UNK> pull a <UNK> and throws out korean words could have been pulled off only by spike this is a brave attempt by fox this is a brilliant show and i hope that it pulls off my wife and i have been it regularly and although it <UNK> it with a couple of other programs we watch it now on <UNK> i hope fox <UNK> full resources to the show and makes it daily i can't wait to see bobby lee on his show with people like bernard behind the show this is on the right track also mary mae as his wife looks beautiful
<START> in cold mountain north <UNK> near to the period of the american civil war the <UNK> monroe donald sutherland arrives in the small town with his daughter the shy <UNK> monroe nicole kidman due to health reasons <UNK> meets the also shy jude law and they fall in love with each other with the beginning of the war becomes a soldier and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see <UNK> in cold mountain again meanwhile <UNK> meets ruby <UNK> <UNK> a survivor of the war who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend the story <UNK> present and past situations <UNK> a beautiful romance i liked this film a lot having names such as philip seymour hoffman natalie portman and <UNK> <UNK> in the supporting cast a magnificent direction of anthony and seven <UNK> to the oscar this movie does not disappoint my remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the dvd at least one of them which show what happens with sara her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm should not be deleted as it was my vote is nine br br title brazil
<START> some films are just plain silly beyond explanation this is one of them words cannot do justice to the wooden acting the stupid <UNK> and the ever predictable outcome about the only thing that makes this film halfway worth watching are the scantily clad women and the mute guy for you ladies in it the leader of the warrior women and <UNK> are quite appealing to the eye but that's about all this movie has going for it br br some silliness in point one scene when they start to journey to the <UNK> of the dark one they are walking away from a supposedly destroyed land but we clearly see a 1980's new york behind them about 2 <UNK> of this movie looks like it was filmed in a high school basement the deadly <UNK> puppets look about as scary as a <UNK> street monster i have to agree with in that many 1950's trash b movies did a better job than this about the only one i can think of that didn't was teenagers from outer space
<START> this is yet another pseudo intellectual let's make the nazis look real bad movie the nazis were pretty bad no doubt most of already know that however that does not necessarily make every movie on the theme good a discovery channel presentation of the <UNK> would have been much more interesting br br conspiracy falls on its ass between two categories documentary and drama it doesn't cut it as a documentary the movie is too staged and the presentation too common it doesn't cut it as a drama the characters are too shallow and conflicts too easily solved br br another thing is the <UNK> one of the greatest crimes against humanity was <UNK> in just over an hour as the movie shows the <UNK> the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a <UNK> on the final solution the decision on the solution had already been taken by the ss the sole purpose of the meeting was to make all significant commit themselves to an already established plan there were no decisions or plans made at the <UNK> there was only <UNK> and some needed less than others br br finally one thing the movie does show although in no exceptional manner is man has a tendency to turn to culture and <UNK> in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing appalling atrocities this is seen in most leaders and politicians
<START> hell to pay bills itself as the <UNK> of the classic western it succeeds as a western genre movie that the entire family could see and not unlike the films baby <UNK> experienced decades ago the good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad bo <UNK> stella stevens lee <UNK> andrew excellent in this film tim <UNK> and james <UNK> are all great and it's fun to see them again james <UNK> really shines in this one maybe even better than his days as the in a way hell to pay reminds me of those movies in the 60's where actors you know from so many shows make an appearance if you're of a certain age buck taylor peter brown and <UNK> miller and william smith provide a wow factor because we seldom get to see these icons these days hell to pay features screen legends along with newer names in hollywood most notable in the cast of <UNK> is rachel who i've seen lately on the young and the restless and kevin who plays the angst ridden <UNK> a war weary man who's torn between wanting to live and let live or stepping in to do the right thing william gregory lee is excellent as chance mischievous and <UNK> brother katie <UNK> plays rachel sister a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive but giving up her pride in the process in a small but memorable role jeff davis plays mean joe a former <UNK> with a rather nasty mean streak i think we'll be seeing more of these fine actors in the future hell to pay is a fun movie with a great story to grab the popcorn we're west
<START> there was absolutely nothing in this film that hadn't been done better in a hundred other films it was barely worth the trouble of watching through to the end even the bad language sounded tired tom <UNK> a very fine actor was particularly disappointing here
<START> the word boring gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a low budget horror movie might or might not be i've seen many a b movie many horrible terribly inept b movies some with a production value of a few hundred bucks does <UNK> lousy acting worse continuity and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable some would no doubt way yes most of which are probably huge fans of the matrix well i hate big budget movies so i say no bad can sometimes be funny blood freak sometimes even mind blowing <UNK> 2 but boring will always be unwatchable hey kinda like <UNK> <UNK> which reminds me i'm writing a review for this pile of garbage uh yeah anyway this is one of late british director andy <UNK> many <UNK> to sleeping <UNK> this one is based on <UNK> todd great <UNK> takes a boring story and still manages to butcher it hey that's pretty funny i said <UNK> sorry i keep getting distracted this isn't exactly easy on second thought i'll make it easy no gore no scares no entertainment just unlikeable annoying people having incoherent conversations that's <UNK> <UNK> oh yeah and something about a <UNK> killing people and something or other about meat <UNK> i don't know it's not important br br for something a little more rewarding from andy <UNK> there's always the only other one i've seen the rats are coming the werewolves are here yeah you heard me but <UNK> about we forget about this <UNK> guy all together and pick up something sweet like sick girl or goes to camp whatever you decide just know <UNK> <UNK> sucks possibly even more than any other version of this already lackluster tale and that b movie fans is really saying something 2 10
<START> set mostly in the back streets of toronto <UNK> is a dark mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman <UNK> and sarah each of whom has a fascination with <UNK> and a disastrous incident in their past fine dialogue and first rate casting <UNK> this low key <UNK> journey into the girl's search for the meaning behind the word <UNK> that keep appearing in her life aided by her anything but enthusiastic male friend the two of them reach the end of their quest but with a price to be paid the film never <UNK> to answer all of its mysteries but does an excellent job in the exposition of several plot twists
<START> i saw this movie with my girlfriend it was a total disaster you can really see it was cheaply made badly scripted and with very bad acting i have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book we couldn't take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained the experience of watching this was like the blair witch visits green <UNK> then there were parts that were vulgar they show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the <UNK> of it the witch throws the <UNK> of it on the boy and the whole family laughs i thought it was nasty and very strange i really can't understand why someone would think that would be entertaining it shows another scene where dr arrives and <UNK> bell is <UNK> in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother how sick the little boy in the first scene of the many scenes dealing with how your body <UNK> of wastes begs for toilet paper and goes to the out house and makes these sickening faces of joy with sound effects i think they should have left all of that out the makeup on the <UNK> james <UNK> as a older man didn't really make you assume he was older it made you think he was <UNK> in fish <UNK> the blood on joshua <UNK> when he falls from the ladder is even worse the john bell death scene looks like they got out <UNK> and tried to do something with it to make him look as a serious sick man to me to much sickening comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this picture these people would do better if they film commercials for local tv stations for bathroom products they chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner i rate this film capital f minus
<START> i love you i could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending my family has not seen this movie yet but i know them too well they will hate it but this time i watched it alone and i found that it affected me greatly although the movie is long in length i was tied to the story and amazed by the ending i initially thought it was weird as to how she just <UNK> but on some level it makes perfect sense br br but like said this movie does not make sense of reality instead it challenges it and the viewer to think strongly about what the word normal means it also gives you the insight to personally think about what the ending means i can say that i loved how it turned out and i'm happy for
<START> sometimes things should just not be made and while the set up seemed good enough it proceeds to only make the audience gasp in horror but the problem is its not another saw film its just so bad you wish you were receiving punishment from jason <UNK> br br i lost track of how many sports movies and spoofs it <UNK> into the film and generally it <UNK> in its attempts true telling his team they should fail every subject to be true players was somewhat funny at first but that grew <UNK> to watch that and the joke about radio and <UNK> br br overall i can't stand to watch this film again even is worth more than this d
<START> terrible adaptation of low key love story an american soldier rock hudson falls in love with a british nurse jennifer jones in italy during world war 1 what's wrong with this virtually everything hudson is way out of his depth here he could be a good actor but not in this movie jones is far too old for her role she's 21 in the book here she's <UNK> and looks it also her acting <UNK> between overdone and <UNK> they took a simple low key love story and blew it all out of <UNK> the film is <UNK> long a little over 150 minutes self indulgent and padded to a ridiculous degree it seems producer david o <UNK> thought he was doing gone with the wind again some of the scenery is truly stunning even on a small tv screen but there's not enough of a story to match the images br br spoiler the ending where jones dies is supposed to be tragic but the bad acting and overblown <UNK> had me fighting not to laugh br br to make matters worse actor <UNK> de <UNK> overacts to a truly embarrassing degree overblown self indulgent badly cast and slow pretty terrible this was understandably a financial and critical bomb and ended <UNK> career as a producer you might want to tune in for some of the scenery at the end but it's really not worth it i give this a 3
<START> and boy is it soft br br i saw this on cable channel bravo one saturday night and here in britain we often have these dire erotic soft core movies turning up late at night on bravo this one follows a weird science type plot of a couple of college <UNK> building a virtual reality <UNK> that makes you have sexual fantasies br br when you <UNK> seen one of these movies you <UNK> seen them all with a bunch of <UNK> looking like they re advertising <UNK> <UNK> come on i <UNK> actually seen breasts in real life i m sure some other of us have too and they <UNK> around unlike here where they defy the laws of if not physics than at least gravity the sex scenes are these tedious affairs where a well <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> himself against his co star without any dialogue or sound apart from some <UNK> and when they climax it looks like they re both having a bad attack of <UNK> the girls themselves are very pretty especially <UNK> davis and <UNK> fritz but they re wasted in these type of soft core movies br br and if it s fantasy you re after i recommend the lord of the rings trilogy
<START> yeah i know his character was supposed to be a drunk and he may have been just acting goofy but something tells this critic that mr <UNK> really was drinking a lot and was <UNK> during his scenes in the film basically everything he says is <UNK> and often <UNK> or maybe it was just the poor productions values hard to say br br anyway the race for the <UNK> is a film that just doesn't work that's a shame too since the film has a terrific opening and a generally interesting plot the production values are just too low and the action just too sparse for this new zealand adventure to deliver the goods the story deals with a us war plane which is filled with gold money and <UNK> which crashes into a lake in new zealand during wwii the plane remains lost for about forty years or so until it somehow <UNK> <UNK> and a drunk <UNK> literally stumbles onto it at first he <UNK> up all the purple heart <UNK> and tries to sell them in town actually getting 75 <UNK> for them little does he know that once he sells them the local gets on the phone and starts trying to track down info about the plane before you can blink all of the attention brings a wealthy <UNK> <UNK> and his henchmen into town and they quickly try to force the old guy to give up the location of the plane since they know there is much more on it than just <UNK> the old <UNK> business partner and his daughter warren then race out to try and claim the fortune before the bad guys can get to it the resulting action just isn't as fun as you'd hope it would be br br the acting is rather awful save for <UNK> george <UNK> tries to do some kind of i guess <UNK> accent but it is hardly convincing <UNK> ann warren isn't too bad but ken is really bad he's basically doing his best impression of michael <UNK> on his worst day and that's saying something hopefully he made enough money on this film to fix his front teeth which looked a bit crooked i don't recall if he'd had them <UNK> by the time he was in <UNK> the rest of the cast are pretty <UNK> probably mostly locals who never did much else i guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the film and the lack of danger the villains are just too nice and goofy to be taken seriously and honestly there are no <UNK> in the film that look like the ones on the dvd cover and none of the <UNK> in the film have teeth painted on them either br br the film does have its strengths though the beginning which starts off as a <UNK> and then becomes part of the story was a nice touch brian <UNK> score sounds a little too much like the one in mad max 2 but he included a nice little march they play for <UNK> in some scenes sounds just like the one in the great escape there are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming the scenery despite the grainy look of the picture is still quite beautiful the thing you'll remember most is the drunken antics of donald <UNK> though he was almost enough to save this film almost 4 of 10 stars br br the <UNK>
<START> dennis patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar joe peter boyle a <UNK> who is getting drunk there at first takes it as a joke but then the story is confirmed on the evening news instead of calling the cops or the like joe decides that since the guy killed a hippie they must be <UNK> spirits he <UNK> the man into becoming his pal at first the film seemed harsh and <UNK> but as it revealed itself it actually became quite a complex portrait of the current society yes i think it does <UNK> a bit but in amusing ways that don't really detract from the power of its messages susan sarandon <UNK> in this film and it's a shock to see how pretty she was around 23 well worth seeing
<START> the movie has a good story line the action is good in some parts but not all of them some of the parts i just felt like the bad guys wouldn't have <UNK> off yet from my experience from taking martial arts some are the actions are long like always mostly for the boss but for the least important ones they were killed or <UNK> off with a few hits but some where quite unrealistic or could have done a better job at br br the least important actors or stunt people were the right picks for the movie my girlfriend started to have a crush on them that she started to watch the movie more than she spends her time with me br br the movie is good that is all i can say
<START> <UNK> shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 fellini <UNK> with bizarre sights and depictions of sexual <UNK> all set in the glory of ancient rome but fellini it ain't first of all it is not as entertaining far too much screen time is devoted to bug eyed rubber faced mcdowell in the titular role his performance is far too <UNK> and campy to be convincing the portrayals by jay robinson in the <UNK> 1953 and david cain in emperor <UNK> 1983 are far more <UNK> and believable with the latter being the most nuanced relief could have been provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully as it is they are little more than <UNK> one example is the role of <UNK> played by <UNK> who has tremendous screen presence in an important role but is mostly left in the background the only positive features to credit are the <UNK> use of some and themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the <UNK> but nevertheless accurate actions of the <UNK> these two factors are far less than what is needed to <UNK> the <UNK> tedium however
<START> this film was pure trash not the worse film ever if it were to be broken down the acting was good enough to get the job done but the script was so out there and so stupid that one was left thinking where did my life go even vanessa redgrave whom i love and is the reason i watched this was wasted utterly wasted she didn't even leave an impression the directing was so distant that non of the characters left me much of anything but to see redgrave leave nothing her part was nothing she was good as a mean boss but that was it do depth and she's given depth to small roles see <UNK> and <UNK> i would not waste my time and was upset to have spent the 5 on this movie i wanted it back no returns skip the film it'll only bring you grief and boredom
<START> my <UNK> career ended in 1974 when my two by four <UNK> with steel roller <UNK> <UNK> hit a rock and i <UNK> for days it seemed down the sidewalk outside my <UNK> house in boston by the time the cast came off my arm summer was gone br br but i have always admired the x games types and surfers especially i think i spent the first month after i moved to southern california on the <UNK> and <UNK> watching the surfers <UNK> that fact that i had missed my calling it's the sort of thing you should learn young before the horrible senses of self <UNK> and self awareness <UNK> in or else at best you'll be so worried about not getting hurt or laughed at you'll wind up looking like a trained bear br br i always admired how a good <UNK> seems to not care about anything but that moment that wave that experience at one with the forces of nature a good <UNK> makes it look like there is nothing else but that wave right there and the way you interact with it there's a lot of <UNK> in it to me br br this documentary <UNK> how a few young folks took the surfing concepts and extended them to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> low sweeping <UNK> while <UNK> with the <UNK> waves beneath their feet in their day and time this was all new radical prior to the <UNK> team the idea apparently was to go as fast as you could in a straight line on a <UNK> hence my long <UNK> <UNK> at palace like <UNK> down the front walk br br this film is a look back through time to an america before everything was labeled <UNK> <UNK> and jam forced down our throats as extreme seriously what's so extreme about an extreme value meal at <UNK> bell other than the fact that it is an extreme <UNK> to your <UNK> br br watch this film and watch the birth of before there was an x games before boom boom <UNK> jam before <UNK> demons before the there were these young street <UNK> who created without really trying they were just doing it for the <UNK> the pure pleasure of <UNK> in the sun with friends br br i hope they get a cut of the <UNK> money out there goodness knows they don't get the credit they deserve maybe this film can correct that br br excellent film with a great soundtrack a portrait of a southern california indeed an america that no longer exists br br i don't care for sean penn but he does a decent job <UNK>
<START> i was really looking forward to seeing this movie having spent a few fantastic college weeks in <UNK> myself the premise is right on cue a confused <UNK> young individual enters a world of equally confused <UNK> young individuals but the director's weak at symbolism philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark and it leaves us the audience feeling confused <UNK> bravo br br perhaps if this movie had been presented as a european american pie flick then i'd be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride but right off the bat the director our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted <UNK> and the <UNK> of the inner self vs the public self one's mother tongue vs one's secondary language furthermore it <UNK> <UNK> into the subject of racial national stereotyping off to an interesting start eh br br wrong that's as far as it goes these interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived <UNK> type ending which seemed to be the director's way of <UNK> to get back on topic it reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere but the <UNK> ends by saying so in conclusion i hope you see how this relates to my original thought br br furthermore as other reviewers have pointed out the cynical <UNK> at stereotyping betrays itself if the point is to <UNK> the use of national stereotypes then why did the director introduce a cockney speaking beer <UNK> english brat as a caricature of prejudice why did the director portray the american as a <UNK> literally <UNK> his chest making ape noises at one point whilst the europeans tolerate him why is the british girl the one who sinks to <UNK> <UNK> calling french people <UNK> and <UNK> the french language while everyone else is above all that the answer is that this isn't a deep or well thought out film it's simply an <UNK> to the but really it's no different from the prejudice it seeks to <UNK> now there's a funny irony to consider br br ok philosophy artistry <UNK> political commentary aside i was still very bored by this movie there is one very funny gag which involves <UNK> one of the girls' boyfriends but aside from that i was hardly entertained at all the only reason why i watched it through to the end is that i'd like to brush up on my french spanish you see we americans may be stupid but we do try
