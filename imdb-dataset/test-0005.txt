<START> ok so i gotta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for months i use to watch its trailer and think it looked really cool little did i know that the only cool thing about this cliché driven turd was precisely its trailer br br at the cinema i watched the first 3 frames of this movie and though to myself no way this movie is so bad don't be an idiot give it a chance you've only seen 3 minutes while i rolled my eyes in shame all those frames showed get this a guy with a poker face because he feels nothing that's deep looking straight at the camera in the middle of the frame in the second or third one he stays awake in his perfectly made bed because he sleeps like a dead guy cause he feels nothing and his father calls and says john garden state is me your father oh come on i've seen a little more than a couple flicks to hate clichés such as the is me your insert parent how the hell am i supposed to react oh he has a tough relationship with him uh yeah thats exactly how i'm supposed to react br br man this is a crappy movie br br <UNK> as the flick goes on we learn things about his friends of which everyone is a alternative <UNK> walking indie movie for example one of his <UNK> is a guy who works in a medieval themed restaurant who speaks <UNK> bizarre characters pop culture your standard american indie flick then we know natalie <UNK> character who is a copy of jones from a movie that kicks butt chasing amy <UNK> and that chick from eternal sunshine you know smart original not really <UNK> beautiful and in touch with her sexuality she <UNK> some '70s band named the <UNK> and gives what they're from this damn decade then why do they sound like that oh they have no personality ok so she hands her cd player to john garden state and he looks at her with a dumb face you know love as the song played on i heard its lyrics saying you will love this soundtrack it is so alternative and cool you will love this movie it will define you and your generation even if it is a <UNK> of the breakfast club ghost world and every other smart teen movie from the last 20 years you will drink coffee and read books you don't understand br br by now really unoriginal sh t starts to happen he doesn't care if he dies in a airplane crash because he is already dead and he feels nothing and he lets us know in a scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called fight club it is a cool scene but oh did i mentioned it appeared in the trailer then in some party and just when you think this guy is really deep and <UNK> he makes out with a bimbo so oh he's not such a emotional zombie after all clever character development or just a sh <UNK> movie well lets analyze that scene it features him sitting <UNK> in a couch with everyone else moving in really fast speed scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called <UNK> from a dream so just a sh <UNK> sh <UNK> movie br br then they meet more eccentric cliché actually characters and finally one that lives next to a big hole in the ground john garden state says some crap like good luck exploring your <UNK> <UNK> and the guy says and by now i wanted to really choke myself you too and then we are gently told that neo is jesus oh no wait thats from another dumb obvious repetitive <UNK> and cliché piece of crap br br finally finally some more crap happens and he enters the big warehouse showdown to <UNK> the bombs he has to talk to his dad who he hasn't seen in the last <UNK> years cause he finally cool spoilers killed his own mom you see he killed his mom so he's also dead and feels nothing that's deep now i really expected just clever and moving <UNK> like dialogue between a father and a son but this is garden state so this is pretty much it john garden state father i forgive you you didn't know what you were doing when you drugged me for a <UNK> years but i know you love me crappy director's dad no no i'm gonna say some simple stuff cause i'm not really so deep of a character anyway like this whole movie actually so no john garden state no dad we must get along cause we are equal individuals i mean different individuals crappy director's dad no no ok you convinced me br br and he gets the girl cause he's no longer dead you know and the movie ends and i go and eat a piece of chicken that makes my day br br this made for trailer movie sucks
<START> written by someone who has been there you can tell but only if you've been there excellent performances by meryl streep of course <UNK> <UNK> and william hurt br br many people have said that it is about a dysfunctional family i think every family is dysfunctional when they are facing this kind of torment to not be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional you are losing your family as you know it can anything be worse people need to see this movie so when they are faced with this nightmare maybe they will change how they do it maybe they will see that the father is denying himself valuable time he'll never get a chance at again maybe they will realize how hard it is to die or to watch someone you love die they didn't miss much of the nightmare it's hard to forget
<START> br br her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has worked in countless movies over life time i think best is yet to come br br fire is ok br br but still good days are yet to come br br hopefully in water i will be able see her better br br thanks and regards br br ps india doesn't have a director to make best use of her
<START> this is more than just an adaptation of bond it's a plain rip off with mediocre character sketches that ian <UNK> would not have <UNK> of this film goes down as the worst <UNK> movie an older even <UNK> connery tries to <UNK> his past 12 years later the result is a <UNK> tacky version of the classic hero give me roger moore any day
<START> this movie may bear some historical importance and it sure seems astonishing how well the facts are together the setting the rocket the space suits the surface of the moon all scream a classic but in the end the result makes a pretty dull movie for todays eyes and the <UNK> tech scenes you might hope for in a movie like this are by far not enough to reward sitting through all the tacky dialog and predictable plot developments the characters and plot may reward a scientific <UNK> analysis but bear too little entertainment value many times br br much of this movie seems like a good movie for nine year olds the mature themes the human drama and the violence are kept to a level for children as well br br the images of the earth and the moon seen from space may actually be more accurate than the ones in 2001 but so what if their use is dramatically <UNK> especially 2001 may seem like a stretched out <UNK> over themes of this movie and has star wars not somehow <UNK> it's space <UNK> opening titles on the opening titles of this film but then again the inheritance is <UNK> br br if its a real groundbreaking and mega influential mature sci fi classic you are looking for however check out forbidden planet
<START> i loved this movie it was cute and funny lauren holly was wonderful she's funny and very believable in her role <UNK> was also very good nice to look at too brenda <UNK> as usual was a pleasure to watch she did a great job with her character it was a pleasure watching a movie that is funny interesting and can be watched by the whole family it's difficult to find nice wholesome movies anymore thank goodness for the hallmark movies they are wonderful i wish i could buy it if anyone knows where i could purchase this movie please let me know i have purchase several hallmark movies and am very happy with them i hope i can buy this one
<START> dirty war is absolutely one of the best political government and well written t v <UNK> in the 25 years br br the acting is superb the writing is spectacular br br <UNK> war reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a nuclear <UNK> and terrorist attack here on american <UNK> br br dirty war should be made into a major motion picture it's that good i highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth br br this t v drama reveals how british intelligence <UNK> <UNK> attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims because of <UNK> involvement in the iraq war br br the scenes of different parts of london england are also spectacular br br dirty war is a must see
<START> this is truly a documentary of love about a fascinating character her <UNK> on life and her extended family the filmmakers spent three years <UNK> sister helen at her halfway house and managed to capture so much wonderful material that you can not help but feel you know sister helen and her boys the house holds 21 recovering <UNK> each with a story almost as involving as sister <UNK> the ending scenes are particularly involving and emotional br br sister <UNK> story of marriage addiction and loss reveals a very complex character who's tough love is at all times funny touching and endearing br br the film is a amazing in the way it tells its story in wonderful slice of life sequences which develop into a story that is almost as clear as if each scene were scripted and acted by the best the honesty and obvious <UNK> of the <UNK> is very involving as you learn of their fears and watch their attempts to grow br br you will never forget sister helen robert moe or poor spelling
<START> ever since i've been allowed to play <UNK> once again it's been impossible to get my mind off it i'm surprised i could have gone without it it is without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time i have never played any other shooting games but i know that this one rules above all most people blame it for too much violence but i find that ridiculous there may be a few graphic antics but there's far worse out there br br most importantly it's fun with an awesome <UNK> of weapons such as the <UNK> and the classic golden gun you'll go through several challenging levels from the movie <UNK> crucial <UNK> and <UNK> off <UNK> of guards there are tons of awesome <UNK> to get and even two secret levels that you will only earn if you have the true skill <UNK> is also one of the greatest <UNK> games ever as well you can choose several characters from the movie classic villains from old <UNK> movies baron <UNK> <UNK> may day and jaws and guards in the game chances are you and your partner s will be laughing so hard as you blow each other away that you'll look like bart and lisa simpson watching an episode of the itchy and <UNK> show br br so if you don't have the game don't rent it just buy it it's too good to be true for cool <UNK> stuff check out <UNK> <UNK> website every james bond lover will dig this game big time
<START> in addition to all the negative reviews i was amazed to see that at the drop of a hat somewhere somehow a <UNK> camera was <UNK> at a most unlikely location to show the team what was going on notably near the <UNK> <UNK> where the professor is hit at full wind force against the head by a heavy object and subsequently lives to tell the story otherwise i was unable to shake off the image of some actors as portrayed in other films programs i said to my wife <UNK> that's neil from the young <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> they <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for help ' david <UNK> to add to the disgrace of this film shown in two parts on <UNK> uk recently <UNK> showed the <UNK> number of the environment agency after each episode for worried viewers living in areas <UNK> risk of how low can you as a <UNK> go to treat your audience like that what must the environment agency have thought <UNK> no it's mrs jones from <UNK> again she says she was right all along she saw it on
<START> i have always been fascinated by silent films there is something about seeing actors and actresses from 100 years ago performing jaded by today's high tech special effects i always try and imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of it's original release it helps to appreciate the <UNK> of early cinema br br the life and passion of jesus christ is a very charming production from <UNK> originally filmed in <UNK> but expanded and finally released in <UNK> imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life separated by title cards and you will have a pretty good idea of what this film is like for example the scene in which mary and joseph rest as they are escaping to egypt is almost identical to luc olivier painting rest on the flight to egypt right down to mary sitting on the famous <UNK> while some might find these living paintings an unimaginative cop out i found them to be very charming and very nostalgic br br the sets and costumes appear to be right out of a stage production of the life of christ possibly from and elaborate passion play of the day the make up on the cast is very theatrical so much so that a close up of jesus is almost comical again where others might be bothered by the of them i was quite <UNK> br br having been filmed over a period of 3 years the continuity isn't too bad the biggest flaws are in the casting changes made over that time the characters of john the <UNK> and the 12 year old jesus change in mid scene much to the audiences surprise br br the best unintentional humor of the film is in the birth of jesus scene the baby literally appears as if by magic in the <UNK> between mary and joseph maybe it was simply my frame of mind at the time i viewed it but i laughed out loud if only child birth were that easy to top it off the actress who plays mary looks bored through the whole scene actually through the whole movie as if this sort of thing happens every day my how times have changed br br as simplistic as this film is compared to today it's really a wonderful window into the past i recommend it br br
<START> the dvd for this film is by <UNK> video a company that almost always releases the <UNK> quality <UNK> in defense often that is the only print available but the <UNK> in public <UNK> and cheap o films if you can find another print by a different company try it first as the print for this film is <UNK> and faded still compared to most <UNK> dvds this one is excellent especially since the sound is pretty clear and <UNK> never seems to include closed even with films with horrid sound br br a man has been dating a lady for a very long time one night he's a bad boy and spends the night with another woman soon <UNK> he comes clean to his fiancée about this she <UNK> him and they marry br br very soon after the wedding he gets a frantic call from the other woman she needs to see him and has just tried to kill herself when they meet he learns that she has an <UNK> and she wanted him to know that he too might now have it then although there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt she somehow finds a gun and kills herself the makes a huge mistake he does not tell his doctor and he doesn't tell his new wife some time passes and now she and the baby are infected at this point the doctor meets with the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment and they shows him rooms filled with horribly infected people actually these were just films of people with <UNK> that they spliced into the film most of whom have <UNK> br br in some ways the film is very <UNK> it <UNK> a serious issue and it's interesting how the film encourages couples not to wait to get married but to marry fast and give in to those sexual <UNK> but only with each other not bad advice at all on the other hand the film never exactly says what it's talking about they never use the terms <UNK> <UNK> or the like nor does it even name the <UNK> often it is referring to <UNK> but at other times it's talking about <UNK> or other <UNK> the information just isn't very clear or specific a very common problem with such films from this era audiences at the time must have felt quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their friends explain it all to them br br speaking of such films in the 1930s 50s lots of small and often sleazy production companies made films <UNK> the dangers of drugs and sex though often they really just wanted to promise a bit of <UNK> for audiences who usually could not see such <UNK> fare in hollywood films many of these are hysterically funny since they are so over done and the information so inaccurate the most famous examples are <UNK> madness and sex madness both by the same two bit production company and compared to how <UNK> and stupid those two films are this cheap film seems like it should be in the <UNK> collection br br interestingly there are <UNK> out there i would definitely be included among them that enjoy seeing the films because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are great fun this one however isn't that bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims isn't as grotesque as some similar films while the message really should have been more explicit and useful for a 1933 film it's pretty good despite the occasionally poor acting and the ludicrous suicide scene remember kids just say <UNK> to suicide br br oh by the way the two years of treatment they talk about in the film was actually the norm for <UNK> back in 1933 nowadays it's a lot more as are the rest of the <UNK>
<START> not me if it came down to it i could kick a <UNK> ass and that's why this movie doesn't work for me if it was me against the alien or jason or hell i <UNK> any other horror movie antagonist then <UNK> be no contest and i'd have my ass handed to me <UNK> divine <UNK> a horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with a creature person being <UNK> whatever that is more powerful or <UNK> or intelligent than they are and then people think <UNK> what if that happened to <UNK> and they get scared and that's why this is a horrible idea for a story i can't imagine myself being <UNK> by a dog so i'm not scared
<START> it takes a lot for a movie to reach the already <UNK> <UNK> of my brain which have not already been <UNK> out due to the and world of movies but this movie has made it onto my <UNK> <UNK> list to become a <UNK> <UNK> it must leave every string of my being <UNK> in that which i can only define as and this movie has <UNK> into the <UNK> of how my mind thinks and if not for the deeply personal bond my head and the head of whoever made this shares it would look like another <UNK> rave <UNK> movie from back when the 90's <UNK> with its ecstasy <UNK> this is not how the movie came off to me at all it's reached into me and pulled up something that i thought was dead for a very long time and pushed me as far as to give it a critique of my own i forgot how long it's been since i've seen something that left me feeling this good inside i strongly suggest seeing this movie
<START> accepted let's see the only reason why i had chosen to see that movie was the hot dog shown in commercials when <UNK> said ask me about my <UNK> after that i had to see that movie and i watched it with a couple of my friends and wow amazing one of the best films of the year the entire movie i was laughing like crazy the plot in this story is that <UNK> justin long doesn't get accepted into any of the schools he applied so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he did make it into college so he makes the finishing touches and he fools his parents until more students look at the website and see the acceptance is one click away and all these rejects come to this school they face many problems and they just cant seem to get anything right 10 10 loved it now watch it
<START> ghost story has an interesting feminist revenge tale premise a list veteran actors colorful flashbacks with nifty look a like youthful counterparts of the old men scary <UNK> music <UNK> the approaching horrors atmospheric new england winter weather and an excellent charismatic actress in the title role ghost story could have been much more effective in black and white and in <UNK> some of the more lurid special effects and to presenting a more <UNK> screenplay we should not have to be wondering about why the two trailer <UNK> are in the script the biggest <UNK> of the film is craig definitely separated at birth from bill <UNK> who from perhaps editing or just bad acting is totally <UNK> he seems to <UNK> in wide eyed wide mouthed reaction shots not a lot of personality here the revelation however is alice <UNK> pale faced enigmatic terrifying underneath the <UNK> exterior however her eva <UNK> is creepy even before she meets her fate i mean a young woman who says things like i'd like to take a bite out of you or dance with me you little <UNK> is already not in the land of the living ghost story would have been much better in a low key val <UNK> mode the overdone special effects completely <UNK> the chill factor
<START> just watched this film on tv and it was awesome br br had just planned on watching it whilst doing some work however i ended up watching the whole film with out doing work as it was so good br br actors my not be very well know but the story line makes up for it the fact that the actors make are less well known only makes it more believable that the events could occur i did not feel a biased towards one character as i have no judgement of the types of character as i have never seen any of the actors in a film before which made it even more enjoyable br br would recommend watching it
<START> keys to the <UNK> is one of the most entertaining informative and hilarious shows that is on television right now the idea is original and well executed as it manages to <UNK> the reality aspect but still remain entertaining all of the judges have a razor wit they're not the <UNK> at all times but if you're looking for comfort go watch a chick flick say what you like about <UNK> of the show but it is absolutely real i know people who have <UNK> on the show and they have confirmed this br br if you want to laugh watch this show it is on of the best comedy shows ever made
<START> loving the <UNK> fairy <UNK> as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries on this odd though brilliant author i eagerly looked forward to see this made for tv film unfortunately the experience was nothing but a disappointment leaving me in anger and confusion first of all the story script is filled with inaccuracies and downright fantasies and in this way creating almost a completely new story while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fairy tales presumably in order to sell the crap to <UNK> like me secondly pretty boy actor really ever seen a picture of the real <UNK> <UNK> manages to portray hans christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant though very disturbed character he indeed was though annoying and irritating like <UNK> <UNK> is missing the required charisma to create any feelings of compassion what so ever <UNK> the love story between <UNK> and the fictional whom actually should be <UNK> the wife of <UNK> why this man has lived such an interesting life it should be enough as a foundation to a great movie br br i could continue this to be a very long list but feel it <UNK> to simply recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead
<START> man with the screaming brain certainly isn't a perfect movie but i'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career slapstick sarcasm cheese action and happy endings campbell is as a writer uneven there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been <UNK> into it and some of the scenes feel like <UNK> of other better <UNK> the scene in the restaurant where and william battle for control of <UNK> body is straight out of evil dead ii there are however lots of little touches and non <UNK> that feel rather brilliant such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue what are you looking at the movie looks like a sci fi channel original probably because it was the acting is actually pretty good i particularly enjoyed <UNK> as she was ruthless and cunning yes but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored ted <UNK> handled the standard bumbling assistant role admirably enough and bruce is funny as the arrogant <UNK> condescending american jerk now that he's writing his own films you'd think he'd give himself a role that he hasn't been <UNK> in already man with the screaming brain is a bizarre nonsensical b movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously
<START> <UNK> is an indie thriller about four young adults who get a ride late one night on a <UNK> bus from the airport to find out that the driver is a sadistic psychopath br br although some of the sequences of scares and it's <UNK> interesting plot work some aspects just don't the bad dialogue and unlikeable characters gives a good reason to not care for them but often the suspense works and asks you the question of what would you do and usually what you would do isn't what these idiots on the <UNK> do br br if you're expecting a mindless bloody horror film you'll be mistaken this is a film that causes you to use your mind but unfortunately not until the end br br four out of ten
<START> this film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in <UNK> in fact it is now more available with two other medium sized silent chaplin features a <UNK> life and the <UNK> that chaplin re released in the 1950s in it's day shoulder arms was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach it still is very funny chaplin in disguise as a tree <UNK> on the germans is so ridiculous it's hysterical but it suffers from being set in it's own age charlie's dealing with world war i a hideous conflict that killed 20 million people but not the worst war horrible to say of the 20th century chaplin would live to see that war too and would spoof it's main <UNK> in the great dictator but the latter is more accessible to modern audiences because that movie is a talking picture also hitler as a target seems more important to audiences in 2008 than <UNK> <UNK> ii and his general staff br br shoulder arms was to take us through the <UNK> of the tramp his training his getting use to <UNK> <UNK> and his actual fighting against the <UNK> on the western front much of this is now gone one segment when albert austin is a doctor <UNK> chaplin in his office at the draft center is still in existence and was shown completely in the documentary unknown chaplin this is unfortunate because the film is now roughly forty five minutes long and there seems to be gaps that these scenes filled out what remains is first rate but one leaves wanting more and feeling a <UNK> cheated br br sydney chaplin and henry bergman do well in supporting parts especially sydney as <UNK> he had done it before in a short with charlie for the sale of bonds giving a <UNK> speech before being <UNK> by the tramp with a huge hammer labeled war bonds here we see the tramp succeed in capturing <UNK> and the general staff at the conclusion it was only topped by stan and ollie capturing the german army with a tank and <UNK> wire in pack up your troubles br br the funny thing is that chaplin actually had a major crisis as a result of his wartime activities he was not a <UNK> american not in <UNK> or in <UNK> when attorney general <UNK> announced that chaplin could not return to the u s because he was an enemy alien chaplin and his family were in europe on a trip in anger charlie settled in switzerland for the rest of his life except when he made a <UNK> from hong kong and when he went to hollywood for his special career oscar in the 1970s because he was not an american he could not be <UNK> by the u s so he sold with douglas fairbanks sr and mary pickford u s war bonds but in great britain <UNK> of thousands had <UNK> in world war one <UNK> and the public there was upset at chaplin who they considered a <UNK> and a coward chaplin eventually did overcome this but <UNK> of the <UNK> followed him until he died this does not detract from the success of shoulder arms as a film but it does suggest why chaplin did not do another modern war film until 1940 and a target
<START> well the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected it's not boring and it's not unoriginal it's really not a silly romantic comedy the situations the characters put themselves in are very unusual of course we're still talking about a movie but the main characters are indeed plausible donald is of course an exaggeration but he's just a <UNK> in the movie a means to prove something the ending isn't one of those ridiculously happy always the same moral containing pieces of crap you can usually see in movies of the genre i genuinely liked it and i'm hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies it's worth a watch besides it's better directed than other movies the story line always stands up the characters themselves stand up and they do not experience this <UNK> change and love is not revealed to them like a holly god given <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all the movie makes you feel something you may even learn a thing or two it's not the usual hope producing <UNK> idiocy it's a good movie not a <UNK> prize for <UNK> women around the world
<START> so i caught this one afternoon as what lies above and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising the heroine diana <UNK> is a mountain climbing expert but that doesn't help her when her fiancé brian gets hurt on a climb when she goes off to get help and returns he disappears from the mountain never to be seen again br br two years later diana is still a <UNK> but she won't go near <UNK> pass that is until <UNK> <UNK> appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program she agrees and they take off up the mountain with two <UNK> his bodyguard hugo and the computer <UNK> tyler from the start you know that there's some <UNK> motive going on but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie br br the major <UNK> are the red herrings most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to <UNK> the object from the sky that fell into the mountains which turns out to be not so supernatural the story of how <UNK> pass came to be and the most memorable one of them all <UNK> dream sequence halfway through the movie but what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball the majority of the movie revolves around the search for brian that's why i can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie this was the major plot this was how the movie started how do you not wrap that up br br i wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one
<START> this is the battlefield earth of mini series it has with a few exceptions all the disastrous ingredients that doomed that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery they are both adaptations of books with a endless amount of pages who has been turned to a complete mess by a script writer and a director in this case they are the same person who clearly don't know what they are doing they have both a <UNK> wannabe that don't really deliver as a hero played in this case by a guy that looks like mark <UNK> but sadly the force is not with him and a bunch of stupid bad guys who likes to <UNK> and mess up the life for each other they are both containing scenes stolen from better productions and they are both cheap productions who tries to look expensive with some often badly made computer animation the exceptions that actually makes the whole thing worse is the terrible work made by the lighting guy who don't even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room the camera work that for no reasons at all sometimes are in <UNK> battlefield earth mode but for the most of the time are flat as a <UNK> the extremely cheap and to small desert set that only <UNK> a pile of sand in the front of a backdrop painted as a desert that turns very old very fast because it appears in almost every scene and the bad idea by the costume designer to try to <UNK> the fifth element 's fashion madness with the addition of the <UNK> hats ever made silly moments to remember 1 every scene with the <UNK> guys who looks like <UNK> <UNK> guys but with silly hats 2 shows up at the party dressed in her <UNK> dress why was the one with stuffed <UNK> in the <UNK> with matching silly hat together with a couple of guys with silly balloon hats 3 paul the stand up comedian 4 baron in over acting <UNK> screaming i m alive 5 every scene with the backdrop because it newer fits the <UNK> 6 every scene with the fake religious specially the water of life 7 the battle scenes where the same guys gets killed a couple times and the same things explodes over and over again it is a lot more but it is a 1000 words limit on this so i better stop before i gets carried away
<START> a chilling and gory tale of a couple <UNK> a 150 room italian castle while still <UNK> the loss of their young son the couples marriage seems to be on the rocks due to the car accident that took the life of their son and left their daughter blind upon taking <UNK> of the castle for a future sale a hideous tortured and <UNK> creature breaks lose from the <UNK> of the <UNK> century castle pretty gory with great horror atmosphere and some sexual overtones starring jeffrey combs barbara <UNK> jessica and <UNK>
<START> my friends and i rented this movie simply to satisfy a friend who was very bent on renting it despite having no idea what it was about we all thought it would be like a canadian american pie but when we watched it we were completely surprised we were all silent throughout the movie and loved it it was nothing like american pie and had a plot that teenage girls are sure to adore seeing as the guy gets the crap beaten out of him at the end after that night it became my favorite movie for not only it's plot but the actors and the great writing there wasn't a moment where i thought that it was unbelievable everything is very realistic and relate able for anybody living in a small town with little <UNK> i absolutely adore this movie and would recommend you to rent it next time you have a chance it's worth it
<START> it's difficult to criticize a movie with the title like the bed that and involves a ghost narrator who's trapped behind a 2 way painting he drew and a bed that and  if i'm not mistaken <UNK> now that's getting back at its human companions furthermore it up in orange for whatever reason to <UNK> lying on its surface including <UNK> wine fried chicken and of course people again it's suffice to say that don't expect too much when you see what i guess is stomach acid  the final remains of anything that orange <UNK> takes  <UNK> only certain things it'll drink the wine but the okay and it'll eat away at the chicken bone but the just fine heck the bed even <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> hilariously at one point it downs <UNK> <UNK> i had to laugh at that one i don't think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously it's low budget and it's extremely easy to see where they cut costs and saved <UNK> amounts of money i thought in a world where there can be a killer and a <UNK> beach ' this might be amusing to watch for reasons that might involve cost 90 of the film is voice over no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fright confusion on why a bed would attack i can think of one  and i never was one of those kids that jumped on the bed and you'll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief a victim loses all flesh on his hands barely saying <UNK> only one scene that went on too long was <UNK> tense  a woman attempts to crawl away only to be dragged back using a sheet where are the mst3k guys
<START> when jean <UNK> the young <UNK> for the sole purpose of annoying her husband little does she realise the explosive drama that is to follow br br the short scenario does not waste a word or a frame in this brief <UNK> in the day of a dysfunctional family the lives of the father mother and son are all linked in some way with the <UNK> it's this fact that makes the script so intriguing br br for such a short film the production is every bit as professional as any major work and the casting is ideal br br a wonderful little film that can guarantee a few laughs from beginning to end
<START> i love a cute heartfelt movie with a happy ending this movie could be considered a drama bout two characters realizing true love but the story's so touching and so sweet that in my mind its a romance granted the acting is not so great thats y i didn't give it a 10 but they do the job and they don't <UNK> thank god plus they're cute but the story's powerful and just plain adorable some of u <UNK> will choke up its a great watch for a love story but if <UNK> <UNK> stay away for everyone else i loved the movie its <UNK> sweet i felt its a <UNK> on a smaller scale but with a happy ending so enjoy
<START> saw this movie and totally loved it the characters are great it is definitely my kind of movie you do not get bored in this movie i love independent films they are so much more rewarding my husband and i really enjoyed <UNK> style if you are an open minded person who loves thought provoking films and loves conversation after it's over you will love this film it is definitely thought provoking the film definitely will step on some <UNK> but who cares those people will probably not go to see this movie it is amazing to see the characters <UNK> jay <UNK> has really captured both sides of the table applause applause jay i hope you are working on another movie
<START> i really don't understand who this movie is aimed at from just the absurdity of it not to mention the ridiculously bad acting cheesy dialogue and the fact that the villain is a child i'd assume this was meant to be a children's movie but i think there may be more swear words than pulp fiction not to mention constant references to drugs and general mayhem and killing so which <UNK> is it trying to please this movie is too <UNK> like trying to combine country music with heavy metal in the end no one is going to like it because it's a bloody <UNK> i would recommend this movie because it's so funny in a bad way except the actors are so <UNK> unbearable that i wouldn't want to suggest otherwise br br i'm completely serious when i say that i could not watch more than 15 minutes of this
<START> i grew up in new york and this show came on when i was four years old i had half day <UNK> and this was on <UNK> channel 11 in the afternoon i just loved the music and stories and remember <UNK> them around the house when playing br br i just saw part of an episode on youtube and for a moment i could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child i of course stopped watching when i got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out no <UNK> or back then i grew up not realizing that the show was still on until i was in <UNK> grade br br i also had no idea that there are dvd's and wish my <UNK> and <UNK> were young enough to enjoy this show but now they're all past the <UNK> or i'd buy all of them dvd sets this was so much better than a lot of the kid shows today
<START> this is one of the <UNK> best tv series ever with all the great suspense story and a cast of absolutely fantastic actors and love and grief that really gets you involved and captivated in front of your tv if you have seen it once you will go back to see it again i have several times and still do it the 20 <UNK> <UNK> best drama
<START> i've expected a comedy about the <UNK> but this is a parody it shows the national army of eastern germany in a light that is not appropriate and definitely not true br br one can make a comedy about everything as long as the underlying facts are not changed even a comedy about the german is possible as <UNK> <UNK> with life is beautiful has shown br br the movie <UNK> would be an ok comedy because the jokes in it are overall ok nothing special not hilarious but enough to live with it br br the point is that the movie makes a farce and a parody about the <UNK> a death machine that was ready to attack western europe along with it's friend the red army an institution that used everything to get the <UNK> from it's soldiers an army that <UNK> into the in 1968 and was ready to march also in <UNK> to destroy the you can't make a movie without showing the <UNK> bit of evil or would you make a parody about a <UNK> or 9 11 showing <UNK> bin laden as a funny screwed guy 90 minutes about a funny <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> camp where he makes jokes and is training his soldiers would be comparable to what this movie is doing about the <UNK>
<START> i heard this movie was even warned me it was terrible but for some reason probably katie holmes i still watched it when it came on national tv watching kevin <UNK> films means torturing his scenarios aren't funny definitely not scary and not the least bit creative teaching mrs <UNK> <UNK> the same irritating atmosphere as his brainless series <UNK> and it's probably meant for the same target group as well before the credits even started 5 people already wanted a hug and they stated that eerie i love <UNK> sentence it doesn't get any better as the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop rock and the storyline is ultra thin three students on the verge of <UNK> get caught cheating by the teacher in school every high school has a teacher like that you <UNK> to save their skin they try to convince mrs <UNK> that it wasn't their intention to cheat but this attempt goes horrible wrong the typical high school humor is completely lost on me the <UNK> of sentiment is pathetic and the acting with the exception of helen <UNK> is <UNK> i'm sure katie holmes can act  that's a fact <UNK> by her role in the  but she <UNK> needs to stop accepting <UNK> girl roles as said before the only positive comments goes out to the brilliant casting of helen <UNK> as the <UNK> it's like kathleen turner in serial <UNK> the role suits her perfectly and you can't imagine anyone else playing her other than that this is <UNK> teenage nonsense
<START> hello looking for a movie for the family to watch on a friday night can't find what your looking for i thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie good for the whole family i found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike it was brilliant to say the least bruce acting was top notch there was a lot of humor in it and overall a great movie in my opinion it's a must see movie and i don't think that about a lot of movies believe me when i say it takes a lot for a movie to get me to think that it's clear that there was much work done by bruce willis and cast to get this movie done excellent story good acting and again overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie
<START> snakes on a plane was such a well hyped film that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year let alone the same week reading the other comments here i see the results a lot of people are mad mad because it doesn't have the best special effects mad because it doesn't have a star cast mad because they wanted to see samuel jackson say i'm sick of these m er f ing snakes on this m er f ing train br br well this sure ain't the samuel jackson version and maybe that's good br br snakes on a plane was lost between cop film and horror a family action film and a bloody gory movie of death saturday night live performers got laughs while jackson <UNK> enough to make a grandmother cover her ears and as far as kids go they would be traumatized by the violence br br snakes on a train however knew exactly what it was this was a cheaply made horror movie on a train sure it had snakes and sure many of them were <UNK> harmless garden snakes with fake <UNK> sound effects but never once did it miss a step in its plot or intention where as the on a plane version was <UNK> all over itself from the first scene on br br i did enjoy the over the top fun that snakes on a plane had to offer and i admit that the on a train version was a little dry but hey in trade it was a cool and unexpected story this little horror film could have gone way more wrong than it did br br for this it gets a 7 out of 10
<START> in my personal opinion i think this is the greatest video game ever created i first played this game at my friends house years ago the very next day i went out and got my own since that day close to seven years ago i have not stopped playing it i can't help it i just can't get bored of it i've been addicted to other games on other much newer systems but i keep coming back for more <UNK> every mission is amazingly fun and challenging the multi player mode was like none other i hope you can be as fortunate as i was to have played four player multi player mode because i had brothers and friends who would get together and play this game all the time
<START> <UNK> is certainly an experience and a out of the ordinary experience at that the use of colour is fascinating and at times frustrating a lot of what happens on screen is incredibly difficult to make out your view is either <UNK> by a sudden bizarre change in colour and tone characters in the way and random cuts to the sky the sound is very haunting and a welcome addition it really aids the <UNK> and hopeless tone that <UNK> this film br br as for what <UNK> is about the rape of the environment and <UNK> theory feels pretty accurate to me but i wouldn't spend a lot of time focusing on the meaning it's virtually <UNK> it's clear the director didn't want to explain anything he simply presents it as it is and if you want to search for a meaning that's up to you br br watching <UNK> is definitely not a walk in the park but i was captivated from the opening it really is like watching a person's worst nightmare what we see is at times <UNK> and very unpleasant but there is a surreal <UNK> beauty in there if you're an art house experimental fan and you haven't yet seen <UNK> make it a <UNK> i doubt you will ever forget it i sure know that i won't
<START> having been raised in canada i saw this short many times mostly on the cbc i have seen it numerous times at many ages in my life and each time the reactions are the same it is a <UNK> bittersweet beautifully animated film that <UNK> at your heart i am sure i have it on some vhs tape somewhere digging around br br every kid growing up can relate to the situation and wanting to fit in with your favourite <UNK> the scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the <UNK> and his jumping around the room is priceless i haven't seen someone capture that <UNK> mood of youth on film as well as this little short has br br sure i am a <UNK> fan and that makes my appreciation for it more special but in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey and the memories of your family telling you that you should be for what you get even if it isn't exactly what you wanted and oh yeah the animation is beautiful too br br rating 10 out of 10
<START> i saw the film yesterday and really enjoyed it although there were several clues which i could realize after second time watching i was not able to awake the dawn case maybe this was my <UNK> the <UNK> of a woman was became <UNK> with <UNK> me go key sentence of the film let me go out from deep deep inside of your brain and we will both be free a <UNK> film that forcing the limits of human conscious and brain anybody who have seen the would realize the similarities with breaking dawn a man that could not escape from his conscience again a psychological and an abstract concept meets it in an human body and he will just be free of accepting and realizing there is no way of escape also i want to mention about the performances of <UNK> <UNK> in spite of having not many experiences from actors and actresses to director all <UNK> <UNK> reasonable performance that have created a <UNK> which would increase the quality of the movie
<START> this demented left wing wipe out <UNK> <UNK> great work <UNK> the genius of the author out of all recognition <UNK> hateful ideology incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place and itself deserves a place in the <UNK> circle <UNK> with the rest of the has reserved himself a spot next to it br br <UNK> hell with <UNK> political figures fox news <UNK> and christian <UNK> is a work of literary <UNK> to say nothing of extreme liberal bias it is however unoriginal tedious and trite nothing in <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is in the least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining humorous or <UNK> despite his smug <UNK> to the contrary br br i could have eaten a reel of video tape and <UNK> a better movie i regret the two hours of my life that i lost watching this insult to the very concept of poetry will <UNK> forever
<START> the 80's is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun sometimes there were some definite brains behind it all evil dead ii night of the creeps and return of the living dead for example and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends movies like pieces and blood diner <UNK> rental shelves in the 80's and 90's offering little in intelligence or <UNK> but plenty in dumb entertainment kevin 1988 movie night of the demons is a part of this tradition stupid poorly acted and not an original bone in it's body but <UNK> if you don't have a good time br br the plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80's a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late <UNK> decide to go to a party at <UNK> house thrown by angela <UNK> <UNK> and suzanne scream queen legend <UNK> <UNK> well angela and co decide to throw a <UNK> this turns out to be as will arrested development character <UNK> would call it a huge mistake because a demonic force soon possesses angela and starts to get to the others as well br br take the evil dead a nightmare on elm street and your average dumb dead teen flick throw them in a <UNK> and night of the demons is what you get the movie is anything but original and really it's not a good movie the whole thing is insanely derivative the acting is terrible the jokes often fall flat the characters are annoying especially the character of <UNK> and the plot holes are numerous that out of the way it's still a lot of fun so why br br well for one thing the make up and gore effects are top notch with some really memorable moments especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of <UNK> that really stick out it also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously yet with the exception of some terrible <UNK> plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with <UNK> self awareness plus there's a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise that's almost impossible to resist yeah it's nothing special but it knows that and it couldn't be more proud of that fact it's a goofy party horror movie and it never pretends to be anything more br br it might not be a classic but night of the demons is a good example of horror junk food done right it might not be too memorable or original but sometimes you don't want a fancy beer sometimes you want a <UNK>
<START> <UNK> blues is a fine stage play by <UNK> <UNK> hudson and an even <UNK> film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen this brilliant film <UNK> the screen with rich colors fine music brilliant editing superb direction by george c <UNK> and a cast so stunning that they make an <UNK> viewing <UNK> yes it is just that good br br the story is based on the author's life as the child marcus carl franklin raised in the <UNK> home of <UNK> <UNK> rachel <UNK> crosby s a lady who devoted her life to <UNK> the <UNK> by <UNK> them from the south from mental <UNK> and from the streets to <UNK> new york the boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house odd characters with painful <UNK> and from the <UNK> of his <UNK> mixed <UNK> family rescued by <UNK> the <UNK> characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business <UNK> howard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the beautiful carmen louis <UNK> jr jeffrey wright ernie hudson <UNK> jimmy patricia macy gray <UNK> <UNK> kathleen lou myers hill <UNK> the list goes on and on br br in the course of the film we are introduced to the <UNK> of racism the history of <UNK> the dynamics of drug abuse and violence the <UNK> joy of african american music <UNK> to our musical culture and the courage of one fine woman who <UNK> all the <UNK> the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact s is wholly <UNK> in this role a role she makes shine like a <UNK> of reason in a world of chaos she offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an hbo movie she without a doubt would add the oscar to place along side her golden globe award br br the entire cast is exceptional and <UNK> handles the acting and the story like a master like <UNK> in a jazz piece he tiny moments of conversation with each character and junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance <UNK> at the local <UNK> <UNK> over the top with incredible blues jazz dancing and joy the production crew has <UNK> this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention <UNK> from the momentum of the story highly recommended almost <UNK> viewing grady <UNK>
<START> i loved the film eddie monroe the film had all the <UNK> that kept me interested while watching it i especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending craig morris has brad pitt potential both in looks and talent his blue eyes reminded me of paul <UNK> fred carpenter took this movie to a new level i loved the cast the music score cinematography talent locations and script were awesome i loved seeing some of my favorite actors in eddie monroe fred carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director he gives his work 200 the film has great <UNK> i hope that there will be an eddie monroe 2 i would love to see how <UNK> turns out after getting her of money fred carpenter's eddie monroe is hollywood level
<START> is this movie as bad as some claim in my opinion yes it is i wasn't going to comment noting that quite a few comments have already been made ranging from <UNK> to not nearly so bad ' however i can't resist br br what do you make of a movie that has on the dvd cover the phrase the real story of ma barker and her boys and the standard any similarity to actual persons <UNK> in the credits i'm not naive but in this case it's a pretty relevant observation regarding this movie br br several comments knock the performances they are pretty awful roberts russell <UNK> and stallone have something like movies and tv shows listed between them they can act or at least perform br br however the dialog is not to my taste and quite unintentionally funny at times the story <UNK> didn't seem to be anything but the <UNK> minimum required to string specific scenes of violence and melodrama together br br direction and screen writing has to be <UNK> <UNK> after seeing ma <UNK> violent temper and finishes with take the girl what ever you think of acting abilities some screenwriter wrote that line or reaction and or some director shot it and said that's good enough no need to <UNK> that that's credible ' one <UNK> i did pick up my copy for 1 99 or 2 99 in a <UNK> story <UNK> bin the running time is shown as <UNK> mins and i note that the running time is listed on imdb as 95 mins i don't know what 4 minutes i'm missing but i acknowledge that if those 4 minutes were of the right sort of person in the right sort of situation my rating might <UNK> to 3 or 4 out of 10 as i saw it 1 10 is what i must vote
<START> before i begin a little <UNK> imdb states that richard gere is <UNK> <UNK> tall wrong i passed by him 10 years ago and he can't be an a bigger than <UNK> i'm <UNK> and he looked like a child next to me br br should have been called an appropriate title to <UNK> <UNK> previous and much better movie <UNK> this movie shows that not all directors have as their prime objective to entertain in fact some of them have as their main objective to show <UNK> in all its <UNK> br br the movie is depressing and relatively <UNK> with the obligatory tragic ending nothing more than an average and predictable love triangle drama with the male two thirds of the triangle not surviving the movie praised for its visual quality while it does have that realistic 70s feel to it there are limits to how <UNK> <UNK> fields can be you can shoot them with <UNK> <UNK> cameras for all i care but they are still <UNK> fields br br gere who at first seems miscast as some kind of lower class factory worker turned worker is quite solid while brooke adams appears distant and cool for most of the movie making one wonder just how much she loved either of the two <UNK> but for those looking for a movie that displays all the glorious colours of a field of <UNK> look no further you've found your dream br br if you're interested in reading my <UNK> of richard gere and other hollywood intellectual <UNK> contact me by e mail
<START> i don't know what the makers of this film were trying to either accomplish or say but they badly failed at whatever it was unless of course the object was to totally confuse the viewer i watched this movie simply because drew barrymore was in it and it turned out that she had a smaller than small cameo in it the whole idea of having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet up with all sorts of <UNK> is utterly ridiculous
<START> i watched this movie based on the good reviews here and i won't make that mistake again br br the first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy but you don't see what it is flashback 12 hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen when the ending is finally <UNK> you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn't happen and means nothing to what you have been watching the only connection these people have is that they have all had a bad day but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom br br if this was supposed to be a crash clone it's a complete failure
<START> usa the movie is like this you take a <UNK> on a long hot sunday afternoon it feels great to close your eyes and let your <UNK> drift away soon you're lost in one of those intense <UNK> dreams where you know you're dreaming but you still can't wake up not that you want to you go with the flow and soon you're in a kind of weird alice in wonderland story complete with characters you didn't think you could dream up they're telling you all kinds of crazy stuff about war and peace while taking you through a trip into the past and even the future br br the dream starts to get <UNK> and you feel like it's going down a path you can't control maybe you want to wake up so you try to open your eyes but you now there's destruction and sadness and confusion and scary voices telling you what could be truth or could be lies you're seeing images that <UNK> and change and then get clear but do you even want to see what you're brain is creating for you br br finally you're lost in a myth world and you realize the end has come the end of the world and the end of the dream it's over what do you wake up to what do you do next br br maybe you'll write down that dream because you know dreams like don't happen too often and when they do you better pay attention br br or maybe you'll crack a beer and forget the whole thing bad idea don't forget
<START> first off let me say that this is probably in my opinion one of the 10 most underrated movies since this came out in <UNK> i absolutely loved this movie it's very urban gritty no real hollywood <UNK> added to it you can actually feel for all of the characters in here i love the blood just <UNK> abound in here joe <UNK> was pretty good in here but to me it seems like he was definitely <UNK> by the lead character joe <UNK> now i don't know anything about him but boy can he really act i believe this movie is probably true because living in new jersey living close to <UNK> you here this kinda thing all the time i think that if the movie had a bigger budget and say robert deniro as <UNK> boss you would have a perfect movie but hey who am i to argue i was so <UNK> by this film that it is already up there in my mind with mean streets i wish hollywood would go back to this <UNK> gritty display of movie making it would serve them very well to do so this movie is a great drama with great actors in it and i highly recommend it to anyone
<START> nothing better than an <UNK> <UNK> 80's technology and a coming of age storyline to pull your thoughts from the depths of your mind front and center to be taken captive by a beautifully lovable cast growing up in the 80's gave me the priceless opportunity to see re runs of not quite human on many special occasions considering the fact that my parents were never present during the viewings i would guess that i would most likely not enjoy it near as much as i did as a child so perhaps this is a film to dig out of your vhs collection and hand to your kids it can be found on the same tape as the apple gang and an episode of tour of duty that is if you recorded in <UNK> mode of course
<START> it's not awful but what a waste lousy gags bad music poor drawings and animation br br regarding the impressive number of animators and on this picture from hum a hundred different studios throughout the world come on how can you expect something coherent when doing an animated movie this way i wonder if one guy on the credits one drawing the lines are rough the 3d work <UNK> i'm not against it but not in this film but the backgrounds are <UNK> the storyline is rather dumb far from the precise <UNK> of the <UNK> and obviously aimed at an international audience to <UNK> a movie all over the world doesn't mean to take everyone in the world for a simple minded guy a cultural object is far more interesting when challenging even when it is a foreign movie being french in this case it's even worse br br some new stuff is doing well the <UNK> character sometimes like with the stone explanation but it's not great but the modern references are <UNK> music not even a verbal joke just a stupid bird named short message service does anyone know imagination but hey it's a production with some celine <UNK> in it pathetic br br <UNK> is <UNK> and talks too much could be great like in the book but he is too clearly a cool guy having a love affair with an uninteresting made up female character in fact only the <UNK> wizard <UNK> are funny too much action not enough laughs the best part of the movie are the end credits not the music but the few stills it contains <UNK> style well definitely <UNK> is not made to move
<START> this movie seemed like it was put together very quickly in both plot and graphics my two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie which rarely happens when we go to the theaters this was a <UNK> production and it would have been better if they had released it on the t v station the animation itself in some parts was o k but the plot was horrible a classic tale of a son trying to fulfill a fathers expectations is used in a lot of kids movies but the animation or graphics need to be really good to keep a <UNK> attention this was not the case with this film there were also awkward elements between the lead male character and the lead female character that the plot could have done without
<START> probably one of the funniest movies i've even seen obviously this isn't intentional though it takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big <UNK> thing is in the middle of the city is <UNK> hot red stuff and the other half spent <UNK> the flow through the city using fire <UNK> <UNK> right it certainly made me laugh the acting makes arnie look like a <UNK> <UNK> it is amazing that films like this get <UNK> a more interesting version would be someone going near an active <UNK> and filming it and would probably cost about <UNK> to make 40 i can see some guy <UNK> the film to a film company well there's this big <UNK> and it <UNK> in a city pretty radical hey if you can find it in the dollar <UNK> maybe worth buying as after watching this most other films would look good
<START> to begin with i really love lucy her tv show still makes me laugh she was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived right up there with chaplin and keaton but her performance in this movie is disappointing she was too old and the <UNK> <UNK> on the lens make her look like a london fog <UNK> she couldn't sing and her voice was so that she through every song her dancing days were long in the past just because you are a lucy fan don't <UNK> over this mistaken sad performance and sing it's <UNK> i prefer to remember lucy in her wonderful tv series i love lucy and to draw the curtain of charity over the terrible mess of a movie called <UNK>
<START> this show is like watching someone who is in training to someday host a show there are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre ones it doesn't look like the writers know the difference between what's funny and what's just weird or gross br br it has its moments when spike down a neighbor who had been letting her dog <UNK> his lawn repeatedly it hit it's peak but the hilarious moments are too few and there's too many experimental comedy bits that miss the mark br br the show's better than say watching a test pattern or the <UNK> network but it needs some better writers br br reading the positive imdb comments on this show i am convinced that most of them were written by show and by relatives and personal friends of spike br br it just isn't very good most of the time
<START> well another <UNK> up typical run around film with guns revenge and violence not much of a story in fact i forgot most of what this film is about don't rent this one i think the exercise would be more entertaining during late night
<START> ironically what makes john carpenter's the thing such an entertaining sci fi film are its genre <UNK> elements of mystery suspense and tight plot structure it puts to shame such films as aliens or <UNK> that are content to the viewer with special effects while their plots <UNK> around stunts that butcher the laws of physics <UNK> laden one liners heroes <UNK> with enough <UNK> to <UNK> iraq and pathetic attempts to <UNK> meaning into the <UNK> on screen with emotional sequences that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience the supreme tragedy of course is that these kind of <UNK> movies are also the most popular i think that there is a cause for this although it isn't very <UNK> there is an increasing trend in our culture to <UNK> surrender to the media to <UNK> <UNK> in the images we see without <UNK> a single brain cell to <UNK> the statement the work is trying to make this mindset is becoming increasingly <UNK> in all <UNK> even the once <UNK> print medium is being <UNK> thanks to the <UNK> reader response theory that <UNK> our schools and the <UNK> <UNK> that lines our magazine <UNK> whose mentality appears to be <UNK> the once <UNK> mainstream press nowadays we just flip the switch and put our minds on pause is the thing a good movie for the rare individual who still values his <UNK> of reason a more appropriate term would be entertaining its plot keeps one guessing its ending is <UNK> and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia upon subsequent viewings one begins to note a <UNK> lack of depth in the acting but the taut storyline remains compelling of course citizen kane it's not but then again sci fi never was a thinking man's genre
<START> producers <UNK> and <UNK> should have been ashamed to release this piece of trash <UNK> i know this is gonna sound cliched but compared to this the first <UNK> of 1983 looks like a mature and exciting epic this sequel is moronic cheap <UNK> childish phony inept and badly acted a landmark in bad cinema and one of the few few movies i've seen that really deserve the lowest possible rating no stars
<START> i saw this one at sundance and i can't figure out why it won the directing award it was painfully slow and literally <UNK> it's the type of movie that is only appreciated by film fest <UNK> who think any movie that a lot of people like must be beneath them br br the jury at sundance this year seemed to be making a conscious effort to reward the underdog ultra low budget films that's all well and good but this wandering dragging mess looks like a home movie mini <UNK> shot in a snow covered gray winter results in a drab look for a drab movie br br certain <UNK> snakes are beaten to death in spite of the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols br br now it wasn't all bad vera <UNK> is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem she will be going places and she deserves it her co star hugh dillon also does a fine job frankly there are many fine moments in this movie but they just don't fit together very well
<START> this was a random rental at the video store but i was impressed from the start wooden camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director the film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young <UNK> friends would experience in a modern post apartheid south africa the young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting the film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and <UNK> without falling into iconic stereotypes and clichés the musical score to the film adds body to the film without being <UNK> after watching it the second time i <UNK> down the dvd on amazon and have been happy ever since
<START> i am not sure who recommended <UNK> to me but i think i have an idea one of the fat guys at the movies the person said they were <UNK> by how great it was and said it was one of the <UNK> disturbing movies i'm <UNK> and doing this only by memory so forgive me if i <UNK> at any rate i made the decision to watch it so i take full blame for my own <UNK> in watching one of the most horrible predictable and stupid movies i've ever seen strange i doubt i've ever called a movie stupid but that was the first word that came to mind about one third in and stayed in my mind until the end br br where to begin unbelievable premise and reactions incredibly brain dead characters could blame the writing or the actors or i'll just blame both and enormously bad acting i'd sooner believe bill <UNK> as president of the usa than a fbi agent here of course there's a reason for that and i'll partially go into that and to top it off if you can't figure the so called shocking twist in the first 5 minutes then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late don't worry they'll tell you the twist every five minutes thereafter br br there's been some serial killer s on the loose in the most depressing town in the county or world but there's more to the story some <UNK> and corrupt cops like to blow out <UNK> for their own amusement could there possibly be more oh yeah there's a family well maybe not but there are four humans one boy one girl and an adult couple the girl says she sees things with much less conviction than cole sees dead people in the sixth sense there's gotta be more to this than what i mentioned that's what makes a movie interesting adding as many subplots that may may not be developed is the way to go okay then i'll continue we have goofy fbi agents that made me laugh a pair of <UNK> <UNK> who's shocked at first their dealer <UNK> but then <UNK> to robbery a gosh <UNK> great guy cop who must've been put in for comic relief who's always battling an angry suspicious cop and finally poor poor michael <UNK> who didn't just phone his performance in he barely text it in br br none of these work they're all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks and believe me you'll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin in addition the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all i guess i'm referring mostly to the cops but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely <UNK> br br this stupid stupid movie stinks it's barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was unless his exposure has been limited to <UNK> stories and what's with the title <UNK> oh i get it it's because it was used in 1 50 subplots just to film interviews since that's so random it might as well been called cop car bullet or coffee just stay away from this horrid mess
<START> even though this film is 11 years old i just rented it yesterday and i found it to be a really touching film the story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and quite touching br br while i did not care much for the amount of language used by some of the young actors especially from i understand that art is imitating life once again does a magnificent job of the rough and tough very and i mean very disturbed wannabe bully his role in the client comes to mind and does a wonderful job of the witty somewhat quirky <UNK> a child who realizes that his life must end too soon br br while there are so many touching and funny moments in the movie i have to say that my favorite was when the boys were <UNK> by <UNK> in the abandoned church and <UNK> cut himself saying his blood was poison while very <UNK> and somewhat amusing seeing a grown man running away from two little kids it's one of the hardest scenes in the film br br definitely check this one out but prepared with your <UNK> you'll need it
<START> this was a pretty good movie i love fighter jet movies and this was the best one i've seen lately it was made using real planes so that made it an even better movie if you like watching u s f <UNK> blow the living <UNK> out of their enemies this is a great movie for you
<START> it's quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be simultaneously so insightful about gay <UNK> sexual relationships and their struggles br br pool days is about the <UNK> of <UNK> and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one a story about experience and vulnerability br br a friend of dorothy portrays a common dilemma many gay and <UNK> sexual people experience at some point in their life the intense attraction towards someone whom is <UNK> <UNK> examined this story truly left me feeling moved br br the disco years shows another version of a no win situation getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual <UNK> but is also terrified of being exposed as anything other than straight a very <UNK> story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person br br while these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an <UNK> of empathy towards others they will psychologically <UNK> those who consider themselves gay <UNK> sexual or searching each story is uplifting in its own unique way
<START> our reviewer from toronto told you what you need to know about this film except note that it needs editing the hand held technique gets really old really fast i saw this film last night in france we are in the valley which is covered with and of course wine makers they were all there in the <UNK> de for the showing <UNK> in polite patient <UNK> although my french is <UNK> i got the <UNK> of the film but noted that the audience loved the old terror <UNK> interviewed <UNK> the one from a communist village in he got a lot of laughs this is unusual in france laughing <UNK> there is no question which side of the terror <UNK> war they are on <UNK>
<START> this movie has every cliché of every terrorism or <UNK> crisis movie br br however it is not entirely unwatchable thanks to good performances by <UNK> and and maybe br br what is amazingly bad though is the computer animations they try to pass off as live action scenes boy oh boy the cgi scenes in the last <UNK> filmed in 1984 are better than these filmed 17 years later the feeling of really sends <UNK> down your spine br br a pity this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste
<START> i have now suffered through parts the horror br br to have the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror br br the story was about a <UNK> central owned by the the man they grow <UNK> for <UNK> organs from the <UNK> later on for the original humans in need of <UNK> one clone escapes the government gets angry and kills all involved but the story somehow <UNK> out anyway br br it is truly shameful how a movie with potential is destroyed by amateurs such as the only thing he genuinely succeeded in doing was to <UNK> in the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect what makes a human a human and would it be ok to grow <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> sadly mediocre actors have been chosen and the plot has left town until the very end in where a pathetic attempt is made to sum it up br br but what disturbed me the most was the introducing of new characters lacking actual relevance for the plot despite that feels the need to kill them off in a bad explosion which only sir coleman francis himself would be proud of br br the setting was interesting how thought that pulling out sheets of plastic and running water over them would make a believable river is beyond me but i guess if you were to compare the setting to coleman <UNK> gray <UNK> <UNK> of a setting this film would win br br perhaps coleman has changed what bad movies are for me 3 10
<START> although i think the reviewers who hated this movie have <UNK> exactly what it does wrong everything i had to add my two cents if you'd like a long version of how terrible this movie is please read the review by br br here's the short version shameless use of the actors' names to <UNK> the plot as opposed to using their talent no one brought their a game to this blatant <UNK> i guess <UNK> can afford to stick an <UNK> or 40 into a movie now and a plot that was so convoluted with rock star clichés that it was totally ridiculous br br let me put it to you this way i was thinking of <UNK> the whole time i was watching this movie but i wasn't laughing anytime you try to throw in steven tyler to help your movie plot along you've got serious problems br br please warn your friends and family this movie sucks
<START> having discovered the ring trilogy i have been <UNK> up all those other japanese and korean films that are either on or following the <UNK> br br i don't have an easy definition of horror but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons even though i can't claim that the film makes a lot of sense i'm <UNK> so there were several points in the film when i just didn't want to watch what was happening on screen the film <UNK> me so i became <UNK> of seeing things that i thought i was going to see br br it's an imaginative film offering a great deal visually it also provides food for thought and plenty of material to argue about when the film is over br br the characters are well defined to say the least could they make films like this in the west br br so it doesn't make sense in the end but when one has an <UNK> for the occult the supernatural the bizarre the <UNK> then no film is going to deliver a final all explaining pay off
<START> warning may contain some minor spoilers br br hard to say anything bad about this movie except for one thing br br you don't get to see it much anymore then again maybe that's because you have to be home in the morning or at 3 am to catch it the fox movie channel br br too bad for this is another gem lost to time <UNK> <UNK> takes his <UNK> sour know it all demeanor he had <UNK> as <UNK> sitting pretty and sequels and turns <UNK> br br actually it's like this br br <UNK> plays robert jordan the host of a sunday children's educational program that is losing audience share and the network breaks it to him that he needs to do something about it or else br br part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married host has no children br br <UNK> but as such things happen the local church <UNK> needs a leader for an <UNK> <UNK> of boy <UNK> and finds a willing victim <UNK> <UNK> in the host so jordan he takes the position br br problem solved right br br wrong this being a movie there are other problems br br for example it turns out one of the <UNK> is the son of his boss at the tv station which causes a little <UNK> especially since the kid is overweight has <UNK> as well as an attitude br br and he is the more reasonable one br br also there is this <UNK> <UNK> mike george <UNK> who wants to hang around being the type br br as it turns out the reason is that he has no folks of his own but is cared for by a relative who hasn't much time for him br br it is things like this that makes his job harder than expected br br all in all <UNK> becomes more understanding of kids and not only saves his show but learns a rewarding lesson and eventually even <UNK> mike br br still a great movie after all these years
<START> it's fun to watch a young james cagney doing his thing he plays the <UNK> and <UNK> guy who takes his job very seriously stepping on the <UNK> of a group of crooked politicians he is offered the world but keeps his integrity he is beaten and set up but that's the problem we never know if he is really in danger they say he's in a spot but still seems to have <UNK> <UNK> to move around and do what he needs to do at times he's so cocky he doesn't do much to protect himself his allies are in the police department but just about everything else is pretty corrupt he <UNK> almost too good to be true of course and we pull for him the problem for me is a lack of <UNK> suspense it would have been much better if he had had to clear his name he never drops into the depths even when rejected by his wife to be it's still fun with the bad guys kind of see it just to watch cagney do his tough guy <UNK>
<START> i haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and <UNK> me in such a way that i couldn't take my eyes off the screen i was <UNK> for the <UNK> and i didn't even want to pause it because i was drawn right in <UNK> powerful very moving horrific and heart breaking it gives you an amazing insight to south africa their struggles and their lives the acting by the leads were mind blowing and the script was incredible despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is i was captivated i don't want to even try and explain the story it's way too complex and i wouldn't do it justice please see this you'll understand why when you do cheers
<START> jesse yet again delivers after almost 12 months of hype about his upcoming production it finally reaches the dark world of the internet with more than a brilliant approach to amateur film making br br is a original nail biting commentary on a troubled child growing into an even more troubled adult if i had more than two thumbs i would give more but i think two will be enough br br great work from all cast especially by <UNK> and elizabeth the character of emily as an adult has given me <UNK> so far and i'm afraid of where she'll go next br br an excellent watch
<START> do not take this film seriously rent it with some folks who want to play mystery science 3000 and you will probably laugh your <UNK> off the evil guys are so not scary it's funny it's like some dude from <UNK> grade with a <UNK> in a scarecrow get up the acting is hilarious i love the occasional self torture with a poor horror film and this really had me <UNK> i recommend it on that basis of course <UNK> drugs will enhance the experience oh there is a naked group swimming scene that will allow for some star dust on the 5 star system the token black male gets injured badly but continues his joking as well as using the injured body part quite readily throughout enjoy this complete and utter disgrace to films
<START> a girl is looking for her soul mate this movie was very strange lots of sequences that look like an hallucinations tommy lee jones is the only stable one in the picture it was hard to figure out what the director was trying to say most of the time the main character is dressed in weird clothes and makeup a weird combination of reality and madness
<START> well i expected for all the hype and oscar nominations an epic civil war drama something with the <UNK> of the english patient given the same director this film isn't of epic stature but it turns out i was <UNK> it wasn't it's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young men are sent off to fight are <UNK> and killed and the women and children at home are left to <UNK> for themselves while the men are gone br br anyway i thought nicole kidman and <UNK> were pretty decent and not knowing much about jude law he was all right also it seems <UNK> z had the more fun part of the 3 leads and was able to <UNK> play a spirited <UNK> <UNK> woman with much <UNK> also for me it was good to see actress kathy baker someone's who's talent needs to be more recognized acknowledged br br this film is worth seeing this i'm can't <UNK> why really but maybe because it is a slice of <UNK> br br
<START> i had never heard of this movie but i like heath ledger and bryan brown and the story sounded interesting so i figured i'd give it a shot i found it to be very enjoyable heath ledger plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious <UNK> so he goes and asks for work from mobster bryan brown i won't go into details but things go very bad for ledger and gets into big trouble with bryan brown from their on the movie just gets better and better with one scene involving ledger <UNK> up with a pair of bank robbers and lets not forget the beautiful rose <UNK> who plays <UNK> love interest i would definitely recommend this movie
<START> it must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened br br the is <UNK> by such a miserable <UNK> amoral <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> group of characters as can be imagined everyone is stabbing someone in the back everyone is attempting to commit adultery everyone is trying to cheat someone that or they are being stabbed <UNK> or <UNK> nobody is cheerful nobody laughs nobody has a <UNK> stroke of luck or a really nice day it's hell with cockney accents br br i suspect this programme must be <UNK> by the it's perfect viewing for the depressed it doesn't cheer them up what it does do is present a whole community of such <UNK> <UNK> sad <UNK> that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse they might be living in br br apart from the above as a representation of <UNK> east end it is pure <UNK> the programme makers have evidently never been across town the first thing you encounter on the mile end road is a <UNK> <UNK> and this pretty well <UNK> the racial majority of the population white british <UNK> are a <UNK> and rapidly <UNK> minority a large <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> near the bow road and <UNK> by tower <UNK> health care boasts that out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more ten healthy smiling faces <UNK> down at the <UNK> in <UNK> eight of them are dark skinned br br what's more i used to work with a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> dare i say <UNK> a few years ago and i can tell you that a more <UNK> racist experience i've never had each day was like an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they couldn't pass 5 minutes without <UNK> some other race or <UNK> than their own and in terms that were repulsive and obscene and were the small change of conversation in fact their entire and extremely limited stock of <UNK> <UNK> upon sex organs and their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was a <UNK> of liberal virtue in comparison br br any programme that <UNK> to represent <UNK> native east end <UNK> in their true nature would be completely <UNK> for broadcast even after the 9 o clock <UNK> imagine a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> script written by quentin tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark but when they weren't being <UNK> <UNK> they were at least extremely cheerful br br i don't know how such a soap opera came to be this imaginary <UNK> island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever and if you're of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it will quickly <UNK> you to tears of grief <UNK> ordinary actors pretending to be <UNK> ordinary <UNK> with cockney accents what's the point of that br br dull dreary <UNK> and <UNK> preposterous the most popular programme of an apparently <UNK> and dying nation br br avoid it like the plague
<START> this is realism if <UNK> was seeking to give us a ground level study of a woman in a certain place and time and how she was able to influence and was influenced by the world around her he has failed miserably most <UNK> because we never get a clue as to why thousands of men would have followed her into battle there is certainly not enough exposition of the cultural historical context to define the country's need for such a <UNK> and god knows there is nothing particularly charismatic about joan as she is presented here unless wooden <UNK> and flat line <UNK> are supposed to indicate <UNK> faith and determination the use of landscape is particularly uninspired we never lose the feeling we are watching <UNK> century actors wandering in a supposedly medieval landscape and as for the battle scenes which in contrast to some <UNK> claims do take up a good 15 of <UNK> they look like look like some some history club from your local high school <UNK> a medieval siege although the kids would no doubt put more passion into it i will give <UNK> credit however for <UNK> a side of joan left out by other movies that of a <UNK> naive and <UNK> adolescent played by a woman all too clearly at least twice the age of the character she is supposed to portray obviously unable to understand her place within the movement she is helping to create or the world existing outside her own passions <UNK> outrage at her own soldiers swearing and <UNK> at the enemy for their lack of respect and <UNK> to her are <UNK> spontaneous and believable notes you suddenly realize such moments must naturally have occurred in an otherwise <UNK> historical representation unfortunately they also serve to point out precisely what is not addressed on screen what made joan special i must say i also continued to be puzzled and frustrated by certain foreign film lovers who <UNK> tedium and lack of dramatic involvement with artistry and seriousness does this film really increase our understanding or involvement with the subject or with anything for that matter 4 10
<START> well of course the critics hated it this isn't a movie that's going for the big time critical acclaim but the fact is that it's really very good br br sure if you don't like that chris <UNK> brand of physical comedy or the exceedingly dry wit of david spade you're not going to like it but for the rest of us the movie has many hilarious and for that matter <UNK> sequences and the plot isn't half as dumb as that of black sheep the parts that aren't meant to be humorous are actually done well not what you'd expect from a movie of this <UNK> and the acting is really pretty good br br tommy boy is without question chris best movie i give it an a and suggest you give it a view
<START> what a movie i have always liked the asian style of shooting and this movie does not disappoint at all photography is breath taking ranging from amazing landscapes to <UNK> of colours the main actor is really realistic in representing the painter whose paintings are astonishing the ending is also very well chosen very poetic the only remark is that they should have maybe shown a bit more deeply the connection between his inspiration and his abuse of alcohol and women but altogether this is an excellent film
<START> occasionally funny but generally boring i did recognize robert from welcome back carter aka <UNK> as the ex celebrity criminal there is a <UNK> <UNK> gut <UNK> scene with the french lady having a bad reaction to american food s <UNK> s <UNK> and tom arnold are billed but have only minor roles you never get to know the characters and it's hard to care what happens to them not recommended
<START> sometimes i wonder if today's horror movies rely on human torturing to make people scared if so then there's a sad future for horror movies dee <UNK> tries to make you feel scared and terrified this movie does exactly this but not in a good way now there are some moments in the film where that there is a chance that <UNK> is saving this film from falling into a hole but let's be frank this movie didn't fall into a hole it was already in a hole and makes no attempt whatsoever to bring itself out of it when you finish watching this movie you are left sick depressed dirty and insane i have a feeling that was the intention of this movie what is lower than dirt
<START> from c jay cox the writer of the hit comedy <UNK> home <UNK> comes a heartwarming and tender gay romantic drama that combines laughs seduction tears and plenty of romance the handsome aaron steve a mormon <UNK> travels door to door in los angeles <UNK> the word of his religion christian wes <UNK> a cute west hollywood party boy goes from man to man without much commitment <UNK> attract when aaron and christian meet and sparks begin to fly br br featuring two star making performances from and <UNK> the film also features a terrific supporting cast including mary kay place joseph gordon <UNK> and international screen legend <UNK> <UNK> according to the dvd <UNK> description not to mention some sweet from jordan as julie the stock sympathetic roommate <UNK> director cox turns his otherwise ordinary latter days into a enjoyable and touching drama due to some story surprises and an engaging team br br latter days 7 10 <UNK> c jay cox steve wes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> joseph gordon <UNK>
<START> any film about wwii made during wwii by a british production company has no latter day <UNK> in my opinion <UNK> the of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive as a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval <UNK> i favor depictions of <UNK> and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things for those <UNK> with target <UNK> an attack on an enemy <UNK> is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing rank and british studios back in the day frankly i prefer its <UNK> more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that <UNK> far better than any over produced hollywood movie ever could this reminds me of powell and <UNK> the <UNK> parallel thanks to the <UNK> <UNK> eric portman a favorite of mine john mills receives second billing and a smaller <UNK> in the titles so this is clearly meant to be mr <UNK> film but the whole cast shines as for the title sequence am i the only one who is utterly <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> lovely pre cgi <UNK> girl
<START> dillon <UNK> reno should have teamed up for a much smarter effort because this one <UNK> in the b category and could have been done with no name actors and a much smaller budget since anyway 2 <UNK> <UNK> and a wasted warehouse could not have <UNK> too much since the writers did not manage to come with a smart heist plan they targeted the <UNK> of the situation but there was not much to exploit there either <UNK> and reno do not bring anything to this movie except the media interest they're only expensive advertising dillon is ok but this was a walk in the park the choices of the main character <UNK> <UNK> are quite uninspired and the final with the reward is quite childish waste of time money actors and so on
<START> meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the 1970's this movie plays more like something mr <UNK> threw together after having a bad day on the <UNK> a <UNK> mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the <UNK> in florida and along the <UNK> of life the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor the problem is that what didn't end up on the cutting room floor probably should have now available on dvd it's kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost 100 million to produce had it been made in 2004 it rolls along and isn't too difficult to sit through and strangely enough in 2004 we're all still pretty much just br br <UNK> in our cars and going faster and faster heading nowhere
<START> let me just give you guys some advice if your going to watch this movie just to see a bunch of unlikable characters get slaughtered in a dozen different ways then you are going to love this movie because everyone dies a horrible death beyond the gore however there is not much else br br where should i start the characters do not appeal to the audience as there are no back stories for any of them there for i didn't feel connected to any of them in fact i didn't like any of them and i was so sick of them that by the end of the movie i was rooting for the <UNK> creep to kill them all which he did by the way br br bad acting i mean i didn't get it take the asian tour guide for example first he spoke perfect english then after their little tour boat thing sunk he somehow got an accent out of the blue then later on went to speaking normal english br br one of the worst endings for a horror if you can call it that after the monster human mutant thing kills almost everyone he is killed by the last two remaining idiots or so they thought the monster human thing is finally killed when the beauty and the geek stick a pole through its heart nick it was hard to tell and presumably it died right in front of them within arms reach but later on it comes back and kills them wtf i mean why didn't it just kill them when he was right next to them i mean it was just way too retarded it was like the writer didn't know where he wanted the story to go or he was a few minutes short of 80 min so he added some more retarded twists to the movie so people can get <UNK> worth of crap instead of br br what i didn't get was why didn't they just kill the damned thing while it was unconscious instead they just walked away from it like idiots and left it so it could come back and kill them the only reason i gave it a 4 was because of the gore which was actually the only thing that i watched this movie to the end for that and to watch them all get killed no i'm serious
<START> well i'm not a movie critic or something like that but i have my opinion for this movie i think that the best in this movie was amanda <UNK> she played her roll for my look very well i have watched many her movies this i liked most when you are watching this movie you just can relax come down and watch it you don't have to try to look for subtext or something like that you just watch it movie is really great maybe i liked it for actress maybe for all the scenery but i liked it the whole atmosphere that was created in one moment i just felt like i was in that university in that room it is not another drama movie that is made to win oscar it is just nice movie to watch in your free time
<START> early jackie chan film where there is no sign of the chan persona we know this is chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was <UNK> and re <UNK> by countless producers and studios all through hong kong <UNK> and <UNK> china its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would <UNK> jackie chan to super stardom its also clear from watching this that had he not <UNK> himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short as a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty <UNK> movie i was watching it in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have <UNK> together with every other film that i watched that day had i not noticed jackie in the film honestly i don't think the film is really worth bothering with there are too many other better variations except if you're interested in seeing where jackie chan started
<START> this movie is so bad that it actually gets funny one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my entire life the funny thing was that the trailer had scenes in it that wasn't in the movie just by watching the trailer i would have saved a lot of my time it actually showed everything that happened in the movie except for the conclusion and that was also so obvious br br it's honestly hard to think of a reason why this movie was made this is just so bad horrible br br i would give it 0 out of 10 if that would be possible there is nothing else to say about this movie
<START> in the world of shorts most of which aren't this film is a gem br br a quiet <UNK> <UNK> into the world of a young woman who's a reader for a blind woman here the stellar elizabeth <UNK> this film bears the <UNK> layers and visual storytelling of a <UNK> painted still life br br the dialogue is minimal the cinematography is stunning and the direction sure clear and compelling i saw this film in a film festival held in a loud and crowded <UNK> bar and within the first two minutes and for the first time that night the crowd fell quiet br br that says it all
<START> four or five episodes of <UNK> and his flying robot edited together amusing giant robot battling giant monsters tale aimed <UNK> at kids parents of course will go crazy since the action is violent with the robot monster battles resembling professional wrestling and the human on human violence the sort of stuff you'd find in the al <UNK> st <UNK> day school and gangster training academy i liked it but then again i grew up on the series if there is any problems other than the men in suits effects variety is that the movie plays like a series of episodes <UNK> together with a climax coming every 20 minutes recommended for those who've run out of or godzilla
<START> okay i'm just going to disagree with the past comments that criticized this show i happen to think this show is awesome i mean when <UNK> <UNK> was still on and was still alive so <UNK> and i was surprised to learn that this was <UNK> as a soap because it just doesn't carry the same look and feel as <UNK> in america <UNK> here are absolutely horrific at least films on location features real music and more plausible story lines moreover the acting on for the most part is quite believable especially with <UNK> <UNK> and felix plus soap actors are some of the hardest workers around in the business as they have the most demanding work <UNK> if it's ratings are that high it must be doing something right <UNK> in america are shown in the day time and historically have always had rock bottom ratings give a chance trust me it's good
<START> i saw this film at film festival in 1997 where one of the screenwriters <UNK> <UNK> was being <UNK> it ranks highly as a great noir crime drama incredible performances by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals <UNK> loyalty <UNK> love and hope are tremendous it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film up there with the best of <UNK> the title in english all risk ' in french <UNK> is word play on ' meaning
<START> i enjoyed this show it was on in the uk but not at peak time and they seemed to move it all over the <UNK> so i wasn't able to watch them all i was surprised when it didn't return and had no i idea why still don't know but i guess that's not important br br great performances from the two leads they were very believable as friends the two supporting actresses also added well to the mix i guess it was part of a whole load of shows that were lifestyle <UNK> friends being the obvious main one but sex in the city came along a few years later br br the characters get take out coffee they drink at nice bars that sort of thing a little woody in a way
<START> if family guy <UNK> you or you simply don't get the humor unfortunately this show is making fun of you and the masses of overly religious dull and politically correct people in america so put your morals aside and have fun with this show is a hilarious mind opener on the reality of today's society whoever said this show is for a young immature audience is very mistaken with all the references to old movies and politics 10 80 years ago i couldn't imagine any young immature kid finding this funny family guy is definitely for a mature open minded audience who are not afraid to criticize american society hats off to seth and the whole crew who were able to make this show happen
<START> i have watched this movie twice in the past six months what i go through so you don't have to the first viewing left me half crazed and <UNK> the second viewing at on a rainy <UNK> was a little better i only screamed in agony once br br seems the aztec mummy had the <UNK> for a certain aztec princess who was supposed to keep her maiden obviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it now that is severe but before they are the film tries to put us to death with a <UNK> aztec ceremony the singing will make your ears bleed br br anyhow there is the usual reincarnation nonsense not to mention a treasure map on a <UNK> <UNK> by that <UNK> <UNK> by this time looks like he's been on a 2000 year <UNK> and is after the <UNK> of his tomb his <UNK> <UNK> sounds like he has a bad case of <UNK> revenge or he read the script for this movie that will make your breath stink br br an evil dr von appears wanting the aztec treasure possibly to <UNK> acting lessons <UNK> classes for cast crew he is called the bat because in the curse of the aztec mummy he wore a bat like cape hat and something like a <UNK> mask over his face guess it's better than the laughing fat man br br the bat in typical mad scientist fashion wants to rule the world he <UNK> this by rolling his eyes laughing <UNK> and chewing the scenery he has <UNK> together an <UNK> robot looks like the <UNK> was made from a garbage can a <UNK> and the <UNK> of a 1957 <UNK> this will make your eyes bleed a company even takes credit for making this tin can br br well the mighty showdown between and the robot takes place in the <UNK> new crypt having been made homeless earlier br br about half of this movie is <UNK> from la aztec never released in the us in its original form but in a chopped atrocity from jerry warren see my review on attack of the <UNK> mummy and curse of the aztec mummy the robot is frankly stupid as are most of the characters if that and the plot doesn't make you <UNK> with laughter nothing will br br my first impression was so bad it would have gotten a one but after seeing <UNK> mummy which is a movie deserving of being burned and watching robot again it <UNK> a 3 you have to watch this with no expectations at all then it can be <UNK> pleasant
<START> i do not know which one was first released earlier in 1970 cannon for is an western it was made in spain this means this is fairly inferior to sergio <UNK> so called western spaghetti and to the real american masterpieces of john ford sam <UNK> howard <UNK> john <UNK> and anthony mann in my order of merit this order is not to be interpreted as all john ford westerns are better than all by sam i think <UNK> 100 sort them out all pretty well br br the worse about this firm is the casting george <UNK> is fit for a <UNK> role <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> and giovanna <UNK> to a in <UNK> in the in rome
<START> <UNK> the rest of the <UNK> world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous <UNK> to sell something weird locations too much makeup too much skin is not necessary sex does not always sell when you are selling to women the same goes for the horse <UNK> <UNK> walk that looks unnatural people come in all <UNK> <UNK> they need to have that on the show my daughter has a <UNK> is tall <UNK> a size 5 i am more average at a size 12 we would like to see both i can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it it will not fit the same way on me i do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter we would really love the show to consider women of all <UNK> thank you
<START> so after years and years i finally track this film down i was dying to see how it lived up to my memories i distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine then waiting behind two <UNK> of wood crossed in the <UNK> just staring out with a pale white face this single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood i remember chills running down my spine watching it now its obviously nowhere near as scary but quite <UNK> strange to see the same images again if anyone wants a copy private message me br br the story itself is fairly standard stuff its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around there is no real moral as such except that <UNK> are here to help us ' or <UNK> be <UNK> against ghosts ' there wasn't even a greed <UNK> angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine however a massive act of <UNK> from the captain <UNK> the two kids to actually follow the vague <UNK> of a ghost not only into a mine but into a new mine hole which is totally dangerous the captain then encourages the children to climb down a huge ladder deep into the mines simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults and not just help the trapped adults direct oh well
<START> this film is really quite odd clearly certain events portrayed identify the main protagonist as the <UNK> criminal known as the general but almost everything else is just wrong we are not talking of a <UNK> of ancient history but a complete <UNK> of <UNK> documented facts the question indeed is why the <UNK> are shown as latter day <UNK> cops his gang as non menacing and the man himself as well kevin spacey almost pure fiction anyway why bother to try to give a semblance of realism having said all that it is a poor exercise any way you want to look at it not worth a second of anyone's time
<START> this is the kind of film one initially <UNK> to make up the numbers from video rental only to discover an under rated entertaining and enjoyable movie the opening sequence of the police arriving at a dark and rainy house <UNK> the wife has committed murder or is it and the remainder of the film seeks to unravel what really happened ok the film is a bit campy but has good editing and dialogue professional acting often humorous and the very last scene with the facial expression is one of the best of its' kind definitely worth watching deserving at least a 7 or an 8
<START> we don't know if <UNK> loves all three gentleman certainly they are <UNK> of one another yet they live together viewers might <UNK> that the feelings of rivalry between the gentleman and the feelings of all of them toward <UNK> might make for an unbearable home life br br in the <UNK> beautiful rural brazilian landscape <UNK> by the frequent use of <UNK> and the use of stock anything might happen and the <UNK> for any one of them save perhaps may not be <UNK> enough to encourage them to change their circumstances they seem to bear the <UNK> because it is familiar the unknown <UNK> them into <UNK> toward a fate which is more challenging than their characters can <UNK> thus it <UNK> them rather than <UNK> them the web in which they are caught is made of the <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> us all perhaps the sadness i felt after watching this movie has to do with it's portrayal of the inevitable <UNK> of our <UNK> bright colors in the <UNK> light of time the three children will enter the world <UNK> to <UNK> their parents lives to one or another degree well filmed and portrayed the story is tragic in it's essence walt disney it ain't
<START> when i saw this movie all i could think was what a disaster no i'm not talking about the <UNK> but about the movie itself i have seen a lot of movies but this is certainly one of the worst ever i don't care about the fact if a <UNK> <UNK> underneath downtown l a is possible or not perhaps it isn't but even than this could have been a good movie but it sure isn't and i'll explain you why br br i don't know how much <UNK> flows out of an average <UNK> but what i do know is that the <UNK> in this movie makes the and <UNK> together look like a little <UNK> i don't think there has ever been so much <UNK> flowing out of a <UNK> as what we see in this film i'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his movie but i really wonder why he all spent it on the special effects and not on the script and the actors i'm not saying that he should have hired a top cast but this really is the opposite of what i would call good acting their performances are so unbelievably poor that it makes the entire movie even worse br br and what's wrong about the script you probably ask yourself well can you tell me who comes up with the idea of people standing a few <UNK> or even a few feet from the <UNK> without getting burned or having to hide for the heath or people sinking in the earth when the flow of <UNK> isn't even two foot high br br i'm sure i wouldn't be proud if i wrote such a script but apparently there are script writers in hollywood who don't mind about believability as long as it pays good money very good money br br when you see the movie you'll probably agree with me that this is one of hollywood's worst disaster movies not worth more than a 3 10
<START> i give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter robert w morgan who also plays the part of <UNK> in the film in listening to recent show called the show robert morgan is a co host he tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and such there are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film i think he said that two of the original stars have signed on and he hopes to have a few more robert is a good man and i hope it does well he has devoted 50 years of <UNK> work as a <UNK> which is also one of my interests and author check out his show on the <UNK> and maybe look for blood <UNK> ii sometime in the near future
<START> nothing i dislike more than a kung fu movie that plays for laughs it is the main reason i can't stand jackie chan or his he was not always a clown i must add my young <UNK> is slapstick martial arts of the worst kind it is a perfect example of how the <UNK> was brought down to the mud by endless silly antics and childish behavior unless you are 5 year old i really don't understand how anyone could find this kind of film funny but humor is indeed a very <UNK> thing personally i think this type of approach did permanent damage to the beloved <UNK> i did think leading lady <UNK> <UNK> was very good here but i had such a hard time sitting through this one that i could not enjoy her fine performance if you don't mind all the silliness you might enjoy it i know i didn't
<START> i can't believe i rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and i definitely won't be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that <UNK> is awful viewing on the contrary i enjoyed it very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the and surprise twists it offers don't just refer to this film as being <UNK> 80's <UNK> because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers we're introduced to three <UNK> looking youngsters who were all born during a <UNK> <UNK> at the moment they were delivered planet <UNK> was <UNK> by both the sun and the moon and due to this the kids are <UNK> and <UNK> without conscience this really starts to show around their <UNK> birthday as they go on a <UNK> killing spree br br granted this stuff is <UNK> far fetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who cares unlike many other horror films from this period it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative for once the kids' acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and <UNK> music the murders sequences are grim and tense and it's always eerie to see them getting committed by angel faced kids i don't know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable the bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights such as of the <UNK> 'the bad and of the <UNK> this film is nowhere near as memorable as these <UNK> but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this br br bloody birthday was written and directed by ed hunt not particularly the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged <UNK> who also brought us immensely entertaining <UNK> like 'the <UNK> and <UNK> if all this isn't enough to convince you yet bloody birthday has a lot of nudity and not just any nudity but a topless dance act by mtv <UNK> julie brown oh and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by joe penny later the star of tv series <UNK> and the check it out
<START> to start off i didn't bother seeing the grudge the previews for that movie didn't make me jump didn't scare me and didn't entertain me but when a group of friends asked me to go see the grudge 2 i accepted the invite a little curious as to how this movie would be i mainly went because of my friends not even 5 minutes into this movie i realized i threw away 7 50 the acting from the get go is horrible the <UNK> in the beginning look as if they have never acted in their entire lives then the movie plot takes over let me tell you i could not stop laughing this entire movie it is just so stupid i'm pretty sure they tried to not make it scary they don't make anything jump out or anything it shows the kids then shows them attacking it builds up to it it's not an all of a sudden thing and even in the middle of the movie the core of the movie the acting is still horrible it leaves so much time in between the dialog for someone to add in their own comments this movie is honestly one of the funniest horror movies i have ever seen poorly written horrible acting horrible script horrible unable to act cast and a horrible concept the movie blacks out and changes situations more times than you can count each part eventually plays out and then ties up at the end of the movie i would never again pay to see this movie i wouldn't even watch it on cable for free this movie is a joke please do not waste your money on this movie
<START> it actually pains me to say it but this movie was horrible on every level the blame does not lie entirely with van damme as you can see he tried his best but let's face it he's almost fifty how much more can you ask of him i find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together <UNK> 2 arguably the best western martial arts movie in years created this everything from the plot to the dialog to the editing to the overall acting was just horribly put together and in many cases outright boring and nonsensical scott <UNK> who's fight scenes seemed more like a <UNK> reel was also terribly underused and not even the main villain which is such a shame because 1 he is more than capable of playing that role and 2 the actual main villain was not only not <UNK> at all but also quite annoying again not <UNK> van damme i will always be a fan but avoid this one
<START> two things are always signs that you re going to be watching a bad movie br br 1 if you re instantly reminded of other movies like the terminator <UNK> or blade runner during the title sequence br br 2 if there s a death during a sex scene straight after the title sequence br br there s actually a third warning sign and that s a <UNK> <UNK> lazy exposition warning the poor ignorant naive audience of the dangers of corporate greed guess what cyborg 2 starts with a <UNK> warning us of corporate greed in the future followed by a title sequence that reminded me of the terminator <UNK> and blade runner followed by a death during a sex scene hey you don t suppose i ll be watching a bad movie by any chance br br as you can guess this is a bad movie it s basically a series of action scenes written around a thread bare plot of a cyborg on the run from a greedy corporate company it s badly written directed and acted and most especially it s badly lit which means it s very difficult to see what s happening on screen though i m not entirely sure this is actually a bad thing the only interest to be had is that it s the film debut of angelina jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the <UNK> line they re lovely i wonder if they re real which is something i ask myself whenever i see one of her movies
<START> this is an engrossing woman's drama that men can enjoy the plot follows a young woman hope lange who goes to work for a <UNK> after college we can forgive her jump in position from secretary to editor hey it's hollywood and a few other flaws here is one of the few films in which once big time producer robert evans here beautifully depicting a rat with women appears it also features a mature joan crawford and terrific supporting cast check it out
<START> the weakest of the <UNK> crew star trek films this film suffers from an awful script and obvious budget constraints particularly in the <UNK> finale the bones of a good movie are here and the directing from shatner is not as bad as is <UNK> made out but the characters end up speaking and acting way out of the style that the previous 3 films had carefully established lawrence is convincing as the <UNK> <UNK> with and mystical powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes particularly for <UNK> <UNK> who shines as mccoy in this his second last movie however as good as those scenes are they ultimately do not advance the plot and end up feeling as more of a distraction a great score from the ever reliable <UNK> and some funny scenes in <UNK> between the main three are not enough to cover the <UNK> <UNK> in the plot and the frankly <UNK> attempts at humour serve only to alienate even die hard <UNK> all in all a wealth of possibilities which although it fails to deliver has its moments watch out for the pool table in the bar <UNK> scene
<START> if like me you enjoyed the first film bruce almighty my advice to you is not to get your hopes up too high in fact disregard any hope you possess for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any film sense at all br br without giving too much away the story sees <UNK> <UNK> nemesis co anchor from the first film move home with his family to the <UNK> to change the world with a new political path what follows is a rather far fetched and quite storyline which is obviously set out to target young children as the main target audience unlike it's predecessor <UNK> almighty is a family <UNK> film with the ambiguous genre of <UNK> <UNK> upon it's misleading position of <UNK> to which some would regard a modern day comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature <UNK> audience br br generally speaking <UNK> almighty <UNK> itself of terrible cinematic values the acting <UNK> steve carell and morgan freeman was rigid and many of the characters were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget <UNK> for the production additionally the cast includes acting legend john goodman who makes an appearance as a <UNK> and is seen just a few times in the movie's entirety i didn't quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he was involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy every other character in the movie especially the wife and kids deserve a mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill a king size be warned though it is the typical <UNK> associated with many mainstream family <UNK> films so i'd advise you defend yourself with the nearest <UNK> in sight br br it may seem the movie is worthless thus far however it does have some promising aspects the cgi was outstanding and it was clear that a lot of time went into <UNK> the <UNK> and producing water effects and animation of the computer generated animals towards the end the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> used were <UNK> stellar although part of me couldn't help but think these were <UNK> to a movie with such poor ideals and were in my opinion <UNK> <UNK> for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughout br br overall i view this film as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with huge potential but unfortunately it fell short to a bad conclusion in the almighty series and approaching the end of the film i had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content i had so far witnessed this wasn't the case and i was deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credits as i sat <UNK> i couldn't help but think the movie wasn't anywhere near as as i hoped for in many ways the film reminded me of a watered down night at the museum as it showed similar <UNK> and characteristics but unfortunately was <UNK> below even that br br i give this movie 3 out of 10 as it is watchable but it's definitely one to be avoided if you have to see this film be prepared for disappointment as is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production
<START> first the <UNK> an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film some of the shots could be paintings by de sophie beautiful br br the <UNK> the stories are hard to believe unreal <UNK> dimensional characters <UNK> and <UNK> 100 of the time as if they were in some kind of <UNK> this is neither the antonioni of his earlier much better movies nor the <UNK> we've all come to know and appreciate <UNK> is excess <UNK> in this movie
<START> this film is terribly bad kevin spacey is a really great actor he shines in la <UNK> american beauty usual suspects 7 etc but this is truly rubbish he came nowhere near a decent irish accent maybe he should have <UNK> it with kate hudson while she was doing about adam to irish people this film is laughable and even worse its quite irritating for several scenes i think the producers made this film hoping the target audience non europe would had never seen or heard of the <UNK> or martin <UNK> and be enthralled in an intriguing and entertaining story total <UNK>
<START> the film itself is absolutely brilliant its that buzz that rush that makes you just want to go out blow your <UNK> and loose yourself it's what the weekend is all about its our <UNK> where we can come together as one and be ourselves without a care in the world the film is layered in depth and the dialogue in places is just spot on especially with <UNK> the characters themselves are instantly likable one in particular is obviously character and his views on what star wars is really about genius br br if ever you've got an hour to kill before going out stick on this you'll immediately feel yourself growing in confidence definitely recommend it
<START> on their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer his secretary and the playwright end up stuck in the mud they make their way to a nearby house only to end up at the home of the <UNK> <UNK> if you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention br br this is a a good entry in the old dark house genre not only does it have a good mystery you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it the cast is across the board excellent and they're more than willing to have a good time with what is good material br br i would love to say that this is one of the best of the genre it should have been but for me something happened on the way that made me down grade the rating to only seven out of ten i can't tell you what it is not for certain anyway perhaps its the sense that i knew where it was going almost from the outset or perhaps its something else i'm not sure what but there was something that i couldn't shake that made me like this film despite wanting to love it it just missed being great and somehow fell short br br that said i do suggest you see it it is after all a very witty film that entertains fully despite just missing being great
<START> apart from the fact that this film was made i suppose it seemed a good idea at the time considering bottom was so popular the one thing that puzzled me about guest house <UNK> was what happened to the lighting there is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this film whatsoever and i watched it on network tv so it <UNK> t a case of watching a dodgy tape in fact the film was shot so darkly it was impossible to see what the hell was going on but if the dialogue was anything to go by that s maybe not a bad thing
<START> there were nice characters in here played by pleasant looking actors and actresses plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers yet the film just didn't work by the time this was almost over i was bored to death the dialog was dumb the humor mainly <UNK> was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alley br br i've never been a big band fan anyway and if i hear in the mood one more time i'll <UNK> br br this was my first look at famous <UNK> actor <UNK> <UNK> and i have no complaints about her almost part of the problem at least with the humor is that it's so dated it isn't funny anymore <UNK> phil <UNK> bob hope red <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc etc were hilarious to the crowds in the 40s and 50s but humor changes and what was funny back then is not today
<START> a very sweet movie about a young chinese man <UNK> of western technology and an <UNK> trying to make his fortune showing movies in china it's a very interesting story that is presumably based on true events although i'm assuming it's more fantasy than real it's got a fairy tale quality you rarely get in real life and it's also got 8 people credited for the script so they must have been making up stuff right and left br br this is a very likable movie that conveys how magical film was to people who had never seen it before it is not an especially deep movie touching briefly on the loss of tradition and the <UNK> of western culture but mainly just being a pleasant little movie it's actually a movie i enjoyed very much that is already beginning to disappear from my mind 15 minutes after seeing it light as a <UNK> but i enjoyed every minute
<START> that's what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire flick we couldn't believe how stupid it was i think somebody shot this on their camcorder at home and <UNK> it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up well i guess the joke is on us br br i guess i should have come to this website first and read all of the reviews it has gotten every single one says this movie is horrible stupid and on and on and boy are they right although it did provide some pretty good laughs me and my friends were pretty drunk because it is so stupid we just can't believe somebody was dumb enough to make such a crappy movie i swear this had to be made in the 70's before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene looks really crappy but when i looked on here it said it was made in 2001 what it sure doesn't look like a movie that would be made today but i guess that's what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using <UNK> lights and really fake looking <UNK> and use real life people from your home town instead of actors or even aspiring actors btw some of those chicks or were they drag queens we couldn't tell were so <UNK> even my drunk horny college buddies wouldn't touch them with a 50 foot pole br br so there's absolutely no appeal to this movie at all bad acting bad writing bad directing bad special effects bad bad bad don't waste your time or money on this one you'll be completely disappointed
<START> i was waiting for this movie for a time in the first day of the air in turkey i watched it it was totally a disappointment for me i was planning to watch a historical movie but the one in the screen was a fictional one first of all the main character of the movie han the great <UNK> was portrayed like a soft calm even a loser one you can not feel the power in the movie historically the war machine he created was <UNK> <UNK> even more of the world know in those years to do that first <UNK> the asian <UNK> however in the movie this loser man is in one scene poor alone man and in second scene he is commanding <UNK> war scenes were incredibly week in the final battle the <UNK> <UNK> were using double swords on their sides and cutting the enemy as a consequences me and my friends just laugh at that scenes <UNK> army means <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you can not see that in the movie another ill thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie i do not want to go into the scenes which was portrayed as a prophet we can say in the integrity of the movie it is acceptable however the scenes when the old monk saw the future and go to find the wife of khan after gave him a mission is really funny when the monk died in the desert wife feel this dead and she find the corpse in the continent we are talking about the again we laughed there are a lot of more things to say but i don't feel that this movie has value to talk more
<START> this movie is total <UNK> <UNK> yet i've seen this movie several times already and plan to watch several more times because despite its sheer <UNK> it's very entertaining and it has one of my favorite hokey movie actors casper van <UNK> who is here in his full hokey movie glory here casper van <UNK> is fully casper van <UNK> and ya gotta love him for it if he hadn't been in this movie it would have been totally unwatchable dreck or at least far than it already is br br the <UNK> <UNK> science used here makes absolutely no sense at all no one else in the world noticed that big <UNK> approaching the earth besides that small group not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur <UNK> constantly searching the <UNK> for just such a thing an <UNK> that big would have made itself completely obvious to anyone who has a pair of eyes even vaguely capable of sight and a <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> off the atmosphere and no one even noticed it a rock that big hitting the atmosphere would have caused enormous <UNK> that would have in turned caused an enormous amount of damage to the <UNK> surface surely someone would have noticed such a thing the science used in this movie is so completely ridiculous that somehow it works for making this movie as entertaining as it is br br one thing i noticed is that despite the uber heat all the characters weren't dripping with sweat and their clothes completely <UNK> with it at the most the characters looked like they had been lightly on occasion by someone off camera with a water bottle to give a sweat sheen authenticity was not a goal that this movie and constantly <UNK> for which in a weird and hilarious sort of way gives this movie its entertainment charm br br is this movie actually worth watching definitely assuming of course you have absolutely no expectations of anything that even remotely approaches reality and it's your desire to <UNK> and in total <UNK> at the moment
<START> here we have the <UNK> charlie chaplin <UNK> his slapstick past to tackle the serious subject of anti <UNK> and <UNK> in general he portrays two characters the sweet innocent jewish <UNK> a war veteran and the raving and ruthless dictator the jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long due to the <UNK> of and his armed thugs who <UNK> rough up its residents or leave them alone <UNK> upon his mood that day or week the <UNK> is among them but is <UNK> by his former commanding officer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who seems to keep things quiet for a while until <UNK> him to a concentration camp he seeks <UNK> with the jews in the ghetto most specifically the <UNK> and the <UNK> young woman hannah <UNK> the premise will be who will be the one among these jews to put their lives on the line to get rid of and his <UNK> we <UNK> guess too hard to know the answer the <UNK> is a dead <UNK> for the dictator and he is <UNK> in his image accompanied by <UNK> also in full military gear hannah escapes with several of her ghetto friends to the country of where mr maurice cousin has a farm and they can live for a while at this point himself has been arrested by his armed forces thinking him to be the notorious <UNK> the latter meanwhile has been <UNK> with <UNK> to a <UNK> to make a speech <UNK> the conquest of the ensuing ten minutes is pure chaplin himself speaking from his heart of tolerance love and freedom and <UNK> greed and hatred albeit chaplin started production on the film in <UNK> it can be forgiven some <UNK> he was allegedly unaware of the gravity of this <UNK> and hatred and said had he known the full extent he would never have made the film because he most likely believed it would have <UNK> the situation he has a marvelous supporting cast <UNK> <UNK> henry <UNK> as his <UNK> de camp the always wonderful billy gilbert as the bumbling <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> as the dictator his rival for conquest veteran european actors david <UNK> <UNK> father maurice among others the scene he choreographed with globe with just a musical <UNK> is sheer <UNK> inspiration and <UNK> as well is <UNK> at the film's end smiling through her tears i have seen this film before but there is always something new in it for me last evening when it finished i sat there in tears i defy anyone not to be moved by it
<START> steven <UNK> films of late have not exactly been good but this is by far the worst since the <UNK> the plot makes no sense what so ever it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are who works for who or who is double crossing who the film is completely disjointed each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow most of the blame must lie at the director's feet for not even understanding the <UNK> of film making but seagal does not get off lightly as one of the producers of this film he must also share the blame oh and i haven't even mentioned how awful the acting is even by seagal standards even as straight to video fodder this is not worth a view even for seagal fans give it a wide <UNK>
<START> br br summary not worth the film br br as an avid gone with the wind fan i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece when the book scarlett came out i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters <UNK> on their journey together while the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as i was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable however i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst spent hours of my life any of the original character traits so well formed in margaret <UNK> book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape <UNK> murder and relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character in the novel scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband <UNK> butler to <UNK> under the <UNK> of visiting extended family after coming to an <UNK> with <UNK> she agrees to leave and proceeds to <UNK> with her o'hara relatives in <UNK> eventually she <UNK> her cousin a passionate leader of the <UNK> to ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named the o'hara the head of the family while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of scarlett <UNK> out into the world of the english <UNK> and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of their parties she having been <UNK> by <UNK> time and time again eventually agrees to marry luke the earl of <UNK> until <UNK> comes along in a clichéd night on white horse type of a rescue the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice raped by her fiancé and <UNK> by her family the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed br br i <UNK> advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to <UNK> this decision br br
<START> i am utterly <UNK> at how over rated cemetery man is among horror fans now i usually welcome movies that blend two or more kinds of genre styles into one and i love just about every zombie comedy i have ever seen to my <UNK> this italian cult classic really didn't show me a lot to get too <UNK> up about it follows the unusual duties of a full time cemetery care taker and his retarded man child curly joe looking assistant as they seem to primarily <UNK> of the recently deceased who pop out of the ground seven days after their initial death he meets a widow whom he <UNK> with some grisly grave yard atmosphere and develops a quick romance soon having sex with her on her dead husband's grave the husband's corpse springs alive and bites her <UNK> a series of events that seem to <UNK> the rest of the movie cemetery man attempts to <UNK> every element it can like horror romance comedy action and fails entirely in the long run it <UNK> along never able to focus on any aspect long enough to make it interesting for the viewer such as the <UNK> relationship with a living severed head a motorcycle riding zombie <UNK> out of the ground the main character deciding to gun down random people on the sidewalk etc this thing is so convoluted and dull that it's nearly impossible to take it seriously sure it's stylish and often elegant but even the most artsy kind of films need the right kind of <UNK> to allow it to make sense cemetery man <UNK> along appearing unable to focus on anything for more than a few minutes which becomes very <UNK> after a while people argue that it's a more sophisticated zombie movie frankly when it comes to zombies i don't want anything more sophisticated than romero there's a little bit of gore and nudity mainly in the scenes where it wants to play horror movie but not nearly enough to make up for it's <UNK> lack of structure terrible film
<START> very good 1939 film where john garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder trouble is that the killer and <UNK> girl ann sheridan in a brief but good performance get killed while trying to <UNK> the police br br a crooked attorney <UNK> garfield to flee n y he lands in arizona and meets up with the dead end kids they've been sent there by a funding program to keep them out of further trouble br br of course garfield finds a new love interest but must <UNK> his identity as everyone thinks he was not only the killer but was the victim in the car crash br br may <UNK> is fabulous as the grandma type running the place for the <UNK> youth claude <UNK> is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that garfield is still alive and <UNK> him when a picture is <UNK> of him in arizona br br the film really deals with <UNK> relation to the boys while the ending is good you want to see garfield go back to n y to <UNK> his innocence
<START> movies like these do not need sequels part of the advantage of don <UNK> moving away from disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless <UNK> of straight to video poorly animated cash in sequels but apparently it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to all dogs go to heaven so we get this br br charlie sheen <UNK> burt and he's not really as good most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn't nearly as dark different or entertaining as the original br br i feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films as a <UNK> to release banal crap br br please no more sequels to kids films that don't need 'em
<START> i had been looking for this film for so long before i found it i had seen it when i was younger and loved it after my second viewing i still loved it and i still do br br this is a love hate film if you like bottom young ones the comic strip then you will find this funny if you don't like that kind of humour then don't bother i love this film and have grown up with these comedy <UNK> for me this film is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen it is not an award winner by any means but if you just want good wholesome slapstick then this is it br br the film lacks the quality of the tv series and this is usually the case with films but it still has enough material to keep you laughing even if a lot of the jokes are pretty similar to their previous work br br yes the humour is a little childish and not to everyone's taste but sometimes you just need that in a film
<START> director and auteur jean pierre was 8 years old during the spring of 1940 as <UNK> third republic <UNK> in a matter of a few weeks it was a time he says when all the adults were a little bit insane he and the production staff have lovingly and <UNK> <UNK> that world in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional the structure a classic farce is ideal for the period as multiple plot lines <UNK> and <UNK> only to come together in a logical satisfying conclusion the <UNK> for this plot is <UNK> played by brilliant newcomer gregory who is fully up to playing opposite <UNK> depardieu and <UNK> the real strength of the film is in its supporting performances m has cast the film <UNK> with actors who <UNK> ideas for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with just two short sentences of dialogue though not yet as widely influential as <UNK> of the game ' <UNK> richly deserves to be a companion piece to that classic though it demands a lot of the audience it gives much back one of its demands is tolerance for a certain and <UNK> as to the exact genre we are watching a crime melodrama no a spy thriller ah a romantic comedy recommend it to friends just be sure to let them discover for themselves that it is a romantic comedy
<START> in 1967 i saw an outstanding musical at the in new york city where angela lansbury <UNK> the stage as <UNK> but did hollywood give her the lead no lucille ball great as lucy was given the role she killed the film what a mistake there was no chemistry as there was on the stage <UNK> arthur and angela what a <UNK> when they sang it is too bad a producer does not put these two together even today
<START> this is one of those religious horror films which never explain why the forces of evil are 10 000 times stronger than those of good we've got here a satanic cult which can 1 <UNK> away people like in star trek 2 kill through little children's dolls 3 transfer a soul from one body into another 4 <UNK> <UNK> from a bigger distance and 5 cause <UNK> car crashes in which selected persons turn into spaghetti while others kids in this case survive <UNK> br br on the other hand the forces of good can 1 sit around <UNK> 2 stand around <UNK> 3 panic 4 laugh hysterically 5 waste time by doing nothing 6 read comics while people get slaughtered by the dozens and 7 arrive too late to satanic <UNK> br br in every religious horror movie i have to assume that that movie's world is inhabited by god and by satan i also have to assume that satan can't be 1 000 000 times more powerful unless the movie has a world order resembling that of hell in other words where were the priests in this film who knew something the best that this movie's priest could do is guess that there are some witches about nothing else from reading all those books in his study at the first sight of violence this priest becomes <UNK> then laughs hysterically only to finish in a major panic attack so this is supposed to be god's contribution to fighting satan ridiculous every good religious horror film has the powers of good <UNK> with some form of more or less supernatural power or at least some <UNK> knowledge of how to fight evil in that sense this movie is quite idiotic as is the casting of the <UNK> martin to play the high priest of the cult there is very little menace or awe in watching the quirky martin lead a satanic ritual i mean it didn't have to be christopher lee or but couldn't they have found someone less funny looking also why does the couple go back to the town after their car is put out of the running after their friendly encounter with the town's folk no sane person would have gone back they should've just walked on the man's explanation to his girlfriend and the viewer is that who knows what's in that direction
<START> if i assume that you know what this film is about i am also forced to assume that you've come to this review knowing that you will probably watch it regardless of what i say if all this rings true read on you are likely to find some with at least part of this review if you're <UNK> or not really entirely certain what happened in the late '70s and early '80s in the urban and suburban youth music culture you should probably read one of the reviews which pretends to be objective instead br br although i didn't grow up in california the american punk scene was the first music scene i ever truly lived in at the height of the hardcore i was immersed in from about 1979 1981 everybody had a band and the only common between bands and indeed members of their audiences were br br the <UNK> of <UNK> br br tolerance and enjoyment of difference br br a desire to have fun hard and fast br br <UNK> politics dislike of authority figures and violent slam dancing were not integral to what i experienced though there were certainly <UNK> or <UNK> who tended to be <UNK> of those who did not dress speak or act punk enough and there was often a certain amount of <UNK> credit extended from some of these <UNK> to those who tried really hard to live down to the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> self <UNK> angry young cop <UNK> br br although the interviews with audience <UNK> in penelope excellent cal punk documentary decline of western civilization present a very narrow view of the <UNK> some of us enjoyed the interviews with the bands club owners <UNK> and even the security people are much more representative of at least my own perspective and memories of 'the <UNK> nevertheless it is possible for those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is to experience this film without having their <UNK> challenged unfortunate as this is the blame for it rests solely with those who promote believe in or feel comfortable with stereotypes not the film makers don't blame the <UNK> br br the music presented here is not going to be for everybody nor even most it's not the most crude stuff out there but it's loud obnoxious fast and less concerned with technique than with raw energy br br for me seeing early black flag with ron <UNK> singing x fear and the circle <UNK> was worth far more than the cost of this hard to obtain film as much as i like the <UNK> seeing <UNK> crash for the mess and the nice guy that he was left me a bit cold nevertheless the scenes of <UNK> playing with his pet <UNK> while shut down <UNK> on and on in the background were precious the x interview is also great br br straightforward documentary style is <UNK> by wild pans and <UNK> during the musical segments during the interviews framing is used very nicely to provide context for whatever is being said considering her experience and the budget did as well as anybody could have with this film br br recommended for those who appreciate what this film is actually about and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun honest direction less rebellion before punk was co <UNK> into yet another flow within the musical mainstream and the stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy
<START> indeed <UNK> is in this movie as elizabeth talking to <UNK> though i'm just wondering how she ended up as a <UNK> where <UNK> is also in there trying to <UNK> his weight as seen from the previous episodes br br anyway this last episode is really suspended the ending is not so understandable i think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming br br i just hope the next season will give light to more unclear hanging events that were happened br br just can't wait further for season 3
<START> this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward granted i am not the movie <UNK> that some folks around here appear to be but i thought this was amazingly well acted and a powerful creation if lacking a little subtlety in i happen to admire movies that can effectively recreate the sensation of watching a stage play it creates an <UNK> that works well with this flick i am also a great fan of alan <UNK> so that might be my bias personally i found the lack of <UNK> <UNK> a good thing this could in fact be anywhere and probably is i say go easy on what was a powerful experience for me and likely for anyone involved in any sort of political activity
<START> i just watched the <UNK> this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years ago br br it's not a big movie and doesn't try to make a big <UNK> but my god the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless albert finney and tom are nothing less than amazing in this movie br br the <UNK> is the story of sir an aging shakespearean actor finney and his <UNK> norman sort of a <UNK> putting on a production of king <UNK> during the <UNK> of london in world war ii these are two men each <UNK> upon the other sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to <UNK> <UNK> and bully him into getting <UNK> for his performance of <UNK> and norman lives his life <UNK> through sir without sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anyway br br this is a character driven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life finney only <UNK> years old is completely believable as a very old very sick <UNK> bullying but brilliant stage actor he <UNK> and <UNK> at his fellow actors even when they're taking their <UNK> and is no less convincing as the <UNK> <UNK> who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a <UNK> to his elderly <UNK> <UNK> is really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship is that of <UNK> and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple br br yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are finney and the marvelous script by ronald <UNK> that is not to say that there aren't other fine performances most notably <UNK> <UNK> as the long suffering stage manager <UNK> there is a wonderful scene where sir and <UNK> talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been br br although it doesn't get talked about these days it is worth remembering that the <UNK> was nominated for five academy awards best actor nominations for both finney and best picture best director peter <UNK> and best adapted screenplay br br i had remembered this as being a good movie but i wasn't prepared to be as completely <UNK> as i was from beginning to end if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then i encourage you to see the <UNK>
<START> well sword in the moon finally got a dvd release in korea and despite the mostly negative <UNK> i've heard to it and the <UNK> dvd release i couldn't help but pick it up any wu <UNK> film is better than most non wu <UNK> films in my eyes d perhaps low expectations were an advantage because i was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable br br an assassin is killing a number of <UNK> who were involved in a revolution that <UNK> the throne and the <UNK> top <UNK> is <UNK> with <UNK> the <UNK> this doesn't take particularly long but the answer is not one he wanted to hear through prolonged flashbacks we learn why and the history of the <UNK> and the assassin and of the revolution br br the film is typically melodramatic for a korean film and <UNK> serious in tone no hk style comedy moments to be found here the story can be a little difficult to follow at first but all makes sense eventually the film goes a bit <UNK> at the end but no worse than a chang <UNK> film might do and for the most part i found it enjoyable the production values are high with some good cinematography to capture it the fight scenes aren't up to the <UNK> of the better hk wu <UNK> films but perhaps they're not meant to be the fights are more realistic in that they're less like choreographed dance routines but there's some <UNK> and occasional cgi that put the film in wu <UNK> mode the film doesn't have the best cast unfortunately with the leads being a tad lacking in charm and occasionally difficult to <UNK> from each other there's a young lady in the film that i don't think i've seen before but makes the best impression of any of the principle cast not just because you see her <UNK> or perhaps it is p the film lacks the charm and grace of the better hk wu <UNK> films and perhaps the beauty too but i only wish hk would make them half this good anymore twins effect 2 does not give me hope that that's about to happen any time soon though tsui <UNK> surely still has it in him if he can get the funding and cast sword in the moon is not going to go onto my list of favourite wu <UNK> by any means but it's a whole heap better than romantic warriors or legend of the evil lake perhaps better than too though i did like that film quite a bit more on a second viewing obviously it's nowhere near the wonderful <UNK> but it's a different affair altogether really will probably get a second viewing within three years which is perhaps the best <UNK> of how much i liked it 7 10
<START> how do two great actors <UNK> off a piece of junk like this on film goers my only conclusion is that they and their director believe that any film in which they star just must be seen and <UNK> br br now to the film probably the worst thriller i have ever seen the actors showed minimal emotion the plot was reasonable for a 1 2 hour time <UNK> not <UNK> minutes the fbi agent was almost a silly parody his partner was apparently struck dumb and spoke not one word to <UNK> robert redford the villain was a meaningless piece of crap the film was drawn out and meaningless the only question was whether the hero would die or not one truly bizarre part of the story the waiting family seemed to go on for at least several days the hero and <UNK> seemed to only take one day br br all in all waste of time
<START> the story <UNK> a french policeman is shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body is found in nice investigating the murder he finds out that he was in possession of a list that details the deeds of the russian mafia helped by his brother's girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> russian gangsters corrupt fbi agents while trying to find the list br br maximum risk is another one of the long list of action films that feature jean claude van damme as far as things go it is strictly formulaic the script sticks to the clichés the acting is mediocre there are some nicely done action sequences with an inventive car chase a fight in a burning building an escape through <UNK> a brutal fight in an elevator fleeing his enemies over an <UNK> train line director <UNK> <UNK> keeps everything going at a reasonable pace
<START> another <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> story but with a difference this includes learning self discipline when julie goes with her teacher to a <UNK> monastery she learns about herself she also her karate skills br br when the <UNK> monks visit the city some awkward and comical moments ensue not <UNK> but entertaining nonetheless br br next karate kid has much to say about looking within and <UNK> what is there as well as using what you have
<START> <UNK> edge of the city directed by martin <UNK> stars john cassavetes sidney <UNK> jack warden and ruby dee it's the story of a troubled man <UNK> who has a mysterious past that gradually comes out during the film he has a connection that gets him a job on a <UNK> <UNK> working for charlie jack warden a real <UNK> who takes from his workers and rides them hard charlie has an intense dislike for a black man t t <UNK> who holds the same position t t invites <UNK> to work on his team <UNK> defies charlie and does so <UNK> finds a place to live and with t t his his wife dee and their son's white <UNK> kathleen <UNK> when tragedy strikes none of the men on the <UNK> <UNK> will talk to the police and <UNK> has to come to grips with his values what he stands for and the meaning of friendship br br this is a really excellent black and white film that curiously isn't really about being black or white it's really about the limits one puts on <UNK> and knowing who you are charlie is a <UNK> and hates that a black man has a good position on the <UNK> t t <UNK> charlie and gives as good as he gets there's no discussion of t t and <UNK> spending time together or of t t 's son having a white teacher with whom the family also what <UNK> a loner finds difficult is accepting any friendship or in anyone these things he learns through t t br br <UNK> absolutely shines in edge of the city he's warm energetic loving and smart a man with a real enthusiasm for life afraid of nothing cassavetes is excellent and plays a character totally opposite hiding in the shadows <UNK> depressed and always nervous br br the film leaves open what happens to <UNK> whatever does he's a different man now br br strangely underrated and unknown film possibly in the shadow of a lot of the angry young men films that came out in that era
<START> controversial german journalist <UNK> who herself got <UNK> to the <UNK> wreck put this silly thriller together to save her investment br br donald sutherland is of course always watchable but he's only in three scenes he delivers his material perfectly as you can ask from a professional also the main lead <UNK> is at times very good br br the rest of the cast is however bad the actress that plays the swedish minister secretary or whatever she was she seems not listed in the cast is extremely bad br br the script has some nice ideas and the story is actually kind of interesting the final screenplay should have been re written a couple of more times though some scenes are plain ridiculous especially the end scenes br br the film is almost 2 hours which is about 45 minutes too long presented as a 60 minutes tv film this could have been really interesting as a two hour feature it's pretentious boring stupid and plain out silly br br <UNK> might be a good journalist her ideas about <UNK> using <UNK> to transport military items from <UNK> to sweden have been <UNK> as true recently when the swedish military officially said that they actually used the ship <UNK> for this but as a film producer she sucks br br the director the writer and the actors suck more br br i give this film 3 10 i would've given it a 1 if it wasn't for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times donald sutherland is in it and it has real stock footage br br but we don't even see the boat sink what kind of movie about a ship that sinks is that like a werewolf movie without werewolves

<START> two years after its initial release <UNK> still sits <UNK> the field of first person <UNK> for the <UNK> 64 even the <UNK> and series have not had the combination of graphic detail sound quality enemy intelligence challenge and overall fun that bring me back to this game over and over again the missions each have specific <UNK> that force you to think as bond not just to shoot up every baddie that pops up on your screen but also to avoid cameras <UNK> security systems rescue <UNK> protect the bond girl and so on q <UNK> abound in this game including the famous watch the game is loosely based on the movie storyline including all the major characters and the best scenes of the movie from the <UNK> jump to the prop plane escape to the tank chase through st <UNK> even the <UNK> is <UNK> where possible so you'll recognize various situations if you've seen the film other levels are added to challenge the player and string together the scenes a little more with each difficulty level the mission <UNK> are more difficult the enemies smarter and the bullets more lethal i still have not gotten through the 00 agent levels <UNK> can be opened not by entering <UNK> or pushing buttons but by <UNK> certain levels within a certain time frame and additional characters can be opened up for the <UNK> the <UNK> is still the best among the first person <UNK> it's not as crisp as but it doesn't slow down nearly as much tons of <UNK> give your friends reason to blow each other up over and over again and one more time just for kicks there are better games for the <UNK> such as <UNK> and all things star wars but rare has continued their streak of outstanding games with a first person <UNK> that has not and will not be <UNK> until they top themselves in 2000 with perfect dark
<START> i caught this flick on the trail end of a tape i had used to capture a movie i truly wanted to wanted to see again when i saw <UNK> <UNK> name in the opening credits i decided to watch it it was actually mildly entertaining and took me back in the <UNK> machine to the <UNK> movies that hollywood <UNK> out during the sixties much in the same genre as the current austin powers stuff oh the acting was not superb nor was the plot but it was worth watching there was some delightful scenery although ms welch provided the most pleasant of such tape it if you get the chance and watch it when you have absolutely nothing else to do it is not a <UNK> but it won't have you rolling in the <UNK> wanting more either
<START> is a sad almost <UNK> style of portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly <UNK> the movie as explained by one of the main characters <UNK> it also means fate br br indeed it's fate that bring the two main characters <UNK> and alex together and <UNK> the problems that ensue br br on the whole i enjoyed it quite a bit it starts out as an <UNK> the down and <UNK> drama road movie an builds into a suspenseful thriller road movie br br there were two things that i found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a higher rating i gave it an 8 the first is the major point of why did alex give the stuff away she was so desperate for cash that she sold her <UNK> for a <UNK> sum and then she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger her explanation was unconvincing also how did they get through the gate where were the cops
<START> i thought id check this film out as i'm currently making a film about a mysterious box therefore it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of a mysterious and unexpected box br br before going to the cinema i had a high expectation of this film with actresses like cameron diaz you would expect the acting especially hers to be great the acting was a sort of let down for the film the characters accents changed throughout the film it made it unbelievable br br the whole idea of a weird box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a brilliant story but i feel the director let it down this film had potential it could of been a lot lot better than it was br br this film had no middle to it it was too confusing and needed a steady storyline nobody wants to go into the cinema and come out thinking what have i just watched 'i didn't get it at all ' sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again but this film made people want to never ever want to hear of the film again throughout watching i noticed that half the audience had left before the ending i feel every single person had been let down watching this film because of the high expectations and how slow parts of the film was br br lets put the bad points to one side i did like however the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end it was unexpected it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and scary it would of been to be in that position the lighting and the effects made it look excellent this scene looked slightly more 1990's than the 1970's that this film is supposed to be br br this film was confusing because it had so many different bits to it parts that you would expect to be up at the end where everything comes clear but it didn't it totally went against an audiences expectations even though leaving the film on a cliff <UNK> not giving the audience a reason why things happen could work and do really well but this one didn't it was a creative different unusual film i thought it had potential could of been better disappointed didn't enjoy it wouldn't buy it on dvd to be honest
<START> if you like the excitement of a good submarine drama and the fun of a good comedy then this film comes highly recommended <UNK> gives an excellent performance here br br the film also gives you something to think about the next time a serious sub movie asks for <UNK> br br
<START> i caught the first screening of driving lessons at the <UNK> film festival rupert shows he can act past harry potter laura <UNK> is amazing as the overbearing mother julie <UNK> is hilarious as dame <UNK> with a mouth worse than a sailor i hope that this film is picked up by an american <UNK> so that everyone can see it this film is not only about driving lessons but life lessons ben rupert is torn between wanting to <UNK> his overbearing mother and <UNK> father and wanting to live his own life it's an amazing film from an amazing director whose taken his own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see and everyone who can should
<START> <UNK> there was you is one of the worst films we've ever seen it fails in every respect <UNK> <UNK> was better as an actress in <UNK> in comparison this film is when a character stumbles once or even twice in the course of a film one can understand it but character falls <UNK> stumbles so often that she might have a bit of jerry lewis in her in her <UNK> each <UNK> fall was probably <UNK> choreographed and <UNK> and <UNK> although this is bad enough for a film the actors dylan mcdermott and <UNK> <UNK> seem to spend most of the plot going out for a smoke or trying to find a place to smoke if the film was a <UNK> on having no place to smoke ok but it isn't br br however long this film runs it is too long by 10 minutes past the running time br br oh <UNK> <UNK> almost acts in a public forum meeting you almost see her break life into the character oh it's almost as convincing as her scene yelling at michael douglas in basic instinct hmm on second thought not really br br this is a film to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and are trapped in <UNK> <UNK> anonymous or forced to watch <UNK> of hooper burt reynolds and even then toss a <UNK> or go to sleep
<START> i attended a screening of this film travolta came to do a q a after the film ended it was a small screening room in <UNK> out of courtesy to him i did not walk out which i wanted to do this is film making at its worst to start the script was poorly written the writer writes in one voice the dialogue was stilted and clichéd how this writer director got scarlet <UNK> john travolta and lions gate entertainment to back her on this is the only brilliant thing she accomplished in this fiasco br br i do in fact recommend this film to all aspiring screenwriters directors and filmmakers because when you are told that you are wasting your time and it will be impossible for you to reach your goals hey just look at this crap and say to yourself if they can make this then br br ps travolta did a great q a though he was at ease spoke <UNK> and was a down to earth nice guy the director writer stood on the <UNK> when john tried to engage her in the conversation she stood back like a piece of wood and never joined in i looked at her and i thought how was this person able to successfully pitch to agents studio <UNK> top talent when she can't open her mouth at a screening of her own film the conclusion from a few of us in <UNK> was that she must have strong family connections in the business br br after you watch this you should follow it with guy <UNK> zero star masterpiece swept away with the most unintentionally funny and worst performance by wife madonna she's so bad and looks so bad in this film i figure this was her his way of getting back at her for all the abuse he takes from her at home
<START> it may be difficult to believe but the basic plot of this abysmal flick has been lifted from hitchcock's <UNK> classic vertigo to see edward james <UNK> in the part once played by james stewart is heart breaking sean young is better but still a poor substitute for kim novak
<START> absolutely the best thing i have ever seen on tv it was both entertaining and informative the reason i found this site is an attempt to find out how i can again see it br br in the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with gen leslie who was responsible for the nuts and <UNK> of running the manhattan project most certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past br br the casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding it was the first time that i noticed sam <UNK> as an actor except for height he looked very much like robert <UNK> br br the early scene in which <UNK> is leading a class of graduate students was especially intriguing to me
<START> this canadian movie is the worst ever stunningly amateurish when the bad guys rob a boat we see two women with machine guns and one of them says with a very low voice we're robbing your ship she <UNK> and is totally shy very <UNK> br br the two karate <UNK> heroes are year old five feet tall twin brothers they're really bad actors in fact everyone involved in this production is a non actor br br there are so many continuity mistakes in this cheap production that it's amazing in one scene the guys are wearing one type of <UNK> in the following shot they're wearing completely different <UNK> br br absolutely terrible a must see for any fan of bad movies i have it on vhs it's very rare i <UNK> it
<START> <UNK> dare to be truthful is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original madonna truth or dare julie <UNK> brilliant creation <UNK> <UNK> highly entertaining documentary although it wasn't exactly daring insightful <UNK> or truthful with a <UNK> to detail right down to the <UNK> i highly recommend this for madonna fans julie brown fans or anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody
<START> the film someone had to make br br <UNK> the rules of engagement <UNK> the evidence behind the <UNK> in <UNK> texas that led to the destruction of the branch <UNK> and the alleged government cover up br br the first thing you need to know about this film you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies this is not done for shock value but to illustrate points about the way they died as if you were present at the <UNK> <UNK> br br the second thing you should know about this film at two and a quarter hours it's pretty <UNK> especially if you already followed the events closely at the time if you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report this may be essential viewing if on the other hand you want a more <UNK> albeit <UNK> one sided version of events you should see <UNK> the big lie br br in summary this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event and is very <UNK> but as a work of film making could test your patience especially if you have a short attention span and it's at times superfluous for those who watched the <UNK> <UNK> and the 60 minutes reports br br perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the raid or the psychological <UNK> tactics the fbi used <UNK> rock music at the <UNK> and their charismatic leaders all rock musicians themselves picking up their <UNK> and turning their massive <UNK> to blast their own music right back at them
<START> the storyline seemed fine the actors seemed fine the movie should br br have been fine but it sure wasn't it didn't lead us anywhere the br br scenes are weird maybe it was meant to create something new to make br br us think that <UNK> it did where is the rest of this film to me it br br was waste of money time and talent someone might want to see this br br for curiosity to see if they can figure it out other i personally br br wouldn't recommend this to anyone
<START> if you want to enjoy the money you would spend to rent this money go buy a bag of ice and watch it melt that's more entertaining than this movie br br bill shame on you br br or if you wanna see this movie plot go in a corn field bring two of the most annoying little girls you can find run around for a couple hours having the girls scream as loud as possible then send me the couple bucks you <UNK> spent br br i enjoyed the first dark <UNK> after watching the sequel i'm going to cry myself to sleep
<START> this is a movie which reminds me of <UNK> starring <UNK> from the 80's the issue of parents kids <UNK> is interesting but was handled in a rather unoriginal manner the characters were not developed fully and the kids seemed to go from being loving in the first of the movie to being totally <UNK> about the parents this transformation was not credible to say the least they have explored this a little more amitabh and <UNK> were miscast as this helpless old couple firstly <UNK> was not too convincing in this role because he just did not look like he should be helpless i mean why not just go back to work where he is wanted instead of being w kids who didnt want them <UNK> was not convincing as a 60 <UNK> old either she didnt look a day over 50 then the whole of the book <UNK> winning the booker prize <UNK> credibility all in all a movie that handles an important issue but have been made better i give it 5 10
<START> jerry <UNK> owner of zombie <UNK> finest <UNK> returns for more undead action in the sequel to director todd <UNK> atrocious home made gore fest zombie bloodbath this time around jerry plays a sleazy low life thug who along with his equally despicable partner in crime some escaped <UNK> several teenagers and a bunch of screaming girls comes face to face with a <UNK> of <UNK> flesh eating corpses br br obviously having <UNK> <UNK> about <UNK> his craft in the two years since zombie bloodbath sheets delivers another shoddy mess of a film that somehow manages to be even worse than the feat that i thought was almost impossible to achieve the acting is uniformly lousy the effects amateurish and cheap most of the gore appears to be nothing more than a selection of <UNK> and blood from the local <UNK> shop the story incomprehensible as far as i could <UNK> the zombies rise from the dead because a scarecrow <UNK> them to and the direction <UNK> laden with cheap looking video effects and completely meaningless cuts to black and white br br and as if that wasn't enough to convince you of this film's complete lack of redeeming features the simply mind <UNK> moronic ending should do the trick the few remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently happens to have a <UNK> of flesh eating <UNK> laying on its passenger the thing for <UNK> the undead but strangely enough not at all <UNK> to the living
<START> first of all <UNK> hepburn is badly miscast as clara she just can't be convincing as the devoted <UNK> rather smarmy wife that the writers have created br br but the real weakness of the film is its <UNK> in the face of a potentially great piece of drama <UNK> manic <UNK> disorder amounts to oh oh i have a headache and the occasional angry word suicide the word is used but there's no sign of it in domestic scenes and when we see him in the mental hospital he's calm and subdued and smiling and optimistic a superficial treatment and is so <UNK> and <UNK> no sign of his gruff humour his love of <UNK> the <UNK> of the establishment no sign of his tortured attitude toward sex and women resulting from spending his youth playing piano in <UNK> and was <UNK> long concert career entirely about promoting <UNK> music or was she in fact a remarkable <UNK> who wanted a career for herself a female <UNK> <UNK> out a place for herself in a male world any sort of treatment of the lives of great artists is better than none but this is a standard hollywood middle of the road approach particularly disappointing because the real story is so much more dramatic so much more interesting so much more human
<START> i felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for <UNK> the primary actors campbell scott jennifer <UNK> <UNK> butler james <UNK> iii patrick stewart and leslie caron were very well selected and played their parts with excellence it was a very uplifting movie that i wish was available on tape or dvd a rare gem
<START> i must admit i was against this movie from the outset but i tried my hardest to be <UNK> i really did but the very idea of <UNK> a sophisticated witty entertaining quirky british classic full of character has to be dubious from the outset br br people in my house were watching this so i <UNK> my pride and told myself to be professional about films i have studied them at <UNK> after all br br as expected for an american film of this sort the movie began with a chase which wasn't bad indeed many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark br br yet the characterisation was abysmal the set pieces could very easily have been spliced from any american schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all character br br seeming to take a <UNK> angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery the us version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of donald <UNK> character this allows our us cousins plenty of opportunity for <UNK> <UNK> eyed vengeance seeking against the <UNK> which it <UNK> to predictable <UNK> this is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring <UNK> <UNK> oh pretty oh so pretty look at her pretty wounded <UNK> eyes everyone which were thoroughly nauseating her entrance scene particularly was like something out of resident evil or tomb <UNK> which were both a more entertaining and b had better <UNK> because they couldn't mess up a game like they could with british cinema which was already chock full of spark people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration but i <UNK> the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most ham <UNK> <UNK> i've seen in some time and exposes cynical hollywood blockbuster lust for what it is br br if you like any of these actors by the way and you agree with any of the above comments do not go to see this film if i had the opportunity of watching <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> history <UNK> after seeing ed norton in this i would have <UNK> likewise jason <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and i suppose 'the is okay if you like that sort of thing br br sadly all the set pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking <UNK> he's smart ' he's cool ' <UNK> what a tough guy ' then there's the <UNK> pc <UNK> who has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> across his <UNK> but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance to be honest if you've seen one or two films like it you might easily confuse the two as <UNK> from the jerry bruckheimer stable not that jerry is <UNK> awful by the way but he just uses the clichés to excess as everyone knows or should br br this is where i have to come clean i didn't manage to make it to the end so i couldn't even say whether the brilliant ending in the michael caine version made it but i'm sorry it's just one of those extremely rare films that if i'd seen it at a cinema i would have walked out and staged a small protest outside it's not just that it is another identical by the numbers <UNK> 14 or something <UNK> eleven was fine but don't bother with the rest with all the <UNK> <UNK> fake <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of such a film but i couldn't <UNK> anything from the original at all br br so if you are expecting 'the italian <UNK> and not <UNK> albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters some <UNK> elements and cardboard cut out script writing then do not watch i don't mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal <UNK> job that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic seriously show some pride i felt thoroughly justified in my <UNK> and <UNK> reaction when i first heard that the film would be made avoid at all costs br br p s some of the action sequences aren't bad at all so add an extra <UNK> to the mark if you like this sort of thing
<START> alexandra maria lara a very beautiful and <UNK> woman but not a good actress in all the films i've seen her in she appears to me as the exact same character whether it be in the downfall <UNK> der <UNK> and now <UNK> <UNK> fred she always is plays the young good hearted woman who is a little naive and doesn't know how to handle the things happening to her she <UNK> of a <UNK> of probably five different facial expressions that she works with <UNK> i personally have a hard time believing that she could play a mysterious and slightly obnoxious character because it just isn't in here so she's <UNK> as the nice girl next door which she is but once again she ain't up to snuff when it comes to acting <UNK> <UNK> same thing the film downright stupid as it was an american movie it would have been a great role for adam sandler who i don't like either i wasn't offended by the fact that this is a film with handicapped people in it i just thought that the jokes resulting from this weren't funny at all i <UNK> twice or three times but when i was halfway through it i was just bored and annoyed and wanted this flick to end
<START> this was a excellent back when it came out it had some the best talent available and a funny story between <UNK> cameron and ali it was hard to choose who is <UNK> and add in <UNK> from fresh prince and all the other big names and you get a blockbuster ok a made for tv blockbuster but none the less if you can find this move don't miss it br br
<START> i only voted excellent because this film took two <UNK> of <UNK> one in 1970 and one for every year afterward br br <UNK> really changed br br joe is actually a jerk a big stupid <UNK> who's mad at everybody else in the world for his own idiocy this ain't really a spoiler but the key to the film is the big corporate never does wrong guy making friends with this semi joe and he gets some kind of <UNK> from his <UNK> and stupidity and sense of being <UNK> br br yet few would argue that the dealer boyfriend did deserve to die and those kids shouldn't have ripped joe and <UNK> off and joe and <UNK> were actually getting into the <UNK> and the young skin until they got ripped off a simple film in many ways except that in 1970 new york city was par to a battle zone thanks to <UNK> care and all of the money going to the war in vietnam as i write this 2 25 2007 there is a very long wait on netflix for this film which makes me happy because i think there are people out there who want to learn this was a pretty good <UNK> not exact a bit <UNK> but actually pretty close to how it was back then and the scary thing is things haven't changed that much sure there's no more <UNK> but that just means the <UNK> slavery has won out br br amazing how <UNK> will complain about not making enough money then complain that 5 15 an hour is too much to pay their people
<START> what a great show a very underrated dramatic show it is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other character s are the main character s i think the best character on the show is <UNK> he is a tough bad guy and an <UNK> on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be this show has many murders i think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show but i have to admit that is one of the reasons why i think the show is so great i think some characters were killed off a little early but some sure still made their mark you can't compare things like prison break to this show they are totally different i think some of the actors on the show are also very good and underrated and should what is due to them a great show my <UNK> a show that should be considered of the the <UNK> for years to come
<START> the battle at <UNK> was <UNK> longest and most expensive short he had made up to that point in it we see him trying to perfect the large scale action scene that would be necessary in his full length features <UNK> in all the elements that had made his previous action shorts successful br br griffith uses the western format  already the ideal backdrop for pure straight ahead action set pieces  as the setting for his first epic battle like many westerns of the <UNK> the starting point is a character from the east heading out west  a device which perhaps helped ease the audience into the wilderness and here those <UNK> are a pair of children which was important for the type of picture this develops into for griffith you couldn't have action without a sense of vulnerability and here he <UNK> it in with the kids from back east <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> mother of the only baby in town and even some <UNK> that are at risk of ending up on the menu br br all this <UNK> the way for an exceedingly complex and layered action sequence <UNK> the trapped heroine scenario and the ride to the rescue with the battles that griffith had been depicting since his earliest civil war pictures in <UNK> there is a phenomenal amount going on here and griffith does very well at maintaining the <UNK> pace throughout and keeping everything coherent and logical however <UNK> x amount of elements in an action sequence does not necessarily make it that many times more exciting no matter how <UNK> they are balanced and griffith did create better tension <UNK> <UNK> before and after this one br br but even a griffith picture so heavily focused on action would not be without its drama characterisation and <UNK> in the battle at <UNK> the emotional set up is dealt with briefly but <UNK> first we have the scene in which the <UNK> leave their home the <UNK> they travel on heads away from the camera making use of depth and distance to express their moving away from safety and civilization an equally effective scene is the one in which we are introduced to the young family of <UNK> bobby harron and their baby the people of the town <UNK> over the precious <UNK> then off screen revealing that two indians were watching them from the background adding a sinister little note of danger br br of course many viewers today have pointed out the battle at offensive portrayal of native americans in contrast with the more sympathetic red man's view but perhaps all is not what it seems first of all take a look at the indian <UNK> son's  it's black and covered in shiny white <UNK> it looks to me like a <UNK> king's jacket perhaps <UNK> slightly for the <UNK> climate now have a look at the war dance they perform later on  it has a certain knees up mother brown air to it these aren't indians they're <UNK> so it shouldn't be offensive to native americans just <UNK>
<START> what a shocker for starters i couldn't stand the constant screaming and <UNK> <UNK> all the time it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying the jerky camera movements were also annoying the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot and then there's the ending i'm still not really sure what to make of it i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid br br the case had a couple of those little award winner nominations symbols on it so i figured it couldn't be too bad i was wrong if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
<START> but to be a little more precise i do not think that it is as bad as it actually could be <UNK> the actors famous to semi famous didn't do a very great job directors fault could be the script as well hard for me to say anyway if you are after a lot of cool guns and action this is not the movie for you but they do run around with a lot of ww2 vintage guns sort of fun well i guess i could say more but it just doesn't feel as if it's worth it if you are desperate enough or a hackman freak see it otherwise don't br br live well and <UNK>
<START> i always felt that ms had never gotten a role fitting her skills familiar to millions as the lt on law and order she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases always in a supporting role <UNK> <UNK> blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as <UNK> successful <UNK> in a world changing from <UNK> to <UNK> but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a <UNK> house in <UNK> new york a <UNK> of buffalo br br the story could be set in any major african american community of the 50's and 60's from sweet <UNK> to new <UNK> harlem but the <UNK> <UNK> angle is only a subtle <UNK> in the colorful lives of the folks at <UNK> <UNK> house the story revolves around <UNK> relationships with all kinds of people played by some of the best actors in the business i <UNK> did not say black actors this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black except for jimmy of course i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a <UNK> day
<START> imaginary heroes is a 2004 film starring <UNK> weaver jeff daniels <UNK> <UNK> michelle williams and <UNK> br br the story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child commits suicide br br ordinary people has been mentioned often in relation to this film it's sort of ordinary people with a role <UNK> the mother in this case sandy travis weaver is more accessible than the father ben daniels who is clearly <UNK> and unable to cope like ordinary people the younger son tim <UNK> is the focus of the film br br for me the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious <UNK> about it there were some wonderful interactions mother and son mother and neighbor brother and sister williams and some good offbeat moments what never <UNK> was ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with sandy this seems to have been the goal of director writer dan harris in one scene in a <UNK> store the <UNK> kid assumes sandy is about 30 and gives her his phone number in almost the next scene daniels asks sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday weaver was <UNK> when this film was made actually probably <UNK> and looks phenomenal so what is ben looking at however there's something <UNK> about ben's complete <UNK> because the viewer doesn't really see how daniels ever was attached to that family br br the end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes everyone is very good with weaver and <UNK> being the <UNK> br br there's not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares the script could have been <UNK> but imaginary heroes is a good effort
<START> i honestly fail to understand why people love this show so much a friend of mine watches this and since i like sci fi i tried to watch along since the plot of the show sounded promising but in truth it really is a very boring show the only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the video game like cgi effects and the complete <UNK> of muppets note that i call it muppets because they actually really look like muppets not like the aliens they should be br br speaking of which the muppets and make up effects are horribly <UNK> in this show you have this guy who could be best described as a alien dwarf hybrid you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy <UNK> girl you've got a floating <UNK> mouth frog alien it just feels very unnecessary and furthermore even to the point that you feel distracted from the whole storyline about a lost astronaut br br every episode is also too much of a stand alone the creators of this show directed this in such a way that every episode almost feels like a whole other show at least up until the point that you see the main characters muppets again that is the whole plot about the main character getting back to earth is way to much pushed to the background at points the acting is also quite bad br br conclusion if you want good sci fi just look somewhere else this isn't even real sci fi to begin with in my opinion since the show is more aimed at fantasy elements with all the <UNK> and weird dreams going on and if you just want to see muppets then i suggest you watch the muppet show and feel glad that this abomination of a show has come to a end br br by the way doesn't anyone have with the concept of a living spaceship thats right doctor who started that concept almost about 30 years ago this show is like a collection of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scripts and events that were abandoned for a good reason only to be picked up by this horrible show
<START> how sad it is when a film as wonderful as jurassic park slowly into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise the <UNK> sequel jurassic park iii has given no thought to characters a story or pretty much a script and instead relies on non stop dinosaur action which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch the dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology after 7 years of cgi <UNK> it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was <UNK> out for the summer relying only on its name the introduction of a <UNK> does not a great movie make br br go see shrek again br br
<START> i quit watching the west wing after aaron quit writing and producing it just wasn't the same imagine my thrill at seeing a film that he wrote again it has been a long time the american president a few good men his script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy he made a compelling story believable and made me <UNK> at the same time br br tom hanks was incredible as a small time texas <UNK> whose <UNK> only wanted lower <UNK> and to keep their guns not a hard job so he had plenty of time to fool around and that he did his office staff looked as if he were at the playboy mansion like he reportedly said you can teach them to type but you can't teach them to grow tits despite his sexist attitude which fits right in with a texas <UNK> they were <UNK> loyal especially his <UNK> amy adams <UNK> former <UNK> girl br br now add a rich texas <UNK> who wants something done in afghanistan played perfectly by julia roberts and a pain in his <UNK> ass cia agent superbly done by philip seymour hoffman and you have a movie well worth watching br br outstanding writing and <UNK> acting and a story that needed to be told what more do you want at the movies
<START> in spite of many positive reviews this is a very slow film with three essentially good actors <UNK> the most banal dialog you will ever hear this is another road movie that really goes no where the camera frequently goes out of focus and the constant <UNK> in some of the over long scenes is annoying br br the three characters are attractive but note likable the cast also sets what must be an <UNK> record for the use of the tired word dude even howard stern has abandoned this tired <UNK> br br the three primary actors and one supporting actor show great promise they are clearly comfortable and <UNK> allow themselves to be depicted as shallow and even goofy the character actors all seem as they are <UNK> amateurs who <UNK> <UNK> to speak a few lines indeed they all physically fit their roles well br br all in all a dull 90 minutes that seems more like an eternity this is among my ten worst films of all time
<START> mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment and fair play to him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know what you are going to get with rourke mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more and you don't want most of it br br first and foremost this whole thing just doesn't make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a bus load of <UNK> <UNK> ireland for london he is on the run from the cops and from his own army <UNK> he has also <UNK> to never kill again it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him br br however when he gets to london he is <UNK> down by a local mobster bates looking like his <UNK> and hair came straight off a <UNK> <UNK> to kill his main <UNK> in turn for <UNK> 000 and a boat trip to the us rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest <UNK> and <UNK> the crime to him in the <UNK> in order to keep the <UNK> mouth shut he figures it is better than killing him br br a wealth of things <UNK> here which just don't add up br br 1 why pick rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a scene <UNK> an employee is <UNK> to a wall by a couple of <UNK> with what look like these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing br br 2 not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes why didn't that guy simply kill the <UNK> and save all the <UNK> of dealing with rourke br br 3 <UNK> sees the murder take place and the police let him go off without protection i may add to take confession no way br br 4 rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession why aren't the cops checking the place out br br 5 rourke hangs around the church and blind niece in particular for days afterward without anybody bothering him what he's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder stupid br br 6 the cops actually meet rourke in the church <UNK> the <UNK> and have no idea who he is do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing they don't even check up on him br br 7 why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat you'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other br br 8 why does <UNK> brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not <UNK> himself for a few days at least until rourke has been safely <UNK> to the states ridiculous br br 9 rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again utterly ludicrous and besides she falls in love with him in record time a few days br br 10 the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from <UNK> point of view br br 11 things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say that in <UNK> along <UNK> houses rourke in a <UNK> until the boat is ready to <UNK> and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house but yet will bed a blind girl br br 12 rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is and the henchman practically <UNK> out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked br br 13 priest is an ex army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally <UNK> for and yet another cringe worthy scene br br i'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning <UNK> hair so <UNK> red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but <UNK> to a barely heard <UNK> at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing style br br i have just mentioned them br br overall a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in rourke on the cross preaching from a <UNK> which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director br br 4 10
<START> i'm not exactly sure why i ordered from netflix probably because i enjoy bbc dramas it was on a list of <UNK> i had no idea what i was about to see the plot which i will only describe in general so as not to spoil it for anyone who will see it after reading my review has more twists and turns than a mountain road in the <UNK> of the sort that appear in caper movies they are very unusual in a period drama not having read the novel and i do not intend to do so i was totally <UNK> for the surprise that ends the first segment on the dvd and equally surprised by the subsequent twists and turns nonetheless it is extremely well acted by the two young principals by sally <UNK> in particular as sue and by <UNK> cassidy as <UNK> and in key supporting roles by <UNK> <UNK> as the mother figure in a house of thieves and by charles dance as the rich uncle who <UNK> pornographic <UNK> and who <UNK> young <UNK> from the mad house where her mother lived to be his secretary the lesbian affair between <UNK> and sue is the big news in the movie but really not its <UNK> the <UNK> is a plot to steal the fortune that <UNK> is due on her 21st birthday the turns and twists in the plot add tension though not much credibility to the movie however no viewer is likely to doubt that <UNK> and sue will somehow end up together <UNK> as the credits roll although one has been raised as a and serves a collector of pornography and the other is a <UNK> posing as a <UNK> maid the author obviously means for them to live together in the end it's a bit difficult to swallow since each has <UNK> to cheat the other despite these <UNK> i liked movie well enough it does not quite deserve the praise that others have <UNK> on it the most <UNK> and interesting scenes take place inside the <UNK> where one of the two young women has been confined until she is able to escape and return to london to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion sally <UNK> sue is a very impressive young actress able to convey her character's <UNK> and changing emotions with her facial expressions and her eyes no doubt we'll see more of her i certainly hope so
<START> i give this a 10 out of 10 not because the plot was hard to <UNK> because it wasn't but because it leaves one caring for the characters the acting by all the cast is superb especially joan and it's a marvellous episode because of it's heart br br miss <UNK> is called upon by jason dying request to investigate and solve a murder that happened some seven or eight years previously and she has to discover who why and when as she goes along mr is the same as was in a <UNK> mystery and so there is a sense of a connection here br br nemesis is definitely one for the amateur <UNK> among us and if you are one of those who is only happy with lots of blood guts and rip roaring action sequences then you won't like it but if you are like me one who loves knowing about people and discovering what makes them <UNK> then nemesis is the one for you
<START> in a bizarre experiment an astronaut is abandoned on the moon as alice <UNK> <UNK> a troubled <UNK> living in italy wakes from a nightmare about a <UNK> mission mixed with an old movie that frightened her as a child she also has no <UNK> of the last three days except for a torn photo of the hotel she finds in her apartment fired from her job alice heads to that resort island to try and piece together the mystery br br often <UNK> as a giallo due to it's director the fifth <UNK> and the presence of evelyn stewart and <UNK> kinski <UNK> is actually a deliberately paced psycho thriller with sci fi overtones <UNK> the distinction between dream reality memory and movies the disturbing story is beautifully photographed by oscar winner <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> score by <UNK> <UNK> it also combines elements of such diverse films as <UNK> and <UNK> death in <UNK> in it's depiction of alienation isolation <UNK> and maybe madness brazilian actress <UNK> <UNK> on screen all the time does a <UNK> of her carol <UNK> in lucio <UNK> a lizard in a woman's skin as alice a young woman thrust into a mystery that makes her question her sanity the locations mirror <UNK> unstable state of mind the island of off season with it's <UNK> influence and ancient ruins is a lonely almost mystical place unwilling to give up its secrets evelyn stewart has a bit in the beginning as a concerned friend and oscar winner <UNK> <UNK> are hotel guests peter plays a handsome <UNK> trying to help <UNK> and the ever intense <UNK> kinski is in the film within a film <UNK> on the moon br br <UNK> is a classy case of guaranteed 100 euro weird but not for everyone there's only one murder toward the end but you won't see it coming as the film starts to come together
<START> this short movie <UNK> to focus on one issue <UNK> known as <UNK> shock the film presents the condition of average romanian in <UNK> romania who finds out that the life and the problems are not different from communist period and if you want something you must <UNK> around to get it br br so our main character is fired after a long while he is around 50 and needs to get a similar job but the only job available is one inferior he is forced to take it because the lack of money br br my opinion is that you have to live in romania so that this movie can be as real and tragic as it seems
<START> i enjoy watching robert <UNK> that was the main reason that i rented this movie i also wanted to see a story take place out in the middle of nowhere where the characters could work off of each other really well with no <UNK> br br i found the movie to be dull i couldn't get interested in the characters i couldn't get interested in the story which seemed to <UNK> nowhere br br after watching this movie for an hour i turned it off i will rate the movie 4 out of 10 this falls well below the mandatory 7 rating that makes a movie worthwhile to watch
<START> <UNK> banned movie was quite disappointing in my opinion the movie is about a couple who go to a greek island to kill of all perverted people apparently you know you got something pretty sick when one of the first scenes include a guy having sex with a goat and then killing it off br br but things only get worse from that point as all scenes pretty much look alike they meet some people so they either kill or have sex with them preferably both br br the ending is ok <UNK> when the couple turn out to be brother and sister and she is just letting him <UNK> somewhere but overall one would have expected more no substance here i'm afraid br br 3 10
<START> once again mr <UNK> has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences of which there are very few i just did not care about any of the characters most of us have ghosts in the closet and <UNK> character are realized early on and then forgotten until much later by which time i did not care the character we should really care about is a very cocky <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a <UNK> closet his only <UNK> appears to be winning over <UNK> finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker <UNK> tells us all about ghosts we are told why <UNK> is driven to be the best with no prior <UNK> or <UNK> no magic here it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour in
<START> what can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no stars with absolutely no bad performances not one poorly delivered line of dialog and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm heart of the protagonists in the story br br it's a jewel a diamond a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the american west a west not settled by grand heroes like <UNK> or cody or masterson or <UNK> but by the spread of the everyday man and woman <UNK> and ranch hands <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and and <UNK> of the day some looking for <UNK> some for peace and quiet some for religious freedom br br it is perhaps a very spiritual story though not promoting any particular religion for even the non mormon <UNK> portrayed by ben johnson and harry carey jr act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story regardless of religious <UNK> and beliefs and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the <UNK> train comes upon the stranded medicine show people and in true biblical fashion like david and <UNK> or <UNK> and the <UNK> they are the guardian angels sent to the <UNK> train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil <UNK> <UNK> clan <UNK> them to the <UNK> in the garden of <UNK> and <UNK> what it is they have to do afterward it's a sweet <UNK> tale of the west that hits every target john ford takes aim at br br nowadays i have a western santa claus whose red outfit is covered with a <UNK> coat whose red <UNK> cap is replaced by a brown who carries a <UNK> bag of presents and a <UNK> of rope to my santa i added a winchester rifle with a <UNK> to put on one of his shoulders and a <UNK> revolver to <UNK> into his <UNK> when people at the office ask why my santa has to carry guns i simply <UNK> snakes after all isn't the spirit of the christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve br br fifty five years later especially post <UNK> the <UNK> and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then
<START> <UNK> as another reviewer described this film is a fitting word the director's idea was to present bach without plot acting fun <UNK> dialog narrative or drama mission accomplished <UNK> pretentious yes cinematic no way this is anti cinema no one moves hardly anyone talks the camera holds static shots for 10 12 minutes at a time very very occasionally the camera will <UNK> in you may catch a glimpse of <UNK> fingers moving over the keys that's it br br if you like the idea of staring at the back of a head for 7 minutes at a stretch while listening to bach this is the film for you i'd rather listen to bach on my <UNK> with my eyes closed
<START> <UNK> was a super hit film which was loved by many peoples it tells the story of <UNK> <UNK> innocent obsession for <UNK> who loves sunny <UNK> honestly it was a entertaining movie but if you look carefully its not too realistic <UNK> khan keeps <UNK> <UNK> and tells her that he loves her too bits he gives an <UNK> in college that he loves her and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful photos of her unfortunately instead of being <UNK> that a guy loves her too bits she gets very very scared i personally know <UNK> of people that get <UNK> by someone and these people enjoy it <UNK> they play a long <UNK> <UNK> gives us a good film that does entertain widely because of shah rukh <UNK> character sunny <UNK> is suppose to be the main actor but <UNK> belongs to shah rukh khan delivering a superb performance shah rukh khan is literally the villain of the movie but i would of been happy if he got the girl because he loves her so <UNK> sunny <UNK> gives a decent performance but he beats up all those guys on his own and survives a brutal knife attack <UNK> <UNK> is cute as ever in a fairly good performance some good songs including <UNK> mere being the best
<START> whoever cast this movie was a genius every character in it is perfect for their part and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts this is a good glimpse of what life was before during the civil war the difference between the wealthy the average whites and the black people the story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days the storyline is compelling and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie there are characters you will fall in love with there are characters you will hate and you will find yourself emotionally involved br br both my wife and i loved it and we will watch it again in a few years i'm sure
<START> technically this movie would have had it all decent actors a nice landscape no obvious sights of a lack of budget a celebrity like richard attenborough the plot summary also sounded promising suggesting a satire on silly <UNK> and common people it br br however it never delivers the plot is simply too illogical throughout the whole movie not one person does a single sensible thing mad politicians ridiculous soldiers brain dead villagers all just <UNK> from one incredible situation to the next what they all do never makes sense in a context beyond the current scene br br of course this kind of movie has to be absurd and exaggerated however it's also supposed to have at least one instance to point out the madness behind splitting a city in the middle actually there are at least two attempts which unfortunately fail the main character who doesn't seem to have a clue about what's happening to him and the writer who occasionally cracks jokes from the off that might be considered funny by an audience <UNK> solely of 12 year olds br br what i found most <UNK> is that the movie tries to be funny all the time but didn't made me laugh once i've seen several bad funny movies but until yet every single one of them featured at least 2 or 3 good laughs so in this sense is really remarkable br br if you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot check out brazil don't waste your time on
<START> the texas revolution of to <UNK> including the periods <UNK> and immediately following is depicted in this mediocre 3 hour made for television film whose only redeeming value is bringing light and paying homage to stephen f austin the so called father of texas whose life story had long been overshadowed by that of the legendary sam <UNK> the rest of the film is simply the usual santa anna is a <UNK> storyline and with a weak attempt to show the mexican perspective with a fictional hispanic character displaying stereotypical latin <UNK> combined with short low budget battle scenes such as the and san <UNK> this film is recommended only for real history buffs who who do not come from mexico to its credit the mexican uniforms look accurate and the romantic subplot another love triangle doesn't take up too much screen time overall this movie depicts the violent <UNK> movement by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> racial minority to be a positive and just revolution against mexican <UNK> as <UNK> by the general antonio lopez de santa anna the so called <UNK> of the west
<START> we screened this movie in a club as an example of how classic literature can become twisted into some of the most awful movies of all time just the fact that the back of the box proudly <UNK> the plot to be set in the <UNK> <UNK> future should have been enough of a hint i think that word describes the movie itself because no matter how much technology they tried to use to save this movie the effort was completely <UNK> not to mention that our club <UNK> told us that it allegedly couldn't get a <UNK> for two years br br this cinematic failure is <UNK> with cheesy cliche dialogue that's worse than <UNK> teen poetry <UNK> character changes halfway through in a way that is in no way credible and whenever he's in an action scene he's constantly flipping like a hyper <UNK> there is even as they say a token black guy whose attempts at humor are completely out of place and of course the daughter of the leader of the <UNK> grendel is <UNK> is a total <UNK> a <UNK> whose breasts are exposed throughout the entire movie a <UNK> who wants to fight the creature yet she never puts on armor and her weapon of choice is a little <UNK> knife and despite their dire situation she still dresses up for dinner in a dress with a see through <UNK> that exposes her short shorts underwear there are a couple scenes that could pass as soft core pornography and in the second scene they even <UNK> footage from the first i thought the portrayal of grendel was bad enough but then came the end of the film which featured a display of cgi that might be decent for the 80s but is totally ridiculous for a late 90s venture i could go on but you all should watch this film for the fully laughable effect yourselves br br the other club members and i did manage to have fun watching this by taking a cue from <UNK> <UNK> and mocking it the whole way through i'm still <UNK> from an <UNK> weapon a <UNK> spinning pizza cutter on a pole
<START> jeff film is filled with heart and laughter as in <UNK> your enthusiasm his screen persona is hilarious but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal while the film chronicles his character's dreams of love performing success and weight loss it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life the supporting cast brings the <UNK> and <UNK> of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways the simple <UNK> of food friendship and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes the use of music is creative and adds to the many pleasures of this film any fan of jeff tv appearances must see it

<START> the movie <UNK> of based on the <UNK> book by joseph conrad is one with little to no detail and has an almost <UNK> like plot line if you have read the book then you know that little to none of the important story making scenes were put into the movie in the book there is so much that is left up to the imagination and i feel that that is one of the part that make the book what is it an example would be when <UNK> spent timeless hours and days even months waiting for <UNK> and that entire scene was left out of the movie again if you have read the book then you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the main theme of <UNK> best finally i feel that the movie was too cut and dry not enough though was put in to the original text and how that made the story what it is today br br if you have not read the book <UNK> of preferably the norton critical edition then don't <UNK> your time in renting or buying the movie however if you have read the book then i think that you will appreciate the book a lot more if you decide to watch the movie br br eric 2007
<START> ok so it owes pulp fiction but in my opinion has it's own voice and identity mainly because of the music video direction style sketch like narrative and great performances thomas jane delivers great the drug dealer show down is extraordinary aaron likewise james <UNK> has a short and <UNK> appearance great humor they got the wong house the <UNK> and rape scene is memorable as is mickey <UNK> cameo appearance take a peak br br great hollywood popcorn b production with strong performances of a level and rourke br br well take a peak it's worth
<START> imagine this br br whenever two people meet in this movie one of them is shot the plot just does not exist it appears that someone shot some action sequences and then tried to put them together to make a movie out of it if you decide to watch it you will regret it
<START> its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown br br i don't think alan bates has done a better film than this br br its never shown on television the only time i can recall it being shown on british tv was in the summer of 1998 i have it on tape but sadly the quality isn't great due to a dodgy <UNK> at the time br br i remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on tv it was shown on channel 4 in the early hours of the morning thereby <UNK> that it still remained unseen except for a very small audience br br i was living in <UNK> at the time and it was ironic that when i finally saw the film i realised that i had walked past the very house where it was filmed several times before the film <UNK> a fine line a married couple attempting to make light of their tragic <UNK> of <UNK> with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes br br the direction and the acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of <UNK> into bad taste br br a couple of years ago i saw a clip of the filmed theatre production with eddie izzard in the role of <UNK> and victoria hamilton playing sheila br br it showed izzard <UNK> and <UNK> about and hamilton <UNK> telling the audience to ignore him when he's being like this br br i maybe taking this out of context as i only saw a brief clip but having read the play and seen the film this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both <UNK> and <UNK> br br izzard was praised for his performance but i felt uncomfortable with what i saw br br it is perhaps surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed br br this is one of the best british films of the 70s and hopefully it will be released on dvd one day
<START> i have really enjoyed several movies by <UNK> depardieu and expected i'd like this movie a lot more than i did the biggest reason was that i just didn't find the movie very interesting or funny so it didn't hold my interest also although he does not sleep with his <UNK> daughter the idea that she is lying by telling everyone that he is her much older lover is just plain <UNK> yes i know there is no incest and i know that nobody around them knows he really is her father but i found that any kid passing her dad off as her sexual <UNK> is too <UNK> and <UNK> the movie from truly being funny in addition i really didn't like this little brat very much apart from her lies she seemed very sassy and self involved i would have preferred if somehow she'd gotten her come <UNK> and somehow been <UNK> as i just didn't like her
<START> there have been many well more than a few in any case attempts over the past 30 years to create film that has an <UNK> appearance <UNK> that this is a film director's wish to distance himself from other movies or simply to <UNK> over the low budget and <UNK> look <UNK> is on the top <UNK> of this pile br br apart from the <UNK> <UNK> anyway br br <UNK> process of <UNK> <UNK> his film changes it's structure completely imagine what this film would have looked like in glorious standard <UNK> it can almost be <UNK> as an <UNK> from another unknown culture some images are so far removed from what we expect to see on the screen they <UNK> mainly as they are <UNK> this is not last house on the left <UNK> more like leaving your cave for the first time and seeing the sun <UNK> br br watch this fever dream if you get the chance and <UNK> remember they make other more standard films every day they can wait
<START> i first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters way back when seeing it again nearly 30 years later i was surprised at how well it has held up the gags are still funny the interaction between characters works great and the cameos come off better than ever steve <UNK> has to be the best one br br my kids 9 11 and 14 all loved it and the music is good enough that they are still <UNK> the tunes many days later br br i would suggest that before seeing the movie you should view at least a half dozen episodes of the muppet show to get a sense of the back story behind the characters otherwise the movie won't make all that much sense
<START> i was truly surprised when i first saw this movie directed by it <UNK> in so much ways from the usual hollywood mass production the plot itself is simple kevin spacey plays a mental patient who claims to be from the planet k <UNK> who arrived to earth by a <UNK> of light while dr powell played by jeff bridges tries to help him to solve his <UNK> first of all i must admit the cast is perfectly chosen kevin spacey is really brilliant in portraying the intriguing character of always walking in the fine line of convincing us that it is real and then making us wonder whether he is <UNK> or not some of the gem scenes include the one where <UNK> eats the whole banana even the <UNK> while in session with dr powell or the <UNK> scene where he <UNK> shows his knowledge of the k <UNK> system to the <UNK> <UNK> jeff bridges on the other hand is the subtle rational side of this movie and he delivers it perfectly there is a whole other cast of excellent actors like <UNK> <UNK> convincing performance as ernie who make this film truly work br br k <UNK> has it all elements of comedy sci fi even psychological thriller concerning the identity but most importantly it can be <UNK> as a heartwarming drama the main premise of the movie is quite intricate but the director never lets it get loose he always keeps it believable and yet two ways the camera and photography have almost a crucial part here continuing the main idea of light travel there is much focus on light shadow play lightning settings one of the memorable scenes is where dr powell holds a crystal figure in his office which light in a beautiful way while all the time he suspects can the idea be true br br subtle and slow paced intriguing and <UNK> k <UNK> is truly a gem to watch one of the kind movie that may not be for all tastes but those who see it might fall in love with it
<START> mark in a great role a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs imitating him to perfection and dressing like him when the opportunity comes for him to take over his <UNK> role in the band he jumps at the opportunity however the role of a rock star may not be what it is <UNK> up to be and relationships can change this movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you <UNK> for may not be what you think it is once you get it overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads mark and jennifer aniston it did make me feel sad especially when emily jennifer aniston met up with chris in seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk if anybody ever <UNK> of being a rock star or a <UNK> they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle although <UNK> for a while is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want
<START> this horror movie lacks any horror or even mild suspense even the gore is not good the plot would have some promise if it was done by someone who cared about what they're writing filming but the people who made this movie obviously did not basically the film proceeds in a series of fits and starts <UNK> br br main character insists she's not crazy br br milo <UNK> about in his yellow <UNK> or rides in front of a car on his bike br br main character insists she's not crazy and <UNK> on about her passion as a <UNK> br br someone gets killed in an unsatisfying manner br br main character insists she's not crazy and <UNK> up a few fake <UNK> br br are we seeing a pattern here if you don't you may enjoy this film otherwise watch something else the budget is low low low and it shows unlike say the evil dead which makes you forget about its crap budget and the acting is bad bad bad with the possible exception of the janitor in general the movie is boring boring boring i can't think of a single scene that's actually done well in fact i disliked the movie so much i actually turned it off ten minutes before the end something i very rarely do heck i watched the non <UNK> the <UNK> and wild wild west all the way through br br 3 10 spare yourself and watch phantasm again
<START> i'm a big fan of h p <UNK> books and the <UNK> background <UNK> some rather good other stories and stuff like that and in the last years there came along some boys who did movies about h p 's work  for the bigger part low flicks  and showed them to the public at places like the h p <UNK> film festival now like i said most of them don't have a big but they at least know the heart and soul of work and films like cool air or the call of are what i would think gifts for the fan base and other <UNK> that like h p 's creation br br and then there are people like <UNK> who just rip off the name and create a movie which would have been fun to watch if i had directed it myself and filmed with some friends down at the beach that is what mr did as it seems but while <UNK> like aaron or bryan moore's earlier movies might not have had more they somehow still had more to offer like a story real characters and some connection to <UNK> just <UNK> out names like or <UNK> makes a movie not a <UNK> adaption br br anyway this flick will not only make fans of the <UNK> <UNK> and hide it will also not appeal to people who 1 like good movies 2 laugh about bad movies 3 like good c grade splatter movies or 4 watch everything that has horror written on the dvd cover i will not go into the of this waste of time as it has already been discussed by others here on this page but like i said unknown beyond is like a movie i would have made up with some geeky friends aside from that it lacks ideas for any storytelling and goes into ridiculous moronic nonsense but he it's art stuff self made flicks of this quality are fun to watch if you know all the <UNK> in it and ha ha see how <UNK> is <UNK> out the fake blood we made from old <UNK> <UNK> and stuff  but hey you don't put this in a dvd <UNK> <UNK> it an actual movie and want money for <UNK> br br i give it 2 10 because of the i <UNK>  effort or something like that
<START> once again we have a movie that packs about 20 minutes of entertainment much of it involving the <UNK> occasionally funny lyrics into a 90 minute package for anyone old enough to remember this is along lines of the first bill and ted without the story line if that doesn't say enough as to how brainless this movie is think about jack black singing for about 20 minutes of the movie and that being its selling point if you actually like listening to <UNK> d because of their musical <UNK> then knock yourself out and buy the soundtrack don't waste your time with this though if your a <UNK> looking for a good bad movie filled with laughs you're still <UNK> up the wrong tree no matter the <UNK> of your <UNK> you'll still be left wishing you'd popped in <UNK> boy again instead
<START> a genius my genius i remember the exact second in 1994 i was sat in a pub in <UNK> england i recall the exact seat bill <UNK> dies of cancer said the <UNK> in the i felt like someone had <UNK> me in the stomach buy this dvd if you don't find something in it one way or the other i'll be <UNK> br br rip bill i wish so much you were still here
<START> i haven't seen this film for over 20 years but it had such an impact on me that i remember sitting through the credits and for several minutes after in complete awe this is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released i just ordered a copy of it on dvd and paid for overnight <UNK> and can't wait for it to arrive it is uplifting at times and also very dark and somewhat disturbing it's a story of a close <UNK> band of regular kids growing up in the inner city and makes one feel as though they are actually sitting on the <UNK> rather than watching on a movie screen or television hard to explain but it is something that must be experienced the story starts at childhood and tracks the lives of the four main characters through high school and as they <UNK> on their separate <UNK> in life the entire cast did an incredible job and it's by far the best work of <UNK> career i'm hoping that the dvd lives up to my memory and plan on watching it this friday with a good friend
<START> i liked this western starring randolph and glenn ford it's got pretty much everything a western should have there's <UNK> action chases on <UNK> there's a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at there's some nice comic relief in the form of edgar <UNK> who plays uncle willie <UNK> a character who pretend to be a <UNK> old fool but is actually aware of everything going on randolph scott plays the town sheriff and glenn ford plays <UNK> rogers bill smith a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways i liked the different mix of characters in the movie i didn't find it always fast paced but i never found it boring either even though the movie is in 1943 it is in colour 8 10
<START> sometimes it's hard to define what <UNK> a successful delightful comedy from one that falls flat in this case the contrived plot about a spoiled rich girl who schemes to take her <UNK> away from the <UNK> village who is raising them only to fall for him herself is not promising and nothing in director leigh <UNK> filmography suggests that he was an overlooked major talent and yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed happy atmosphere on the set that was <UNK> recorded on film br br he also had the good sense to cast this movie properly the one small flaw is <UNK> hopkins in a part that ginger rogers would have been perfect for hopkins is efficient but <UNK> lacking the warmth and <UNK> rogers would have had she is further <UNK> by a pair of <UNK> long and <UNK> false <UNK> that are sometimes a distraction but a very young and very handsome ray <UNK> couldn't be better in an <UNK> <UNK> comic performance of great charm br br and better than that particularly for new york city residents is the hollywood depiction of <UNK> village in <UNK> though completely <UNK> and <UNK> it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer art director van nest created an <UNK> <UNK> of apartments and <UNK> shared that is the perfect backdrop for this <UNK> collection of artists smart <UNK> and <UNK> best in the supporting cast is <UNK> williams bringing <UNK> and light to his role as a <UNK> <UNK> suggesting the self invention and <UNK> sexual and otherwise of life in the village even more refreshing are betty and playing the little girls plain intelligent and full of humor these girls seem like real human beings and are nothing like the professional child actors of the time br br of special interest are a couple of memorable comic set pieces ray <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to a woman with a howling baby is played with more <UNK> than one expects the baby and his <UNK> are marvelous moments and a phony domestic <UNK> in a department store window that <UNK> into a free for all is also fun the movie <UNK> slowly downhill with a straight faced custody trial and then never quite gets back on track when the action moves to long island but this movie is still worth a look
<START> the first two hours of the <UNK> version are full of character and plot exposition after an early brief sequence of las vegas being hit by <UNK> the action doesn't really start until the second two hours still some character relationships don't become clear until the second part the actors turn in competent performances but nothing special however better than those in <UNK> <UNK> in new york an exception is randy quaid whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying the plot is a pretty standard mix of parts of independence day speed the day after tomorrow <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and several other films you can predict what will happen next and come close to <UNK> the dialog word for word the special effects are unbelievably bad despite the effects in <UNK> the <UNK> in this film seem less realistic than the one in the wizard of oz and other effects were obviously done for less money than such series as <UNK> and cold case spend on the <UNK> of a single episode if you have to see a made for tv disaster film see the day after <UNK> or special <UNK> instead you'll get better plots acting and effects
<START> a very sensitive topic 15 y o girl abandoned by mother as a baby and who goes to visit her continues to be ignored is raped by her mom's boyfriend becomes pregnant there was not enough depth displayed of this situation too much of time is taken up on the chase with the <UNK> <UNK> the baby interesting this baby with <UNK> you never see him cry except once be fed have is <UNK> changed during the whole truck transport ordeal i would have liked to have seen more of the <UNK> more focus on the fact that this girl was a minor this should have stood up in court immediately br br and this was a true story it deserved a better telling than that br br if it weren't for the subject matter i would have given this closer to a 0 rating i rented this from the library only later i found out it was a made for tv movie br br oh well
<START> the first and far better of kevin <UNK> two gay roles the second is the dreary de lovely in which he played cole porter inspired by tom <UNK> emotional acceptance speech for philadelphia in which he his high school drama teacher the nominated film in this version was obviously more forrest <UNK> than philadelphia here the hanks character is played by matt dillon br br the reaction scenes in most of the film are very funny and as has been often pointed out are especially effective as done by kevin himself debbie reynolds tom <UNK> a brave move since he was himself the target of such rumors which he denied bob <UNK> and joan cusack as the eventually <UNK> bride to be br br tom <UNK> actual teacher criticized the <UNK> scene saying people don't act that way in real life but this is a farce and not real life that being said it is not as effective as it might be and the <UNK> of the final wedding scene which makes it look like tom and kevin are about to get <UNK> i found rather pointless annoying and a cop out br br the highlight of the film for me is of course <UNK> scene with the how to be a real man audio tape and it is hilarious but certainly not at all realistic when the tape <UNK> to <UNK> actions br br on the whole a hoot
<START> <UNK> from characters previously developed in a series of much <UNK> shorts the curse of the were rabbit is about as far from run of the mill family fare as you can get beautifully crafted and with witty dialogue and clever concepts this really is a movie that will appeal to almost every member of the family br br the story concerns wallace and his dog <UNK> who live in a village obsessed with growing large <UNK> for the <UNK> fair and who operate anti a <UNK> solution to all those <UNK> <UNK> that torment passionate <UNK> everywhere the business is a great success but wallace proves a bit too clever for his own good when he tries to <UNK> <UNK> from their <UNK> <UNK> ways he unexpectedly <UNK> an ancient horror of legendary proportions the were rabbit and suddenly no <UNK> in town is safe the movie is full of crazy <UNK> unexpectedly smart dialogue and references to everything from king kong to the wolf man more than enough to <UNK> even a jaded teenager but the real charm of the thing is in its characters the amount of personality the artists and animators can <UNK> from bits of clay is amazing they seem as fully alive as any flesh and blood actor the dvd release and i recommend the widescreen includes a number of informative and entertaining extras as well greatly recommended <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> is a classy filmed movie in the same style as the oscar winning film character 1997 but this comparison immediately <UNK> me to add that the latter was quite more exciting br br sure is a beautiful historic costume drama with fantastic acting by in which you witness the personal growth of van in her marriage to the <UNK> of this movie is 'a so it starts and ends with their marriage br br but that is where the director makes a crucial mistake exciting independent life started when the marriage ended she wrote several children's books and <UNK> around the world what a great life she has lived but puts back in the of convention that depressed her and that she <UNK> out of the thought that her life extended just her marriage to being no one else but the mother of their kids br br let's all hope for ii
<START> no redeeming features this film is rubbish its jokes don't begin to be funny the humour for children is pathetic and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky <UNK> to the whole miserable package sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next i couldn't enjoy the film at all although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again unlike with monsters inc finding <UNK> jungle book lion king etc which all get frequent <UNK> for <UNK>
<START> bizarre this movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer but everything that happens in this movie is fiction i guess it tries to explain why diane <UNK> had a fascination with <UNK> and made it her primary photography focus in the movie <UNK> moves into the apartment above hers she seemingly becomes obsessed with him and falls for him she puts her kids and husband second over the <UNK> and even tries to <UNK> him into her family <UNK> some of the freak show side kicks come over to visit and she <UNK> with them the whole thing is very bizarre br br final verdict nothing memorable there is just something weird about a woman who gets her <UNK> from <UNK> the <UNK> i think you can find better films out there
<START> on seeing this movie i didn't expect much i was delightfully surprised although the writing was <UNK> as some of the dialog seemed drawn out and contrived the script did have shining moments my favorite line life is like a rich <UNK> an and i'm <UNK> so i can't enjoy it the plot was new and refreshing as opposed to some of the newer more main stream horror that most of us are sadly growing used to i do believe some of the scenes could should have been longer and maybe some shorter the superfluous use of blood was campy but seemed to make sense in the end ah the end the end would have been a little better if they had explained why what happened happened i don't wanna spoil it it might have also added to the movie time which is in the area of it's only an hour long how good could it be answer quite good
<START> the <UNK> you hear the name you think ah it's a crappy hong kong movie guess what it's not hong kong and yes it is crappy this amazingly stupid jackie chan film ruined by us yes us the americans i'm <UNK> with anger <UNK> i think i'll jump out that window has chan as a new york cop hunting down a gang <UNK> the death of his buddy sounds cool but it's not don't waste your money renting it to prove he could make a better cop film chan made the amazing police story 1985
<START> radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt in his heart was the right thing to do the viewer will be compelled to wonder what he or she would have done the <UNK> that coach jones and radio both faced was both tragic and predictable people did not understand nor did they want to understand but in the end the power of <UNK> forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little besides three of the most important things the are too often forgotten as we mature <UNK> compassion and love coach jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the underdog who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way that he knows how it was sad the way coach jones and radio met the practical joke that terrified the life out of radio was enough to make you want to severely <UNK> not only the boys involved but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it however on the positive side of the scale the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the kind of way that most of us believe only happens in the movies this movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed ed harris was his usual brilliance gooding was flawless radio is an inspiration
<START> i had never read any of sarah <UNK> novels or watched <UNK> the <UNK> i only heard about when i was flipping through the l word <UNK> the storyline of interested me yet i passed it away thinking lesbian in victorian period that never ends well i have enough of those <UNK> series and movies that go no where br br however during christmas my local dvd store gave a <UNK> i brought the dvd and my life has never been more colourful br br this mini series deserves to be <UNK> and praised the acting is so great that i call it rare sally <UNK> <UNK> cassidy rupert evans <UNK> <UNK> and many more that i can't name all brought light and darkness to their characters just by a little gesture a little look a little touch they made their characters real and as a viewer i couldn't help it but take them home keep them close br br sets in victorian area is a story of sue a thief who loves and lives with her family of pick <UNK> little did she know that her fate is linked to <UNK> lily a somewhat shy <UNK> girl grows up in a mansion miles and miles away mother left her a fortune but <UNK> herself can't touch it unless she married worst of all uncle makes sure she never will by keeping her in the house br br enter mr a charming good looking thief with a heart as bad as any he wants fortune for himself and in order to do so he sets sue up as <UNK> <UNK> maid asking sue to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> with him as time goes by things would be simple if sue didn't fall in love with <UNK> br br and things would be simple if the story was what i have just told i do not wish to spoil so i would like to stop there but i can you that everything is twisted and turned before you can even aware of what has happened once it happened you then question what would happen next on top of that the story is filled with passion unlike any others there are no self searching sexuality questioning oh my god do i like girls moments because the girls in are buried so deep in their own darkness that they barely be able to care the story with such twisted plot moves as smooth as water running <UNK> but strangely calm br br weeks have passed since i watched yet eyes still haunt me and <UNK> words still warm my heart you pearl you pearl you pearl she said and such pearl it is
<START> for only doing a few movies with his life the late great chris <UNK> <UNK> died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in tommy boy david spade from the lame police academy 4 spade really has done good with his career in films tommy boy is a classic and we will always remember chris <UNK> when we watch it from appearing on saturday night live to doing tommy boy black sheep <UNK> hills ninja almost heroes billy madison and dirty work i think chris <UNK> had a short and successful career tommy boy was his best in my case and i would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time thank you chris <UNK>
<START> when you think <UNK> <UNK> the movies that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial ones like platoon <UNK> born on the fourth of july or natural born killers talk radio usually doesn't it's a pretty small movie actually more than half the movie takes place with barry at his radio station talking into his mike but believe me this is one of oliver <UNK> greatest movies and should not be missed br br above all things it's a character study barry is a rude self destructive risk taking talk radio show host who says one too many things and starts to get in trouble with his boss his lover s his fans and even some nazis he doesn't like his audience and <UNK> and a lot of them don't like him that or do like him but have no idea why but at the end he says on his show i guess we're stuck with each other br br see talk radio even if you don't like oliver stone movies you might be surprised i sure was br br my rating 10 10
<START> richard a very wealthy man has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral included in the funeral party is youngest sister <UNK> while none of the family has seen <UNK> in at least 20 years they all agree that <UNK> was always a bit different so when <UNK> says something about having been murdered most laugh it off as one of <UNK> but someone is obviously taking <UNK> seriously the next day <UNK> is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently is there a connection between the two deaths it's up to <UNK> <UNK> to find a killer br br after the funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire <UNK> series i've always been a fan of this particular agatha christie book and from what i remember the movie is as faithful to <UNK> source material as any of the <UNK> <UNK> the mystery is top notch with plenty of clues suspects and red herrings and as i've written before i always enjoy an christie story where <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal it might be old fashioned but that's the way i like it getting beyond the plot technically and artistically after the funeral is a winner sets editing direction and cinematography are as good as you'll find in one of these movies the acting is equally impressive i've come to expect an enjoyable performance from david <UNK> as <UNK> and he doesn't disappoint here the rest of the cast is just as strong with monica <UNK> giving an especially noteworthy performance other than a minor <UNK> with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced i've got no real complaints it's a good show all the way around
<START> watched last night and right away was reminded of two early peter <UNK> films from australia the last wave and <UNK> at hanging rock they were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror to me seems clearly influenced by these films it has a number of fairly mundane scenes that become more <UNK> the deeper you are sucked in by the film it also has more scenes of outright horror and although i don't think the film actually <UNK> up to those two films it is well worth the time of most thoughtful fans of the unusual not necessarily horror 7 out of 10 seems fair but i must say that years after seeing the last wave the film still stays with me and it is precisely <UNK> at hanging <UNK> <UNK> ending that makes it so haunting p s all the people <UNK> the acting in this genre
<START> this is a totally awesome movie if you haven't seen it yet you damn well should sure the plot is slow to develop the special effects are laughable the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed but as wrestler <UNK> would say that's not a bad thing that's a good thing everything about this movie is hilarious especially if you get the dubbed version which has even worse actors it's countless laughs until you get to the end yearning for the sequel where the mummy fights wrestling women thus i give it ten stars unless you're one of those and people with good taste who likes only <UNK> <UNK> films of the highest <UNK> i recommend this utterly movie
<START> maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end that's odd because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed <UNK> dream once many years ago when i saw it on the stage br br i think that two things did me in that <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> name <UNK> and michelle sitting in a giant <UNK> well i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't i'd say we have a bad movie on our hands
<START> a wonderful christmas story on the moving theme of <UNK> <UNK> finds her inner amazon no i'm serious <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> starts to improve when she is knocked on the head from this familiar beginning we move in an unexpected direction good pace good action fun story lots of explosions and mayhem
<START> bud <UNK> and lou <UNK> always had a good following among children but in their careers i think you could say that they only made one film that could be <UNK> for kids jack and the was that one film br br it was part of a two picture independent deal from warner brothers the second film being <UNK> and <UNK> meet captain <UNK> these were the only two films the boys made in color br br the two of them out of work as usual take a job for a very <UNK> and obnoxious young david as a babysitter although it starts out with <UNK> wanting to read the kid jack and the as a <UNK> story the young <UNK> winds up reading it to <UNK> lou falls asleep and in his dreams he <UNK> he's indeed jack the giant killer br br buddy <UNK> who <UNK> the boys in africa screams plays the giant and he's got a giant size dorothy ford as his <UNK> dorothy was a big girl and you can imagine she had some difficulty being cast except when her height was used as a joke one of the only players who ever looked down at her was john wayne in three <UNK> at henry fonda and james stewart in on our merry way also stood barely above her but again her height was part of a gag br br <UNK> <UNK> and james alexander were the princess and prince of the fantasy and they sang beautifully but couldn't act worth anything this was the last film of william who's career dated from the early silent screen days and even to the turn of the last century on stage he played princess father the king br br some not terribly memorable musical numbers came from jack and the save the title song i well remember as a kid having the <UNK> record of bud and lou singing the song and <UNK> the story i was in my early single <UNK> years but became a <UNK> fan of <UNK> through that and their television series br br jack and the is still a good children's picture for the very young though i would warn parents to warn their little <UNK> not to imitate young master
<START> hunt for justice is about the setup of <UNK> for his trial in the <UNK> while it was a little too <UNK> in presentation the subject matter could have gotten very depressing very quickly a canadian judge louise becomes the chief war crimes <UNK> at the international criminal <UNK> for the un in <UNK> she battles everyone to pull out the evidence that sent <UNK> to trial not a bad <UNK> drama with class a directing and production work the <UNK> was disturbing by the <UNK> discussion of the facts happily they didn't go into too much detail and no real pictures of the tortured
<START> my entire family enjoyed this film including 2 small children great values without sex violence drugs nudity or profanity also no <UNK> dollar special effects were added to try to viewers from a poorly written storyline a simple little family fun movie we especially like the songs in the movie but we only got to hear a portion of the songs mostly during the end credits would love to buy a sound track cd from this movie this is my 4th bill <UNK> movie and they all have the same <UNK> as mentioned above with all the movies out there that you don't want your kids to watch this <UNK> <UNK> has a no risk rating we love his movies
<START> this movie was different from most of jimmy films of the 1930s in that it was not done by warner brothers first national but was a <UNK> out to a smaller studio because it was a poverty row studio the production values are lower than you might be used to seeing with cagney films plus the plot is certainly one of the strangest i have seen instead of him being a gangster he was a good guy in this one fighting for the law this isn't all that unusual because cagney frequently played <UNK> such as an <UNK> leader the <UNK> of the cia of fbi agent but to make him an investigator for the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> was indeed odd especially since at times he acted pretty much the same way he did in the movie g men br br all in all a time <UNK> and that's about it br br finally the <UNK> i saw this on from memory lane video was perhaps one of the <UNK> i have ever encountered the sound was terrible and <UNK> and the print looked very white and had lots of torn film and gaps
<START> shaggy friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message if you want to make it in this world being imaginative isn't enough you have to live up to your place in society and that means living by the <UNK> rules that <UNK> us drag queen comedy drama from australia is a mostly upbeat journey of three male friends traveling across the <UNK> in their pink bus <UNK> <UNK> while not a formula film per se there are the obligatory road movie sequences bonding by the <UNK> facing down the <UNK> etc writer director <UNK> elliott follows every potentially mean spirited moment with a little humor and sympathy but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative a dire subplot about a gay man's relationship with his ex wife and estranged pre teen son both of whom are comfortable and the child wise with his lifestyle and a third act with no energy whatsoever it has some wicked <UNK> humor and a fairly game cast but a script that seems to have been watered down along the way from
<START> i enjoy gay themed movies where the characters aren't <UNK> gay and that's what attracted me to this movie that and the principal actor which is the only reason i'm giving this movie one more star than it deserves although not because of his acting in the film let me tell you a lot of people complain about the cinematography but the camcorder feel of the movie added a certain underground quality to it for me and there are a couple of scenes usually around sunset or sunrise and among trains that would make any movie screen <UNK> br br but the acting is cardboard the music is repetitive i got through the latter half of the movie listening to a soundtrack from another film you have to wait almost twenty minutes for any dialog and then it is awkward and amateur the subject of <UNK> could have made this movie great had it been <UNK> exploited and had the art itself been more intriguing but it isn't br br worst of all there is no climax there wasn't really a plot to begin with the movie just <UNK> back into its shell of silence and dies a forgettable movie
<START> some of the early <UNK> survived to become classics the is a classic all right but not in the way it was intended melodramatic in story and acting today it seems ludicrous particularly the casting of myrna loy as a seductive gypsy imagine nora charles breaking up a young couple and driving a young man to steal outrageous however as many people know when loy first came to hollywood she did quite a few of these exotic <UNK> roles br br based on a play the concerns the aforementioned gypsy who in the film is now in <UNK> spain in the play running away from her cruel master and <UNK> herself into the home of the <UNK> family richard tucker and alice <UNK> basically by appearing at the door one by one <UNK> the men of the family and the farm talking her <UNK> english not bad do nothing wrong and dropping hints about nice presents the son in the family paul <UNK> <UNK> is engaged to the beautiful <UNK> loretta young and can't wait to marry her he loses interest when he meets br br with the exception of the lovely alice <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a woman who lives in the household and the stunningly beautiful loretta young the acting is uniformly awful loy is stuck with the <UNK> of her character bad english whining and <UNK> with her <UNK> makeup <UNK> and curly hair she is not only beautiful but right out of the 1980s quite modern though richard <UNK> putting the back of his hand on his <UNK> reminds us we're just <UNK> from the <UNK> br br robert <UNK> on tcm commented that this film is one of his secret pleasures while it is deliciously bad it's not deliciously bad enough to sit through again it's just bad but a great example of how far we've come and had someone not picked up on myrna <UNK> sense of humor how limited her wonderful career might have been
<START> i rented this movie without having heard or read anything about it what a shame this movie is intelligent witty hilarious fast paced and realistically ridiculous the characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on clichéd tired stereotypes it was refreshing to watch i couldn't help thinking that marketing would have helped <UNK> this not so mainstream movie into the <UNK> for intelligent comedy mainstream the quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors <UNK> a huge range of <UNK> <UNK> and comedy is so rare these days i felt that the actors must have really enjoyed <UNK> in something this rich how is it that national treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row it is so weak in too many ways to mention i guess i'm just happy that movies like seeing are still being made somewhere out there
<START> challenge to be free was one of the first films i saw as a child it was also one of the first vhs tapes that i owned i hadn't seen the movie in years so yesterday i decided to stick the tape in and watch it wow the story is as powerful now as it was the first time i saw it i think now that i am older i can better the values that are <UNK> in the movie self <UNK> the value of freedom and the love of nature it is a b movie to be sure but it's one that you'll remember for years especially if you see it as a child
<START> the 3rd in the series finds paul bronson turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy i don't know why this movie shoved me into it but somehow it did i found myself rooting for bronson to wipe the floor with those <UNK> every time he blew one of them away i felt good this movie does not take itself seriously but what if it did there is a good build up to the fireworks finale in which bronson goes on a rampage but as far as acting and plot go it just doesn't measure up if i lived in that neighborhood i would get out as fast as i could but it seems like the people are asking for trouble i know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets but there is a limit here folks i had to give it a 4 sure there are good blow 'em away scenes but that's about it at that time bronson was 64 i'm sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with bronson bronson takes the place of a or stallone in this movie this movie gives you a sense of <UNK> the common man can save the neighborhood save the day to sum it up this is far from being the original death wish but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot 'em up
<START> what that was it the town sheriff john <UNK> blows up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a <UNK> did i just write that did i just see that br br with by the <UNK> night fright is one flick that never deserved to be made as late as 1967 the <UNK> of the gorilla was well over and anyone other than ray <UNK> in an ape suit is just asking for trouble remake this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you'd have at least a 4 0 rating on the imdb but sadly this one never should have stood a chance of seeing the light of day <UNK> there's another <UNK> you can never tell if it's day or night in the story since they seem <UNK> with one another br br i'll give you this though a couple of the early <UNK> shop scenes looked like they could have gone on the air as coke commercials thinking about it now those were probably the best looking and best lit scenes of the picture <UNK> <UNK> must have paid for them had they seen the completed movie they might have been better served to prevent it's release
<START> it's important to keep in mind the real meaning of the phrase inspired by a true story when watching pride it's sort of like you could save up to 50 which can quite literally be translated to you can't save more than 50 it all sounds great until you realize that the lower part of up to is zero similarly inspired by a true story means that someone heard a story and it made them think of this one the only <UNK> is that the real story and the one you're about to see are not the same thing br br there is a real jim <UNK> that began <UNK> the swim team at the philadelphia department of recreation in the early 1970s but i have a feeling that the real jim <UNK> must not have been able to <UNK> some feelings of disappointment at the way the movie turned out clearly it takes wild liberties with the story of his life and i just picture him <UNK> to the strange looks of his friends who wonder why the movie is so much different than the man they know br br at any rate one thing that he will surely be proud of is that he is portrayed by <UNK> howard one of our finest actors who starred alongside <UNK> mac who despite the lack of an original and powerful story still gives a heartfelt and moving performance br br the movie takes place in 1970s philadelphia a time and place where racism was the norm not the exception and the educated and professional jim <UNK> who is also an accomplished <UNK> is having trouble finding a worthwhile teaching position until finally <UNK> to a falling apart recreation center which he is assigned the task of cleaning up before its <UNK> we can certainly understand his feeling of br br when we first meet the <UNK> man <UNK> mac he is a <UNK> who sits in his office surrounded by <UNK> of junk that touch the ceiling and watching daytime tv on an old dusty television set needless to say when jim shows up to start cleaning the place up and <UNK> it out is not exactly friendly with him he knew his <UNK> center was being closed and all his anger about that transferred quite smoothly onto jim br br given his past as a college <UNK> jim takes a special interest in the pool which he <UNK> and fills and brings to top shape a group of black teenagers who play basketball just outside the <UNK> center take interest in the pool when their basketball <UNK> is taken away and the heat remains <UNK> and soon the group have a developing swim team on their hands which they enter into a <UNK> swim meet to call them <UNK> of course would be something of an understatement they're <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> trained and have no idea how to behave at a swim meet br br that doesn't matter of course the movie is your standard underdog sports story so the first athletic outing is totally <UNK> as anything other than a learning experience a <UNK> to drive their much harder and much more focused training that will lead up to the final athletic outing the one that matters by now the only thing a sports movie has going for it is that the protagonist s do not have to win at the film's climax we only have to understand the meaning and significance of their effort br br sadly the movie has all of the character development of an old seagal movie the good guys are the good guys because they're just supposed to be and the bad guys are the nasty white <UNK> who laugh and and make racist jokes at our team oh and there's one scene where one of the white guys kicks one of the black guys underwater while in the middle of a race i didn't know it was really possible to kick someone underwater like that but you get the idea of how deep the character development is br br we understand that this is the group of kids that jim <UNK> turned from kids hanging out on the streets doing nothing with their lives and into an organized and <UNK> team of <UNK> but other than that we don't really get to know anything about who they are br br but the biggest problem is that the only real statements that the movie makes are that effort and organization lead to success and racism is bad both of these are so obvious that when a movie is made with them alone it ends up feeling empty and unnecessary racism was so much more powerful in america in the 1970s that it feels like an enormous loss that the movie dealt directly with that issue but didn't really say anything about it it's sort of a feel good movie but when it's over and you realize how much it should have said is much bigger than what it said the feel good sensation turns into a sad disappointment
<START> this is one of the <UNK> the most harrowing of <UNK> films i've seen i also think this is one of the most powerful films about the <UNK> of war and what it does to the human souls br br the couple of musicians who left a big city for a remote island and make a living as <UNK> find themselves capable of <UNK> and shameful acts that would have <UNK> been impossible for them even imagine as they struggle to survive horrible reality of war they <UNK> their souls their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day <UNK> and max von <UNK> are brilliant as usual as lost confused and terrified couple that got caught in the midst of a civil war br br 9 5 10
<START> first of all i know almost nothing about <UNK> so although i found the <UNK> aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and i think i would have enjoyed it just as much the fact that it as about <UNK> didn't make it any better or worse for me br br what made this movie great is the story itself based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the <UNK> <UNK> club coach is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have someone who cares more about the person than the sport even though they have won 17 national <UNK> and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years the more i have learned about the coach and team the more i like this movie and its message br br i have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first but then i <UNK> the details only to find that most of those movies were 10 fact and 90 fiction with the 10 of facts being greatly exaggerated not so with forever strong it may seem too good to be true but that's what's so amazing about it if it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more instead the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person br br don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics i have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews these are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate in fact i would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because i almost always disagree with their opinions br br go see this movie and post your review positive or negative currently most of the audience reviews are <UNK> positive here and on rotten tomatoes and similar sites and i am interested to see if this trend continues thanks
<START> <UNK> the geek 1990 is a dull horror movie and is really bad even by <UNK> standards it's about a freak who bites the heads off <UNK> and kills people by biting their <UNK> out and he actually thinks he's a chicken himself <UNK> gets released from prison after 25 <UNK> because he's been a model prisoner and deserves another chance in life which is very hard to believe after you see how he acts and treats people throughout the movie br br after killing an elderly lady in a supermarket car park he manages to sneak into a <UNK> car and proceeds to torture her her daughter and the daughters boyfriend at their family home in the country br br then we get treated to a long <UNK> and boring movie with awful acting all the way through before a useless cop turns up to try and kill <UNK> once and for all oh and the film has a ridiculous and laughable ending too i love low budget horror movies and i think the toxic <UNK> is an all time classic but i'm afraid <UNK> the geek is just boring illogical and dull not much in the way of gore too just <UNK> bloody neck and thats about it 3 10
<START> spoiler alert wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this film first of all we think it is hilarious that the producer in the film as the <UNK> doctor with a horrible <UNK> unbelievable accent what the hell was that anyway romanian and how is it that in <UNK> no one speaks danish except the <UNK> creatures note the scottish camp director and who does the shopping for the <UNK> creatures their pants looked like they were purchased at banana republic very nicely dressed for being <UNK> years old this one was worse than scarecrow <UNK> we didn't think that was even possible we basically fast <UNK> through 75 of the movie looking for any gore death scary moments none found do rent the dvd just to watch the 2 hour behind the scenes of <UNK> creatures <UNK> who are these people are they serious and the filmmakers are like 60 years old i think this is their holy grail and that's pathetic enough in and of itself br br best line from the movie hands down not bad for a girl who never even went to graduate school my blind grandma who has <UNK> could make a better movie
<START> what really stood out to me about this movie was how little the plot made sense so many characters were randomly introduced it was like how i imagine tommy the room would be re <UNK> for the disney channel set we had the wise elderly couple who kept on hanging out where jane worked telling the same story about how <UNK> brought them together or jane's mom <UNK> random crying woman who would all show up at random times br br aaron <UNK> acting is definitely the highlight of this film i actually looked forward to every scene he appeared in the editing is painfully bad with scene cuts that make no sense the jane character is really irritating <UNK> about and <UNK> about j d mcqueen the scenes with the music awards are more depressing than anything else and the ending of this movie is surreal
<START> perry mason the case of the glass coffin finds raymond <UNK> defending david <UNK> rick <UNK> like magician peter from a murder charge involving one of his <UNK> a trick involving a suspended glass coffin in <UNK> goes awry and the body of nancy comes a <UNK> out br br nancy was one of six female <UNK> who work with the act and we learn two things about her first in a moment of drunken weakness got <UNK> by her and she claims she was <UNK> secondly she is living under an assumed name and had a secret from her past br br billy <UNK> who probably never thought he'd be doing such rough stuff back in law school gets to <UNK> with a couple of good old boys when goes seeking the truth in home town a little more action than usual for ken he almost gets himself killed br br one big flaw in this mystery is simple <UNK> the medical report should have provided <UNK> evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that could not possibly have done the deed the police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer br br when you see who the killer is you won't blame the individual but you'll also see how the investigating officer james got it wrong from the start it kind of <UNK> this particular mason film
<START> what we have here the standard disney direct to dvd sequel where i would expect <UNK> are cut in all areas resulting in an okay animated movie that falls well short of the original that is not to say that this is a terrible movie it is just that it is a very mediocre movie full of the preachy messages intended to show children the virtues of friendship and being nice to one another and unless done subtly which it is not here can quickly become grating for adults the film has a very thin plot line with trying to win the <UNK> of his father and ending up finding the true meaning of wealth and success this has it's comedy moments but is really nor enough to carry a full length film
<START> this film could cure sleep <UNK> thats how bad it is the story dragged and the bad guy is not that scary you will not even see this one on <UNK> reruns this film made me wonder about chuck film choices he work on a real dog with this one
<START> from the late sydney <UNK> comes a grown up love story about human nature pain passion and betrayal police sergeant dutch van <UNK> harrison ford is <UNK> when he learns his beloved wife has been killed in a plane crash he's even more upset to learn of her affair with the husband of a famous <UNK> kay chandler <UNK> scott thomas he <UNK> to meet her and see if she knew or like he had no idea they start to <UNK> each other then out of their mutual pain and distress begin an intense affair which could be seen as healing for them both however will the memories of the dead and <UNK> from their respective jobs drive them apart and cause more harm than good or can they escape the past well you'll have to watch random hearts and find out a moving and well acted film with a great cast
<START> i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful br br awfully long even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life br br awfully boring the parts they included were long <UNK> and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained br br awfully inaccurate the side to this film was a joke and last time i checked khan wasn't exactly a nice guy br br awfully acted i found several of the characters hard to believe they were very two dimensional and lacked and kind of depth br br a saving grace of the film was the cinematography that is why i gave this film a 2 star rating rather than the bare minimum however if you want to look at something pretty i would recommend buying a picture instead br br all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money please do yourself a favour and give this <UNK> turkey a miss
<START> look i've practically lost all hope in <UNK> after watching their <UNK> hit the naked brothers band show and is no exception if you haven't noticed is now the 1 hit <UNK> sitcom on television right now after hearing this i decided to watch a few episodes myself to see what the hype was about i have one word to describe this show in general <UNK> i cannot believe that dan schneider would go this low and make something this crappy it's horrible let me give you the details br br the cast starts out with a girl by the name of <UNK> played by miranda <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately throughout the episodes doesn't really have a personality so to speak of i guess she's supposed to be the average girl in the show because a lot of people have an army veteran for a dad an artist for a brother and a popular teen web show taped and produced with thousands of dollars of equipment and to say the most about miranda her acting is pathetic she sounds like a 3 year old girl with <UNK> syndrome on a sugar high half the time br br next we have sam <UNK> good god where do they get these names played by <UNK> sam is the co host of web show wait a minute if sam <UNK> the show with <UNK> shouldn't the show be called and sam i bet sam feels like she's been ripped off sam is supposed to be the bully in the cast yeah because every girl bully wears <UNK> skin tight shirts and pants with blonde hair she also i think is supposed to be a <UNK> too i would find this a little funny but it's her cliché <UNK> that ruin it the give me a bucket of fried chicken pun is <UNK> way too much give this girl a script and give her a coffee because don't get me wrong acting is okay but throughout half the episodes she looks like she's about ready to fall asleep br br next we have <UNK> benson played by nathan <UNK> is the technical producer for <UNK> and <UNK> show there's not much to say about <UNK> other than the fact that he's a <UNK> geek and has a crush on <UNK> which never works out here we go again with the clichés does it not stop <UNK> acting is also okay but seems to get excessive sometimes he's too boring br br lastly and my most favorite we have spencer played by jerry <UNK> let me make this perfectly clear if it weren't for him this dirt <UNK> of a show would be mud spencer is the one who keeps the show alive spencer is the older brother of <UNK> if you had a little 5 year old who was both on a <UNK> high and <UNK> you would have this character summed up spencer also earns money from being an artist hmmm i wonder you would think that a professional artist would make promising <UNK> yeah i just love sarcasm his art is pretty much utter crap i mean what kind of <UNK> name is merry what that's about as much creativity as a <UNK> <UNK> speech on drugs it's stupid br br the plot settings and morals are <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> these shows are now telling kids that stealing lying and being an <UNK> to your parents is a good thing if these are the kinds of awful crappy shows that they're throwing at kids these days then i don't want to take part in watching any of them this is biggest piece of crap i've ever watched on tv bar none <UNK> i'm through with you end of story 1 10
<START> there are no no redeeming qualities to this film they didn't check a single fact not one about anything i feel sorry for larry miller and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable <UNK> br br the adults are all idiotic the effects are cheesy and devoid of any sense of reality the music is honestly cheesy the plot is beyond belief br br i you want to see something good with your family see anything else take some time and check for in your attic my ten year old is mocking this film as we watch it he's unfortunately learning that not every movie is worth watching
<START> i had to suffer through this movie three times while i was a zombie extra in the director's new movie after <UNK> the first time that i saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters i could not take it any more i <UNK> out laughing right in front of the guy the movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent female nudity was nowhere to be found i am a fan of low budget horror movies but this was just too much for me the worst part was that i had to watch it so many times also do not expect the new movie to be any better
<START> this unintentionally amusing mid 80s tv movie is based on the premise that sex bomb donna mills in a mostly appalling wardrobe throughout is a neglected housewife <UNK> for her sexy past as a <UNK> she escapes her empty life by <UNK> about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she comes across finally giving into her fantasies and <UNK> in a bit on the side although all she really wants is to <UNK> the flames of passion with her boring husband james <UNK> br br there are many laughable aspects to this film <UNK> first <UNK> into co producing later following her departure from <UNK> landing she found great success as a trashy tv movie queen starring in mostly issue of the week <UNK> through most of the <UNK> she usually played a victim of some sort clearly determined to wash her hands of the wonderfully wicked and entertaining she played for so long on <UNK> funniest are the drawn out fantasy sequences filmed as though they are meant to be soft core porn wind and smoke machines <UNK> porno music but as this is a network tv movie the scenes are all very <UNK> and ultimately not very sexy at all the most amusing and bizarre scene has mills taking a walk on the wild side downtown among the <UNK> haired <UNK> complete with robert <UNK> soundtrack br br less laughable is the dreadful dialogue that the cardboard characters are forced to utter pity poor <UNK> <UNK> as the mandatory psycho <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> as the mandatory best friend or even pre <UNK> james <UNK> with that daytime soap style of <UNK> fist anger br br of course as in all of these sorts of films we learn that all problems can be solved through psycho therapy and then the film just becomes silly as we explore briefly the reasons for <UNK> shocking behaviour as if it can't just be that she wants a good <UNK> br br vacuous
<START> i found this movie at the flea market for cheap i was so <UNK> because i thought it was a <UNK> movie i got home put it on the previews rules and the opening scene with the old guy rolling down the street on the <UNK> was awesome at that moment i realized it was a post apocalyptic movie but i still had high hopes for it this movie was awful a friend of mine was stoned out of his mind when we watched it and even he thought it was horrible and a waste of being high i kept falling asleep during the movie because it was so boring and the music was utterly awful i don't know if during the apocalypse all the good music and all the music that is only kind of crappy is destroyed and <UNK> memory of how to play it is wiped clean but i think i would rather die than have to endure that crap also what the hell was up with the tv studio i can only assume that this movie was adapted from an old greek play with the names and title but some plays are not meant to be adapted into a futuristic sci fi setting or at least not by the people who were involved with this movie if you are forced to watch this movie i can only suggest bringing a hand gun and finishing yourself off before the end it would be a good movie to kill yourself too everyone will understand why

<START> if you need a clue as to whether is decent or not look to its star colin <UNK> who refers to it in an interview as absolute rubbish i sincerely hope no one ever sees it br br the script and plot are ludicrous the female lead is unconvincing the only thing worthwhile is colin <UNK> and he seems slightly embarrassed throughout br br for <UNK> <UNK> fans only the shower scene alone is worth the 3 99 you might have to shell out should you find it in a video <UNK> bin like i did br br i'm happy for mr <UNK> that his days of taking projects like this one are over
<START> contains spoiler the movie is a good action comedy but i don't know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast the end of the movie come the bad guy dies and that's it br br the special effects are good and i don't regret paying to see it at the theatre
<START> sitting in a big wing chair with a huge book in his lap the one and only bela lugosi looks into the camera and in a dreadful vocal delivery that sounds as if he were mocking a reading of shakespeare <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> man's constant <UNK> of things unknown drawing from the endless reaches of time brings to light many startling things <UNK> startling because they seem new <UNK> eyes now <UNK> with raised <UNK> and mouth <UNK> he continues but most are not new the signs of the ages cue a visual of <UNK> accompanied by the sound of thunder which then continues to <UNK> for an astonishing <UNK> seconds br br and so begins what is arguably the worst film ever made this movie almost defies description told in semi <UNK> style with an unseen narrator explaining the plot such as it is the story revolves around the <UNK> of a man named <UNK> ed wood jr who cross dresses hence the reference to glenda the film has no real structure instead it consists mostly of a random assortment of vignettes that may or may not relate to <UNK> or to the cross dressing <UNK> one long sequence consists of some unknown woman <UNK> on a <UNK> followed by a man <UNK> a woman in what we would today refer to as s m br br then at odd moments bela <UNK> for no apparent reason and <UNK> more inane dialogue like when he's wrong because he does right and when he's right because he does wrong pull the string dance to that huh br br about twenty percent of the film's visuals consist of stock footage accompanied by a <UNK> that relates to the story <UNK> but not the visuals hence we see stock footage of <UNK> city streets <UNK> traffic a <UNK> herd of buffalo and a <UNK> full of kids but it gets worse in a film about cross dressing we have <UNK> <UNK> seconds of stock footage of a <UNK> making hot steel and <UNK> <UNK> seconds of battle scenes from wwii br br even the <UNK> items are <UNK> in one scene we see a newspaper <UNK> that reads man <UNK> dressed as girl underneath the <UNK> which has clearly been glued or <UNK> on the article is about <UNK> in one of my favorite scenes an off screen woman <UNK> out <UNK> why it's against the <UNK> will in a voice that sounds like she's just <UNK> <UNK> br br except for the performance of <UNK> <UNK> the acting is uniformly horrendous production design is cheap looking and drab but you gotta love that tacky <UNK> the editing is sloppy most of the background music is suitable only for 1950 style <UNK> the b w cinematography has way too much contrast and the costumes look like something that came from a <UNK> store br br this film is so bad it makes plan 9 from outer space look like citizen kane by comparison i just don't know how one could make a film any worse than ed <UNK> <UNK> or glenda but thankfully it's got bela lugosi in it every time he opened his mouth and <UNK> into the camera with those big <UNK> eyes i about fell on the floor laughing
<START> dragon ma jackie chan is back having rid the <UNK> of the <UNK> pirate lo back on land he is assigned to the police force where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local <UNK> along the way he is caught up in the fate of several chinese <UNK> attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause the chinese <UNK> government is after these <UNK> and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble even if they are in the police force i had big expectations for this movie after i saw project a but sadly i was a little disappointed there is just too little action compared to the first film there is just one good fight scene until the big ending that fight scene is in the gangsters place and its good a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw jackie chan and his stunt team don't disappoint here at all the ending is very entertaining jackie chan shows us why he is the best <UNK> in the world really exciting stuff the only bad thing with the ending is that the fights are too short and forgettable conclusion many funny moments good acting and crazy stunts but not enough fighting for a top rating
<START> hulk hogan plays rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend joan is kidnapped by thugs who are forcing him to take on another wrestler tiny <UNK> jr bottom of the barrel <UNK> is such a failure that even hogan looks ashamed to be in it and with the evidence portrayed he should be
<START> 4 out of 10 br br this film was neither funny as a whole nor was it even <UNK> <UNK> any kind of emotion into the characters eugene levy is probably the most funny the rest of the cast do their jobs but the story never really gets very deep and there are a lot of holes in the plot that never get filled this just wasn't very much fun despite being funny at times br br
<START> this really is a cringe making exercise dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes of we're just a bunch of wacky guys in the midst of the my goodness this can be really dangerous parts mostly it is just plain dumb you couldn't believe for a single minute that real fire fighters act like this it is so awful i couldn't bear to watch at times if my daughter hadn't rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end i would have had no option but to turn it off br br thing is i'm a john travolta fan every interview of his i've seen just raises my opinion of him i think this was one strictly for the money i'm sure he'll be happy when this one gets forgotten
<START> i saw the movie hoot and then i immediately decided to comment it the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the <UNK> <UNK> of this planet some people think that if they have money they can do whatever they want to which probably is like but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful this movie is not just about kids this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do when i was twelve i saw some and i knew they are <UNK> by law and didn't even dare to touch them not <UNK> of the law but <UNK> that i might harm them actually i am currently 15 what so ever the acting was great the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie and enjoy
<START> this one is a poor attempt at spinning the old cons turn good yarn which we have seen so many times before it actually reminded me of the american series 'the <UNK> although nowhere near as good omar <UNK> is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the bunch as is <UNK> who's attempt at being the funny guy gets lost along the way danes performance was decent though and you can see from this performance why she was cast in terminator 4 br br the <UNK> squad is a film which lies in a kind of grey area between serious thriller and comedy at times it takes itself serious but other times it tries to be humorous but fails miserably the film has a kind of half finished feel about as if it was stretched to the 90 minute mark br br <UNK> be disappointed
<START> this film won't win any awards for greatness but if you have an hour and a half free and fancy a bit of light hearted entertainment then you could do much worse than watch this br br the cast are mostly young and pretty the script has some genuinely funny moments and the soundtrack is pretty cool too rupert <UNK> jones as jake seems to have the most fun while laura <UNK> as <UNK> is sweet likable and funny br br i rented it because i like the series that is currently starring in and here he's young and buff and the perfect eye candy for a girls night in br br get some wine and some ice cream and have a chuckle
<START> ok so i have recently been collecting a lot of <UNK> and <UNK> titles on dvd and i have to say that this one is one of the most disappointing ones a more recent film compared to other titles in the <UNK> <UNK> this was a straight to dvd release i've always been interested in the myth of el ever since i saw a documentary on it as a teenager however this film is a terrible let down shot on tacky <UNK> the storyline and acting are terrible it took me three goes to watch this film all the way through while cheap 80's and 90's horror films are good because of their cheap budgets and comedy this film is not br br check out some other titles in the <UNK> series first for example is older but much much better
<START> during my trip in a youth <UNK> forum i was channel surfing until i found tommy boy on <UNK> since i have never seen this film before i wanted to check it out my roommate who have already seen this told me this movie is a classic after seeing the whole movie i came to the conclusion that he was right br br tommy boy is constantly funny from beginning to end thanks to the comedic duo of chris <UNK> and david spade <UNK> is a riot as the title character a <UNK> <UNK> who just <UNK> through life as if it wasn't important his <UNK> <UNK> ways soon come to a halt when his father brian <UNK> a wealthy break <UNK> king dies of a heart attack on his wedding day this leads tommy with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend richard david spade to hit the road to sell enough break <UNK> to save the company br br the main reason tommy boy works are the funny performances from the lead cast <UNK> is the funniest person in this movie the second funniest person being spade and the third being rob lowe as the film's villain who has bad luck another funny guy is dan <UNK> as ray a well known auto parts br br another reason the movie works is the large amount of jokes chris <UNK> has hilarious slapstick moments and david spade has funny <UNK> comments and one liners the gags in the movie some which involves a deer and a airplane bathroom are laugh out loud funny thanks to director peter segal naked gun 33 1 3 writers bonnie terry turner br br 3rd rock from the sun that 70s show and the cast br br tommy boy is a really funny movie although for some unknown reason most film critics including roger ebert find it horrible and unfunny i wonder when their sense of humor died i recommend tommy boy for those who are great fans of comedy thank you very much roommate
<START> robin hood men in <UNK> 1993 was a much needed parody from mel brooks he has the assignment of <UNK> the robin hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of english <UNK> cary <UNK> stars as robin hood he's looking for a few good men <UNK> join him in his quest to <UNK> the evil sheriff of <UNK> roger <UNK> and win the fair hand of maid <UNK> robin also has to deal with prince john richard lewis as well <UNK> <UNK> co stars as prince john's personal witch <UNK> who has her eyes on the sheriff br br will robin find his merry men how far will the prince go to throw his weight around in the absence of his father why does the sheriff hate robin so much to find out you'll have to watch robin hood men in <UNK> check out the hilarious cameo by dom de <UNK> who plays the duke of jersey br br highly recommended
<START> and a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter <UNK> atmosphere that burton creates for <UNK> city is way cool it's weird that warner decided to release this as a summer film it doesn't fit br br but what's even <UNK> when you consider the content of this film is that it was aimed at families an upper class family throws their mutant baby down the <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dresses up in leather as a flying <UNK> a lonely secretary dresses up in leather as a <UNK> and a freak runs for political office and s m and bondage are presented in a very perverted way but burton got away with it his visual style in this film is at it's best br br this and batman dead end are the only true live action <UNK> of the comic book character true the animated series was the closest to the source material but compared with batman forever and the un one after that batman returns is the best of the four br br darker and more violent than the first movie the sense of gothic pathos reaches a new high i was quite keen on michael keaton as bruce wayne don't even get me started on george clooney he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter michelle <UNK> is great as <UNK> much <UNK> and more cat like she wears that leather outfit better than <UNK> <UNK> and danny <UNK> was so convincing as the penguin that his scenes became disturbing to watch and christopher walken is brilliant as the spooky max if you think you <UNK> chip shrek it's none other than a very young <UNK> br br danny <UNK> score is also even better than it was first time round his powerful and engaging themes are way better than the <UNK> that followed in the later 2 <UNK> movies this movie is the batman phenomenon at its <UNK> forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this let's hope that christopher nolan and christian <UNK> can bring some integrity back to the live action batman with their movie next year br br this dvd was one of the first ever dvds released by warner almost 7 years ago and as a result there are no features and the case is a <UNK> pick it up cheap like i did and hope for an se in the future
<START> originally <UNK> as a sequel to the <UNK> party massacre series this film falls flat on it's face with a new title first off if you are going to include the word massacre in your film's title you better deliver this one certainly does not there is no gore no on screen murders and no chainsaw as the box art would lead you to believe instead we get a paper thin overdone plot about a group of <UNK> who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game only to be <UNK> one by one again this film could have been ok if the gore <UNK> was <UNK> a bit why directors especially those doing direct to video flicks are afraid to show any gore is beyond me now i am not a huge fan of excessive gore but come on why else would anyone rent a movie called <UNK> massacre besides that problem the film suffers from a shot on a home video camera <UNK> it looks cheap sounds cheap and the actors aren't all that good it tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be but even that fails the ending ends up being a ridiculous mess folks if you run across this film walk away and go find the original <UNK> party massacre 2 out of 10
<START> i really love this movie i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look and then i found it they put it out in spain on dvd under the name <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and you can buy there it is in english and spanish on the dvd hope this helps i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't released to the u s market best of luck oh for more info here is one place to look http www com i think it going for 10 dollars <UNK> on ebay as well
<START> at first sight this is yet another <UNK> anime with lots of excuses for but there is a lot more going on the is part of the plot the main character is a tired <UNK> unusual and most importantly there is a clever plot that ties all the episodes together and that poses some interesting questions the episodes are deliberately non <UNK> and it is certainly worth watching the series again in <UNK> order br br the series is worth watching carefully because there are a lot of casual hints in there that <UNK> and explain things plus a good number of in jokes about other series anime and other
<START> this is one of my all time favourite movies if <UNK> not into cars then forget it this movie features 1 of <UNK> greatest muscle cars the yeah so the acting not the greatest it was never made to win an oscar the car action will keep you back for more and more there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70's and an awesome with a real cool cat it also there is a really cool song sung by terry <UNK> the main actor the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly but the <UNK> <UNK> and drag racing is the main focus in this movie big fast cars with of steel no plastic cars and some cool street dragging i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting
<START> a beautiful film cleverly shot with an eye to war era detail and considering it is set during wwii minimal violence br br a small cast weaves an <UNK> journey through the <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> from loved ones as the pilots <UNK> for england the <UNK> from the <UNK> will touch hearts <UNK> scenes love friendship and betrayal the theme of betrayal runs deep through the movie from betrayal of love to betrayal of friendship and finally the betrayal shown by the communist regime to former <UNK> pilots post war br br a desperately sad film all the more so because it is so <UNK> accurate i would recommend it to everyone
<START> unfortunately i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on <UNK> since i am a sci fi buff the notion of a movie about <UNK> interested me br br instead this movie quickly revealed itself as an <UNK> christian propaganda flick appropriate for an audience of like minded individuals but very un christian like to exploit the movie mall scene and <UNK> to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and <UNK> shame on you at least the da <UNK> code did not hold back its wild eyed <UNK> br br so this b grade movie and i am being kind production will be appreciated in those <UNK> with similar beliefs probably shown to <UNK> and sunday evening youth groups but if you are a <UNK> christian or non christian you will not be comfortable
<START> i first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network t v i think i was like 9 picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television anyway i've seen it again years later and it's like i remembered it's really good scary flick i think the reason why it might of gone <UNK> is cause it wasn't followed by a load of sequels i e friday the 13th but it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better even though this is a killer in the woods flick like friday it has more in common with the original texas chainsaw massacre that's because the movie lays down a certain atmosphere and feeling of dread even in broad daylight and the killers feel more threatening than in friday there's also a good amount of suspense i recommend seeing it now that it's being released on dvd in late july
<START> i have watched every version of this play that i can think of including several on the stage and sir derek <UNK> is absolutely the best hamlet i have ever seen br br he has the most wonderful voice for stage acting and his <UNK> face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play the way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness he as hamlet can in an instant be loving soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life you believe that he is in pain you believe that he is angry you believe that he is not a little mad you believe he is hamlet br br of course some of the thanks obviously goes to shakespeare but without an excellent actor to get the words from the page to the stage it doesn't really matter how well written a play is br br if you like shakespeare you absolutely must see this version if you don't like shakespeare you absolutely must see this version you will come away with a new appreciation for shakespeare if you do the nuanced performance that sir derek gives will leave you breathless
<START> <UNK> 1934 john <UNK> <UNK> hepburn ralph <UNK> robert young br br mountain <UNK> <UNK> hepburn as trigger <UNK> is a religious back woods <UNK> woman going on 18 she begins to attract male attention and responds by throwing rocks the arrival of a <UNK> building construction crew <UNK> dreams of romance in ms hepburn she quickly <UNK> the attention of suave engineer robert young as john <UNK> who hides his marital status <UNK> engineer ralph <UNK> as george <UNK> is also interested in hepburn but for different reasons mr <UNK> wants to know more about jesus christ whom hepburn <UNK> br br after hepburn employs the power of <UNK> to <UNK> a child neighborhood folks suspect she is a witch br br if it weren't so serious <UNK> might be more amusing it is an <UNK> and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star who is thoroughly unconvincing of the leads mr <UNK> performs best however the best characterization is <UNK> by sarah <UNK> as <UNK> dawson who appeared in george <UNK> stage version along with louis mason as bill grayson will <UNK> as west <UNK> grandpa <UNK> in the 1970s has a small role an unexpected ending helps
<START> i saw beyond about 20 times it was that good at first when i watched it i saw the story of laura <UNK> but later after multiple <UNK> i realised that this also was a parallel documentary it came to be in my mind a story about san and the struggles of women to remain strong in the face of <UNK> danger and sadness i also would put history and politics on the list after further viewing since i did learn a lot about past and present and could only guess at it's future this movie is not only one you will want to see it's also one you will definitely want to own a copy of it's a movie that could easily been seen by the whole family although not for children under thirteen however the educational benefits of this movie can not and should not be understated
<START> after a <UNK> experience on an airplane <UNK> kevin hart the <UNK> and uses the money he wins to start up his own full service <UNK> what makes his different is that it has sexy <UNK> an on board dance club and no less than captain <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> br br soul plane is a very racist comedy except it is only occasionally funny soul plane has been described as an urban version of airplane the problem is that soul plane doesn't even come close to achieving the laughs of airplane the jokes in soul <UNK> are too offensive and they are mostly unoriginal i would be lying if i said i didn't laugh since there were some funny moments however i was expecting more and i left the theater disappointed br br i would compare soul plane to airplane 2 the latter was just a rehash of the first film while the former is just a rehash of outdated crude jokes there is really no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots however i don't think soul plane is bottom 100 bad right now the movie is <UNK> at number <UNK> and that's a little harsh i'm not saying this is a good movie but it isn't a terrible on either the running time is only <UNK> minutes long so it isn't too much of a pain to watch for stupid comedies you can do a lot worse br br no one in the cast is very good but they all seem to be having fun and this helps kevin hart was very annoying as he had a few funny lines but he is a very poor leading man <UNK> <UNK> who was mildly funny in <UNK> and <UNK> completely <UNK> here tom arnold was actually tolerable and that was the film's biggest surprise the most annoying person in the movie was ryan he was not funny at all and he will never be funny the funniest cast members were <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> they gave the best lines and they made me laugh the most in the end soul plane may fit the bill if you're looking for a stupid comedy but it would probably be better if you just skip the film rating 4 10
<START> this movie was thought to be low budget but it turned out to be awesome i just rented it from blockbuster and i loved it the acting was very good hot women and some scary parts it is plain and simply worth the money to pay for
<START> i was an extra on this film in the part shot at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so i was one of the fleeing mostly mexican <UNK> running across the at ryan field in <UNK> at one point standing around in our <UNK> as we waited for another shot one of my fellow extras turned to me asked me what the move was going to be about i told him it was going to be a remake of lost <UNK> only as a musical there was a long pause then he <UNK> man this movie is gonna suck pretty <UNK> of him i thought i had a good time and made a bit of money but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie i can't sit through the whole thing br br if you ever saw the movie the <UNK> you can pretty much get the idea you get to see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an an idea that on the face of it is just bad the idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money at a movie and hire enough big names then a good story and good writing aren't necessary just turn the big <UNK> and out comes the product it's just not worth watching
<START> i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it eight different characters eight different perspectives at first i was confused by the way the story was moving along but then i realized that it was just one scene being shown over and over again just to show us the different perspectives of the characters br br at first you think the <UNK> are yelling at the teenager for stealing they speak in their own language which i and chris the teenager played convincingly by cannot understand the perspective of the <UNK> <UNK> that view i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes br br excellent short film hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film br br
<START> i have watched the root of all evil with the <UNK> object of <UNK> this so called scientific <UNK> i don't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity br br he is obviously not a else the odds of 2 1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in god br br he regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do god one has only to look at the language used in his br br regarding faith this <UNK> is used <UNK> in everyday behaviour just think about it when he gets in an <UNK> be believes that it will be <UNK> correctly and turns on the switch when he gets in a <UNK> he pulls the chain in his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction regarding faith in science when i was in chemistry class i believed and was taught that the <UNK> was the smallest <UNK> and the <UNK> skin theory of <UNK> both of which have now been <UNK> i was taught this as the atomic theory in <UNK> so to speak so why should we believe any scientist especially when he goes beyond the <UNK> of his field <UNK> states that religion will be the downfall of <UNK> religion is <UNK> can he or any other <UNK> please tell us what <UNK> was <UNK> and <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> please he is now living in the last stages of a christian based <UNK> and taking all the benefits from it without any admission for its source i found <UNK> to be arrogant <UNK> <UNK> an obvious believer in <UNK> and a nazi in his attitude towards the young how dare he say what a parent can teach their child the child is theirs not the <UNK> and as the parents to it their <UNK> so do they their beliefs his <UNK> of adam as he never existed as he has no proof was an example of this same attitude so i have no proof that joe <UNK> lives in new york but he well may do i just haven't found the proof yet that does not <UNK> his existence i note his argument with the bishop of <UNK> that the is <UNK> with what he takes and believes in the bible well <UNK> also does this where does he draw the line between it as a historical document and a religious statement he is also <UNK> i heard the lot when <UNK> came up with the <UNK> gene what a hoot he is desperately looking for proof for his <UNK> and as the man was invented so now we have this so called <UNK> gene which us to looking after our young and other members of our the trouble is that all animals do this not just apes and with evolution it is survival of the <UNK> not the <UNK> and if he really thinks we are becoming <UNK> as a race he is not reading the same <UNK> as i am i found his arrogance beyond belief in <UNK> that as we only have this life we should enjoy it to the full so how does he <UNK> this with his obvious position as a well off european to a <UNK> person in africa who has had all her family wiped out and probably raped and is starving will he help her i note that all his opposition to religion is a that they go to war well g k <UNK> <UNK> that the only war worth fighting was a war for religion b we are against using <UNK> and abortion and homosexuality all sins against the <UNK> <UNK> funny that br br as a catholic i find his <UNK> of <UNK> of the dogma of the <UNK> in 1958 to be <UNK> he never said that it was revealed to him while he was sitting somewhere by himself in case <UNK> does not know it revelation ended with the last <UNK> would have taken years of advice and studied documents handed from down over the centuries to have come up with this <UNK> also as a catholic i find his <UNK> of all religious people as satisfied what utter rubbish we everyday fight the world the flesh and the devil we are the church <UNK> we are also able to glory at a sunset and admire the <UNK> of nature even if we believe in god the trouble with <UNK> was that he interviewed <UNK> <UNK> and them to all of us
<START> <UNK> my spelling this is probably the funniest horror movie that ever existed think evil dead 1000 the acting is horrible you can see the makeup line on a certain <UNK> face there is a lesbian scene which makes no sense at all and the ending haha <UNK> the ending be prepared to have your stomach hurting from laughter now if you watch this film for more then 5 minutes and are still expecting something take a look at your self and ask what the hell is wrong with you this is a very bad movie meant to laugh at and enjoy for its pure silliness br br don't forget to watch all the <UNK> after the movie you can see just how low budget the whole thing really was all in all this movie is a rare gem in <UNK> the pure and <UNK> lack of talent care ability money and anything else you would ever need to make a successful film but its definitely worth watching
<START> admittedly there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unrealistic the ravishing woman first <UNK> and then only a few minutes later she starts kissing the young <UNK> while the old guy is right next to her but as the film goes along we learn that she is a little <UNK> girl or slut and that partly explains her behavior the cinematography of this movie is well done we get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective and some of those images and scenes really raise the tension george plays his character well a wannabe hot shot getting old and being <UNK> by young men like the character <UNK> who i admired in hitchcock's the torn curtain delivers a great performance that although he doesn't say much he is by far the best actor in this play one critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real case of <UNK> nothing would really happen but then again how realistic are films such as mission impossible or phone booth given the fact that we are talking about a movie here and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that aren't very likely to occur in real life you can still enjoy this movie it's a lot better than many things that i see on german tv these days and i think that the vintage 80's style added something to this film
<START> el <UNK> has just been released in europe and is really kicking ass this film with its great cast <UNK> blood in blood out robert <UNK> jennifer <UNK> robert wagner and many more is the best gangster movie since scarface a film that everyone must see 2 hours full of action with fantastic unbelievable stunt br br <UNK> jennifer we are eagerly waiting for part 2 does anyone know if there will be one keep up the good work i loved it
<START> shame represents a high point in the career of a master <UNK> bergman <UNK> existential study of a couple on the island of dealing with surviving a long war <UNK> <UNK> and max von <UNK> give painfully detailed performances in this spare stark drama the films intensity rests in <UNK> keeping our focus on the minute intimate relations of his two characters both accomplished musicians trapped in a landscape they have <UNK> to understand we see the way the <UNK> <UNK> of the war <UNK> and their relationship both characters are forced by the material circumstances of the war to <UNK> their own sense of <UNK> in one of the most powerful episodes bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the cinematic medium by showing us a filmed interview with <UNK> character that has been re edited and distorted for political effect by one side of the conflict and is used by the other side as evidence of war crimes in a brutal <UNK> scene br br
<START> i saw this once probably like most people my age <UNK> back in the 60's i understand the <UNK> with the final product by both families but this is a great movie it was a great opera but as a film it is wonderful this film should be released at least to video other generations can gain an appreciation of great music and story telling the cast was made up of some of the greatest black actors ever most have now passed away only sidney p is still with us please don't wait until he is gone and the film as all old film does becomes <UNK> do to the <UNK> of time again this is a great film which is something that one does not see very often today if at all
<START> after the funeral was absolutely superb and by far the best episode of the season i was disappointed with cards on the table that started off so well but let down considerably by the last half hour and i didn't know what to think of taken after the <UNK> though i do remember being confused at the end after the funeral as i've said is one of my all time favourite <UNK> episodes up there with five little pigs sad and the abc murders i was afraid that they would ruin the story but instead it is very faithful to the book now i will say i don't mind changes to books and try not to compare movies and tv adaptations to their sources except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation doesn't do it justice that's why i disliked some of the like nemesis and sleeping murder and so far out of the <UNK> the murder of roger <UNK> taken at the <UNK> and cards on the table are the only ones that really did disappoint everything else <UNK> from good to outstanding even the recent <UNK> with death despite the many <UNK> from the book which i admit isn't a favourite was surprisingly good thanks to the marvellous production values stellar ensemble performances and outstanding music score back to after the funeral the production values are fantastic it has a really cinematic feel to it and the stunning photography and splendid scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes the music was very stirring and even haunting and the entire cast give wonderful performances david <UNK> is impeccable as always as <UNK> and <UNK> james and anna <UNK> marshall are just as terrific but for me the standout was monica <UNK> as mrs <UNK> she is up there with donald <UNK> and polly walker as the best supporting actor actress in a <UNK> episode that's how good her performance was all in all a must see one of the best <UNK> episodes by far and one of the more faithful ones too 10 10 <UNK> cox
<START> michael <UNK> is known for his disturbing movies like funny games this time he adopted <UNK> die which is probably her best work so far <UNK> always writes about abusive behaviour in families and especially of the <UNK> of women in a <UNK> society br br erika <UNK> isabelle <UNK> works as a piano teacher at the <UNK> she still lives with her mother annie they even sleep in the same bed already a hint of something strange erika bullies her students the same way she's <UNK> by her mother and secretly watches porn movies and plays <UNK> games with herself a student walter benoit falls in love with her but she refuses to simply sleep with him she wants to play her games with him but he's disgusted he reluctantly follows her rules which means disaster for both of them br br <UNK> has a very clear picture language everything is filmed in a almost way so the complex characters and story are enhanced br br people who don't know <UNK> very well may be don't realize how essential the setting is for the story <UNK> as well as other great <UNK> writers like thomas <UNK> suffers from the <UNK> and in <UNK> families and society <UNK> at least <UNK> people are often unable to <UNK> their pains wishes they <UNK> their emotions so there often enough is no real love affection and <UNK> in their families in a society where it's more important to show a perfect <UNK> to society even if this means to protect crimes within families as erika and her mother protect <UNK> rape of erika to avoid a scandal than to deal with your emotional problems it's probably no wonder that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> in vienna erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother they only time they share some emotions is very violent and not at all loving erika <UNK> her hidden emotions with wishes for violence so that she can finally release some feelings but she has nobody who really wants to speak about her emotions so in the end she has to stab herself to ease her inner pain br br isabelle <UNK> shows her best performance of her career as well of most other actresses with a <UNK> face you often see only a hint of emotion in her face a quick smile a glance with her eyes and in the end her pain is <UNK> displayed without a single tear br br benoit and annie also turn in powerful performances but the movie belongs to <UNK>
<START> this small quiet <UNK> movie grows into a masterpiece on human dignity it is intelligently structured filled with meaningful little details and important side plots it tells a story of one man with great humanity without <UNK> itself politically but <UNK> life as a precious right not an <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> right to choose it enjoys the <UNK> of different landscapes mental and physical and languages important detail outstanding acting by each of the actors especially unbelievable <UNK> <UNK> his screen presence has such a force that you forget that this is fiction the movie has a wonderful rhythm it is beautifully shot and <UNK> directed it takes real talent to make a movie on such a difficult theme with understanding humour and heart six stars out of five
<START> george <UNK> death bed the bed that eats is at root a dark fairy tale told via a horror movie <UNK> it is in my opinion one of the best films of the 1970s and it's downright criminal that the picture was basically stolen and distributed without <UNK> knowledge those responsible for this <UNK> should be fed to the bed <UNK> if you're looking for overt gore or <UNK> action death bed the bed that eats isn't the flick for you death bed is a <UNK> <UNK> drive in picture it plays like an utterly strange dream half remembered i'd recommend reading stephen <UNK> of death bed in <UNK> press book nightmare usa he describes the movie's vibe perfectly whether intentional or not i've noticed shades of death bed in everything from the phantasm films to <UNK> <UNK> cemetery man to the magic realism <UNK> fiction of authors such as kelly link barry is an original and in a fair world i'm sure he would've followed death bed with a number of fantastically bizarre films
<START> this picture hit the movie screens on june <UNK> 1980 starring stephen as sergeant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as captain butt j d <UNK> as buzz and starring <UNK> of the year dorothy <UNK> the picture starts with the police <UNK> <UNK> space looking for i guess criminals there ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship enters sergeant <UNK> and his partner buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to when failing they call on captain who <UNK> his crew to fight back enters the gorgeous dorothy <UNK> who plays the role of <UNK> who is man made robot an now a few thoughts on this picture this movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that i don't get into sci fi if you're into sci fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early sci fi movie titled battlestar galactica which aired in theaters in 1978 many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another sci fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled star trek now for the reason that i bought this movie dorothy <UNK> she is gorgeous in her one piece suit i think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage connie was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also on the picture alone i give this movie 1 <UNK> star and on dorothy <UNK> i give her 10 <UNK> stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this if you like pictures like this you can get the dvd version on amazon com
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is major a singing dancing <UNK> drinking russian officer <UNK> near the <UNK> hungarian border during the hungarian <UNK> of 1956 in <UNK> the journey though the film has yet to be released on video or dvd it remains one of most compelling performances because of the political <UNK> a group of <UNK> cannot fly out of <UNK> but are put on a bus to vienna before they can reach the border however their <UNK> are taken and they are <UNK> for questioning by the russians led by major br br the major has reason to suspect that there is a hungarian freedom fighter among the group being <UNK> out of the country indeed lady is hiding a mysterious passenger paul <UNK> jason <UNK> jr who pretends to be an american but fools no one she is helping <UNK> mainly to <UNK> a debt she <UNK> because of the trouble her past association caused him among the other passengers are a british journalist played by robert <UNK> an american family played by e g marshall his wife anne jackson and their two children one of which is the screen debut of little ron howard br br major takes a romantic interest in lady diana deborah kerr and a romance of sorts develops between them she offers him nothing but disdain and a stiff upper lip however though we suspect that underneath her heart still beats the cold war intrigue and the powerful acting carry the story but the romance is never quite convincing it remains however one of my favorite <UNK> <UNK> films and deserves to be seen if only for his passionate performance
<START> the selection of the <UNK> boring and racist <UNK> ranks as the worst choice for best picture in oscar history poorly acted particularly by the <UNK> forgotten richard <UNK> whose performance as the self centered and irresponsible <UNK> <UNK> ranks as one of the most <UNK> characterizations in screen history and <UNK> paced the film is truly shocking today because of the racist <UNK> towards its one black character who is introduced by being shown sleeping in a <UNK> br br other comments by imdb reviewers have <UNK> the attitude towards this character as being merely dated but many films that appeared during this period did not depict blacks as <UNK> lazy mental in the manner that this <UNK> takes great delight in so that argument seems weak to say the least but whether you regard this <UNK> characterization as in shockingly bad taste for anyone at any time or merely the forgivable ignorance of a less educated era it is very painful to watch with 21st century eyes br br but even this might not matter if the film weren't the overlong bore that it is voted the best picture oscar at the 1930 <UNK> academy awards when such enduring classics as city lights the public enemy dracula the dawn <UNK> and the blue angel failed to be nominated <UNK> is by far the worst selection to join the oscar <UNK>
<START> this movie is simply rubbish i have to say i am an expert of rubbish movies i <UNK> the 1 rating for movies that are rubbish but funny but this film is just tedious and certainly not crappy in a funny way but crappy in a crappy way it gets a 2 so those of you out there can <UNK> between the ones that will make you laugh and the ones that will make you fall asleep there are scenes in this movie where the actors are looking at something their expressions are of <UNK> and there wide eyes and slack jaws tell the audience that what they are looking at is going to be profoundly amazing this simply isn't it's just a <UNK> or even more desert it has to be pretty god damn awful for me to walk out let me tell you i walked out and so did quite a few people
<START> first off i would like to make it clear that i <UNK> subject myself to the viewing of terrible movies i have seen what i thought were the worst of the worst in my mind movies could not get any worse than the likes of d e b s <UNK> 6 back 2 <UNK> hood and terror storm until i saw this movie br br the pirate movie without any exaggeration is the worst movie in the world i was informed prior to watching that the movie was indeed awful but i did not believe the <UNK> believe me when i tell you that this movie is simply an abomination to film br br it starts out with a 3 minute clip of a boat of pirates apparently in the middle of a battle with themselves the end <UNK> across the screen unfortunately it is not the actual end of the movie the movie is about an <UNK> <UNK> nerdy girl named mabel who carries around a ghetto <UNK> and is attracted to <UNK> homosexual pirate boys she <UNK> and has a overly drawn out <UNK> in which she stars as a scantily dressed <UNK> who falls in love with <UNK> who happens to have just <UNK> out of the ocean he might actually be homosexual the pirate king has a ruby and diamond <UNK> it <UNK> and <UNK> when he <UNK> it br br there is singing in this movie you might have the impression that this is a hilarious musical it isn't trust me they are the worst songs that you've ever heard and by the end of the first original tune you will be searching for objects to pierce your <UNK> with br br there are references to other movies in here by references of course i mean obvious rip offs the inclusion of indiana jones inspector <UNK> and the <UNK> were in fact anti hilarious br br the dialogue is in its better moments painful to hear the direction is flat out awful and at one point you can see the stunt pad in the scene which isn't very well hidden at all br br in conclusion if there is even the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie get rid of it there are times when people want to see how bad something really is but this movie is not worth it put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again if you <UNK> your mental capacity then i beg of you never ever watch this movie
<START> i remember watching this movie on tv a few years back it was so bad i can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing the only plot summary i can give you without any spoilers is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high br br spoiler alert starts here when the movie starts a guy's running being chased by the demon cop when in fact the man was really being chased by a halloween costume gone wrong a car pops out of nowhere hitting the guy who was running it sends him flying over the top of it and what does the driver do watches the man as he falls gets back in his car and drives away what kind of hair <UNK> <UNK> would do that i would've at least asked if the guy was okay br br then some black guy stares the demon cop straight in the face then later tells <UNK> i didn't get a good look at him my sisters and i by then were almost <UNK> ourselves to death with laughter br br then there's some scene in an alley where this girl with an <UNK> pulls a machine gun out of her <UNK> <UNK> little purse it couldn't have possibly fit i can hardly remember certain scenes maybe it's because they were just that bad br br cops in the film can't even jump a fence and the acting is so wooden it makes <UNK> of wood look like better actors br br all in all this movie brings shame to hollywood way more than any other flop could you have to see it to believe its sappy cheesy plot which it has none of as far as i can tell
<START> r i c c o is the stupidest film ever made i can't believe my father bought this crap this film should da never got made if this film was wide known trust me it will be on the 1 spot for <UNK> worst the acting is horrible it's scary which it is why it's horror this piece of s had no horror in at at all it's an urban action which is funny because i could of <UNK> it was a comedy when people got shot i couldn't help but laugh i am the only person who reviewed this and i hope that i am the last with this vote only i hope it make it to the 1 spot at the worst
<START> the only complaint i heard about this film was that it was slow though perhaps this is the point the two characters clash and the slow build up of tension between them is anxiety producing the intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialog take the tension to a point where an otherwise normal argument shocks the audience <UNK> and the <UNK> are dreamy scenery captivating and the plot is thrilling not in that look the hero blew up yet another car and he's now flying with his motorcycle kind of way though i had chills down my spine as the characters moved in and out of each other's <UNK> and watched the fog <UNK> <UNK>
<START> first of all should cameron diaz ever be allowed to act again to call that a bad performance would be an insult to bad performances that was a historically horrific performance any small chance that diaz had at being a serious actress is now completely done after that laughably horrible br br two the movie was extremely boring and not very thought provoking at all i can sit around and <UNK> human nature without having to watch terrible actors play out a terrible story br br third there was not a single likable character and even worse it seemed like that was done by design you were not supposed to like or feel sympathy for any character it was quite effective i wanted them all to just die to be honest aliens included kid included everyone was just one big <UNK> in this movie everyone literally just <UNK> around and they called it a movie you could barely <UNK> the zombie employees with regular people because they all seemed like zombies br br lastly nothing really makes sense from the characters reactions and emotions to the literal story line it all just seems random this is just a really bad movie disguised and <UNK> as a thinking mans movie which is meant to be confusing give me a break a bad movie is a bad movie and this movie was bad
<START> this movie did not give mr bachchan justice he is a great actor and i was very disappointed in the movie and there was not much plot to it matter a fact this is the first movie i have ever been disappointed in with him in it it starts out with her coming to his home with his daughter and he is a photographer he takes pictures of her in the garden has she's <UNK> herself down he is a sixty year old man that has nothing to do but to take pictures of this girl the movie makes no sense the whole movie is about her chasing him around and her telling him how much she cares about him then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl around places so she is not bored and is daughter finds out i just didn't think this movie was up to <UNK> standards he is better than this movie i always <UNK> him as an <UNK> person and then i seen him in this movie and i couldn't picture him in this movie the movie didn't hold my interest at all i couldn't wait until the movie was over and you won't either
<START> brain of blood starts as <UNK> <UNK> reed hadley the leader of a country called is close to death because of cancer however if he dies will tear itself apart without anyone to lead them so doctor robert grant williams one of <UNK> <UNK> have <UNK> a plan to take dead body to america where mad scientist dr lloyd <UNK> kent taylor will transplant his brain into a fresh body with a bit of plastic surgery no one will ever know he was even dead things don't go according to plan though as when the time comes to transplant brain freak assistant <UNK> john bloom brings a dead body of someone that fell from a balcony <UNK> needed a strong fit living body since there's no more time he decides to use body as a temporary stop gap until another more suitable one can be found unfortunately when <UNK> wakes up in his new body he's not very happy at what he sees i mean would you be if you found out your brain was inside a badly burned freak br br also known as brain damage the brain the <UNK> the <UNK> brain this <UNK> exploitation flick was produced directed by the one only al quite frankly i'm offended at the pathetic 1 5 rating brain of blood has on the imdb personally i think it's terrific fun in a so bad it's good sort of way the highly entertaining script by kane w <UNK> joe van <UNK> is as <UNK> silly as they come from sloppy blood <UNK> brain <UNK> to crazed mad scientists from 7 foot tall acid <UNK> freaks who play with toy cars to 4 foot tall midget medical <UNK> from basement <UNK> to <UNK> chases from car crashes to kidnaps to screaming scantily clad women from <UNK> hair do which should get it's own mention during the opening credits to teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for blood to a laugh out loud hilarious ending which includes some deep meaningful speech it's all here brain of blood has quality cheese <UNK> all over it if your a fan of bad low budget exploitation flicks with a sense of fun then this film should be right at the top of your list of <UNK> <UNK> films despite it's <UNK> 1 5 rating i am proud to admit that i liked brain of blood a lot i thought it was an absolute hoot to watch it slows down a bit at the end with a few too many shots of people wandering around doing nothing in particular but until that point it had moved along like a rocket at only 85 minutes it's relatively short it's difficult to second guess the <UNK> plot i just think it's loads of campy fun br br this is director <UNK> masterpiece as far as i'm concerned along with dracula vs frankenstein 1971 which he made a year before this those who have seen an <UNK> film before will know about the none existent production values cheap special effects cardboard sets that all adds to the fun this film manages that fine between incompetence seriousness to create a memorable viewing experience i love the opening shot of which is obviously just a photo of the <UNK> <UNK> in india complete with <UNK> people in the <UNK> <UNK> hair seems to be a separate <UNK> on it's own it seems to change styles between shots is frankly horrendous don't get me started about her make up job either that she must apply with a a paint there is another hilarious moment when we see body has been transported to america wrapped in what looks like ordinary tin foil why is the question i asked myself why the effects are <UNK> there's a terrible looking fake spider burned make up job is pretty bad although there is a surprisingly gory brain <UNK> which is actually quite impressive br br the budget for brain of blood must have been practically none existent i must admit i thought lab was quite good with various computers medical <UNK> although the rest of the film looks cheap nasty the production values are low the music was taken from another film beast of blood 1971 the acting is awful but in a campy fun sort of way br br brain of blood may have the best title for an exploitation film ever as far as i'm concerned it's a highly entertaining piece of nonsense that i had a great time watching laughing at they just don't can't won't make them like this anymore impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good film but bad movie lovers should enjoy it i liked it but then again i'm just weird
<START> truly truly awful i don't even know where to begin this is a perfect example of a movie that doesn't know what to do with itself i'm not sure i could even <UNK> a category myself except that i'm quite sure it's a slap in the face of everyone every where even the unborn br br at times i thought i was watching a parody or some kind of farce at times just a bad b movie but i kept holding out for the porno which i fear is almost but not entirely non existent br br some one advised skipping to the ending i would definitely second that emotion the last five minutes are intense and certainly contain some of the best film making cgi you will ever see ever br br ed wood would be proud
<START> if you like soap series you might like this film i recommend this film to fans of dutch soap series like or even american stuff like the bold the beautiful if you don't like that stuff stay away from this movie it has the same kind of visual style the same quality of acting direction and writing the film was a big hit at home territory but wasn't sold anywhere else outside holland and <UNK> pretty strange for a commercial film like this br br maybe it says something
<START> <UNK> and talents shine in the happily childish version of jack and the the use of <UNK> tone and colour the music and choreography song and dance the crossing over of players from one role to another plus various other aspects of this very fine movie make it obvious that techniques and styles used for the wizard of oz are being <UNK> with here and that works right well for our <UNK> duo there are certain other things involved that make this movie a treat for me buddy max <UNK> jr of the beverly <UNK> uncle appearance as the cop and the giant pat <UNK> <UNK> brother having been involved in the writing of the script these things help make this film fun it does however have it's down side i do think that the choreography is poorly done but the cute tunes and accompanying <UNK> help detract from the rather sloppy dance numbers some of the players the couple in love prince and princess to be precise aren't very good at their trade but these things are a small price to pay for an otherwise <UNK> enjoyable walk down the yellow brick er i mean climb up the
<START> i can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie this is such a slow <UNK> going absolutely nowhere oh yeah ok it goes somewhere but you see that coming from miles away acting really really bad maybe the bartender was kind of ok editing bad i suppose the editor was told we need at least 90 minutes cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin music don't get me started on that the <UNK> score i've ever heard who is that singing in the last scene for crying out loud directing oh my david lynch sucks but someone trying to copy him sucks even harder skip this one
<START> edward directed this shadowy movie about a murder investigation involving military <UNK> robert young gets to lecture us about hatred robert mitchum walks through most of this picture and gloria <UNK> <UNK> the she <UNK> in it's a wonderful life it's robert ryan who gets at the heart of the matter anti he goes so deep into his role as monty <UNK> imagine parents named lawrence calling their son larry that the drama sits <UNK> on his shoulders and he is more than up to the challenge without him the movie would be <UNK> ryan has played a number of memorable villains in his day bad day at black rock billy <UNK> but this performance put him on the map with sam <UNK> as the murder victim
<START> fantastic series one of my few favorites miami vice and tour of duty are the other two and this series is right up there with them br br these guys aren't into wearing <UNK> <UNK> they dress more like <UNK> everything about this series <UNK> an <UNK> of realism artistic license or not br br it paints a picture of a europe only slightly out of the grasp of <UNK> as most of the villagers still have their local <UNK> and there are satan <UNK> nuns and witches and <UNK> casting spells br br however what comes to the <UNK> most is that it's a series of it's time rather than the version of the fifties which was a <UNK> against <UNK> government and the mccarthy era <UNK> this series is thoroughly grounded in the 1980s <UNK> and has a strong <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a nature called the hunter who often appears wearing the head of a deer and is a <UNK> as is this robin of the green man an alternative version of <UNK> the egyptian god of <UNK> and <UNK> it is interesting to note that in these series robin in the hood isn't a person but a concept when the old one is killed a new one is <UNK> <UNK> by the person may die but robin in the hood will live forever hence the concept of <UNK> br br the music and score are really outstanding and performed by the irish <UNK> when watching it i couldn't help but think how boring authentic medieval folk music would have been br br all this is beautifully shot in the lush <UNK> of <UNK> which pass for the new forrest br br the only down side is that in the initial episodes of both series the actors have to overcome their own and convince themselves that this really is a serious work after that they get into it and the acting is great michael as the first robin the second is played by sean <UNK> son jason <UNK> makes a beautiful and fragile <UNK> marion phil rose as the <UNK> and really kind hearted <UNK> <UNK> ray <UNK> as the <UNK> and <UNK> scarlet clive <UNK> as the giant shepard little john peter williams as little john's <UNK> friend and fellow shepard and mark ryan as the ex assassin all of them giving great performances also great are the steady bad guys nicholas grace as the bug eyed scheming sheriff of <UNK> and his <UNK> bumbling sidekick and <UNK> half brother as it turns out robert as sir guy of really cool too is fashion designer richard o'brien as the evil lord owen of <UNK> magician he appears near the end of the first series and later in the second br br the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> on <UNK> stood in for the <UNK> castle check it out on co uk under places of interest br br so if you're at all into mythology the middle ages <UNK> don't waste your time on <UNK> or <UNK> this is the real thing so go out and watch it br br alex
<START> what a great cast for this movie the timing was excellent and there were so many clever lines several times i was still laughing minutes after they were delivered i found <UNK> from heaven to have some surprising moments and while there were things i was thinking would happen the way they came together was anything but predictable this movie is about hope and <UNK> <UNK> i left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing bravo to the five sisters
<START> wow where to begin with this one well if you enjoy laughing at the utter failures of filmmakers then this one is for you i bought this movie for 5 bucks because i never pass up an opportunity to laugh at b movie god casper van <UNK> and boy was this one of them it may have been enough that this movie contains the single most lame movie monster ever this thing which is supposed to be an indian ghost looks more like a plastic candy bowl <UNK> that you put on your front <UNK> on halloween he <UNK> a cape that is clearly a garbage bag complete with what appears to be a bucket shaped <UNK> over his head at some points this is a man in costume at others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse this monster has the uncanny ability to see with predator vision a clear rip off and can miraculously appear after throwing his <UNK> sometimes the <UNK> cuts people sometimes it doesn't this thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow wow this makes a much sense as when the kid blows up a spaceship with a <UNK> at the end of <UNK> this creature is <UNK> to bullets but somehow dies at the end of the movie at the end of his killing spree which we never really find out why he is on he gets blown up this is an incredible feat for we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film but i guess this last time was the charm br br and don't even get me started on the <UNK> of the other characters first of all what <UNK> force unit employs women last i checked the military still <UNK> women into combat situations also this unit is undercover why what possible reason would they have to be undercover and they're not even good at it i guess no one would realize that they were military if they didn't have on uniforms but they were all carrying machine guns which incidentally change sound effects throughout the film at some points sounding like air rifle <UNK> guns and at others <UNK> there is one part when the <UNK> man throws some construction workers from a <UNK> and you can clearly see the pad that they fall onto at another point michael <UNK> falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground they <UNK> the camera slightly to give the appearance of an <UNK> but he is clearly pushing himself along in this fall scene then when he is helped back up the hill the rope is flat and when it shows the woman at the top of the hill the rope goes <UNK> from her grip not the way it would look if she was pulling someone up a hill <UNK> actually has a line that says i'm not going after him i going after it what that is quite possibly the dumbest thing i have ever heard and i watch these bad movies as a <UNK> the saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in the writing production of this film thought that it was so bad ass believe it or not compared to the rest of the dialog this is good br br the acting bad the makeup really bad these characters either had <UNK> or wounds that liked to change sides of their face maybe these are alien <UNK> that like to run around on your face yeah i think i'll make a movie about that attack of the alien <UNK> that move around on your face that villain would be more <UNK> than the <UNK> man and the film would probably be scarier
<START> i just recently discovered this fantastic series and i just can't seem to get enough of <UNK> laid back <UNK> the shows continually display excellent level of writing and suspenseful episodes br br this episode of hand is a little different <UNK> humor in favor of a more serious turn for <UNK> as he <UNK> for his missing girlfriend br br the mystery is great and it's <UNK> is convincing enough it's based on a book can't remember the name and it could easily have been stretched to a feature length episode garner excels here as <UNK> gets tough and really means business this has a noir feel to it all the way the dark lighting and overall mood echo the great dark thrillers of the 40's and 50's br br really good episode in a class a series easily deserves a 10
<START> this is a really great series i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter o yes for <UNK> girls it is very awesome they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch they do everything together just like my mom and me ya for <UNK> girls um i'm running out of lines but i love how luke and relationship is finally <UNK> up they so needed to be together and i absolutely just love <UNK> st james she is so awesome and the show wouldn't be anywhere without michel the whole show is dry humor sarcasm and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other especially the <UNK> girls
<START> <UNK> is about a husband and wife who experience time loss while making love completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they try to go on with their lives the <UNK> begins questioning the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist he comes to believe that aliens are responsible for this <UNK> in time and that the unborn baby he once thought was his and his wife's actually belongs to the aliens br br if ya ask me this is a great scifi horror story taking a highly questionable real life scenario involving alien <UNK> and hybrid <UNK> is definite thumbs up from this guy i love all things related to aliens and this story definitely delivered some good ideas so if you also share an interest in things <UNK> you should be pretty happy with <UNK> at least story wise anyways br br unfortunately the movie overall is pretty average with average acting by all actors yep even by the consistently awesome mr <UNK> who still does deliver the best performance though the black head doctor delivers his lines really well there are a few points in the flick where some of the delivery is cringe or laugh worthy which is fine in my book i like them cheesy and this had a little bit of some nice <UNK> cheese and i mean that in a good way br br anyways with a less than stellar script you can't really blame all the actors i especially didn't care for the mother <UNK> the film went for she wanted a baby so badly that she'd neglect and dismiss everything her loving husband who's a doctor said to her it almost reached a point where you actually didn't care what happened to her br br the <UNK> is another flick by brian <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> film society again he delivers some slimy effects and again he delivers a pretty unique tale of horror if you're into scifi horror or are a fan of <UNK> and or <UNK> films there's no real reason not to check out this flick if you get the chance a generous 7 outta 10
<START> this is the type of film that may need to be viewed several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence just like curse of frankenstein from 1957 if you don't like odd non mainstream films steer clear of this masterpiece for me the artwork alone in this film is worth the purchase price of the the storyline is a bit fantastic but seems to becoming reality in our world today for being produced in the 1980s this film is proving to be a <UNK> vision of whats to come with big government and big brother wanting to control and <UNK> us br br there are many slow sections and the dialog can be quite hard to catch in many scenes thats why i've watched it 6 times now but if you can <UNK> it all it may prove to be well worth your time br br the film is basically about a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their <UNK> they are only concerned about <UNK> and <UNK> the hero of the film has not <UNK> to this sickness and has not been <UNK> and <UNK> by big brother his mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply which will change the way the human robots think and allow to once again be a part of humanity br br yes its very low budget but for its time the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are utterly fascinating if you have an open mind this film should impress and its <UNK> visions are chilling
<START> if you're a science fiction fan and you've only seen this movie once please please go and treat yourself to a second viewing i just did and i was amazed about how good i thought the movie was as opposed to when i first saw it three years ago the first time around i was certainly impressed by the <UNK> <UNK> we're treated to in this movie but by and large i didn't think that much of the movie as a whole it was an alien rip off and i thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science that they were <UNK> to light was something i found especially ridiculous based on my first viewing i recently rated this movie a 5 br br however now that the sequel chronicles of <UNK> is on the way and the movie poster for that one looks amazing i thought i'd better brush up on pitch black once more so i borrowed the video from a friend i am so glad i did there's so much of what i thought i remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate i thought most of the characters died very early in the movie this was not so i thought <UNK> <UNK> character was the first to die this was not so i thought <UNK> was the sole survivor this was not so br br i see now that the movie works extremely well there isn't an excessive tiresome focus on the monsters it's much more of a human drama the main characters are appealing and capable of some convincing acting and there are so many little details that make the pitch black universe coherent and believable such as the <UNK> of <UNK> in the atmosphere of the planet they crash on and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet and so they turn on each other br br and i have to mention the <UNK> <UNK> again i mean we start out seeing the spaceship passing through a <UNK> tail with bits of <UNK> through the <UNK> then we come to a planet with three <UNK> just as the <UNK> people think it's about to get dark a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon and everything is <UNK> in a blue glow as the <UNK> approaches we see the huge <UNK> <UNK> gas giant rise across the sky and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship <UNK> closely above one of these very rings these scenes are created with a sense of beauty wonder and detail and i don't think i've seen any other sf movie that really made such a point out of including these things i hope we see much more of it in the sequel br br pitch black now gets from me a rating of 9 out of 10 a cult classic you bet
<START> if we compare the movie industry with an ocean we have the <UNK> to observe only the surface driven by the strong hollywood marketing force we all saw war movies like saving private ryan the thin red line apocalypse now or full metal jacket but underneath the <UNK> waves grow in silence from time to time less known <UNK> when you pick one and look carefully at it you wonder why this pearl lie almost unknown and why it's not already on the crown br br <UNK> is such a gem why it has a bunch of multi million dollars rated actors no it have thousand of extras no it have breathtaking spectacular shiny <UNK> visual effects not at all so what's so special well in one word it's pure past reality <UNK> and <UNK> to celluloid fifty years later the tragedy of the most bloody battle in the history is here filthy wounded soldiers russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion burning <UNK> <UNK> buildings <UNK> <UNK> explosions tanks in flames soldiers shot burned alive ground by tanks in their <UNK> or shred to pieces you got all but the real horror is elsewhere people are reduced to simple <UNK> without the power to change anything the soldiers we follow in film try to leave the combat zone and they fail the civilians stay in <UNK> in the middle of nowhere only crying for their children killed the huge <UNK> machine of war melt together humans equipment <UNK> cities and ask for more victims and destruction over and over br br in all this collective insanity a group of german soldiers struggle to survive and to keep at least a minimum level of <UNK> they do their duty and fight <UNK> but as everyone know a battle is almost lost when people start to loose confidence and faith we see how all those people are abandoned how they plan to desert how they struggle to catch the very last plane to berlin full of wounded how some very bad injured soldiers were treated as and shot how they were forced to <UNK> a small group of russian civilians including a young boy how they later discovered a place literally full up to the ceiling of food and drinks destined only for some superior officers of course one by one they drop dead the end of the movie is one of the most bitter depressing and touching ending i ever saw all on the magnificent score of the <UNK> orchestra the war destroyed everything in its path br br this movie is a must see for everyone a true movie lover should have it in his her collection the strong anti war message must be a warning for all of us unfortunately the mankind never learn nor the politicians self destruction is in our <UNK> and the human pain seem to last forever can we be enough reasonable to stop the war
<START> yes i am ashamed to admit it but this show is positively <UNK> it's so entertaining and i have the absolute greatest time watching it ever since cycle 1 it's been great and i haven't noticed a downfall in it's glory at all <UNK> banks as you know is the host and as fabulous as she is there's also the other judges and co <UNK> such as j alexander jay <UNK> <UNK> barker and <UNK> the main point of the show is for every girl invited to become america's next top model has to work their way up to the top by <UNK> and winning photo shoot <UNK> it sounds great already doesn't it and let me tell you it is great it's awesome watching all the different kinds of photo shoots the girls take and each one is different cool and daring anybody who hates this show doesn't have a clue and i will tell you that this show will be on for a long time so deal with it
<START> in terms of quality movies this isn't one of them it's actually the first chuck norris movie i've seen and i was left pretty <UNK> the fight scenes are slow and don't have a lot of variety norris just uses a lot of <UNK> kicks on all the bad guys coming after him which makes the fights pretty boring the movie also is quite short but for some reason the movie doesn't even seem finished when it ends it's a pretty anti climatic ending all the same though i've watched a lot of bad movies and this isn't one of the worst that i've seen it's worth a watch i'm guessing especially for norris fans there's also nothing like seeing a group of <UNK> <UNK> down the desert which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie
<START> these writers are trying to re create the characters they have on <UNK> in a different <UNK> however the characters they are stuck with have no charisma or acting ability not to mention the writing seems poor and <UNK> these guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing wasn't so disgusting which is leaving the shows only <UNK> to be two attractive teachers that that are barely keeping it alive the humor in this show seems like it is trying to target an audience with an i q of 40 or below another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the writing on the show <UNK> is excellent and this show has to follow it up leaving the viewer in an odd position not knowing whether to cry or to just lose hope in new sitcoms all together this is just my opinion but i think these guys should stop now before they <UNK> themselves anymore than they have already
<START> <UNK> brothers wannabe from writer director paul <UNK> relies far too much on ideas lifted from other better movies yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching robert <UNK> cuts loose as never before playing a <UNK> psychiatrist ha ha who goes on a killing spree in the desert the film is unusual but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience it becomes <UNK> and off putting with a role for amanda plummer that is downright <UNK> an admittedly <UNK> finale many quirky bits of business and <UNK> looking great in the nude make this a curiosity item nothing more veteran movie director <UNK> <UNK> produced and maybe should directed as well could paul <UNK> be a <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> they call this film euro trash horror br br well it's not horror the film takes place in europe so yes it's euro trash ah yes it's trash all right br br you know you're in for a great movie when right at the beginning the dvd gives you text on the screen <UNK> for the quality of the print you're about to watch expect <UNK> odd jarring cuts and for the movie not to fit the screen plus there's the sound at first i thought i was watching a dubbed film then watching the lips carefully i realized that no it's that the sound quality is embarrassingly bad and out of <UNK> br br the plot itself is fairly goofy an old <UNK> woman named dr <UNK> kills a scientist for his youth formula i'm not giving much away because when you see the old woman it's pretty obvious she's under a <UNK> of thick badly applied make up anyone with a <UNK> of sense seeing the fake old age knows what's coming next br br yes the old <UNK> is miraculously transformed into a beautiful young woman complete with face make up and a long wig of hair br br when i say the old woman is <UNK> i mean she has <UNK> glued to her face the film makes no attempt to explain how the <UNK> got there for that matter there is no attempt to explain anything at all relating to any of the characters they're never developed beyond the level of finger puppets br br the two policemen pursuing our anti heroine just wander about apparently <UNK> by the <UNK> clues the murdered scientist was working on a youth serum the old woman has disappeared and we keep running into a young woman how do these pieces fit together what does it all mean one of the cops <UNK> a lot and <UNK> his face with a cloth the other <UNK> a <UNK> that's pretty much all we get character wise br br dr <UNK> the <UNK> now a beauty goes around wearing odd costumes and then taking them off so we can see her flesh she has affairs with men she gets in a <UNK> with a young woman in a <UNK> she goes to <UNK> so we can see the lake there she water <UNK> a bit then takes off her wet suit to reveal a strange <UNK> curtain bikini she takes off her clothes again in a strange ninja costume <UNK> br br the ending well without giving anything away it's just a bizarre tacked on conclusion that makes about as little sense as the rest of the picture it's the sort of thing a writer comes up with when the director wakes him up at 4 am and says quick we need an ending for our movie what happens next br br the writer <UNK> something half awake and the director runs with it br br what's good about this movie some of the music is campy and fun that classic 60s <UNK> music that's so corny it's enough to make you laugh out loud there are some odd seduction scenes bizarre dialogue goofy moments br br it's very close to being so bad it's good i did manage to watch it from start to finish without <UNK> out my eyes or <UNK> i guess that's praise of sorts '
<START> seriously i couldn't find anything that <UNK> a rational human thought in this movie for some reason the writer decided to have a bunch of actors in random places <UNK> and yelling like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i understand that this was about <UNK> but seriously what's with all the roaring and human <UNK> i also saw at least five actors with <UNK> syndrome and stage 10 <UNK> br br although this movie has actual human <UNK> i must say it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any <UNK> form of human speech <UNK> this is truly a <UNK> in the history of film making because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than a <UNK> or sound br br incredible
<START> <UNK> from heaven is heavenly this is a movie for the family teens and grandparents can enjoy it together but it isn't <UNK> sweet or silly the characters really are characters the plot is somewhat complex and you have to pay attention but it's like putting a puzzle together as it all falls into place bit by bit the period beginning is like watching an old photo album or remembering back when it's extremely well done with very accurate <UNK> and costumes the story moves along quickly with twists turns and lots of fun br br a special treat is to watch the large cast of familiar faces many of whom we haven't seen in much too long a time part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear though this can be distracting <UNK> <UNK> by the end of the film looks as if she's had a make over on oprah i had never seen faye grant in a movie only knew her as <UNK> mother in the tv series saving grace she was great even minus the southern accent and i didn't even recognize <UNK> duvall the five sisters who created this very lovely film are a very talented <UNK> and sister <UNK> is a heavenly treasure
<START> i have only seen the minimum <UNK> episode yet i have no intention of watching the others how can that be morgan starts <UNK> complaining about his awful situation living on minimum <UNK> right at the beginning of the episode and the complaining never stops ever luckily for the viewer his skinny girlfriend is just as annoying as morgan if not even more annoying br br and then to top it all they go to the movies and buy <UNK> water for 2 50 and after that go to a restaurant to eat out all the while they naturally complain about being poor br br i don't care if the other episodes may or may not be better than this no one should be forced to watch this crap
<START> i love most jet li movies with the exception of romeo must die and i bought this movie in a very cheap three pack with the master and twin warriors while twin warriors was very impressive and i was thoroughly intrigued by it and the master was a bit karate kid but also enjoyable i thought this movie was terrible i'm not just saying that because i'm used to better movies i'm saying that it was almost down there with <UNK> the fight scenes were terrible <UNK> cameras and no real fighting and the plot was your typical stupid kung fu plot if you are going to have a plot this stupid see <UNK> turns into woman to become all powerful then falls in love with jet you best have some great fighting to go with it if you are looking for an original hk jet li movie i suggest you go rent shaolin temple 2 aka kids from shaolin
<START> i'm not sure how the imdb <UNK> average came up with such a low rating on this film it is in my opinion and by all other accounts an overlooked gem of a movie rip torn is fantastic as the stubborn <UNK> lord and <UNK> <UNK> as his torn and <UNK> are both underrated actors who are finally given a stage to work their craft on br br their relationship isn't always pleasant but it's very real this is not the <UNK> and touching love story it's billed as on the dvd jacket in the end it is a tragedy lord simply aims too high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the power company to move br br the music is fantastic as are the period sets
<START> for some reason some shows just fail some deservedly some not buddy was a clever show with interesting characters and dark humor that was enjoyable to watch maybe it was never intended to be a big hit but it had a <UNK> about it that made it enjoyable that being said it appears i may have been the only one watching dennis <UNK> and frank <UNK> were casted perfectly in their respective roles production quality and writing were great and vegas was the perfect backdrop hopefully the first and only season will be released on dvd as i believe it deserves some <UNK> maybe at least make it on tv land cheers
<START> well it might be a kid's movie perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm it is teenager movie i agree so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good so good that at the end nobody <UNK> truth or lie anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story i think they writers <UNK> a lesson <UNK> it <UNK> truth is never
<START> why do i give this 1974 porn movie 7 points because i watched it and i found it hilarious aliens their weird spaceship their weird <UNK> my god was that a sight and all what these desperate alien women need is <UNK> from the earth br br and where do they look for it in upper germany and that is where the main fun comes from in europe and more so in german speaking countries is seen as a traditional and <UNK> region and then the actors are so helpless with the alien women well there have been films about people being unable to deal with women like the american pie series br br but what this film achieved is a true funny weirdness you constantly wonder how they came up with these <UNK> ideas but it was 1974 and looking back 35 years fills one with a kind of nostalgia you've never seen a film like that br br and if you don't mind seeing the casual <UNK> <UNK> and breasts watch it once it is a comedy essentially not a porn flick
<START> this was so much better than i expected the film <UNK> compared to other b <UNK> of this sort of budget the script was good if a little formulaic but the acting was surprisingly good from all including <UNK> and you always expect good standards from <UNK> and busey <UNK> as the good plot and acting the action is good especially the car chases and the crashes are a class all in all this is a rise above other b movie thrillers and doesn't have to rely on constant nudity or a flow of cheesy <UNK> to make up for budget and script its certainly worth a rent
<START> one of the worst films of it's genre br br the only bright spots were lee showing some of the <UNK> she would later bring to the time tunnel and batman br br a young patty duke also <UNK> the more established actors br br
<START> i remember running home from school almost every day to catch channel 5 monster movies but never did i run home faster then when this movie was <UNK> somehow the idea of being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend <UNK> to me in a very unique way sure i <UNK> to be <UNK> batman and other <UNK> but i really wanted to be johnny over any of them br br i have not seen this movie in 30 years and i can still remember it vividly who can forget the way giant robot shot <UNK> out of his fingers or how about the way threw his <UNK> to make explosions <UNK> i can even still <UNK> the theme music that plays at the end which is so tragic that i remember crying myself to sleep a number of times br br only one other movie has the kind of magic that this movie does in my mind and that is the wizard of oz but i have seen that movie many times since i was a kid of course the wizard of oz is a true classic whereas voyage into space is low budget nonsense these two films shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence but to a young boy it isn't high production values or continuity that capture your heart its flying monkeys and giant robots br br p s my cousin use to do a very accurate impression of giant robot he <UNK> it giant if you recall giant robot had a particular way of shooting his <UNK> and my cousin had it down cold i made him repeat the routine endlessly for my personal amusement
<START> i rented this movie because <UNK> wood has done some good work and i thought this might be an overlooked treasure it was not a treasure i don't know if this was straight to video but it should have been straight to the dump br br <UNK> wood fans will like the fact that he appears <UNK> in a much too brief shower scene but no sane person would like this script imagine <UNK> played by teen actors but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible case in point <UNK> <UNK> plays a caring psychologist apparently keeping the chain of mediocrity <UNK> br br as if false memories and mind over matter medicine weren't hokey enough the movie also <UNK> on one of those unexplained psychic twin bonds that keep the plot moving and the audience <UNK> this same twin bond creates a few too many contrived love scenes between <UNK> character and the girl from she's all that who plays the <UNK> sister of <UNK> angry cancer victim friend br br adding to the of this screenplay <UNK> other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and <UNK> a young black boy <UNK> with a mysterious <UNK> disease <UNK> dying wish comes true when dr <UNK> gives him his own <UNK> this character's hackneyed function in the story is matched by his on again off again relationship to walking usually bound to a wheelchair <UNK> has several inexplicable scenes showing him pushing others around in it br br characterization may be one small detail but it is <UNK> of this film's many other flaws the <UNK> flies anyway is definitely bumbling but it never flies
<START> i saw this movie over 20 years ago and had rather fond memories of it catching again on <UNK> this month i realized how little <UNK> i had about films back then this is an utterly ordinary spaghetti western with absolutely nothing noteworthy about it script direction acting photography are all a big blah stick with the sergio <UNK> westerns
<START> 1st watched 8 7 2004 3 out of 10 <UNK> brett thompson silly juvenile focused movie about three kids being <UNK> into their favorite cartoon with their parents experiment the script left much to be desired in this <UNK> barbara like rip off of some saturday morning <UNK> action with people in dinosaur costumes kids <UNK> with some goofy <UNK> hanging around nothing really to admire about this and nothing much to be said either i'm just amazed i found this at a blockbuster video store as bad as it was and the way the stores are <UNK> themselves of old vhs movies i guess they couldn't even sell it so back on the rental rack it went
<START> honestly buying this movie was a waste of money it's one of the most boring movies i have seen in my life the only part i liked is the ending but it's so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie
<START> yeah sure the movie its visuals already did looked horrible and not very promising but the premise and the cast looked good so i still sort of expected to be entertained by this movie this however unfortunately wasn't the case the premise is good but the story is filled with <UNK> and is <UNK> flawed br br this movie is potential <UNK> down the toilet the main plot is interesting and somewhat original it's good enough to make a good adventurous movie out of would you think this movie however fails to entertain and i think that that is this movie biggest flaw perhaps it takes itself too serious and a little bit more humor certainly wouldn't had done the movie any harm instead it now is nothing more than a lame and cheap looking movie filled with the one unlikely event after the other that also steals a bit too much from other more successful movies jurassic park obviously br br the characters also don't help to make the movie any more compelling or at least interesting to watch i still think that edward burns did a fairly decent job as the main lead the rest of the characters however really get muddled in into the movie and they get very little interesting to do the movie rather relies on its visual which are extremely poor catherine <UNK> also plays a very irritating character basically all her character does is complain and talk about how right she was and the rest oh so wrong her character just isn't a likable one and the rest of the characters well i already have forgotten their names i think that that is saying enough about them it certainly is true though that ben <UNK> performance alone makes this movie worth watching he is really excellent in his sort of villainous businessman role but from the moment when he disappears out of the movie the movie really goes downhill rapidly br br visually the movie is extremely poor it has some dreadful looking cgi effects and they couldn't even get the more simple <UNK> <UNK> effects look convincing in the movie the sets are also awful and cheap looking like they can fall over and break down every moment br br the movie never gets tense exciting or adventurous since the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way possible it's a very distant movie with distant characters that fails to impress there are plenty of action sequences but all of them are so <UNK> looking and far from believable that they never get tense or good enough br br so basically this movie is lacking in everything that is needed to make a genre movie like this one a good and successful one it's sad to see how low director peter has sunk to the last couple of years after making some good movies in the <UNK> and <UNK> br br 4 10
<START> oh my gosh i love this movie much it is so incredible i loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult it is my favorite disney movie of time you should watch it watch it and love it my friends and i watch it a ton it is good i recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart my favorite part is the song and dance number with all of the <UNK> and thomas the writers producers director completely nailed this one yeah nailed it to the wall br br
<START> based on the excellent novel <UNK> by dean <UNK> is this extremely awful motion picture that probably shouldn't be viewed by anyone not since the running man have i seen a book butchered so far beyond recognition the difference however is that the running man film was still enjoyable as an amusing action film laden down a million catch phrases this <UNK> nope nothing remotely amusing in fact if you love the book as i do you'll hate this <UNK> even more br br warning contains spoilers i'm basically going to tell you the story here almost in it's entirety why because you dear reader do not also need to suffer through this okay for me because i enjoy watching crap because i like complaining about sh <UNK> things now on to the nasty this film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutant monkey creature soldier which escaped from a destroyed government <UNK> lab with a super smart golden <UNK> which the hero calls trust me in the novel this story <UNK> i'll get to that later anyway the hero is none other that dreamy boy child corey <UNK> oh i'm not kidding our hero runs around voice and all trying to convince his mom to help save this dog from the evil government which him and made him <UNK> ultra smart the monkey creature referred to as an god help us is also a genetic <UNK> of a creature built to be the ultimate fighter on <UNK> of the future michael <UNK> total recall starship plays a <UNK> is also in this film and no i couldn't figure out how anyone convinced him this would be a good idea he plays a government agent with the hunting the dog and creature oh yeah here's some he's also a creation from the government and the same lab and lo and behold spends most of the movie being a <UNK> and killing all that killing is supposed to be done by the monkey soldier instead of a <UNK> kick ass creepy horror film we have a <UNK> <UNK> of a <UNK> horror flick the <UNK> intelligence is discovered all too conveniently and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside breakdown br br change from book to film br br lead character travis turned from man to boy child br br man's love interest in book nora is now his all her depth and character growth is completely gone br br johnson black man is now white mr <UNK> this matters as the character's strength was built on his <UNK> in the book br br relationship between two authority figures completely ignored now kills the guy who was originally his best friend br br one principle character in the book is now totally absent the immortal that hunted the heroes maybe this is supposed to be <UNK> but then why is he someone else br br dog never receives deserving name of einstein in the movie br br no part of the book took place in a high least nothing that had strong bearing on the plot br br takes place over a matter of days rather months like the pacing br br corey <UNK> girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the book and they never met in the book br br character of johnson is no longer cool headed instead he's a total <UNK> that bullies his way through people br br hero travis was part of <UNK> force military segment <UNK> in hunting terrorists instead his dad who is never seen in the film was part of that group br br perceived intelligence in the monster now totally absent br br subplots involving <UNK> and the mob completely <UNK> out of the story br br these are just the most obnoxious changes and the one's i could remember off hand and a day later br br the good br br eventually after 90 odd minutes of pain and mental anguish the movie ended br br didn't hurt it didn't help it br br michael i like him br br the dog is still fairly likable br br wacky totally 80's title screen br br the bad br br okay the writing for one is extremely awful br br the direction is so half <UNK> that anyone watching the film will feel superior to everyone involved in it br br the acting is crappy and weak especially from corey <UNK> br br loose weak watered down story br br the monster looks just pathetic that is when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing its head is <UNK> over sized the yellow eyes that were so much a part of the thing in the book are seen for no more than two seconds instead of a lean powerful fast intelligent killing machine we have some jackass in a <UNK> ugly monkey suit forced upon us br br absolutely no character development br br even the violence and gore are done poorly for f <UNK> <UNK> this is supposed to be a horror film usually violence is at least done well br br the ugly br br the idea that dean <UNK> <UNK> out his brilliant novel to become this filthy f <UNK> piece of sh t brings me dangerously close to <UNK> all over myself and anyone near me there are movies worse than this headache inducing as that idea may seem but so far only alien vs predator at least to me is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment br br memorable scene watching the end credits start br br acting 3 10 story 4 10 the novel was really good this is just terrible atmosphere 5 10 cinematography 4 10 character development 1 10 special effects make up 4 10 nudity sexuality 0 10 violence gore 4 10 music 5 10 direction 3 10 br br cheesiness 7 10 <UNK> 9 10 br br overall 3 10 br br i would recommend that no one watch this movie ever except for a few extreme die hard horror only if you haven't read the novel instead i would recommend that anyone interested in this avoid it entirely and buy check borrow the book br br www <UNK> com
<START> this adaption contains two parts br br 1 the now time when <UNK> is at home in england and soon is put into a mental asylum by the evil dr bates br br 2 the described time in which <UNK> describes his travels br br the times are interspersed with a very choppy <UNK> which makes willing suspense of disbelief far more difficult than it would have been if the movie simply would have <UNK> that part and followed the book as written in the book there is no dr bates no asylum and mrs <UNK> gets very little mention the travels in <UNK> are depicted as one in the movie there are several movies covering the topic of sane people dumped into asylum by some nasty person out there look at them if you want that stuff the now time part adds absolutely nothing to the story's value is a complete invention by the movie <UNK> and takes valuable time from the real story all the time when this was going on i was longing for the next bit of real travel to be shown br br so much for the <UNK> the parts which actually are part of the real story are well done and the cgi is really well done for its time many small and a few medium sized parts of the real travels are simply cut out but that does not make the story halt this is the only version which depicts all four travels and for that the movie should get special mention br br the two interspersed parts get approximately equal time i rate the first part 0 out of 10 and the actual travel coverage as 8 10 <UNK> out i give it a 4 10 if only they would have cut the rubbish and focused 99 on the actual travels since that cut would have freed up a lot of time much better spent on filling in the details cut from the travels br br why some <UNK> think that he is gifted enough to improve upon <UNK> work i do not know my best guess is that cgi was so <UNK> back in 1996 so that the movie company felt a need to <UNK> a lot of filler which did not need elaborate sets <UNK> etc in order to keep total costs under some limit while at the same time producing a mini series which <UNK> in at some set number of minutes
<START> another in the long line of conan <UNK> that tired to cash in on that movie's success this italian monstrosity is about as bad as they came you know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies because the movie was made so cheaply there wasn't money for either adequate special effects or to hire real people i won't even bother going into the plot as i defy anyone to follow it and make sense of the storyline maybe it's the television cut i watched but i can't imagine any version being that much better it all seems so random to me evil <UNK> <UNK> giant snakes medieval <UNK> <UNK> and hang <UNK>  none of it fits together it's as if director joe <UNK> had an <UNK> fit while making cave <UNK> or any of the other half dozen names the movie goes by and threw everything he could think of onto the screen regardless of how unrelated it was or how it fit into the film's already puzzling plot the acting is <UNK> bad miles <UNK> could never act his way out of a wet paper bag and he proves that once again in this movie the rest of the cast is equally atrocious then there's the well you get the idea it's late i'm tired and i've already wasted more than enough time writing about this piece of garbage take my word for it  avoid cave <UNK> or whatever you want to call it at all costs
<START> basil <UNK> and <UNK> bruce as sherlock holmes and dr watson respectively the second of the universal series where it's again established by means of a written prologue that the famed detective is legendary and <UNK> time this helps to <UNK> set things up here in the present era of the early 1940's br br in this offering holmes goes through a few different <UNK> with <UNK> very prominent features is it likely that people really wouldn't recognize his true identity as he <UNK> a <UNK> from the hands of the nazis as well as from <UNK> greatest nemesis professor <UNK> now played by lionel <UNK> the scientist has developed a bomb sight which will greatly aid in <UNK> <UNK> and he's promised his plans to the british but <UNK> wants to get hold of it so he can sell them to the nazis br br a good entry <UNK> a bit by the participation of the properly villainous <UNK> now cast as <UNK> though george <UNK> was no <UNK> himself in the adventures of sherlock holmes it's always intriguing watching holmes and his greatest enemy engaging in witty banter together the <UNK> to the last eh holmes
<START> this is one of the most boring films i've ever seen the three main cast members just didn't seem to click well <UNK> <UNK> character was quite annoying for some reason he seems to like repeating what he says if he was the rain man it would've been fine but he's not br br 3 out of 10
<START> this is an excellent movie i have been watching it since i was old with my big sister it is the type of movie that u can watch over and over again and still laugh smile and cry every time with out ever getting bored of it like other movie's it is a movie that will live on forever through generations of family i love it when <UNK> from 1 10 in my case i would rate it easily 9 9 every time br br <UNK> a film about the change of a girl baby and her first boy friend johnny their relationships within the family the changes in <UNK> and <UNK> view of the world during their relationship br br dirty dancing will forever live on as a classic thank you sorry though for only the short comment
<START> spoilers br br i love movies i've seen a lot of movies i didn't think i'd ever see a film that i actually hated son of the mask ruined it son of the mask is so bad i'm not even going to do a detailed comment like i usually do in fact i'm not even going to write a lot i think all of you should know that this movie is horribly awful and poor jamie kennedy he was awesome in scream but now this film also this film takes a can film and turns it into this goofy kids film that not even kids will like this film also consists of very rude humor like the nose woman she has a nose for a head and when she <UNK> white stuff <UNK> out of her nose there is also an exorcist parody yes a kid film has an adult parody maybe they thought the adults would like it quite frankly it made the film even more <UNK> and crude br br here's the basic stupid plot tim dog gets the amazing <UNK> mask and turns into a cartoon dog thing when tim is paying more attention to the baby with special powers cartoon dog becomes a <UNK> <UNK> ripoff then <UNK> takes the baby with amazing powers and tim and <UNK> have a really cheesy animated fight <UNK> wearing the mask it all ends happy too bad this movie is horrible br br overall the original the mask was a fantastic jim carrey movie this basically is not please please don't rent buy or <UNK> this movie i made a terrible mistake renting this i don't want you guys to make that same exact mistake i feel horrible that i couldn't write a detailed comment but really what's there to comment on br br 2 10 i'd give it a one but come on it's basically a kid film br br recommended films the mask
<START> i'm not a big tv person but when i saw the <UNK> episode of greek i couldn't wait until next week i don't miss the show for nothing br br thank god for <UNK> lol i'm in love with he acts like a bad boy but he is so sweet everybody has their own character so we have pretty much all types of people you could still throw in a hispanic and a <UNK> persons br br i didn't go to school in usa so i never liked the idea of frat houses and stuff like that so when my husband told me about the show i didn't pay attention until he asked me to watch it and since i didn't have noting better to do i agreed i laughed so hard the first night that i just needed to keep watching it br br so i'm with the other people that voted for this show to continue on i will hope for a second third and who knows how many more episodes its a really good show very funny and entertaining
<START> please note the below text is taken from the irish dvd release some of this summary may be wrong br br edge of your seat <UNK> in which the legacy of an ancient witch and her <UNK> <UNK> causes a deserted island hotel to become the <UNK> of evil two centuries later br br when an <UNK> photographer david <UNK> <UNK> knight rider and his <UNK> fiancée linda blair the exorcist creep onto the island to research its gruesome history they are joined by an <UNK> estate agent and his <UNK> <UNK> br br gradually the group find themselves falling victim to the ancient evil that lives on in the mysterious old woman who <UNK> the hotel seeking fresh victims for satanic <UNK> human sacrifice and demon <UNK> possession br br check in at the witchcraft hotel we hope you enjoy your <UNK> br br additional info on the movies <UNK> br br violence some gruesome sexual violence very strong br br sex and or nudity some strong as well as innuendo br br bad language some strong br br other some drug use and references
<START> this movie tries to be more than it is first of all the acting is horrible you have to get past the incredibly bad delivering of lines and terrible <UNK> the plot is quite interesting a <UNK> occurs apparently because it was made out of strings and <UNK> wood and a couple of guys find themselves on shore if this weren't bad enough some guy named count de <UNK> is living there as well he lives in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane anyway he has a large slave a young woman and some dogs there's another woman who doesn't speak and his wife who is a <UNK> anyway things get bad as these men have to deal with this nut case he is arrogant and likes to pose and deliver lines the rest of the movie involves an attempt to escape it has an ironic ending which i won't reveal and it kind of <UNK> the film i wouldn't bother if i were you
<START> lord <UNK> is kiddie fare but for whose kids obviously shot for television or <UNK> this amateurish rehash <UNK> has several stock characters a magician an assassin a warrior a scientist on the trail of something or other in order to defeat the dark forces about to be unleashed on their planet badly written acted and staged in available california locations like <UNK> parks and a ranch lord <UNK> has nothing to recommend it not even as a time <UNK> jay <UNK> is the only name actor and most people especially the intended audience of five year olds are not likely to remember him from such ancient disney fare as not quite human a no name actor playing a magician in an ill fitting silver wig at least plays it with tongue planted firmly in cheek while those around him act as if they are in a dinner theater production of king <UNK> i was hoping at least for a decent action or special effects sequence alas the action sequences are <UNK> staged and the few special effects are those old fashioned painted over cartoon gags we used to see in 1950s and 1960s fantasy flicks like bert <UNK> the magic sword the filmmakers planned a sequel that mercifully never came to be often such cheap hollywood back lot productions use a combination of <UNK> and porn actors i kept myself occupied during the film's seemingly interminable running time trying to figure which was which in this one i didn't have much luck
<START> ah the sci fi channel how often do you disappoint me quite often i think do you ever show good movies ok you have given me the great <UNK> and the reasonably good 'the lost <UNK> but they are series and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say bad acting bad directing terrible characters and a shallow story and that is just for starters i checked out the director allan a and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume in fact i am half thinking that this is a pseudo name the premises of four <UNK> <UNK> out <UNK> crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come rescue them only for them to get caught in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens leading man bryan the park ranger is so bad it is terrible cast as the action hero martial arts boy in the footsteps of so many others this guy makes seagal and van damme look like de <UNK> the supporting cast are little better and well before the end one was left hoping the fire would <UNK> them all then the film crew avoid at all costs
<START> okay this movie starts out and it looks like it's going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan she has no touch with reality whatsoever outside of the soap sort of the <UNK> of the main characters in <UNK> and runs away to los angeles to meet a fictional character well it is a cute movie but at the same time it is also a dark very violent movie about two who are out to kill betty for reasons way to complex to <UNK> here either <UNK> would have been enough on it's own but nurse betty contains both stories at once and the effect is very jarring i didn't much enjoy it
<START> i saw the trailer and read some reviews and i had low expectations for this movie i was pleasantly surprised while the plot is a little off beat everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh the writing and jokes are far more <UNK> than i have come to expect better yet they are delivered with <UNK> by unknown actors doing a good job all of them br br the main reasons i wanted to see this movie were justin long and lewis black long is from ed and the new apple computer ads he was just coming into his own as an actor in ed and he was excellent here he's a natural in front of the camera lewis black is a social <UNK> who pulls no punches he's on the daily show on comedy central about once every two weeks but he really shines in <UNK> red white and screwed i regularly catch him on <UNK> <UNK> comedy channel give black an idea and let him <UNK> whether his <UNK> and lines here are scripted or improvised are no matter he's priceless delivering his thoughts on middle class angst one thing about <UNK> delivery his hand gestures are not those of a comedian it just seems like he's having a conversation with you and i think that makes him <UNK> more effective
<START> this was absolutely one of the best movies i've seen br br excellent performances from a marvelous a list cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back br br i couldn't help but care about the characters ms will blow you away as will the young man playing the young lead br br i also thought that the set design was top rate the viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented br br the music is a blast too nice <UNK> to represent mood time and place the blind blues man is <UNK> but he delivers some great songs br br this is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings take the time to watch it
<START> i nearly fell asleep during a screening of this of a boring story that seems to go on forever it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks after a <UNK> affair the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways br br the male prostitute then goes on a <UNK> self destructive spiral trying to find his one true love repeatedly returning to the same places they <UNK> looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his love br br in the meanwhile he <UNK> up with one ugly guy who i thought was also a male prostitute a gay <UNK> and some guy who ends up having a three second sexual <UNK> session with him in a back alley br br it never <UNK> to <UNK> me how films still portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants before <UNK> three times and miraculously experiencing <UNK> br br all of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them to which he <UNK> their <UNK> numbers br br there is a brief side plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle there is also another brief side plot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window and there is also one more brief side plot involving him showing the letter to a male <UNK> but the audience is not advised of his relation to this person br br none of these things really connect with each other only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is he seems to be living life like a ghost there was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him <UNK> through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the world's saddest song on it br br otherwise this movie just seems to go on forever filmed in black and white it may seem very <UNK> but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmare br br i found the ending to be confusing as i wasn't quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven that would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe but seeing as this is an independent film movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to use your imagination br br for those of you who are seeking out nudity there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are <UNK> <UNK> within the shadows in other words don't waste your time with this one br br my rating 2 out of 10
<START> i was disappointed with the third film in the death wish series and wouldn't recommend this unless you are really into bronson he is his usual self in this one maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on t v the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the a team and i like the <UNK> fun of a show like the a team but not on the big screen even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated the film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does it gets out of control to the point of <UNK> the plot is something out of an episode of highway to heaven and bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from <UNK> revenge against the bad guys skip this and go on to the 4th installment which i highly recommend
<START> the title for this review about sums up how i feel about this movie i can't imagine what audience there would be for this thing if not for the die hard fan of 1980s slasher films who simply has to see everything from that era otherwise don't even waste your time on this br br the story is similar to most films of its type something awful happens to one of the characters in the opening scene which <UNK> a <UNK> killer to go on a murderous rampage been there done that truth be told none of these '80s slashers were known for their originality so i can't see the point in <UNK> on the film simply for this br br but where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences i've seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this this one just fails to create any real suspense the director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi professional directorial touches here and there but they mean nothing if you're not frightened the gore is pretty tame as well so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool 1980s makeup effects will be sadly disappointed br br the movie manages to along rather <UNK> honestly the key <UNK> to almost any slasher is the tight pacing you have to keep things moving along <UNK> and keep the murder set pieces staged at regular <UNK> because let's face it we don't watch these things for the great characterization and stellar plots but the pacing whether due to the script or the editor is all off the murders are <UNK> out at odd <UNK> leaving us with some long <UNK> scenes no doubt meant to build character that serve only to bore you and leave you praying for the next kill which as i've said usually isn't executed all that well anyway br br as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening he or she wears a <UNK> suit a <UNK> mask and his or her primary weapon is a sword i bet the writer just wet himself over thinking he came up with an original cool murder weapon but the idea just comes off as <UNK> and silly there's also not much emphasis placed on the nature of the film as if they either forgot or don't care to place any red herrings in the mix to throw us off br br i have the sense that the people behind this were trying to make something decent and respectable and at times it shows their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film as opposed to countless other <UNK> slashers from the era but alas the attempt fails for the most part there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film there is attempt at characterization but none of it ends up meaning anything in the end so what a waste here all it manages to do is <UNK> down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they can't come soon enough br br in the end if you're really into these old '80s slashers by all means check it out if only to say you've seen it there's a <UNK> in all of us but don't expect to be blown away or anything what we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression at all
<START> thats not saying much this <UNK> film has better cinematography and is more professional looking than the last that doesn't mean it's more professional sounding that horrible last film was about gangsters killing a kid and then being haunted by a voodoo clown i thought the guy that played <UNK> in the last one was a bad actor but wow this <UNK> is honestly the downright worst actor i've seen in any movie and i've seen a lot of movies last movie the clown came in about 15 minutes in this one's shorter and the clown doesn't even come in until 40 minutes in and it's only <UNK> minutes long i give it a 2 because the acting from some characters is ok
<START> this was the first mickey mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound it was based on a silent movie called <UNK> bill jr starring buster keaton back in this early mickey short mickey did not talk nor did he have <UNK> he could just <UNK> and play music the song that he played was turkey in the straw using several <UNK> animals as musical <UNK> he plays a <UNK> teeth as a <UNK> and he plays a <UNK> <UNK> like an <UNK> keyboard captain pete however is very mad and makes mickey <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> parrot flies up to the window and orders him to <UNK> the <UNK> mickey throws a half <UNK> <UNK> at the parrot and laughs thus closing the cartoon i was able to get this cartoon on tape and i really like it i think the disney shorts are much better than the feature length movies
<START> this was an excellent movie i saw this at the <UNK> <UNK> in the czech republic and it won an award there this is the first film i've ever seen from jan the director and i was impressed it's a great story about love and family the movie has a great balance of comedy romance drama and suspense all in one i will not give away any of the plot but this is a well made film and i would watch it again if i had the chance the cinematography editing is great the film simply flows and the characters are warm and they are the kind that one can relate to i hope you can enjoy this film as i did if anyone knows where i can find this in the united states or if they plan on releasing it on dvd anytime soon please let me know
<START> steve martin has always had my respect for being a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor and i loved planes trains and <UNK> and <UNK> but bringing down the house <UNK> isn't one of <UNK> funniest works and it doesn't even seem as if it's trying to be which is just plain sad br br i don't know maybe i didn't like this movie because of the fact that i rented it along with harry potter and the chamber of secrets and phone booth both of which are excellent films or maybe it's because i'm used to so much better from martin or maybe it's just because i'm in a <UNK> bad mood today regardless this film just wasn't very funny or entertaining and i never managed more than a smile or a weak chuckle at the film's gags which is really a shame since the previews of this comedy were so promising i was expecting bringing down the house to be an all out comedy bash and i certainly expected more slapstick comedy and inter racial laughs from martin instead we're to seeing queen <UNK> <UNK> all over the screen trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character the funniest thing in this <UNK> is eugene levy but even he doesn't get the screen time he deserves br br i would've really liked to enjoy bringing down the house but i didn't and i'd find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone but the most die hard steve martin fans skip this one and rent planes trains and <UNK> instead br br you'll have a much better time
<START> what a truly moronic movie all i can say is the writer must be very fond of magic <UNK> and <UNK> because this must be the result of one of his br br you follow the whole movie thinking alright this is very weird but hey i'm sure at the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all of this only to be disappointed to find <UNK> no there's no explanation at all and the twist at the end makes it even more confusing at the end of the movie you'll probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in a <UNK> paying for you <UNK> and the <UNK> told you that'll be 11 95 please and <UNK> to <UNK> you in the balls for no apparent reason there are so many factors in this movie that go unexplained and i think it leaves it to the imagination of the viewer in an entirely bizarre way don't get me wrong i like weird movies 'the could easily be described as weird and twisted but in my eyes it's a brilliant movie despite casting j lo who i dislike to the maximum even that didn't manage to <UNK> my opinion this isn't one of those movies and i think you should take in to consideration the characters of those who praise this movie i can tell you they are probably the sort of people that would go to an art <UNK> see a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> on a white board and say <UNK> what a masterpiece the artist has truly found a unique way to portray eternity when in actual fact all it is is bird <UNK> on a board br br keep that last bit in mind when watching this movie br br thanks for reading
<START> this was on showtime the other night and i figured it was going to be another made for video crap fest like earth vs the spider or any of those other hbo horror shorts instead i found a comedy gore classic it was <UNK> funny and surprisingly the acting was quite good even my wife an overall horror <UNK> agreed and was laughing at parts in addition the fx were high quality br br overall the film felt like a parody of joy ride <UNK> <UNK> and the 2 main characters reminded me of the pair from shaun of the dead definitely worth watching but don't take it seriously br br the end
<START> if you love movies about <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> around with a top hats and while <UNK> off random line of poetry while stabbing their victims then this is the movie for you br br if you like movies where it looks like the whole thing was shot with a camcorder and when people get <UNK> their internal organs are made out of baked <UNK> an <UNK> this movie is even more for you br br and if you simply love movies where the acting and dialogue sucks so much that it makes you feel dead inside then for god's sake run to the video store right now and buy this movie right now hurry go before it sells out
<START> awful in a whole new way anything but love probably should be seen by movie buffs if only as a <UNK> measure that proves all that can go wrong with a vanity production i am guessing a vanity production since there is no other reason on god's green earth to cast as talent free and not particularly attractive non singer actress as <UNK> gold in the leading lady role for yet by the likes of <UNK> like cameron <UNK> and andrew mccarthy except that she also helped write this bizarre little movie her singing leaves much to be desired and yet unbelievable as it is all the other characters in the film think she's terrific there are a few moments here of actual charm or humor but very few otherwise this is a silly sad fiasco that <UNK> from paint by numbers to paint by wrong numbers you know how it is when people look at a piece of modern art and someone says my kid could do better than that well this is a movie the likes of which your or anyone's kid might do better
<START> having finally been able to get the dvd of this 1997 hbo film is at down to watch it by the time i finished it the old saying those who can not learn from the past are doomed to <UNK> it was <UNK> in the mind first shown four years after the first bombing of the twin towers and four years before the events of 9 11 path to paradise reveals the series of close encounters <UNK> and official in decisions that led to the first bombing of the twin towers and the lessons we should have learned from them br br path to paradise features a nice cast of believable actors peter <UNK> and <UNK> gay <UNK> lead the cast as fbi agents john and nancy <UNK> who face not only the <UNK> of terrorism but the lack of official interest from their superiors along with their <UNK> counterpart lou <UNK> paul art <UNK> <UNK> shaun and tony <UNK> are among those who plan and carry out the attack all of whom play their roles not as potential clichés but as real living people and make the film all the better for it of special mention is ned <UNK> as <UNK> the man whom if it had not been for skeptical fbi officials could have potentially informed on the plot br br the film is also well produced despite being made for cable this film doesn't feel like a low budget film at all with its production values particularly in its sets and new york city locations the film's fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style at times when all of these elements are combined with the script it all helps to give the film a sense of reality which makes the events taking place all the more disturbing br br the most disturbing thing about he film is its script the events of the film are true minus some dramatic license which is always necessary and in <UNK> are made even more shocking then they must have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago the film reveals just how a group of men were able to <UNK> a bomb into the world trade center they did so thanks to the lack of <UNK> <UNK> government <UNK> failing to pass information to each other the fbi ignoring leads from a source and police <UNK> being unable to pick up on clues worse then <UNK> to connect <UNK> is the fact that many of these same things not only allowed the 9 11 attacks to take place but in some cases such as the lack of <UNK> are issues that continue even today even more chilling is the ending which really did happen and looks all too <UNK> today br br path to paradise is a film that should be essential viewing today the film is not only well acted and produced but teaches us a lesson we should have learned sooner the lesson of the film that those who can not learn from the past are doomed to <UNK> it if you can find this film then watch it and learn from it
<START> contains spoilers br br but if you weren't dropped on the head as a child and then used as a football then you'll agree with me that this is one of the worst and yet hilarious series ever made round a woman who as a young girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother she spends her time drawing but wait for it then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime therefore being drawn by pain so clever the story itself is actually ok but it's just how it's done jesse the writer and director has no idea how to write a script just listen to a monologue featuring the 8 year old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30 year old man while her dad who sports a great <UNK> just walks around the house all day while looking angry just showing how bad the characterisation is especially the bit where he gets angry in the first episode and begins repeating the phrase no more while holding his wife's head before killing her using the <UNK> work surface the following bang sound effect and just his terrible acting as all he can convey is angry just is brilliant including after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all done with him <UNK> and looking angry in slow motion the episodes themselves could contain easily a good clean script ranging over 5 minutes but oh no jesse doesn't want this little jesse is out post <UNK> as if he'd just eaten <UNK> <UNK> and then himself to death pointless camera <UNK> all at weird angles overly repeated lines and even pointless sequences just muddled up every now and again to fill the overlong episodes in conclusion the idea isn't bad it's just how it's done also there is a great character of a fat guy on a <UNK> who doesn't come up enough and is great i just wanna hug his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cause they look so soft the character development is non existent as the main character just says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head although they all <UNK> one another but all in all mainly s t br br indiana jones 4 however is much better type into you tube as well the results may make you <UNK> at the beauty of the world also you'll hear a lot of cheap sex jokes mostly gay ones

<START> at the same time john russell was playing ranch owner nathan trying to free his no good brother claude <UNK> from sheriff john wayne in <UNK> bravo he was working the other side of the law on television these years were probably the high point of <UNK> career his most noted screen role and his most famous television role <UNK> dan <UNK> of <UNK> in <UNK> br br russell kept law and order in <UNK> the same way that james <UNK> did it in dodge city on <UNK> unlike <UNK> <UNK> never developed the all the minor characters that gave you the feel of dodge city at the time instead it concentrated on russell taking care of business and learning the business of law to his eager young deputy peter brown br br brown played deputy johnny <UNK> who was a most <UNK> young man constantly referring to his boss as mr <UNK> he was pretty handy with a shooting iron but was inclined to be <UNK> good thing <UNK> <UNK> was around br br the other series regular was the kitty russell of <UNK> lily played by <UNK> castle this is where <UNK> most <UNK> <UNK> there was an <UNK> understanding between russell and castle that even the smallest of children couldn't have missed and i wasn't the smallest of children when <UNK> was in first run br br sadly <UNK> castle developed substance abuse problems after run ended i remember a small <UNK> marked her passing in the first half of the seventies she was one beautiful woman br br <UNK> was good no nonsense western from that golden era of the adult television western it was one of the best
<START> this is another sci fi channel original movie staring rhys davies where its hard to decide whats worse the acting or the writing directing producing john <UNK> all three basic story obsessed captures monster <UNK> it in a <UNK> <UNK> aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins clichéd sci fi cast of the <UNK> captain with the beautiful daughter handsome hero and mad scientist <UNK> calls in a terrorist alert for the ship since of course wouldn't believe a monster story no dramatic helicopter drop of the navy <UNK> here budget only allowed for entire force force of eight <UNK> to arrive in a fishing boat and ride a ships <UNK> aboard <UNK> also cheesy computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer i also loved when the seal commander looking thru standard <UNK> from ten miles away was able to see three people jump of the ship if the sci fi channel is going to continue original movies i hope they realize there audience is not <UNK> level and purchase better scripts and directors if this were direct to video you would find it in the 99 <UNK> bin
<START> this is another one of hitchcock's highest rated movies and rightfully so this is a tale of two men who meet on a train and <UNK> exchange murder fantasies one of them robert walker takes it seriously and this leads guy haines <UNK> granger to trouble with the law another fast moving hitchcock movie with lots of great scenes the <UNK> scene and the <UNK> match are worthy of mentioning not a movie to be missed it is a shame that no one will re release this on dvd with loads of extras just a cheap warner brothers dvd is all thats out there now
<START> i <UNK> agree more than with the comment left by and how this film is a masterpiece i have never seen a film that had my <UNK> flowing that this film did and that mostly happened when bronson comes running out a fire escape with like an m 60 and <UNK> down like 20 dude from a gang it's genius quite possibly the best action movie ever made no exaggeration either it really could be the best action movie ever made from the start one should know that you re in for something sweet when the police let bronson go and tell him tell him to clean up the <UNK> once again genius and once again bronson is a bad ass paul is just as cool maybe even <UNK> than john <UNK> or the terminator he's just simply a bad ass and what else is great is the fact that he's a nice guy and buys a kid some ice cream and helps out an old couple all before he kills some <UNK> bag genius highly recommended if you hate this movie you're crazy
<START> what <UNK> me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of this film does not contain one <UNK> element if by you refer to pathetic action scenes overacting <UNK> in violence blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief then is something swedish film can do without br br how <UNK> and <UNK> can agree to <UNK> in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me and how eva <UNK> after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast tv promoting it just disappoints me br br this film doesn't contain a story the script is illogical stiff and last but not least just plain bad these two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boy fantasy containing violence comic <UNK> and <UNK> psychological <UNK> i wouldn't be surprised if the scene of <UNK> <UNK> in the kitchen over a <UNK> wave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two <UNK> cinematic <UNK> that pose as directors br br i wouldn't show this movie to my worst enemy
<START> i have seen about five or six episodes of this stupid show and most of them i was forced to watch and i did not like the episodes i saw what happened to dan schneider after giving us such awesome shows like drake and josh why did he decide to create a stupid show like this my problem is not just with dan it is also with the guys who nominated this show for an emmy were they drunk that day or what's the problem drake and josh didn't get nominated for an emmy but it's way better than <UNK> 101 the makers of this show should be ashamed for the existence of this show let's just hope the <UNK> of you know who will affect the show or better yet it'll cause it to get canceled
<START> oh yes hollywood does remember how to use the good old formula and when lightning hits it's a rather wonderful feeling rarely hollywood creates a masterpiece because lately there seems to be more concern with <UNK> up and getting the most <UNK> in a <UNK> manner or there is the matter of too many <UNK> in the mix usually good screenplays are the result of a talented writer who is in full control of his her property understand his material and is a good writer then there is a little important part often neglected by the marketing geniuses that so often lack creativity and vision a good actor br br a good actor can make the difference between a mediocre half <UNK> try and a fully realized film that might not be an important and relevant movie but one that contributes to its genre and might eventually become a classic of its type we get very few romantic comedies and we are people who are <UNK> for them buried in the sexy humor of sex in the city is the romantic yet <UNK> relationship of big and carrie and people <UNK> to <UNK> because it had some romance <UNK> played by streep and it could have a silly musical but it did touch us because it was played with intensity and conviction nights offers us more of it with the amazing talents of a woman who does magnificent work in romantic films ms diane lane ever since her days as a child actor we could appreciate how her talent combined with her <UNK> soul allowed us to see into the hearts of the story's protagonists a few years back she teamed up with mr gere giving us a tormented romantic and sexy performance as the wife who is not too sure of her consequences in <UNK> work that should have garnered her at least an academy award she is back doing more <UNK> work in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up on her romantic <UNK> and suddenly she realizes there might be another chance around the corner br br ms lane makes this film <UNK> with intelligence and passion her facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions her character <UNK> we can read <UNK> <UNK> desperation anger hope loss and a range that is way out reach for a lot of the <UNK> types that hollywood constantly push down our throats here is a mature performer who has the gift to project real emotions and allows us to connect with the material in such a way that we are moved as we become part of the experience br br ms lane is such a <UNK> joy to watch as she goes through <UNK> from the first scenes of the film until the very end her <UNK> become <UNK> as we celebrate with her the power of hope and love she is able to bring back the <UNK> joy of a person in love much like a teenager does and yet she never lets you think of her character as silly or irresponsible her eyes are <UNK> gems that can move even the cynical in the audience she is one of the stars that can do wonders with just one look in her the classic feel of those grand movies of yesterday are back her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of hepburn davis <UNK> women who played everyday types and made them memorable because they created complete characters br br we admire those superb actresses who recreate real life legends and are rewarded for it half their work is done by the <UNK> of the figures they <UNK> however as much as anyone might make you think it is the roles such as <UNK> in this movie that are a more impressive achievement because they are created from scratch given a personal <UNK> and are able achieve heights without any previous theatrical material support such as plays and the background of a famous legend whose life is paid tribute on the silver screen <UNK> character is one woman whose experiences could be any of us she represents our dreams and emotions with much quality class and just the right amount of sentiment it is quite a remarkable achievement and we should be grateful that we are still able to find such a remarkable performance nowadays br br there are a few <UNK> i could use to pay tribute to her work but i can only say that in my humble opinion every single frame of her work in this film is testament to one of the greatest performances ever put on celluloid by a living performer thank you ms lane
<START> i don't really know where to start here just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from the acting to the props to the story that it makes you angry this is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and that is saying a lot because i have seen some bad ones when i saw this movie i knew it was a blade knock off but i thought that hey its got kung fu and vampires a combination that i thought could not fail that is until i popped this into my dvd player how ron hall managed to mess up something as cool as vampires and martial arts is beyond me first the acting i didn't expect to much here to begin with because its an action movie and a b one at that but the acting here is so bad i couldn't help but be bothered by it expressions and vocal tones were way out of place there was absolutely no emotion in almost the entire film and when there was it was so laughable it thought i was watching mad tv for example that <UNK> man scream derek lets out when he has to kill master <UNK> who should have never been born in the first place all in all i've seen better acting at <UNK> school plays then there is the action not even sub par compared to the things that have been done in action cinema as of late but still the action was not a total let down as ron hall does seem to <UNK> some martial arts skills but even the skill he does have is over <UNK> by the stupid things he does for instance the part of the movie where he starts spinning and then the camera changes i almost ripped a <UNK> in half and the fight scene where his prison buddy fights off vampires by swinging his arms at them wow or how about the part in the jail where derek all of a sudden knows magic and can <UNK> <UNK> that make tap water holy water and as far as the props go the guns look like <UNK> toys the teeth were stolen from halloween costumes and words cant describe how bad the cg graphics are i could go on for hours about all the things wrong with this movie and trust me this is just the tip of the iceberg its only getting a 2 because it made me laugh even though i was laughing at how badly the movie was done a laugh is a laugh i would say steer clear of vampire assassin unless you want to laugh at a horrible movie or are planning on getting tortured for long periods of time and want to practice
<START> three <UNK> are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men the three <UNK> take revenge which <UNK> to a murder after another supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people br br the plot has too many holes the details were ignored in order to move the story forward the acting was uneven the color balance was awful even though i watched this movie in dvd the small budget and tight schedule were apparent the whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight and the ending was just unbelievable
<START> as a note i'd like to say that i saw this movie at my <UNK> church camp where the entire youth group laughed at it i bought it when i saw it on a shelf one year later if only for the humor i derived from a bad attempt at making an <UNK> movie br br lay it down falls short of many movie <UNK> expectations on several different planes most of the problems lie within the <UNK> acting regardless of the nice cars in the film or the truth in <UNK> sacrifice for you as a movie and witnessing tool lay it down hardly delivers br br most good opinions of the movies are supported by christians <UNK> with the message while it's easy for a christian to agree with the points delivered the audience hardly ever witnesses life outside a cliché the fighting scene between ben and his brother is horribly dubbed and there are at least three blatant <UNK> in the subtitles br br i encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director's commentary on it really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was the director's views on <UNK> society are practically opposite of what would <UNK> to a movie needs he shows a <UNK> understanding of as well as some points of religious conflict most of the editing he admits was rushed but satisfactory he thought the over used transitions and themes to be effective and was completely happy with the acting br br he also inserted <UNK> that he was rather proud of all read most of the names are significant ben <UNK> been destined gus <UNK> man <UNK> d <UNK> the car doing <UNK> is symbolic of the <UNK> <UNK> that is a life without christ when ben leaves on <UNK> motorcycle he crosses his <UNK> to form a cross br br i'm not making any of those up he throws around things like this in between saying while street <UNK> and the like blow their brains out with guns and how god is in control when your born and when your die yes that was not a <UNK> he really says that br br i have little forgiveness reserved for this movie the cool cars and good message don't do jack to make this movie good however the movie was made from a group of <UNK> individuals on a budget less than 1 <UNK> of the fast and the <UNK> and the time limit was <UNK> with that in mind i give it a score of 2 10 instead of the 1 10 i so <UNK> think it deserves
<START> i'd chose either over this film this film has been in my must see list for a while because people talked about it being disturbing and also the vhs box contains lots and lots of quotes from people saying how amazing it is or how as close as you can get to texas chainsaw massacre and lines like that but sorry folks i was disappointed big time the idea is interesting but the script is so underdeveloped that each character becomes a mistaken creation of evolution and people do indeed to the dumbest films in the film br br that in turn takes away any credibility that the plot may have otherwise had i couldn't believe how unnecessarily <UNK> some where is he let's find him sequences were a few gory moments to please the gore fan but they are so few that by the time we get to them there's no point if <UNK> a geek then the filmmakers must really be down on the food chain
<START> perhaps the director was trying for another pirate good garland and kelly musical but this lame musical <UNK> falls flat sinatra and kathryn voices do not blend well and their chemistry together lacks spark the premise of sinatra as a sweet guy who tries to <UNK> his late father is okay but he seems awkward in the role what's amazing and wonderful here is how sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special his <UNK> and <UNK> as a singer make you want to hear it again when grayson sings the same songs it's hard to believe she's not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting she has her big moment with love is where you find it which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities the photography is and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets co stars mildred <UNK> and j <UNK> <UNK> put lots of energy into making the impossible work aside from sinatra's singing there is a strange <UNK> a dance with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and ann miller it's fascinating and weird <UNK> and <UNK> were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real <UNK>

<START> what i've seen of <UNK> <UNK> films has been pretty good he knows how to direct action create suspense and get you interested eastwood tends to be great sometimes excellent this goes for both his acting and his directing they both hand in solid work here the concept isn't bad and the cat and mouse game works well <UNK> performs rather well and his and eastwood's playing off each other adds to the film i suppose this won't introduce anything new really but it never really claims to nor needs to it's two great actors each playing a basic type of role that they have proved at other points in their careers that they can manage remarkably well and with a magnificent director at the <UNK> really it's entertaining well done and it just plain delivers editing and cinematography are good acting and character writing is as well the film manages to be suspenseful and intense and if you let yourself you will probably be entertained and engaged even if there are superior films out there the pacing is pretty much spot on i recommend this to any fan of the principal actors the director and or this type of film 7 10
<START> <UNK> day was released in may 1981 during the height of the slasher film <UNK> earlier that year fans had been subjected to flicks like my bloody valentine just before dawn friday the 13th part 2 and the burning and theaters still were expecting flicks such as halloween ii the <UNK> and happy birthday to me i have seen all of these films and out of all the popular 1981 slashers <UNK> day is by far the worst br br what <UNK> day amounts to is an exercise in poor low budget film making with bad acting bad writing pointless characters pointless scenes <UNK> nudity cheesy dialogue and an experiment in editing that didn't work so well and who could forget the classic 80's disco music that plays throughout the film the opening <UNK> music is only <UNK> by the music that plays during a chase scene however when renting a movie like this a person should be aware that those details will be in this film so why isn't <UNK> day considered a classic like halloween friday the 13th a nightmare on elm street my bloody valentine the burning or prom night why do fans still seek those films but disregard this without care br br where slasher films need to succeed above all other areas is in the pacing there is nothing worse than a slow moving slasher and <UNK> day moves pretty slow the most <UNK> part is that there are plenty of opportunities to speed things up there are numerous pointless characters who are introduced and who are never allowed the chance to be a suspect in the murders or be a victim there's a sleazy teacher a <UNK> principal a cunning secretary a dopey school security guard a clueless detective an alcoholic step father a mindless grandmother and a mom to an earlier victim still <UNK> all of these characters could have a motive to killing or a reason to getting killed but they are all wasted the worst part is that the story still focuses on them and at times <UNK> entire scenes just to flesh out their character but for what br br what does <UNK> me about <UNK> day and its small <UNK> is that people aren't more amazed by the death scenes fans go wild for death scenes like the raft massacre in the burning the <UNK> machine death in my bloody valentine the <UNK> death in happy birthday to me the upside down death in friday the 13th part 3 and hot <UNK> death in halloween ii and even the car hood death in madman but where is the respect for some truly unique even though cheesy deaths in <UNK> day one victim gets <UNK> right through the <UNK> with a <UNK> sword while another gets that sword thrown at them like a <UNK> the best death includes <UNK> under a landing <UNK> why aren't these deaths famous among the genre like the deaths in more popular slasher films br br <UNK> day tries hard to be a great and unique film but there is just an element of logic and pacing missing that really ruins the whole experience its not the worst of its kind try checking out don't go in the woods alone and there is a bit of suspense plus it delivers just what fans are looking for blood gore nudity sex and nostalgia but <UNK> day will not be remembered as one of the all time greatest slasher films ever made it's not a question of budget almost all slashers have a low budget however it is a question of ideas creativity and <UNK> that's all any type of movie making is br br recommended for hardcore slasher fans general horror fans might get a little bored and people who don't have much interest in horror at all should steer clear it's not the worst slasher film ever made but its a long way from being the best
<START> this straight to video cheap flick is based on a true story i don't doubt it doesn't mean it's particularly interesting unless you are one of the main characters who actually lived though this experience a young woman named angela buys a great big old country home really really cheap well as we all know from watching horror movies when you buy a big house cheap it usually means it's haunted in some way shape or form in fact the second the house is being handed over to angela the wise guy kid who lived in the house up to now takes a moment to introduce angela to one of the ghosts nice guy huh angela gets in touch with a psychic and a <UNK> expert and tells them that her house is haunted and invites them to come over and see the ghosts for themselves they come to a party and sure enough there are ghosts walking around sitting on the couch hanging in the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom a few friends sleep over the night of the party see the ghosts and <UNK> never to come back in the house again check out the girl who i'm so scared i'm so scared totally <UNK> if she was so scared why didn't she get up turn the <UNK> and leave the ghosts don't really do anything menacing aside from show up and there is no or aura about them they look just like regular people they steal <UNK> from the kitchen move <UNK> around a la <UNK> and one <UNK> female ghost <UNK> angela who get this doesn't seem to mind this scene plays like the kind of soft core porn you see on the spice channel <UNK> not that i'd know <UNK> the actresses aren't your typical porn stars though they should hit the beach and the gym more when not making love to the dead she gets mad at them and stands alone in a room screaming why won't you leave this is my house get out they don't leave i couldn't help but think of all the times i've heard psychic sylvia brown on tv saying that if you have a ghost in your house you should <UNK> <UNK> with the ghost and say look you're dead it's time to cross over to the other side in other words get out according to sylvia brown as long as your not hostile and nasty about it they'll leave this movie looks like it cost about 50 to make it has a really cheap feel and bad acting i could have made this movie with 5 friends and a camcorder
<START> every once in awhile i'll remember that i've actually seen this bizarre fiasco that's a cross between whatever happened to baby jane sunset <UNK> the <UNK> turner <UNK> movie the big cube and the <UNK> murders which also took place in 1969 but maybe before this so called movie was made there are some <UNK> of the plot already here so i won't go into it but it's worth noting that <UNK> hopkins plays a parody of herself a <UNK> ego <UNK> <UNK> actress perhaps she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the bette davis horrors the old gal hopkins never stopped working so you have to hand it to her she shows a little too much flesh in this movie something davis and crawford would never have done and there's a scene with <UNK> in the actual tacky hollywood <UNK> christmas parade which must have been filmed <UNK> 1968 br br <UNK> is old old old it's just shocking how <UNK> and awful she looks john garfield jr looks a bit like his father but not as interesting i think one of the three stooges is the tour guide at the beginning if it's not one of the stooges it's somebody br br i was <UNK> to come across this thing in the form of a commercial <UNK> given to me by a friend who knows all about junk like this it's amazing
<START> what a waste john travolta and scarlett <UNK> deserved better than this to start at the beginning <UNK> was horribly miscast in the lead here the role called for someone who could convince as a broken down anti hero someone who could look haunted and defeated billy bob <UNK> would have fit the bill or even al pacino but <UNK> is just too alive and looks to be having too much fun also surely someone who has been through the mill to the extent character had would have suffered some physical effects the character presented to the audience looked as if he could start as tight end for the <UNK> <UNK> scarlett <UNK> little better role wise where was the pain and conflict of what should surely have been <UNK> development and as for the plot well none of it makes sense the characters leap from one frame of mind to another seemingly without cause and certainly without explanation the pace of the film also leaves something to be desired namely pace this is a very slow film not that i have anything against slow films as long as they are heading somewhere the pace only picks up towards the very end when it shifts from a slow <UNK> to a frantic race to pack in as many tired clichés as possible in this it succeeds the only thing missing being something involving a small dog 3 out of 10 for this one purely for gabriel performance he was the only member of the cast who was a well cast and b able to convince in his role all in all a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a couple of hours
<START> here in australia nights in is being promoted in the same class as the <UNK> quite frankly what a lot of <UNK> br br this film is a like a recipe on paper we have all the right ingredients richard gere normally perfect in this genre diane lane an old favourite from under <UNK> sun and <UNK> ocean side location <UNK> and yet the movie sucks at the session we went to yesterday afternoon a women next to my wife fell asleep and half way through the movie got up and left the main problem is there is no build up or credibility to the relationship in the first place and perhaps there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like <UNK> that gere and <UNK> characters bring to the movie there's hours of those balanced out with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can to see romance there's no warmth from <UNK> character lane looks dreadful at the start of the movie and all washed out so as the viewer we cannot really connect to the characters br br others here say the book is great well be it the screenplay direction or production someone here has made a real mess of this movie it's like the scenes and the <UNK> are a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order they've just been thrown together all over the place br br very disappointing save your money for when it hits the video <UNK> and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to the weekly rate
<START> hello i was wondering if anyone has a copy of the movie broken promise i loved this movie growing up and watched it every time it was on it has been years since i have seen it and would love to get a copy i have checked all of the internet and have been unable to find it if anyone has a copy to trade or sell em please email me at <UNK> com thank you and have a great night christine the broken promise was made to eleven year old melissa whose parents have deserted her and her siblings taken in by the county has had to watch <UNK> as her brothers and sisters are split up and out to different families one of the kids is even <UNK> juvenile court officer chris sarandon joins in her struggle to reunite her family under one roof broken promise was originally offered as a general <UNK> golden showcase presentation it was first <UNK> may 5 1981
<START> hello it is i <UNK> cannon and i welcome you to the first ever review show my movie for this week was <UNK> what route what movie what excellent four star epic would i choose guess what i decided to pull a one <UNK> and go the other route i've decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept the movie i will review today is jack frost two revenge of the mutant killer snowman the stars in this movie include christopher <UNK> as sam <UNK> <UNK> as anne <UNK> clark as <UNK> david allen brooks as agent manners sean patrick murphy as captain fun ray <UNK> as the colonel and scott macdonald as the killer snowman himself jack frost br br it's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny jack frost loved the <UNK> scene but it's even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast the movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and captain fun was introduced what was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie the only possible reason i could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder sam seemed more paranoid then he did in the original his <UNK> about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display i had seen in a movie his wife however was one of the few bright spots she played her role as the main woman to a <UNK> she was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy the scene where she figures out how to kill the <UNK> was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie ray macdonald once again did a great job as jack frost despite what he was given if it wasn't for such weak characters he could have been <UNK> like <UNK> freddy and jason laugh if you must but when it comes down to it jack frost had <UNK> he had humor and most importantly he had an vicious streak br br this movie could have been so much more it could have been a <UNK> of a great franchise instead any plans to make a jack frost three have been canceled br br this movie gets a two out of ten for me and it's lucky that it even gets a one
<START> i watched this as part of a vampire movie marathon with research intent otherwise there is no way i'd have watched it all the way through the first scene <UNK> a bunch of vampires in very bad <UNK> seemingly get <UNK> by various slow moving weapons <UNK> by an even slower moving van <UNK> wannabe in black and white with a voice over sets the pace for the entire rest of the film the fight scenes look ridiculous the <UNK> would be funny if the acting wasn't so bad what passes for plot doesn't make sense and the production values bite from the knock off of <UNK> coat worn by the hero to the cheesy cheap <UNK> cape their lead <UNK> <UNK> around br br i've seen some bad movies check out the magic sword with b <UNK> or the <UNK> with a very young jack n but this one gets my vote for worst of all times
<START> this is a funny intelligent and in a sense realistic comedy about a 14 year old trying to live her first love while on vacation and also about the complex sometimes amusing sometimes touching relation between a divorced father and her growing daughter and about how far a women not only nicole the teen <UNK> can go to get the man she loves i laughed a lot with this lively scenario that never drags
<START> countless historical cultural mistakes 0 10 br br 1 a jewish guy named omar <UNK> 2 brilliant detective was taking out by the least intelligent guy in the movie 3 jewish suicide <UNK> that was funny 4 hitler and his top guns went to watch a movie downtown paris with two guards at the door shoot me 5 brad pitt <UNK> and it was painful to watch him 6 mr <UNK> is re writing history hitler was killed in a really the funny thing about this is that people and i mean stupid people will actually believe this plot br br and finally can any one tell me how this movie made it to the top 250 movies of all time shame shame shame still wondering how can anyone like this movie
<START> <UNK> british film from a japanese novel about a very troubled young man who comes under the influence of a hitler like <UNK> and plots to harm his widowed mother's lover a couple of good scenes sarah miles discovering her son has been <UNK> at her and confronts him in anger the <UNK> faced <UNK> trying to <UNK> kris kristofferson to his demise by being extra friendly but what's the point beyond provoking shock ugly and uneasy it doesn't showcase anyone involved to any advantage especially kristofferson whose hollow stares and usual <UNK> talk is out of place in a psychological <UNK> like this one <UNK> without any sense of its own absurdity director lewis john seems to believe a <UNK> like this could actually happen if he's right that's far more shocking than anything in sailor from
<START> horrible movie this movie beat out revenge of the living zombies for the worst movie i have ever suffered through what the were the morons who made this film thinking was it supposed to be scary because man let me tall you it wasn't it was so dumb it wasn't funny we all know that <UNK> islands are the natural hunting grounds for killer <UNK> and those stupid baby <UNK> stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid fake snow and lousy actors oh and frost looks nothing like he does on the box do not waste your time rent it and destroy it
<START> this short was director del <UNK> last and only <UNK> short the problem it was quite weak and the <UNK> scene was pretty much a <UNK> copy of a curly short busy buddies 1944 the <UNK> scene was pretty funny and the beginning part of the <UNK> part but there are a lot of <UNK> in this short for example why are the stooges hiding in the garbage can when the police come in the remake of cash and <UNK> 1955 director jules white <UNK> this and the reason for the stooges hiding in the garbage can is because there is a <UNK> between the police and the <UNK> car robbers the scene in which moe is having trouble with the <UNK> was done before with curly in <UNK> but dumb 1941 the spooky house part wasn't all that great except for the hilarious scene on the outside of the spooky house to top it off the ending had no <UNK> to it rating c
<START> the united states of <UNK> was an amazing movie i kept passing it on the guide on my tv not knowing what it was and never having the chance to sit there and get into it then one morning when i woke up early i saw that it was just about to start so i decided to watch it i had the time and interest to watch it when i saw that ryan <UNK> was in the movie and then that he was the main character i was immediately sucked in and could not move from my couch the struggle that <UNK> goes through is such an inspiring story everyone has to deal with the same type of thoughts throughout sometime in their life whether it be a small minor detail or something as big as what he's going through i have to sit and watch the movie again just to catch all the stuff that i may have missed the first time around as a general comment i would recommend this movie to anyone who is a <UNK> fan or anyone who just likes a good movie with a real good story the fact that there are so many other big stars who all also had great performances is just an added bonus so do what you can to take the time to check out this movie i can almost be sure it won't be a waste of time
<START> first of all let us discuss about the story it is a copy of the movie <UNK> with an added indian flavor to it one guy who is a love guru and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it comes to ladies and how this seemingly sucker becomes a <UNK> with the help of the love guru forms the story salman khan is the love guru and govinda is the lame guy br br now coming to <UNK> performance salman khan overacts throughout the movie he tries to be funny but fails big time you can see salman shouting throughout the movie no real acting is seen in his performance govinda <UNK> opposite <UNK> <UNK> oh my god she is one heck of a girl a real beauty is in real life a 50 year old dude and <UNK> is a girl in her early <UNK> in the movie govinda looks like grandpa of <UNK> <UNK> what a pity coming to execution of the movie this movie feels like a b movie and a poor imitation of the movie <UNK> where <UNK> looks like a movie with a purpose and depth this movie is shallow and <UNK> nowhere there is justification or clarity br br just forget this movie for it is nothing but boring typical bollywood fare actually i give 3 10 because this is the lowest i go
<START> okay i think we're all agreed that michael jackson was the low point br br and the special effects too but please keep in mind that this was not a big budget film okay not every film gets as much of a budget as harry potter or star wars br br however i thought it was pretty funny altogether b nothing that would in my opinion waste your time br br parodies are always fun to watch and just because it wasn't big budget doesn't mean it's bad br br i think this was a good movie if weak at some points br br hope this comment helps angela
<START> may contain spoilers for about the last four years i've been a keen fan of ali g <UNK> baron cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and in my view his best creation is <UNK> who's as funny as hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to people br br anyway to the movie i didn't bother paying money to see this in the cinema i suppose because i didn't expect a lot but when i hired the dvd recently i found the whole thing pretty sad the best part of taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful <UNK> all the car <UNK> together to blow a safe really br br this movie goes to show i think that some things can run for too long and definitely don't translate to the big screen the movie also had that <UNK> sweet ending that i've come to expect from british films where have all the good british movie making ideals gone to that said there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in bed and audience with <UNK> the q with the <UNK> <UNK> respect remark br br so in summary i am an ali g and <UNK> fan and i have enjoyed many of his interviews notably the one with anita of the body shop but this movie fell really flat with me if there's to be another movie i hope it's a whole lot better than this lot of old tripe br br br br australia
<START> this movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie thought of two or three funny possibilities hired a good cast then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director the director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark artsy film weird camera angles blue <UNK> shots lingering close up looks at <UNK> steve was good as always ben affleck was charming sweet almost shy he was perfect for a romantic comedy sandra <UNK> <UNK> along <UNK> with a character who was supposed to be zany but whose <UNK> consisted of things like <UNK> kissing a husband she hated <UNK> her child going on carnival rides offering to strip for money and a ride with a fellow <UNK> passenger the script had very few funny lines there was no physical comedy it was boring it introduced potentially funny situations then cut them off before they could develop to top it all off the twist at the end was a slap in the face to anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy if you saw the trailer for the movie and liked it as i did my advice is don't go to the movie it will only spoil a nice trailer
<START> this movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book as written by <UNK> this was a clean cut tale of <UNK> in the <UNK> and it would have made a grand motion also it would have been very simple to make all the action takes place aboard ship and on a deserted island unfortunately the screen writers took the title from then threw the rest of the book away even the name of the main character was changed and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel it's a sad loss for one who loves a good sea story
<START> this movie had potential if it had been handled differently what it needed was a different director that's certain and perhaps a different leading lady i just can't understand the <UNK> driver character or at least how she played it she was completely unbelievable i cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either she was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do i am writing this as i am still watching it i'm thinking i would have hated to be in her shoes trying to <UNK> something i didn't understand well we've just <UNK> to the affair she begins with the son i'm still watching i'm now beginning to be profoundly embarrassed for everyone involved in this enterprise if you enjoy watching movies that miss their mark in a big way then watch this one
<START> had the league been <UNK> <UNK> this script the <UNK> would simply have turned around and said no you're not having the money this is dreadful as a fan of the league of gentlemen this is their <UNK> outing to date not particularly funny not particularly entertaining there are few laugh out loud moments they do exist but they are few and far between i felt the format was tired and really dragging the film refers to the writers being bored of the characters and it shows as for being a film i felt the <UNK> special had better production value the fx are generally pretty poor and it is clearly obvious that they didn't film in the original <UNK> <UNK> they filmed this on the cheap in ireland the musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible also the accents of the characters were largely off from their tv <UNK> <UNK> and edward much underused again just didn't sound like themselves disappointing really because i was hoping for something far more entertaining this really was the equivalent of the 1970s comedies where the cast go to spain
<START> why why why on earth no one tells the truth about this horrible horrible movie i still wake up in the morning and ask god why he didn't stopped me from seeing this revolting comedy i cant believe i paid to see this offense to my cinematographic taste i'm starting to think that the 5 stars it has is because of martha 's nudity and all the men who cant buy a porn film and avoid seeing this i will call it thing cause call it film is an insult to the mexican film industry the characters are a huge cliché the acting causes <UNK> laugh and the script is well i cant believe a human being wrote this and just when you thought you've been tortured enough the last half hour is so painful that i wished to ripped my eyes out the only good thing i can say about this abomination is that it only last 90 minutes that would feel like centuries but still really avoid the pain
<START> this movie is not worth seeing at least not at a cinema the story is hard to follow and understand it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier it's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just is so bad weird that it sometimes seems like it american <UNK> and lights on swedish police cars is just one example the acting of <UNK> and <UNK> is good as usual but i think jenny acting as <UNK> acts very poor <UNK> acts pretty well she's not been seen as an actor in swedish movies for a long time if you still want to see it wait until it's released on dvd or is shown on tv
<START> this movie is apparently intended for a young <UNK> christian audience as a teaching tool for that i give it a 7 out of 10 point vote it's a decent movie to show a youth group but i don't think it will be very well received beyond that for any other audience i'd rate it lots lower br br the reviewers that saw it's a wonderful life in this were right on though i didn't think of that until they mentioned it i was more reminded of a chick <UNK> those little 3 by 5 <UNK> comic books if jack chick ever made a movie out of one of his it would probably look a lot like second glance it has a strong christian message about the power of <UNK> and the influence each of us has on earth but it is somewhat <UNK> by christian stereotypes the christians are all very nice somewhat passive and <UNK> clean while all of the non christians seem to be bad people br br muriel the angel plays a major part and he is the <UNK> <UNK> character in the film he is the most unlikeable angel i have ever seen in any movie and the biggest negative i don't know if the directors intended for his personality to come off so badly or if he just struck me that way i admit that he reminded me of someone i know <UNK> love for a very <UNK> girl who is not at all his type drives the plot in this movie why he ever fell for her in the first place is the one question that i wish had been answered br br but the movie does display positive christian values and your youth group will be entertained as they view something wholesome with a good lesson
<START> based on a stephen king novel <UNK> things provides the intrigue and <UNK> to keep you in your seat a mysterious man max von <UNK> comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen could it be that the devil himself has set up shop as an <UNK> dealer in a small town in <UNK> von <UNK> is masterful and dynamic in this role that <UNK> the screen also starring are ed harris and bonnie <UNK> harris is steady and <UNK> is deserving of your attention also in support are j t walsh and amanda plummer not the best nor the worst adaptation of king's horror on the screen
<START> ok so this is horror i get horror but i don't get horrific black white is artistic but too much black is <UNK> enough said about the lighting the story a serial killer <UNK> of these around it's been done in the past and yes it will continue to be done but i hope not my question is when will the audience tire of <UNK> this <UNK> dilemma i guess the director thought he would do something different portray killing children well that's been done before too so i guess he had to go to shock value have them killed in the darkest of fashions okay the audience was shocked <UNK> disgusted <UNK> and getting up out of my seat i felt all of these things so was the director successful yes absolutely these are the things he wanted me to feel and i did now what do i do with the feelings and more importantly what is the message here with the amazing talent that francis <UNK> was gifted with could he ever consider <UNK> it to making films that speak of dare i say coming out of the darkness i was left in the dark after viewing this film my soul was <UNK> is that what this craft is about there are many such films out there they make the bucks i'm told so what's up with the people that want to see all these visuals what is going on in this world that people will pay to be <UNK> shocked would i see this again not ever
<START> me and my roommate got free tickets for a pre screening i guess you would call it in <UNK> <UNK> at atlantic station walking in i was expecting something controversial provocative unnecessarily overdone etc but the film is much more than that it's a story of two people helping each other it's not overdone and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary br br it's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously thats the beauty of it if it tried to take itself seriously it would have failed miserably but instead it carries itself through humor some unintentional and some surprisingly good acting by <UNK> although timberlake fails miserably in his role the movie is good enough for you to put that on the side br br i would definitely recommend this movie if not for any other reason than the fact it is something different to experience
<START> due to its predictable second rate title the one it was distributed under in italy at least i didn't expect much from this movie thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house la <UNK> means the cursed house well i had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene the constant presence of priests and the creepy <UNK> reminded me a bit of the exorcist and some of its decent italian rip offs but this was going to be something completely different this is more like hitchcock meets italian thriller very well written and directed good actors interesting plot ok i've tried not to spoil the viewing of 7 park for you which i'd highly recommend to everyone br br p s am i wrong or when joanna <UNK> or tries hard to stand she's <UNK> from the <UNK> down her feet and legs move a little too much and i'm not talking of the bad dream sequence
<START> if ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper it would be this one here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft porn s m flick complete with the huge in theatre poster depicting a near naked christina <UNK> <UNK> to none other than mr bad ass himself samuel jackson but let me tell you if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with <UNK> power to spare it's craig <UNK> follow up to <UNK> flow black snake <UNK> br br <UNK> over the top from the get go this film sucks you in with the opening scenes and proceeds to dig deeper and deeper in with every subsequent frame it's <UNK> basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move on in more positive ways with their lives been done before of course this tale but as i've always said it's the manner in which a story is told that gives it heart depth meaning and power br br <UNK> damaged by childhood abuse wild child character <UNK> and jackson's equally musician character <UNK> find each other under desperate circumstances and <UNK> takes it upon himself to try to help <UNK> this in itself is relatively unique the idea of a man trying to genuinely help a woman who is in serious pain rather than trying to take further advantage of her and we know from the <UNK> that heart and the film's heart is in the right place the movie at its core is about the <UNK> healing power of love with music as a very close second and the film <UNK> profoundly with this truth <UNK> <UNK> and brilliantly br br a major reason the film succeeds so profoundly is because of the fierce committed performances from <UNK> and jackson scenes that would have come off as laughable and pathetic in lesser <UNK> hands are instead powerful as all get out in particular the film's arc scene in which jackson sings and plays the song of the title alone in his house with <UNK> amidst a serious <UNK> and the abusive demons from past running amok inside her head leading her to crawl to <UNK> and <UNK> to his leg comes off not ridiculous as technically it should but rather as gut <UNK> <UNK> br br all the supporting performances are fantastic here too justin timberlake is completely believable as anxiety ridden boyfriend <UNK> and the always wonderful s is also perfectly cast as a character who obviously has feelings for <UNK> john jr is outstanding as well as <UNK> friend r l a nod to blues musician r l <UNK> no doubt everything works about this movie let's face it including the music soundtrack which features <UNK> scott bobby rush son house and most importantly jackson himself whose fantastic version of i am listening to as i <UNK> this review there's also a really beautiful and moving version of this little light of mine featured in the film sung heart <UNK> <UNK> and soft by <UNK> br br samuel jackson has said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this movie is the best of his career thus far i could not agree with him more this is work that he can be <UNK> proud of along with everyone else involved in this <UNK> <UNK> wise and deeply heartfelt mother of a project
<START> i can't really see how anyone can have any interest whatsoever in seeing this movie a woman meets a man he wants to play games she too but only until she realise what she's missing she leaves and that's it really it took 9 1 2 weeks before elizabeth kim basinger left john mickey rourke she should have left him after 30 minutes and ended our misery
<START> when this movie came out i had seen <UNK> davis play only soft feminine roles this movie was anything but soft and feminine great lines great action she and samuel l really <UNK> too violent for the <UNK> but if you and your significant other are trying to agree on a movie try this one on for size go <UNK> go <UNK>
<START> not quite a bomb the only thing missing was the <UNK> <UNK> actually the script may have worked if the lead roles had been cast with younger actors but the <UNK> of an aging diane lane acting as if she was a teenager or even a twenty something was too much to stomach every time she <UNK> would jump into the arms of richard gere and then pull both heels up behind her you could almost see the <UNK> of pain on his face as he was probably thinking oh my <UNK> back this babe sure doesn't weight <UNK> <UNK> anymore anyway both characters were distinctly unlikeable especially richard <UNK> a self absorbed plastic surgeon dr paul that was on some kind of soul quest after a <UNK> operation left him with a dead patient an older woman from a small farm then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what happened dr is on his way to meet said angry husband at the husband's request when he meets up with <UNK> she is recently split from her <UNK> husband shock and is helping out a friend by watching her beach front <UNK> rental of course that's where dr ends up staying and they both end up falling <UNK> in love especially after she finds out he is a rich doctor and a plastic surgeon in between romantic <UNK> and a nauseating song dance routine that lane <UNK> performs while listening to an old <UNK> no <UNK> they both try to figure how their lives got so totally screwed up dr was also not much of a father and has a son who is also a dr who <UNK> him for not being there for him while he was growing up naturally dr was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than raising an <UNK> distracting boy to make a long predictable story short <UNK> helps dr face his inner demons as well as confront said angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table after going in for a routine <UNK> of the face dr is finally able to tell the husband played excruciatingly sympathetic by scott glenn that he is sorry for what happened even though it was all the fault of that <UNK> i told him she was too old for that much juice <UNK> character robert appears to accept dr <UNK> it's hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good dr at all or thinking about some that he needs to <UNK> ever more <UNK> dr then decides he needs to visit his son who is now practicing medicine pro <UNK> in a third world country to <UNK> their relationship unfortunately that means he must <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> of course while entertaining the natives in <UNK> he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to <UNK> who nearly <UNK> like a school girl every time she gets one and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye evidently <UNK> to robert for his wife's death was the second hardest thing in the end he gets killed in a freak mud slide poetic justice as in mud pack and she is left with just the memories of what could have been hopefully no more gere lane sequels
<START> this movie starts at a and never quite reaches b its title promises far more than the film delivers it's superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality the people are <UNK> even the obligatory flamboyant type the lead kevin <UNK> overacts <UNK> as there's a reason for him to act at all simon <UNK> playing a horny straight is always worth watching and he's by far the only reason to stay with the movie however the rubbish about his men's group <UNK> or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order they seem to have been thrown into the movie's mild mix in a misguided effort to <UNK> the setting and non stop <UNK> the same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip don't worry about <UNK> the tape so you can get a <UNK> let the thing run you won't miss anything hugo <UNK> character is superfluous he appears in a sequence with one of the lesser leads and doesn't even meet the rest at all the outcome of that sequence isn't explained and <UNK> real estate <UNK> have nothing to do with the story the movie is a total disappointment at the end because there is no resolution the thing simply fades out and we're sent to the closing credits this is an <UNK> with no structure
<START> although allegedly <UNK> this movie demonstrates very little insight both into the <UNK> psychology resulting in a flat <UNK> characterization as well as into larger scale historical <UNK> and my hope of either learning something new or <UNK> my understanding of contemporary iran remained <UNK> instead i found my sensibilities somewhat <UNK> as a succession of <UNK> <UNK> villains replaced each other <UNK> torturing or killing the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> middle class iranian whose western cultural <UNK> were <UNK> and whose the movie quite blatantly seeks the deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass media market as it serves to <UNK> prevalent <UNK> folk <UNK> i e a crowd <UNK> br br what redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation genuinely <UNK> imagery which nevertheless always kept the screen rich <UNK> and <UNK> no small for which i do give it some stars
<START> symbolism <UNK> great tunes this film crushed their soon to be no more target audience's expectations these <UNK> and the naturally selected members of the group were witnessing a subtle yet in your face kiss goodbye to each other the message rings true today the cage you escape from and the bridge you want to jump off of are the next generations own <UNK> there will always be new kids on the block replacing those who break free from the chains the film can be frustrating at times because the themes the film attacks are so blatantly apart of the american way of life a thinking and reasoning person cannot help but stare at their own reflection in the scenes of head and question not only their personal motives for continuing the madness of everyday american life but the motives of those who want it to continue for the sake of madness the final scene similar to don daring of the <UNK> tiger to exit for battle represents just how <UNK> and impossible most dreams are
<START> after 10 years it is finally save to say that our <UNK> action star is back again i personally found this one to be even better than wake of death which makes it his best movie in 10 years okay it is not like his highlight years as <UNK> universal soldier sudden death or even his best effort to date hard target one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors john woo the action is good the story is exciting the dialogue is quite funny this one is better than expected the bad guys are awesome like in hard target and the fight scenes are old school real fans know what to expect i must say i gave up on him but van damme is finally back more please
<START> i just watched national <UNK> christmas vacation 2 on dvd hoping to see something at least close to the original great holiday comedy <UNK> <UNK> i saw nothing of the kind you can tell right from the start that this movie just wasn't going to measure up it's too bad it has a title that <UNK> it to the original christmas vacation it's really kind of sad the film can't stand on it's own merits i think too many people will view this film on the strength of the title and it does not come close to that level of comedy other than the title there is very little connecting the movie to the original <UNK> <UNK> and even less of a connection to christmas at all the comedy is very simplistic and the plot poor children might find some humor here but most adults would only get a chuckle here and there this movie is a flop don't waste your time with it
<START> this movie is a picture perfect action drama and thriller every scene has you sucked in i watched this movie and was amazed by how many talented actors were in the movie <UNK> especially was great he played his role perfectly the story was made for these actors the characters make the movie so realistic this movie very simply gets an a plus from me definitely watch this film it <UNK> with scarface but has a more in depth story this movie not only gives you a good picture of the gangster life but it also gives you the characters emotions and at the end you really feel for the main character watch this film
<START> loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer <UNK> around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as <UNK> as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by <UNK> i'll be writing those <UNK> down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed
<START> i purchased this one for a couple of dollars at the local video store as they <UNK> out their tapes in favour of dvds i doubt they'll be replacing this one somehow br br i couldn't say that it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen but it's very dull no real cannibal scenes me me <UNK> is not naked enough of the time only about 4 or 5 times and she's not the <UNK> <UNK> that i expected either so two of my reasons for watching this movie were knocked out br br there is some severe animal violence here for those that enjoy that sort of thing a great fight between a and a large snake gets quite bloody animal torture as well some of which is real and some fake thankfully the fake is somewhat funny but the real is just a little sickening br br generally speaking it's a 70s film overly long under developed not as deep as it would have liked to have been but it's something different right one and a half stars
<START> good lord how this ended up in our dvd player i'll never know my wife thought it was a new release she'd missed somehow <UNK> it's a couple of years old and in danish i think she kept looking for the english soundtrack br br all in all the film wasn't bad good production values better performances and a clever story that doesn't get too far away from itself make for <UNK> dark <UNK> fare from across the sea the ending will make you chuckle in fact the whole film will incredibly strange characters that we grow genuinely interested in make a film that might be worth your while without spoiling the plot the film's title and dvd jacket give you a good idea where this thing is going
<START> if you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like i was the book was great and i was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well however i felt like i was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like the movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense i think both diane lane and richard gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they <UNK> for each other the book was true love story and i think this movie could of been a lot better
<START> my mother forced me to watch this movie with her she apparently will watch anything with a vampire <UNK> in it i was bored throughout br br at different points underworld rise of the is reminiscent of <UNK> battle for the planet of the apes the passion of the christ and <UNK> what it reminds me most of are those italian sword and <UNK> pictures of the <UNK> sixties not the good ones that spend an <UNK> amount of time showing greek or roman <UNK> in <UNK> talking and plotting <UNK> while you wait <UNK> for the muscle man hero and his lover usually the <UNK> daughter to do something br br this film was in desperate need of some color and suspense the characters were pretty two dimensional br br the sets looked as if they were constructed entirely of <UNK> i wonder how many civil war chess sets were <UNK> down to make this movie br br all those wearing <UNK> <UNK> on your arms and black <UNK> feel free to click no
<START> was the last book to feature miss <UNK> written by agatha christie the official final case <UNK> <UNK> was written in the forties and i've always had a very soft spot for it i loved the characters and they are lovingly brought to life in this excellent bbc adaptation with joan terrific as ever as miss <UNK> br br on the whole it is very faithful to the book a few characters are dropped the first new murder is slightly different and a couple of new characters are introduced personally i felt that the added character of lionel <UNK> was unnecessary and rather irritating tour guide <UNK> was irritating in a different way but often quite amusing it's largely because of lionel that i don't award 10 out of 10 the other characters are beautifully done especially helen <UNK> as a <UNK> miss temple and all of the three weird sisters but particularly margaret who gives a <UNK> performance as she threatens to go over the top towards the end but just avoids it the female <UNK> are good value too and the episode contains one of my favourite lines <UNK> ' br br this is another relatively early bbc <UNK> that looks wonderful and is has a <UNK> nostalgic feel to it highly recommended
<START> two teenagers in the north east of england are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favourite football team they go through a series of comic <UNK> but come up smiling in the end br br the trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and includes most of its light hearted moments however the tone is increasingly grim and the end result is a depressing story <UNK> with familiar stereotypes the two heroes have no problems with lying cheating and stealing their <UNK> are a <UNK> teacher a <UNK> villain of a father a psychotic <UNK> and a well meaning but incompetent social worker the other female characters are a drug addicted teenager a pregnant <UNK> and a <UNK> wife who seems to be smoking herself to death there are no likable characters and the audience can only feel either pity or contempt local actors tim <UNK> and kevin both play against type as baddies but the writing and direction of their characters are so one dimensional that they have no more than novelty value br br chris <UNK> and greg give good performances in the two young leads however they are miscast because they have the wrong accent to anyone from the north east it is obvious that they both come from the <UNK> area and yet we are expected to believe they are natives of <UNK> as a <UNK> myself i can assure you that the accents are by no means the same take the phrase let the poor <UNK> speak we say let the <UNK> while they say <UNK> with two distinctly different <UNK> sounds this <UNK> creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in football ground where the two <UNK> are trying to disguise the <UNK> accents they don't have and pretend that they come from which they clearly do in a gentle comedy this kind of criticism might be seen as <UNK> picking however the film's bleak tone makes it clear that writer director mark herman is aiming for gritty realism that means near enough is actually way off br br i had hoped for humour and optimism from this film and instead found tired old clichés is not a grey <UNK> populated solely by losers and in telling us it is herman should have known he would cause <UNK> it's interesting to compare the film with the same director's little voice also largely downbeat and populated by one dimensional characters little voice at least has a talented heroine and doesn't <UNK> in misery to the same extent i've heard <UNK> <UNK> alongside this year's billy elliot but that film is a vastly more enjoyable and life <UNK> experience br br incidentally i may be just too old but having lived on for <UNK> years i have never heard anyone outside this film use the expression purely <UNK>
<START> i was at a friends house for <UNK> and watched a dvd of the movie eddie monroe i've been a fan of indie films for almost 20 years i loved the brothers and was impressed how good this movie is my friend who works at sound told us that this movie was shot on super 16 the photography was so good it looked as though it was a <UNK> shoot furthermore the music combined with fred carpenter's direction was art the storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching very cool the acting by the entire cast was good especially the actor who played uncle benny he was amazing this film was a nice holiday treat and i was delighted to be one of the first to view a movie that many will be seeing in the future
<START> you the living ok i think i am an intelligent educated liberal and really into films i really like and have a great sense of humour i was under the impression this was a <UNK> painful comedy they got paid for making this <UNK> was used electricity burnt food was consumed sets built why i blame the current state of the world on this film and all those people associated with it i will even include us the viewing public we are all to blame and deserve whatever coming its not funny not much happens everyone it seems is bored or boring there are no conversations communication is minimal there is no plot as far as i am aware i have in fact just lost <UNK> point something minutes of my life i will never ever get that time back the only message i have come away with is perhaps life is too short to sit around watching movies of people doing not much and then you die
<START> dull acting weak script worst spanish movie in years i was br br attracted by the naked beauty of paz vega but as an actress br br she's useless you almost can't understand what she's saying br br about the story there's not much coherent to say we heard of it br br before but as this is a modern carmen we find a few changes the french soldier is now a <UNK> soldier himself is a character in the story carmen is a dangerous in love with a famous br br <UNK> and she can speak <UNK> <UNK> br br can anyone understand this mess
<START> this is so poor it's watchable br br the plot deals with a <UNK> spaceship crew happening upon a <UNK> apparently abandoned russian craft br br in the empty <UNK> of space the two craft accidentally <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fun ensues as a cyborg from the russian ship <UNK> our crew br br the <UNK> interiors are clearly a <UNK> up factory set metal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in this entirely unconvincing setting and the rest of our hero crew <UNK> <UNK> run about and continually and repeatedly rack their <UNK> without firing them br br the continuity <UNK> are what define this movie and they are nothing short of amazing br br stuff appears and disappears the <UNK> are <UNK> a <UNK> gets longer by being <UNK> the <UNK> are <UNK> again just to make sure content of a bottle <UNK> by being drunk from br br the film progresses through the usual clichés by way of intense ham acting <UNK> camera work and ed wood quality props to a showdown climax
<START> i have vague memories of this movie being funny br br having seen it again either i have changed or i was thinking about a another film altogether br br it seems as if we are supposed to be sympathetic to jackie <UNK> character however nothing in the movie actually <UNK> that emotion its notable that he is really the only person <UNK> tender dialogue with loved ones no one else's character is allowed to rise to the status of even vaguely human br br i don't even like golf but as the film went on i found myself really rooting for stack and the club guys really hoping they would <UNK> mason and chevy chase
<START> this outlandish troma movie is actually a very good movie it is known as their epic and best and most highly rated production their version of shakespeare's play is extremely funny with the usual dose of troma nudity and gore troma has made some very good gore films one of my favorites is street trash and of course the toxic <UNK> movies i have one troma movie terror <UNK> which has a reputation as their <UNK> and <UNK> movie i enjoyed <UNK> and juliet so much that i need to finally watch terror <UNK> this is a 2 disc <UNK> version with four <UNK> and many many features <UNK> and juliet is an absolute hoot and highly recommended
<START> if you only see one ernest movie in your life make it this one this is by far the best in the series with its <UNK> laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages the other ernest flicks were good too but most people tend to get tired of him quickly not me however br br in this movie ernest p is assigned jury duty for a murder case the murderer <UNK> just happens to look exactly like our bumbling hero ernest mr <UNK> finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him and so we get to see how ernest <UNK> in the <UNK> br br a great flick if you haven't already seen it watch it
<START> this has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the sci fi channel here is how the movie starts women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical <UNK> is a ok as long as it only targets soldiers in case your wondering men however the virus back fires big shock and all the men on earth slowly die then all of male kind is condemned to die when the <UNK> president is shot and killed by a man now we are taken around 60 to 70 years from now two female scientists are working on <UNK> a female baby and one of them says hey why don't we bring men back the other one says no the world is not ready for that but promptly ignores her and thus a man walks the again br br first off this movie assumes that all men who are not <UNK> altered are blood <UNK> monsters secondly the writer forgot to mention that present day soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers so there is no real reason to have a virus like that this is the biggest <UNK> of time you can find this movie managed to insult my intellect not only by the bad story but with the lifetime style acting avoid this movie at all costs br br i give this a 1 out of 10 but only because i could go no lower
<START> lucille <UNK> version of <UNK> in my opinion is one of the worst performances ever saved to film after seeing lucy in her various sitcoms more than an <UNK> number of times i can tell you that i really love lucy however this movie is a fiasco of unbelievably bad casting music and dancing robert preston is the only saving grace with a part tiny enough to miss if you blink i don't know what she was thinking and i can't imagine how she was advised by the studio or director but i actually <UNK> watching this embarrassing performance i could be really cruel and suggest watching it for a laugh but it's too pitiful even to qualify for that don't waste your money or your time
<START> i read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it i'm a big <UNK> and art film lover but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something arty or intellectual into something it is not i will be blunt it contains scenes of sexual <UNK> that i never ever wanted to actually see obviously the piano teacher has some major psychological issues but i really did not want to see them displayed so <UNK> the film is in essence disgusting i mean when i saw <UNK> for a dream i was <UNK> by the last sort of scene with jennifer <UNK> but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and <UNK> i felt during this film
<START> if you watch this series you will get an interesting 10 chapters about a sleeper story and each characters and more intense with a <UNK> <UNK> br br nice story nice characters and performs but something is wrong for me of course the final is wrong you wait ten chapters hoping a great final it doesn't matters if they fulfill its <UNK> or not but well i think is not enough its a small final for a big series also i hoped more <UNK> about characters stories br br but i repeat it's and interesting miniseries if you don't want to wait with large series 22 24 chapters watch it i give 7 of 10
<START> this was the most god awful movie i have had to sit through 30 minutes into the film and i couldn't take any more seriously do not bother with this one unless you are a sentimental nut job or one of those pseudo arty types that like this kind of tripe so that they may feel more <UNK> boring although the acting is fine the kid is just plain irritating some scenes are a little strange with very weird close ups i don't know why they did the whole movie in black and white but whatever effect they were hoping to have failed miserably there was just nothing to watch and although its a sad tale supposedly its just so stupid that its hard to feel any sympathy for the characters
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is not only the best movie tie in game of all time but it is perhaps the most influential first person <UNK> ever to hit the <UNK> <UNK> market if you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem because essential it is the same as the popular james bond movie <UNK> which was released in 1995 two years prior to this <UNK> release br br this is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be <UNK> in many future games to come and it gives the player a wide variety of <UNK> and difficult challenges the a i is smart especially on higher difficulty settings and the <UNK> are complex enough to provide entertainment as well as difficulty to any <UNK> br br the introduction of logical hit points on your enemies is a great feature even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well aimed shot to the head it is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your james bond and that you can sneak in sneak out <UNK> taking out henchmen as you go or <UNK> <UNK> and having to go through massive <UNK> because of this there are many ways to beat the game and <UNK> possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks aka you can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels and if you don't have a <UNK> guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself which i might add is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away br br this is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its <UNK> to the <UNK> industry each time i play it i notice aspects that have been <UNK> in many following <UNK> games so if you have a <UNK> 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of <UNK> <UNK> because trust me as a bond fan and a casual <UNK> i can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of james bond or just have an awesome intense <UNK> experience br br also make sure to look out for its sister game perfect dark which is also on the <UNK> following the same controls and very similar weapon uses
<START> for most people <UNK> 3 is the film that really is the big disgrace for the <UNK> series it has few fans and most people hate it for it's shameless commercial pg 13 approach now i'm not going to say that <UNK> 3 is any good frankly it pretty much sucks but as far as being a properly shot and executed film it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos yes the truth of the matter is that <UNK> 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a near masterpiece so what if <UNK> 3 turns <UNK> into a cartoonish super hero in a ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy at least it's doing it openly i don't know where <UNK> 2 begins and ends i don't know what or whom it's about i don't understand what's going on in it i don't understand which jokes are deliberate and which aren't i will go insane if i try to understand the characters i see nothing of any value in anything anybody is saying i can't believe anybody looked at the shooting script and figured it would work and i can't believe that <UNK> <UNK> saw the finished result and figured that he liked what he see he probably didn't by the way neither miller nor <UNK> nor allen did it's not hard to see why br br now <UNK> 2 has it's fans i know this mostly they belong to this league of absolute anti <UNK> <UNK> anybody who expected any depth or subject matter from the first film as academic roger ebert <UNK> it's just a lot of fun a good piece of action and great entertainment the argument goes yeah well i guess if you just don't listen to what any of the characters are saying you could fool yourself that we might as well have arnold in the suit instead of <UNK> don't get me wrong i like a good action film with pure entertainment value as it's only most satisfying virtue but <UNK> 2 sir ain't no such thing br br look at the first couple of scenes this horrible actor makes <UNK> repeat that he's just a machine and then goes into this operatic speech about how he could never be a man where after murphy's wife who's <UNK> for robot <UNK> walks in out of the blue and have this sad little moment with him and then is never heard of again i surely would like to go in to this film scene by scene because every one has these kind of <UNK> in them it's like a twelve year old fan boy has done the screenplay the characters act totally random and first say this then say that wants to stop crime with a new <UNK> especially this drug called <UNK> but then it seems they really just want to become this big <UNK> empire and control the entire city  politics are abandoned i guess understandable given the comic relief mayor the villain played by tom <UNK> who did a better version of this in last action hero and that's saying a lot is an addict but is still used for this machine the woman behind it all has an agenda which is impossible to understand br br speaking of twelve year olds this film has the infamous role of <UNK> this mad kid who <UNK> and kills people played by a child actor i'm not going to be all moral about it it's a free world and if you want a psycho kid in your action movie go for it i don't know how much of frank <UNK> original vision was put into this but the credits at least acknowledge him as of the story and if i zoom out i could see this as being quite a cool character it's grim for sure to have a maniac killer kid but then again this is the world of <UNK> and who would be surprised this whole business with the trying to become this giant <UNK> over everything is properly <UNK> and good as well also the idea of <UNK> getting in touch with his wife and kid having them <UNK> into the story somehow would also be great and as far as i can see a natural and logical step if they now had to make a <UNK> sequel br br but of course these are just ideas as many people have already said the screenplay is 100 mess the kid has one scene the torture scene where it's hinted that he in fact is just a stereotype messed up kid and then we have this <UNK> scene where he is dying and gets all soft and friendly towards ol' tin head why doesn't he just take up his <UNK> and try to take him down with his last breath isn't that what his character would do does he give his life a little second thought there on his death bed not necessarily given that his last words are it sucks so why it really makes no sense and this can be said about everybody no everything in this film is there a strike in the police force is <UNK> machine or man what's the deal with turning <UNK> into this community service machine for 10 minutes i mean sure it's pretty funny i wouldn't deny that but why build it up and then <UNK> it and why the hell is allen so criminally underused and what is it <UNK> has an obvious urge to express with his character and yeah well the threads are many and the mess is enormous br br this review is just as messed up as the film the only reason i give an extra star up there is because of the actors from the first film i'm sure they had good intentions with it i mean it's something somewhat stable some kind of anchor in this sea of bad movie making
<START> quite a production from the director telling the story of the <UNK> ambitious plan to <UNK> all <UNK> of china some great characters sets costumes and scenes however i was not blown away by the film in terms of the actors ability which was good i enjoyed the marquis the most or its look although the <UNK> of troops was extremely impressive if it was real man that is a lot of extras br br i have seen li <UNK> in other movies and she is always great good period piece i think but not one to judge the true historical accuracy of it good film and found the 2 1 2 hours not a problem br br rating 7 out of 10
<START> look some film has got to the be worst ever i suggest it may be india song when i saw the film in 1976 it was playing at the <UNK> hall cinema a place <UNK> by people who care a lot about film from about the halfway point people were simply <UNK> out of the theater my girlfriend wouldn't let us leave but by the end the theater was virtually empty i kept telling people as they left that the good part is still to come and it was the good part was the screen at the end that said <UNK> it was the only good part i am still annoyed by this film 24 years later it was pointless stupid and derivative <UNK> part 2 see it only if you want to spend an endless two hours learning to <UNK> between merely bad and simply awful
<START> a great show br br first to the people who don't like it don't like it then don't watch it br br this is was an awesome show better than according to jim a favorite of mine it shows a real family household as opposed to 8 simple rules etc where everything goes <UNK> br br they're loud they're messy i can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen it happens in real life sorta like the <UNK> to hell and everyone <UNK> like dogs over the fast food boxes br br it's a been there show you know what's coming but fun to watch because you have been there before br br a good cast they work great together a admirable enough show to warrant a dvd release mel <UNK> safety videos were a highlight of the series as well br br opinion good show really deserving of a dvd release deserving to not be canceled as well
<START> laughably awful one might think that all the big name actors involved in this movie would at least make it believable but they do not this one is a stinker br br characters either <UNK> around without having a good reason to know where they are going or they stand around making <UNK> faces when they should be running for their lives br br check your higher brain functions at the door if you intend to try watching this movie or get a bunch of your most clever friends together and give this one the mystery science theater 3000 treatment that's what i was doing through the second half of this turkey br br and please don't confuse this with the excellent movie the day of the a far superior thriller from 30 years ago
<START> victor <UNK> the viewer into life's lower depths for much of its running time with grim scenes of alcoholic <UNK> family violence and <UNK> despair but the most memorable <UNK> involve the <UNK> image of death itself here death is <UNK> as a ghostly horse drawn <UNK> driven by a wretched <UNK> who was the last person to die on the previous new year's eve for one year the <UNK> must collect the souls of the newly <UNK> and after twelve months of this horrible <UNK> the <UNK> own soul is finally released when the last person to die on december <UNK> becomes the new driver br br the scenes involving this <UNK> the film was known as the phantom <UNK> or the phantom <UNK> in english speaking countries are eerie and mesmerizing <UNK> double exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today most strikingly the <UNK> travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned as fascinating as these scenes are however the bulk of the film is concerned with the <UNK> spiral of david <UNK> played by the director himself in an understated portrayal of a man who has given up on the possibility of living a decent life in flashbacks we see <UNK> enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife children and brother and he appears to be a perfectly ordinary guy abruptly without <UNK> or explanation we then see <UNK> as an alcoholic wreck in trouble with the law and <UNK> from his family <UNK> this leap from before to after might feel like a story telling <UNK> but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar <UNK> details on our own it's suggested that <UNK> has been led <UNK> by his friend georges the drinking companion who first relates the tale of the phantom <UNK> but whatever the cause of his downfall <UNK> appears to be a lost cause a mean spirited drunk who takes perverse pleasure in <UNK> pain on his family and in <UNK> to <UNK> br br while david <UNK> is our central figure the story's true <UNK> is a young salvation army nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and <UNK> believes in him despite his hateful behavior when the nurse herself is dying <UNK> due to her <UNK> on <UNK> behalf she demands to see him and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his <UNK> br br at times this film resembles <UNK> tale of scrooge in its use of ghostly <UNK> who inspire a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life suffer over his and <UNK> i was also reminded of <UNK> drama <UNK> in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family gone a sequence <UNK> here the director also <UNK> a standard theme of <UNK> <UNK> found earlier in his <UNK> hans a k a the outlaw and his wife <UNK> that no man can <UNK> his fate this time however it could be <UNK> that david <UNK> actually succeeds in <UNK> his seemingly inevitable fate for he's given an unexpected second chance to make <UNK> br br viewers expecting a <UNK> into the supernatural will appreciate the sequences featuring the phantom <UNK> of the title but may not be prepared for this film's painful examination of a troubled man's alcoholic downfall but those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate in its entirety it stands with the best serious cinema of its era and is certainly one of most accomplished works
<START> this movie was a total <UNK> that took forever to get going but never really did it was simply boring to watch so much in fact i could just never really get into it this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination the cover of the <UNK> made it out to be one instead it is a thriller type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to make the movie more interesting of course it does not help this movie at all mostly all i remember is that this movie was kind of like a movie from the 1970's called the deep bunch of looking for treasure rival groups that sort of thing there are supernatural twists in it too but to tell you the truth i was so bored when watching this movie that i kind of <UNK> out so i can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were i kind of remember <UNK> on the bottom of the sea so maybe it was some sort of walking dead or that may be me thinking of lucio zombie movie instead as that one was a horror movie that was set in a <UNK> island and as outlandish as that one was it was a lot more entertaining than this movie that day we learned a valuable lesson never rent a movie based on its cover art
<START> wow not because of the 3 d imagery which at times was used nicely to provide good deep imagery but what a lame ending the end of the movie just seems to <UNK> on itself this film has got to be one of the <UNK> movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it the <UNK> of this film is painful as well if you are looking for a bad 50s sci fi film to laugh at aka <UNK> fodder go for it otherwise look for better films
<START> this delightful well written film is based on a new york stage play bearing the same title where sir <UNK> <UNK> sir charles <UNK> smith in 1944 <UNK> the role he plays in the film here in 1931 we see him in the early part of his acting renaissance in the very early era of <UNK> and in the character role that he would make his own until his death in 1948 after finishing his last performance in little women which released in 1949 br br this engaging play is about an elderly british aristocrat who <UNK> his <UNK> children and introduces himself to them having brought them to his <UNK> in england br br marion davies plays his daughter by error and it's a tour de force for her she is all at once endearing <UNK> shallow enchanting wise and compassionate while creating an <UNK> and <UNK> character that remains well <UNK> in the memory br br the 26 year old ray <UNK> appears here in a small but prominent role having already appeared in seven other pictures then only in films for a bit more than two years br br the film should be enjoyed as a representative of 1931 hollywood factory production of course and as such is not flawless however it's a charming pleasure from first scene to the last
<START> this movie was total cheese it <UNK> the only thing good about it was the acting other then that nothing noteworthy at all br br big time spoilers coming up don't read anymore if you have not seen it br br this movie is centered around a family whose happy and wonderful lives have been <UNK> as a result of their younger son and later as they find out older son have been <UNK> by their <UNK> <UNK> although they are called <UNK> in court and the defense attorney is a real <UNK> the jury finds them guilty and <UNK> them br br in the end all i can say to the director is the next time you wanna make a movie like this do it differently
<START> exclusively for <UNK> lovers though clint eastwood very strong though <UNK> presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film it is a biography of gary cooper based mainly on his filmography but also on more private <UNK> which show him as a child as a young man as a family man with some of his friends <UNK> <UNK> etc as an older man finally as a sick and close to death man after the end i did not have the feeling that i knew the man any much better but i have spent a very good moment re viewing many of the best moments of his movies and my respect for the very talented actor and great professional was <UNK> <UNK> the film shows most interestingly how the career of cooper can be <UNK> with the evolution of usa society before and after ww2 two of the great moments are the time when cooper has to answer justice about communism in the movie world and when james stewart a very great one too received an award for cooper one month before his death i'm not a <UNK> pot but that was a close one watch it if you can it is so much worth while if you love cooper that is or an older america
<START> the first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history almost as good as the shower scene in psycho and the acting by robert walker is fantastic a psychopath involved with <UNK> star in exchange murders <UNK> the story and overall this film is very good but <UNK> one problem why guy haines go to the cop in the first place 4 5 br br
<START> after two terrorist attacks in europe one in london and the other in <UNK> the prime suspect is the leader al <UNK> the cia agent roger <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> in the middle east is assigned by his superior at <UNK> ed hoffman russell <UNK> to keep a safe house in <UNK> under <UNK> and he associates to the chief of security in jordan <UNK> mark strong roger does not <UNK> the whole operation to and it fails due to the <UNK> of ed meanwhile roger has feelings for the local nurse and he gets close to her family when roger plots another scheme to catch al using the innocent architect omar ali as <UNK> to lure al he <UNK> not only the safety of but also that is kidnapped after the execution of roger tries to <UNK> the release of with the terrorists and <UNK> to deliver himself to save the nurse br br body of lies is a disappointing tour through europe and middle east despite the names of <UNK> scott <UNK> <UNK> and russell <UNK> the imdb user rating <UNK> that there are many viewers that like this type of fast paced movie of espionage using high technology <UNK> and all sort of lack of respect to the <UNK> of other nations in the name of oil that gives no time for thinking but that is not my case it is boring and ridiculous to see the fat russell <UNK> with a cell phone like a family man while his partner is <UNK> his life in a dangerous operation the rich character performed by <UNK> <UNK> is poorly developed and in my opinion this great actor is miscast as an <UNK> agent in middle east due to his but the movie never explains his connections with the middle east the rescue of roger <UNK> alive is also very stupid and corny my vote is four br br title brazil de network of lies
<START> best years of our lives perfectly captures the era of my youth and the feelings of that time the cast was uniformly wonderful this was possibly dana andrews best role of his career and he should also have been nominated for an academy award there are so many wonderful scenes in this movie it is almost impossible to list them all the cinematography is among the best of any film this movie is a time capsule of what is was like in the 1940's a must see movie for any true movie fan some critics have said this movie has aged i disagree the theme of human desires is timeless and the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us this is just a great movie one that can be watched over and over again
<START> what really amazed me about this film was that it <UNK> so false first of all who in the late 80's when the film takes place lived like this family a college professor wouldn't make enough money to support the lifestyle i saw on the film hence he and his stay home wife would be plagued by financial <UNK> especially when she gets cancer second streep is my age and most women particularly in her class educated white well off experienced the feminist movement yet this woman seems oblivious to her <UNK> behavior i actually felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child by taking care of his every need br br the fact that so many people were moved by the film is amazing i have admired carl <UNK> films in the past and i actually like meryl streep but <UNK> what a manipulative and lying film this is
<START> with a cheap pound shop having just opened i thought that it was worth looking to see if their were any cheap dvds that looked good and while the back of the cover made this sound like a <UNK> <UNK> type of film it is actually an anthology film and thought one or two of the stories feel very familiar its still a fun light horror comedy the plots br br story one the classic br br a young couple feel the it is time that they should try to in prove their financial life by picking up a <UNK> car but when the guy goes to pick a car a car starts to talk to him the car called says that to get everything that he has ever wanted in life that he must buy for <UNK> so while the guys relationship <UNK> does everything he can to show who really is in charge br br story two kitchen culture br br a guy that might get thrown out by his land lord due to how messy his flat is discovers that due to keeping a <UNK> <UNK> in his <UNK> for six months the it has now <UNK> and evolved into a green <UNK> version of himself and while they start off as friends they end up having a big falling out the leads to a final battle to see if the real guy or his <UNK> clone will survive br br story three too good to be true br br a girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets matched with a guy the is perfect for her but she is unsure that the guy is too perfect and when she thinks that she sees him <UNK> <UNK> she starts to get <UNK> view on the film br br the first thing that i have to mention is the rating for the film in england where it has been given an <UNK> rating even thought it has no nudity swearing or blood at all and the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings where the <UNK> win and while the first story is too close to the stephen king classic christine the second story is easily the highlight of the film with director tom <UNK> making the of the story feel like a low budget muppets episode br br final view on the film br br while it does have a bit of a feel their is enough <UNK> to make this a good horror <UNK>
<START> i'm <UNK> sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one line synopsis then end up being equal to what you'd find in the bottom center of a <UNK> heap br br who knows <UNK> may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast like blair and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> likes of <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> some woman br br but on film it just falls apart faster than a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern <UNK> and one of them a woman i'd guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are <UNK> in grotesque <UNK> ways br br okay right there you have a cross section of plots from the exorcist the omen ten little indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanic <UNK> run amok line none of it is very entertaining and for the most part you'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it's over br br no not even linda blair and david <UNK> help matters much they're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their all br br from the looks of it <UNK> probably wishes he were back on the <UNK> with pam anderson and who can blame him and linda well who knows a celebrity <UNK> benefit or pro am golf tour or whatever it is she's in to nowadays br br and the torture scenes <UNK> you'll see people get their mouths <UNK> shut <UNK> up inside roaring <UNK> strung up in trees during a violent storm <UNK> <UNK> out of their <UNK> etc etc <UNK> and i thought mark of the devil was the most sadistic movie i'd seen br br don't bother it's not worth your time i can't believe i told you as much as i did if you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches and yes blair gets possessed as if you didn't see that coming down main street followed by a <UNK> band br br no stars <UNK> these witches will give you <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival br br based on the novel by jonathan <UNK> <UNK> everything is <UNK> is the directorial debut of actor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also wrote the screenplay in the movie jonathan <UNK> wood <UNK> <UNK> items from his family from <UNK> to to <UNK> of paper which he then <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to a wall in his house to record his family history but the space for his grandfather is <UNK> bare all jonathan really has of him is a piece of jewelry and an old photo of him with a woman who <UNK> him from the nazis during the second world war jonathan decides to <UNK> a quest to <UNK> to find the woman thank her and learn more about his grandfather br br his quest is aided there by a couple of characters who run a tourist company for jewish people including a young man obsessed with western culture eugene his grandfather boris who thinks he is blind and who may have memories and demons of his own from the war and his <UNK> <UNK> seeing eye dog br br the screenplay effectively combines both humour and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside looking for <UNK> <UNK> town driving deeper and deeper into the memories of the past the best performance probably comes from eugene playing alex jr who starts the movie as a wearing break dancing <UNK> just out to have fun but <UNK> into something more as not only jonathan but all the characters gain their own <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wood and eugene attended the screening and did a very humorous q a after the film br br <UNK> was very close to his grandfather who was a <UNK> immigrant and who died in 1993 this caused him to start to write to get his memories down on paper meanwhile he was asked to do a reading of short story the very rigid search which was an <UNK> from the still <UNK> novel <UNK> was blown away by the quality of the writing saying that <UNK> had done in 15 pages what <UNK> tried to do in <UNK> <UNK> approached <UNK> and they talked about their <UNK> culture movies and the nature of short term memory in america in the end <UNK> agreed to let <UNK> adapt the book br br own project was intended to be a road movie but the book has parallel narrative that is an imagined <UNK> history of the town of that <UNK> 500 years given his budget and limitations as a filmmaker he said he'd leave that to <UNK> <UNK> and take the road trip instead this imagined <UNK> was what moved him to make the movie in the first place the idea that a past lovingly imagined was as valuable as a past accurately <UNK> br br <UNK> said the movie was a series of happy <UNK> after searching <UNK> in <UNK> for an actor he was walking through the lower east side in new york when he saw a poster of a woman <UNK> topless from the <UNK> up with an insane sitting <UNK> her under the poster said the name <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> punk gypsy band br br eugene then took over the story he had never pursued acting as music was his first passion one day a friend gave him the book and he thought it was written in a manner similar to how he writes music screw sentences <UNK> language is my own br br later they got a call from a production company looking for eastern european music that was medieval but modern met with <UNK> and he soon found the movie was based on the book he just happened to be reading not long after that came up <UNK> asked what he thought about alex and whether he could do the character by any chance br br <UNK> and <UNK> talked about the film in the fall of 2001 shortly after the events of september 11 both were in europe at the time and they talked about the <UNK> comments they were hearing about americans which led <UNK> to want to try to find an <UNK> american who would defy the stereotype that europeans have of americans someone who was awkward vulnerable flawed innocent and looking for history beyond the borders of his own country <UNK> started thinking about who that was and <UNK> came up br br one of <UNK> as a filmmaker is <UNK> kusturica i think that's who he said who also directed a segment in another festival movie all the invisible children who said you don't look for the actors you look for the people <UNK> said there is something about who <UNK> is that he has a <UNK> of spirit and a sincere goodness as a human being that came across on film <UNK> said that the eyes are important when trying to <UNK> a character who is an <UNK> and that if eyes are the doors to the soul are garage doors br br <UNK> wood had fun with a question about the similarities between his character kevin in sin city and jonathan in this movie as both are sort of a blank <UNK> on which emotions are projected wood <UNK> that jonathan may seem still and seemingly <UNK> but it is all about his observations about his experiences with other characters and the environment he was in br br on the differences between directing and writing <UNK> said he likes writing a lot more and <UNK> described directing as hell after his grandfather died <UNK> started to think about how to <UNK> some sense of history and himself is he content driven or not or just good at <UNK> other people's work he said he loved the exercise of <UNK> out what is emotional to you important to you
<START> what a <UNK> movie this is without a doubt a low class b movie the german elite <UNK> assault russian en <UNK> like an old <UNK> battle the acting is mediocre the plot thin and it's hard sometimes to follow where it's going the action sequences are pretty worthless when it shows any except for the fact that they do use authentic equipment vehicles from ww2 this is in no way on the same level as saving <UNK> ryan or platoon lots of worthless attempts at character development which lead nowhere old theme good officer bad officer that's highly predictable even the action sequences look like a old kid set them up i could have directed better too bad this is the same guy that did <UNK> boot the boat because that was a <UNK> good movie he must have <UNK> too much after that success because he sure lost his touch when it came to this film i bought it on dvd better to rent it instead
<START> this is a very touching movie this is a story about a special bond between a child and his grandfather a <UNK> brings his <UNK> to the city to get his eyes treated but comes to know that has some rare cancer of eyes and has to <UNK> an operation and will lose both his eyes the movie is all about the emotions and the turmoil both them go through and how they accept the whole thing the movie avoid any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way though the movie is in <UNK> language is not a <UNK> at all it proves that to make good movie you do not need item songs <UNK> and usual <UNK> excellent performances this is <UNK> entry for oscars 2004 hope it gets the nomination at least would rate 10 10
<START> anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film it's interesting they titled it the hole the production values are good for a short film the hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is <UNK> by the video format it was shot on i <UNK> if this was shot on <UNK> it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat many hollywood movies look good and that's enough for an audience regardless of story and content br br my honest opinion 3 out of 10 for this effort maybe next film will deliver
<START> closet land is an amazing terrifying piece of cinema it features only two actors in a single set but never loses your attention the set design is imaginative and <UNK> the staging of scenes maintains your attention while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror the acting is outstanding with alan <UNK> and madeleine <UNK> having the duty of carrying every scene br br i first saw this film in 1991 soon after it came out on video it didn't play in theaters where i lived not surprising given its political content it should be seen though it features a brilliant staging of the torture and <UNK> techniques used by <UNK> societies to <UNK> fear and <UNK> in its citizens the country is never named which makes it all the more striking it could be anywhere east west 3rd world 1st world it illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone when government becomes the <UNK> of the citizens rather than the servant br br madeleine <UNK> is a children's author who has been dragged from her bed in the night and subjected to terror and torture she finds herself in a room with alan <UNK> a seemingly pleasant at first it seems a horrible mistake and she is free to go but fear causes her to remain and the terror <UNK> she is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture the <UNK> uses <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> manipulation confusion <UNK> manipulation role play and twisted logic to break down the author she is <UNK> and forced to endure <UNK> <UNK> positions <UNK> of food and water br br through it all she refuses to give in to do what the <UNK> asks she is told that it will all end if she just signs a confession a simple little act she refuses through it all she employs defense <UNK> that have developed since childhood it is slowly revealed that she was the victim of childhood sexual abuse to survive she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would take her away from the abuse these <UNK> allow her to <UNK> her torture and turn the tables on her <UNK> she starts attacking his own beliefs and profession forcing him to examine his own life and motives in the end she is free because she maintains the freedom of thought the <UNK> is the one trapped by the state br br this movie was made during the height of the cold war apartheid and at a time when the crimes of many <UNK> throughout the world made daily news it is even more <UNK> in a world where enemy <UNK> are held and <UNK> in secret <UNK> denied legal rights or <UNK> where ethnic <UNK> lays waste to whole societies and <UNK> aid is denied it demonstrates that the individual can stand up to the state or other by <UNK> to give in to fear and terror
<START> this is one of those movies that is so bad it is awesome it has everything an early eighties movie needs <UNK> pants big <UNK> chicks with farrah hair and most importantly ninjas i have a few choice moments to <UNK> for you <UNK> army buddy has a strange monkey like face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw he gets his ass handed to him about every other scene by the thugs wanting his land so he gets drunk through the entire film at one point his farm workers finally return after being run off by the gangster guy's hired <UNK> and frank i think his name is frank is so moved he shouts to the whole group lets have a <UNK> fight and they all <UNK> move to the <UNK> fighting area of the farm to begin the <UNK> this is funny on every level possible whether you take it dirty or literally it still <UNK> my heart another funny thing is sho <UNK> little <UNK> and over animated ninja style movements i remember this dude from when i was a kid and he used to say he was the world's only real ninja he had ads in martial arts magazines if i remember correctly my friends and i were a little ninja crazy during the time this movie came out and i can recall seeing it in the local theater many times i was wondering as i watched this on <UNK> last night why every sleazy american gangster type always has a <UNK> in the <UNK> and wears a white steve martin suit as a matter of fact this guy goes way beyond that in <UNK> all of his thugs to wear white steve martin suits there is a scene where it looks like 20 steve martin <UNK> are attacking a 1970's <UNK> underwear model cole as we wind up for the final battle cole very clumsily breaks into the bad guy's <UNK> and is immediately spotted by a secretary who in turn <UNK> a guard who fires off a round from his <UNK> action shotgun not 30 feet from the bad guys and no one seems to notice or care cole wearing a completely white ninja outfit proceeds to <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> then does a flip right into the area where all the bad guys are the second in charge tells him he didn't need to kill everybody as they were expecting him then gives him a ride to the bad guys huge <UNK> fighting <UNK> don't ask me why <UNK> fighting is a huge part of this movie but it is when they arrive cole is still wearing his ninja mask even though everyone involved knows what he looks like without it the final battle is approaching as cole has killed everybody and now sho as i like to call him reveals himself to have kidnapped <UNK> lady aka <UNK> wife and they meet in the <UNK> <UNK> you ever saw sho then very <UNK> i might add releases said lady and the battle is about to start they do their <UNK> and start <UNK> each other both masked by the way when they join in battle it appears cole becomes someone else <UNK> ala finishing the game a funny spoof on <UNK> bruce lee's game of death cole eventually comes out on top kills sho who dies with honor by being decapitated and all is well next we see cole after ruining everyone's life is about to split town again but not before <UNK> the brutal death of a fat guy with a hook hand and then he inexplicably <UNK> at the camera freeze frame credits done
<START> this series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater <UNK> on this planet being a <UNK> five years in the making one would be hard pressed to expect any less i did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones which is naturally only a minor <UNK> br br david attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative leaving enough room for one's imagination and well <UNK> out so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery if you get the opportunity try not to watch a translated version of this series br br a definite must see for anyone interested in the <UNK> of our blue <UNK> and easily the best documentary on this subject i've ever seen
<START> good actors good director well acted well directed but where's the movie did they have an script or just improvised it all at least it is a short length movie only 80 minutes including credits nothing seems to happen in this film nothing at all a couple of small time drug dealers caught in small time troubles but you'll never get a clue of what's happening nor even what are they talking about in some sequences of the movie tons of f 's and <UNK> 's but nothing else br br for the people who love <UNK> <UNK> films such as the funeral <UNK> <UNK> is going to be a big disappointment as it's been for me what was he thinking about did he really think that this was a good movie and if he didn't then why did he made it
<START> while the new pride prejudice film is gorgeous to view and the soundtrack is lovely we are not seeing jane <UNK> pride and prejudice the film is for some reason set back in the early rather than the <UNK> period where the novel is set as <UNK> have long shown the estate is ram <UNK> and looks like cold comfort farm yet the in the novel are <UNK> class they own a farm but the pig does not walk through the house nor is the of <UNK> and chicken <UNK> <UNK> to the home scenes are re set from the novel and <UNK> we forget jane austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason for example the film puts the big <UNK> <UNK> scene outside in a storm in front of a temple as opposed to inside the <UNK> why did jane austen put it in the because while <UNK> and <UNK> speak with total if brutal honesty to each other in this scene the have never shared an honest word why the rain and the <UNK> <UNK> it looks like jane eyre meeting rochester and when elizabeth walks across a <UNK> field to stand on a cliff and view the <UNK> one expects her to cry <UNK> at any minute austen has been judy <UNK> is a great actress but lady catherine is supposed to be tall and striking the <UNK> tom <UNK> is a brilliant actor but mr collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy looking which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor <UNK> is matthew is another favorite of mine from <UNK> 5 on a e in p p however he is more the young <UNK> never smiling though austen <UNK> in the novel that <UNK> smiles at <UNK> quite a bit and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a <UNK> <UNK> bust and much of <UNK> dialogue is changed to modern speech mr has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why <UNK> would have him as a friend and why jane <UNK> would love him the bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear it <UNK> from jane <UNK> novel so much that any student who watched it thinking she could substitute viewing for reading would fail
<START> i couldn't spoil this piece of crap if i wanted to after watching dark <UNK> 1 i thought this has got to be the worse movie ever made then i watched dark <UNK> 2 and that made 1 seem a little better then i watched dark <UNK> 3 or tried too the only thing i have to say is when is this going to end very bad acting and really bad special effects the only good thing about this movie was the <UNK> shot don't waste your time of money on this piece of crap and now i have to write 3 more lines to get this to submit i was going to sing a song but i can't think of any right now but the movie finally ended though it had an ending that might mean they are going to make another one of these
<START> this is a rip off of already crappy hollywood movies like scream and i know what you did last summer the story is classic some high school students tries a prank on the <UNK> <UNK> but something goes wrong terribly wrong when you watch the movie you know <UNK> happen before it happens all the time not good if a movie tries to be scary the actors are quite ok and the girls are cute after all they're asian so i'll give it two out of five on the
<START> young ambitious nurse ms <UNK> is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere during the course of 3 days she encounters strange happenings even a patient in her bedroom watching her yet she still stays the mental patients are all a little eye rolling by the judge but my favorite was the old crazy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the storyline is okay at best and the acting is surprisingly alright but after awhile it's gets to be a little much but still it's fun quirky strange and original br br note the thing inside the basement is hardly horrifying so the title is a little <UNK>
<START> lance <UNK> has a knack for being the top name in a b movie even in this case starring along side charles <UNK> master control program and joe don baker as always he does a great job of being the bad guy but the plot is just bad don't even get me started about the ending and the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty is it just me or does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute also anytime glass is broken in this movie the editing is so anti phenomenal lastly after watching this i figure david warner is dying for <UNK> 2 0 to finally get the green light br br unfortunately for this will be the third movie i give the rating of 1 10 joining iron eagle iv and no mercy
<START> despite a silly premise ridiculous plot devices and low budget tourist trap br br manages to be striking an inventive beautifully scored film a must see you have to throw <UNK> out the window to fully appreciate what the director was trying to do if you can manage that you will be in for a pleasant surprise also take note that this is one of the few semi classic horror films that wasn't spoiled by numerous sequels
<START> i bought this on vhs as terror hospital and when i got home i checked imdb and was like <UNK> it's the legendary nurse <UNK> so here's another one from al <UNK> who had clearly learned some <UNK> amount about film making since the blood of <UNK> castle days where that earlier effort is a more or less totally <UNK> this one mixes it up a little adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid the incompetence sure half of the movie is a blind post <UNK> football player shooting the <UNK> with his <UNK> nurse but at any moment we might be cutting away to the <UNK> <UNK> head of the <UNK> mastermind or nurse <UNK> running a farmer through with a <UNK> or a wee bit of abstract student film quick cutting to go with the <UNK> blob effects in the possession scene or the most <UNK> half hearted topless bit ever or god knows what else i forget to be honest as dumb ass pieces of sh t go this one runs toward the high end <UNK> al
<START> <UNK> i love this the tale of the cat and the moon doesn't really need an synopsis as that's what it is the cat chasing the moon to a spanish poem it's the artistry that's interesting in fact there was this animated short called the fan and the flower that was an academy award winner last year 2005 yeah almost same thing which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off br br but this is a really good short with stark black white <UNK> shifting and <UNK> into beautiful motion and poetic seduction if you believe cats are poetry in motion see this and you'll believe it more br br also it has such a touching end br br <UNK>
<START> when i first heard that the subject matter for checking out was a self <UNK> suicide party my first thought was how morbid tasteless and then a comedy on top of that i was skeptical but i was dead wrong i totally loved it the cast the funny one liners and especially the surprise ending suicide is a delicate issue but it was handled very well comical yes but tender where it needed to be checking out also deals with other common issues that i believe a lot of families can relate with and it does with <UNK> and humor i highly recommend checking out a must see i look forward to its release to the public
<START> the paul of death wish 3 is very far removed from the paul of the original film if you remember the 1974 film then you will remember was a during the korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution ten years later seems to have learned <UNK> combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time but i ll overlook that <UNK> because is the best of the sequels <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> get shot dead burned alive their teeth <UNK> and thrown to their deaths by middle aged <UNK> armed with sweeping <UNK> yeah i know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they re not racist they re still murdering <UNK> who deserve all they get from and the innocent citizens who needs mayor <UNK> when you <UNK> got paul an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age to <UNK> the streets from the criminal creeps paul i <UNK> you sir
<START> the songs are fantastic and the story line is good like many other acting schools mine also produced hair for most hair production it's a golden opportunity to do nude but my production was fully dressed i don't think full frontal nudity in a movie or a play <UNK> artistic quality and so did the creators of the movie the movie version is great with classic hits following each other while letting the plot develop to the chilling climax a great cast of actors dancers and singers
<START> i'd heard this japanese flick is edgy <UNK> interesting a cool new <UNK> on the asian movie making scene maybe even something as innovative as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or chan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> especially the latter br br you can imagine my disappointment when instead i found the movie disjointed both <UNK> and <UNK> though not in a way that a film <UNK> <UNK> cliché ridden even sadly silly instead of funny on the whole a very bad knock off of the pulp fiction style br br i stopped watching after 30 minutes when i gave up on it becoming something more than it is
<START> i stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the <UNK> late one night it has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later because of the important real life lesson it teaches us about the dark side of human nature and although it tells a true story that takes place in wwii it is amazingly <UNK> to the ugly things happening in europe today br br if you thought ethnic <UNK> as it's called today has anything to do with race or <UNK> you'll think differently after viewing this story br br i guess i'd been pretty naive in thinking that evil follows any <UNK> set of rules evil is as evil does br br this movie teaches a valuable lesson and i recommend it especially to e g church groups or civil rights <UNK> br br i don't expect it will be too easy to find and rent but i'd really like to see it again because there is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal <UNK> of race expertise in this scene the who was taken prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an ss race authority and <UNK> into a room there the two play a sort of guessing game where the ss officer is able to determine where our hero anthony <UNK> character came from and where his <UNK> came from well come to find out that <UNK> character isn't a member of an inferior race after all but to the contrary he's a perfect <UNK> which doesn't mean a whole lot to <UNK> character who is more interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain <UNK> that the ss guy had just been <UNK> nevertheless being a perfect <UNK> <UNK> has its <UNK> among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory where he wears <UNK> <UNK> and into a slave <UNK> job where he gets to wear <UNK> nazi uniforms yeah it's a better gig for sure for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes until the allied <UNK> arrive and recognize his face from magazine covers br br
<START> the movie the cave has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen there was no plot no story line and the lighting was terrible for most of the movie i was unable to make sense of the scenery as it was being <UNK> by <UNK> the <UNK> spaces throughout the movie were <UNK> the only scene that really came through clearly was in the <UNK> lit by what appeared to be a bad <UNK> of the conditions to be found in hell all in all the movie was not really worth watching if the producers cannot come up with something better than this they should find another <UNK> the underwater scenes were particularly awful being mostly made up of <UNK> and <UNK> with the occasional look at the actors in <UNK> a really awful movie with bad lighting <UNK> flashes throughout
<START> and i love it wonder will pick up a cult audience and once it's canceled the dvd sales will go though the roof this is a very funny show in it's own ways it's a parody of children's shows namely <UNK> street our puppet characters consist of a yellow <UNK> monster with a hat whose our host clarence is a blue lizard like thing that does his own segments where he goes out on the streets him is a weird dog like thing that refers to himself in the third person is the smart one whose brain always shows then there's the <UNK> and the pink puppet it's a very funny show not really as nasty as you'd expect but more the situations they take 7 year olds out on the street tell them what to say and have them make mean jokes that they don't understand my favorite segments are <UNK> videos especially when somebody doesn't want to be filmed i prefer tv <UNK> which was a similar show but this is still a very funny show that i hope lasts for years to come br br my rating 1 4 out of 30 mins tv ma
<START> i went to see random hearts with 3 friends and at first i thought maybe it was just me who wasn't enjoying the movie after all i didn't like as good as it gets and that movie won all sorts of awards well it wasn't just me none of my friends liked it either it was unbelievable slow much like getting teeth pulled the only action that is in the movie is what is in previews we didn't walk out of the theatre because we all assumed something more would happen we weren't as smart as the 7 or 8 people who did walk out i have never walked out on a movie in my life but i definitely should have this is all tough for me to write considering i am relatively easy to please when it comes to movies it takes a lot for me to think a movie is awesome but not much for me to just like it this movie didn't even come close in the like category not only was the movie about 2 hours too long but it was like two separate trite stories in one but they weren't smoothly <UNK> together plus the soundtrack if you could even call it that was so annoying like seinfeld has the same riff that is played over and over again difference being that i like seinfeld this movie had this jazz riff that it kept playing which sounded highly inappropriate at times especially when people were dealing with the deaths of the plane crash hard to explain what i mean but trust me it was awful i cannot say enough to make people not waste their money after i left the theatre i honestly wanted to write to the movie company and demand my 7 back <UNK> i could have gone <UNK> or something for that money
<START> i agree with all the mentioned in the other reviews but there are some beats missing here that keep it firmly inside the genre of crime drama or film noir and limit it from being a great drama beyond the limits of the elements that make up film noir not to say that the great film <UNK> aren't can't shouldn't be also great dramas but this one isn't br br one other note the music in the film is used <UNK> but i would say is used to <UNK> the action more frequently than the wife elements br br great set up to this film by the way with an abrupt sort of non ending ending that is either just right or a let down depends br br spoilers follow as to some <UNK> br br the big turn in the story involves the children seeing their mother die or it should be the big moment but the children are never shown to react one way or the other neither cries neither asks their father what happened the kids are good actors and the reactions of the father are i suppose what matters but this is a big <UNK> this is the heart of the story and the kids are kept mostly blank in their reaction they really just have none in the next scene they look as if nothing happened br br in like fashion there is a bond that forms between <UNK> and <UNK> characters <UNK> says he knew the partner who was killed but this is never explained and has no impact dramatically on <UNK> or anyone else the <UNK> romantic subplot also <UNK> credibility though it's convincingly acted <UNK> character just lets <UNK> involve a total stranger in their escape plan for no reason he doesn't even comment or seem to notice another gap br br the ending to the movie and i won't spoil it the ending happens off screen with a <UNK> voice over to tell you what happened i guess this tries to make it feel more true to life but again like these other <UNK> leaves drama off screen br br what's the point of not dealing with these issues i don't know other than maybe the goals of the film were limited to giving the audience what it wants from a crime melodrama suggest some deeper elements then move on to ignore them br br too bad there is much to recommend this film <UNK> is very very good but too bad it could have been a great drama as well as a crime story as with imdb favorite movie of all time the godfather this film had potential would make for a good remake though if done in the u s more problems would probably sink the film but in the hands of the right director this would be a good remake though it's <UNK> <UNK> performance could be topped br br so worth seeing but frustrating as a whole
<START> i was 19 in 1970 when it came out and having heard how funny it was when it came out and reading the reviews here i finally rented it and watched it i didn't laugh once a very unfunny flick and i usually love <UNK> i cannot for the life of me figure why this is seen as funny i had not one chuckle and i love comedies oh well at least now i know what all the shouting was about not my idea of a comedy go rent the <UNK> or the love nest by buster keaton now those are comedy classics if you rent this one have a back up rental so your whole evening isn't a loss score 3 out of 10
<START> <UNK> visconti has become famous to the world after his marvelous production the <UNK> movie fans got to know the style of the director who introduced himself as one among the post war new <UNK> an aristocrat who developed his individual free thinking and consequently expressed them as an artist however when applied to this movie <UNK> a <UNK> based upon the novel by thomas mann it's a slightly different story br br the entire film is at first view so unique so psychological and so much influenced by the various thoughts of an artist both director and main character <UNK> von that it seems to be unwatchable for many viewers therefore such opinions about the movie rose as being too slow <UNK> or endless boredom why the reason seems to lie in a significant view <UNK> nowadays good movie is parallel to flawless action here it would be appropriate to say good movie is parallel to no action as a matter of fact everyone would be able to say one sentence about the whole movie's content and that would suffice all that we find in <UNK> a <UNK> has a sense of vague reality filled with both and <UNK> that appear to be significant for the sake of each single moment and it is so when we notice the psychedelic scenes in <UNK> when we see <UNK> at the <UNK> station when we are <UNK> with his intensely emotional memories the insight into his <UNK> mind is sometimes so intense that the only way for the viewer to go on watching the film is to do his her best to feel and experience rather than see and think all is doomed to fade to <UNK> like flowers on <UNK> when their time comes in other words all has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogs as a result it is quite unlikely that you will get the idea of the movie after a single viewing it must be seen more than twice with the mind that is constantly open if you'll like it or not that's a different story very personal one br br the artistic values are the factor that is noticeable at first sight and stays with us throughout beauty as something very meaningful for the main character that appears to come and leave rest as something he's heading for so badly and which comes to him in the most unexpected way feeling that he finds in a teenage boy who appears as a model of all the dreams and desires as a forbidden fruit of homosexual lust which <UNK> the costume designer <UNK> does a splendid job in this movie through lots of wonderful wardrobe he supplies us with a very realistic view of <UNK> when the action takes place the cinematographer <UNK> de <UNK> provides us with a terrific visual experience that can be called a real feast for the eyes and in the background comes <UNK> music the composer whose life inspired thomas mann to introduce the character br br the performances are top notch particularly from <UNK> bogart as the main character <UNK> von who wants a rest after hard artistic job and <UNK> attempts to find it in crowded <UNK> for the majority of the film we have a great insight into his thoughts feelings and acts of anger <UNK> and despair though sometimes depressing he keeps us on the right track till the end not losing hope for the less tragic end <UNK> depicts the model of <UNK> homosexual desire but also a model of beauty and <UNK> that appears to last pretty short <UNK> it was all too short says the main character a great though very controversial job is done by mark burns as a sort of super ego alfred with whom <UNK> <UNK> about such ideals as beauty justice hope human dignity for alfred beauty belongs to the senses how <UNK> yet how dangerous the idea might be and ever present in artistic italian movies of the time here as an elegant lady from <UNK> mother br br memorable moments indeed <UNK> the movie's strong points yet not all viewers will find them unforgettable they similarly to the whole odd movie require much effort to get onto the right track in director's individual ego and within the four walls of his psyche among such scenes i consider the beach sequence pretty important particularly the way <UNK> <UNK> the physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage to come closer i also appreciate the shots when <UNK> is sitting in the <UNK> and the city's view moves in the background how <UNK> that may raise existential thoughts of transfer aren't we people a sort of in the world in the journey that life is br br in the end i must tell you one important thing i had found <UNK> a <UNK> extremely weird until i started to look deeper at what the director is really trying to convey then every scene turned out to be meaningful in its interpretation with which you don't have to agree i hardly agree with anything the main character does but you should at least tolerate this as something the author badly wanted to say listen to his voice allow him for a few words in one page of reality br br therefore there is a long way towards understanding the film since not many movies like that were being made in 1971 and are being made now <UNK> it seems that we are all bound to have the right feelings about this film in the long run similarly to that we are all bound to experience once a strange <UNK> usually unexpected reality that death is 7 10
<START> this is a great italian shark movie probably not a full action type of shark movie but it has a great story about a native american in the form of a killer shark that attacks a small beach community the movie has actual scenes of real sharks and some not but how they made it is pretty good the cast are not that brilliant of acting in this shark film but it it shows better acting in some other italian shark movies such as e g cruel jaws last shark they show some pretty bad acting but most italian shark movies are good which means this votes best as the best italian shark movie ever some scenes in this movie show violence gore which makes this film good that it shows it so i would say this is the best film for all shark movie fans
<START> or fires on the plain is a film that is so excellent on so many levels that not enough good things can be said about it my only regret is that i was not able to see this 1959 film sooner br br being something of a film <UNK> i tend to look at films for their artistic merits based upon dialog acting photography and even the efforts to remain true to the period in terms of costume ultimately i want to know if the film is truthful enough in revealing the human condition to make me think without <UNK> me with what the director wants me to think br br fires on the plain is a great film because it <UNK> a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe br br film is a <UNK> of war on all levels as any good war film should be war is horrifying bloody destructive it is also murderous on the psyche however what is fundamental about fires on the plain is its <UNK> look at the japanese soldiers it shows them slowly <UNK> under the weight of superior american <UNK> and their <UNK> inability to <UNK> a war of its own making a <UNK> code <UNK> death before surrender is at the heart of this madness br br i was <UNK> to see such an honest and brutally close look at the bitter <UNK> of <UNK> military <UNK> made just 14 years after the end of what the japanese call the great pacific war <UNK> reveals what the germans called the war life the plight of the common soldier br br film is interesting since even today japan is having a hard time fully coming to terms with its wartime <UNK> its <UNK> of <UNK> peoples the racism of its war against the chinese and war crimes which included <UNK> by soldiers and officers <UNK> not only against one another but against allied prisoners of war br br <UNK> produces a stark representation of the <UNK> of soldiers by a of bad political decisions and cultural <UNK> br br this stark examination is <UNK> done by portraying the doomed soldiers as human beings who exhibit at various times fear brilliantly <UNK> humor dialog <UNK> by its and a plot whose complexity is <UNK> by the grim wilderness setting br br portrait is a <UNK> and painful <UNK> of defeated men the <UNK> <UNK> played as a <UNK> and gentle soul by is a good soldier who can't abandon his humanity though he is as frightened and lost as his <UNK> before he <UNK> for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy <UNK> is given a hand <UNK> by a superior who <UNK> the <UNK> of their situation <UNK> <UNK> to kill himself br br why hopelessly ill <UNK> and <UNK> incapable unit was not ordered to surrender at the start of the film is telling <UNK> makes it plain that the war is over and everyone is merely waiting to die as <UNK> leaves his unit for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation he sees his <UNK> <UNK> digging an air raid shelter they appear like corpses looking up from their own mass grave br br we later watch as the <UNK> <UNK> medical staff <UNK> the dying patients to an all <UNK> american <UNK> <UNK> the pathetic patients who crawl from their <UNK> in a vain attempt to survive appear like pathetic <UNK> creatures dragging themselves from an <UNK> force you know they won't survive br br <UNK> makes it plain that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by <UNK> its humanity and its <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> through the <UNK> of <UNK> we encounter the noble the dying and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat one another rather than surrender to american <UNK> br br when the men do talk of surrender the propaganda of how americans kills prisoners is <UNK> by a <UNK> wise soldier who reveals that the approaching americans feed and care for prisoners of war because they unlike the japanese respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up br br it is the japanese who intend to die fighting for the emperor long after resistance has lost all meaning those willing to fight to the death will be killed it is the <UNK> of war br br after shooting a murderous and <UNK> <UNK> whom he earlier offered his own body to as food the <UNK> <UNK> surrender also seems to be an intentional form of suicide his death is a lonely image was <UNK> trying to tell us of the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live but who is still trapped by his <UNK> <UNK> cultural <UNK> br br if someone watches this film carefully he or she will see that and <UNK> is the enemy the americans are portrayed as a <UNK> advanced people willing to employ that technology in the form of <UNK> military power a lesson that transformed japanese <UNK> society film isn't so shallow that it america <UNK> the layers of <UNK> destructive <UNK> that created the war and then to continue it when all was lost br br <UNK> does not mention the nuclear weapons dropped upon <UNK> and <UNK> he doesn't have to the slow motion destruction of the <UNK> japanese army in the <UNK> reveals the <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> what can i say about this film other than the narrative is one of the most exciting in film history and based on a true story being old enough to remember the berlin wall when it was still used to contain a country this film gives you a dark insight into the grim <UNK> of east and their desperate attempts to escape no matter what the cost the film follows the lives of two families who decide to escape using a hot air balloon <UNK> by themselves forever <UNK> arrest by the authorities under <UNK> by <UNK> they have to <UNK> a plan to reach the other side of the wall a tense thrilling story of courage and determination which truly pays homage to all those who succeeded and failed the <UNK> journey to west berlin and freedom
<START> br br i rented this movie on 20 june 2001 and watched it for about 45 minutes i <UNK> that watching a blank screen would be delightful by comparison there was not a single person in the cast for whom i would have shed a tear if hell itself had opened up and <UNK> the whole bunch of them br br so i e <UNK> all of my friends and relatives warning them and i am taking the time to urge everyone who may see this note to avoid this movie like the plague i have seen some really bad movies in my time but never one as bad as this
<START> after <UNK> gives a quick <UNK> of micheal myers we flashback to 1989 where jamie is kidnapped by the man in black before the burning police station explodes micheal returns to once again to find jamie and his baby in this version the <UNK> character gets more scenes and seems much more pro active than he is in the final cut the score is much better more in line with parts 4 and 5 none of the electric guitar <UNK> and the ending makes a tad more sense for these reasons coupled with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense and cuts back on the gore factor halloween unlike say the friday the 13th was never about blatant gore is why i prefer this <UNK> <UNK> cut not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold it just <UNK> the turd a little bit and makes it more <UNK> the whole cult plot is still very stupid as is micheal <UNK> a kid br br my <UNK> cut grade c br br my theatrical cut grade d
