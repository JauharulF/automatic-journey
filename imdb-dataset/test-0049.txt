<START> i have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it despite the lack of excitement in the plot the acting was very good by everyone involved amy <UNK> played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired yet well <UNK> and determined to make up for her younger daughter's condition yet in the process she has neglected her older sister who is more interested in playing with her <UNK> syndrome sibling and living in a world of <UNK> br br the men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles christopher lloyd in a very understated role shows us why he has such <UNK> he plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research yet <UNK> for a meaningful relationship he and <UNK> connect very well in their scenes together yet both know nothing more can come from their friendship their <UNK> goodbye is nothing short of brilliant an acting lesson for aspiring performers br br and in a small role fred savage is fun to watch br br you can tell why this movie was based on a play it's probably very good on stage on screen it's not particularly exciting but it's nonetheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties
<START> i know that this show gave a lot of <UNK> to women in the late <UNK> and early <UNK> but come on you have a <UNK> a buzz kill and an over <UNK> this show really made women look bad i cannot stand <UNK> <UNK> every little thing on this show and that's what really killed it for me also <UNK> whining about her nonexistent <UNK> made my ears hurt and <UNK> cynicism was a complete buzz kill i mean can't she just be happy samantha was the only cool one on the show and the only one worth watching there was also a good episode when nathan lane was on the show but that was the only one worth watching the rest of them were pretty much the same the humor was <UNK> than a bucket of sand and not very interesting plot line all in all not a very good show and i'm glad it's over
<START> jack frost 2 is out of the question i'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies br br as sam and his wife take to the for a relaxing christmas jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with <UNK> br br don't take a at this film at all most people say its a laugh with your mates but its a waste of time if the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story especially the cheesy character names
<START> let me get this straight br br <UNK> plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while <UNK> a from her face and ends up falling in love with recently separated bed and breakfast <UNK> within about 24 hours of meeting her due to her solid advice on <UNK> manner br br wow move over the <UNK> there's a new kid in town br br where to begin well how about the depth of this relationship i think we can safely sum up the foundation of this <UNK> love in the following steps br br 1 exchange polite over a bite of <UNK> 2 drink <UNK> amounts of jack daniels play basketball with old food 3 provide <UNK> <UNK> advice to each other on your crappy lives 4 make love during a <UNK> 5 <UNK> your lives to each other via br br i noticed george c <UNK> has the <UNK> and united <UNK> west project in his would stick to your genre be too harsh enough said i think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry or laugh or even hope but the reason they are able to do that is that somewhere during the storyline we really start to care about the characters we're watching on screen to make us care there must be time spent developing these characters their lives their history why we're watching them now <UNK> didn't seem to want to waste our time with such <UNK> and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before <UNK> us into an intense one on one interaction between two actors we've all come to adore but two characters we could care less about br br for one brief tender moment when richard gere <UNK> that he doesn't expect her to listen to his problems and she invites him for dinner the viewer sees a <UNK> a beginning of something special between these two characters but instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and <UNK> of what happens next in the wonderful unpredictable joy that is <UNK> we are instead pushed <UNK> into a love affair between two people we hardly know br br let's face it we have all heard cheesy one liners in romantic films but the reason we cut some slack to bogart in casablanca or nicholson in <UNK> gotta give is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters and by the time they deliver the line we're so deeply involved with their plight we don't even notice the cheese factor since <UNK> doesn't allow us to love or even like our protagonists all we're left with a <UNK> <UNK> and a few <UNK> in the audience br br <UNK> takes the old hollywood director's phrase cut to the chase much too literally here as each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast the viewer is left wondering if director <UNK> is <UNK> saying to the audience c'mon it's a richard gere romance just buy in br br it is as a result of this stunning lack of character or relationship development that the film's climax fails miserably to <UNK> at our hearts when <UNK> character dies i felt like i was watching the news about someone i didn't know passing away or watching a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> race during the <UNK> <UNK> just didn't care br br epic fail
<START> black and white satire of a madison <UNK> ad agency being taken over by blacks they're headed by arnold johnson who is determined to change things however he turns out to be even worse than his white predecessors that's about as original as this gets br br i'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today the jokes are either unfunny the president is a midget how is this funny cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters it's done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to take or understand the movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along the ending comes out of nowhere to make it worse with the sole exception of johnson all the acting is bad antonio <UNK> a regular in these types of films is especially annoying as the arab this gets three stars because the commercial parodies done in bright color are amusing and there's a rare good line here and there i heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good skip it unless you're in experimental 1960s films
<START> everyone i know loves this movie but i am afraid that i don't i hated this film so much that i had to turn it off mid film because of the <UNK> way too much time is spent on and emotional <UNK> the point of the <UNK> character being <UNK> by her divorce is <UNK> into the viewer's head <UNK> enough already and why didn't we hear more about her ex husband he is portrayed as nothing but a suit who comes by once in a while something must of made her want to marry him what was it what is it about him that makes her so <UNK> upon their divorce more time could of been spent on that rather than yet one more shot of <UNK> lying <UNK> on the bedroom floor the dialogue is stilted cliched and terrible much like one of those corny abc <UNK> <UNK> or something there is no imagination or creativity about anything in this film it is all very predictable and therefore boring this movie also goes into <UNK> on the factor very stupid and not funny like it was supposed to be this is just another one of those horribly done i am woman hear me <UNK> films much like waiting to <UNK> if you want to see i am woman hear me <UNK> films that are truly entertaining original and well done then see gas food <UNK> or ruby in paradise skip this crap i give hope <UNK> 3 10
<START> i like steven seagal but i have not a clue what this movie was about i am not easily lost with movies but i had no idea who was on who's side br br hopefully some of his future movies will be a little better my wife still thinks he looks good in black <UNK> however p
<START> to sum it all up skip end of days and watch rent roman <UNK> the <UNK> gate instead this movie is the perfect stereotypical american movie vs <UNK> gate being the perfect stereotypical european movie br br <UNK> gate noir ish intelligent nicely scored atmospheric excellent acting johnny <UNK> <UNK> beautiful scenery good cinematography funny one liners intellectual minimal foul language thought provoking the only fault is it that a few people didn't understand the open ended ending and said the movie was crappy because of that and there were a couple of questionable scenes br br end of days overly violent liberal use of foul language no musical score except for a poor attempt at a commercial soundtrack that was only heard when gabriel <UNK> stalked around nyc as satan but all you could pick out was jonathan davis <UNK> screaming sex that had nothing to do with the plot violence incredibly predictable violence and did i mention lots more violence i guess some of the special effects were good but that's about it br br well maybe i'm wrong but i thought <UNK> gate was far more interesting quirky original and intelligent but maybe americans don't need need that dripping with cynicism even though i am an american sometimes i wonder
<START> 1st watched 10 10 2009 8 out of 10 <UNK> billy wilder spectacular rendering of famous flight by james stewart as <UNK> and director billy wilder there isn't really a whole lot of background built into this story but that's ok because wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie this early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what <UNK> went thru in this 33 hour solo flight across the atlantic and he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before which is amazing there is a little <UNK> about how he purchased the plane and got the <UNK> and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight the story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite it's age i appreciate the fact that they didn't throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself well done throughout this is a classic movie that should be viewed by all
<START> william shakespeare's <UNK> of <UNK> portrays <UNK> century <UNK> al pacino plays <UNK> a jewish <UNK> shark who plots revenge on a catholic that has looked down on him the movie is a slow moving plot in the beginning that builds up throughout the two plus hours the film gives a very good and believe appearance to it's characters especially pacino when hearing that pacino plays a jew one might think that it would not work looking at <UNK> previous mobster type movie roles nonetheless it works very well credit must be given to the costume <UNK> and director's of the film the look of all the characters fits well with the time period the play takes place in the costumes look like the renaissance appearance one might <UNK> to be br br the film portrays a very anti <UNK> vibe from the first minute to the last it is shown how the try to take advantage of the jews in every way they can even to the point of keeping them locked away in <UNK> and not allowing them to regular jobs in comparison to the passion of the christ another recent film that people believed to be very anti <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> makes passion look like a jewish holiday the film shows how the jews or at least <UNK> wanted revenge for the <UNK> that the jews received the location shots also seem very <UNK> and the scenery is at times very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film making it just that much more realistic showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti <UNK> because the ugly is usually shown around the jews and the beautiful around the <UNK> br br although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura certain parts do add a bit of humor to the act the oh so serious trial between <UNK> and antonio <UNK> adds a bit of humor when collins and <UNK> come into the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated that in itself might not be funny but seeing it that they were women dressed up in disguise as men one might find it to be pretty amusing the whole cross dressing scene as compelling as it was could have probably been even more memorable had the make up artists and director michael <UNK> taken notice that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized the director also could have seen into the fact that the women are speaking through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men which in part takes away from the scene but doesn't kill it entirely br br overall the film gets a 7 out of 10
<START> this is the 1990's tv show not the movie from 1979 it looks to be three episodes <UNK> just under 90 minutes before watching i thought it was one of the movie versions and i noticed right away it had a tv show feel to it i didn't care for it too much i just felt the story wasn't there and there wasn't much in the way of excitement or drama i was looking at the time <UNK> on my dvd player frequently as i was really bored i also thought some of the dialogue was to put it <UNK> not good plus i thought the acting left a lot to be desired but that's just me however it is good clean wholesome family entertainment there's certainly nothing offensive here kids will likely enjoy it for me the black <UNK> is 4 10
<START> it was a fascinating story waiting to be told fat man and little boy takes us inside the trials and <UNK> of a group of top american scientists handed a <UNK> task during the second world war beat everyone else to the atomic bomb <UNK> in a heavily <UNK> new mexico compound the <UNK> slowly turn the idea from ambitious concept into immense reality br br fat man and little boy is one of those films that requires your close attention it's a real thinking person's movie not only from the scientific aspect of developing a seemingly impossible weapon but also the moral <UNK> of <UNK> to killing on a massive scale characters are constantly torn between that reality and their wartime duty as americans the film is never preachy about however leaving us free to marvel at the <UNK> of the inner turmoil these men face the performances deserve special mention as well paul newman delivers one of his great understated performances as the general in charge of delivering the ultimate big stick for the allied forces br br where fat man and little boy loses much of its <UNK> is in the unnecessary romantic <UNK> dwight <UNK> as the leader of the scientific team struggles with his affections for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project director <UNK> apparently felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story but the romantic overtones serve primarily as a distraction besides it's the interaction among the scientists and their military <UNK> that give us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men br br still it's difficult not to recommend fat man and little boy it's a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face put on one of the most intriguing stories in human history
<START> forget any angst ridden documentary this film is really an out and out comedy about a 40 <UNK> old porn star whose goal in life is to sing <UNK> circuit party songs the only problem <UNK> ford can't sing and the film cuts away whenever he appears to be ready to burst into song yet ford and equally vapid boyfriend blake <UNK> <UNK> and and run around in their tank tops determined to make dreams come true even funnier is manager kyle who appears to have the i q of a <UNK> and whose <UNK> <UNK> lips look like a <UNK> <UNK> him how can grown men be so self <UNK> ha ha as for the documentary the filmmakers don't appear to have any <UNK> and the film is poorly structured and wildly uneven very little background information is provided about the three leads such an inclusion might have made the three seem like something other than aging west hollywood stereotypes
<START> peter <UNK> rarely seen punishment park is a brutality laced <UNK> political weapon set across a never ending an <UNK> left <UNK> anti <UNK> abuse fest the <UNK> at first appear to be so over the top <UNK> and sickening that it could come off as some distant <UNK> <UNK> alternate history one harry would even enjoy but once we delve deeper in and really pay attention to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out of those <UNK> over the <UNK> topped <UNK> as well as the shotgun <UNK> guards <UNK> the bloody affair our eyes are truly opened suddenly we realize just how <UNK> <UNK> film making is as much of this is the kind of neo con talking points about youth culture and the <UNK> of <UNK> thought tossed around by politicians today granted much of it was drivel <UNK> out then as well but it really shows us how little has changed and informs of how in some ways we are closer to such a world where punishment parks would be a real and frightening operation br br the main players in nearly every scene are seasoned non actors mostly chosen for their <UNK> political views and desire to get them on camera this lends an <UNK> heap of authenticity to the entire experience as we never even for a second question the reality of all the chaos shot documentary style with <UNK> film this appears like a gritty <UNK> of some despicable government test project that was classified until found years later at least it appears to have that history to it now maybe not as much when it was barely released but this gives an added weight to all the proceedings and helps draw you into this incredible not so alternate universe of torture for convicted
<START> tom <UNK> uses <UNK> in his book red storm rising in the book was show in theatres across russia as a <UNK> to the soviet invasion of west germany i felt i had to check it out it was the cinematography was magnificent and storyline incredible i do not regret watching this movie and added in to my collection
<START> i had to lower my rating of this movie to a 4 due to the terrible sound track i'm pretty sure it was not a problem with me or the tape because some actors and the sound track sounded great but most of the actors voices were distorted or <UNK> beyond recognition especially for non brits br br there are plenty of cute little twists that would make this an enjoyable movie ending up in <UNK> by mistake is great but much of the humor was lost in the sound
<START> this is a clever story about relationships and a display of three main categories of players in the game of relationships <UNK> max manipulative women alice and the fools who may be indeed in love lisa muriel and <UNK> br br max and alice are very unlikeable and perhaps despicable characters but who are always in control in the game leaving their partners around in the dark but as the <UNK> discussed ending tells us as veteran players as max and alice were they would be happy to part ways anytime they see fit as if the game was just announced to be over and each one of them could not care less to get on with his or her own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented itself lisa muriel and <UNK> might be the ones who felt like <UNK> something real in a relationship only not being able to realise that they were the <UNK> in the game and the ultimate losers as far as what we were shown is concerned who knows if they are also advance players of some sort in their worlds not shown to us on screen br br this is a very fast paced <UNK> crafted and <UNK> witty story with an <UNK> execution by the cast it also deserves some deeper thinking how much is real in a game of relationship
<START> this was pretty bad from bad acting bad technical details bad camera shots and bad audio even though i was watching a dvd sometimes i couldn't hear what they were saying sometimes it was blowing my <UNK> even within the same conversation the plot was predictable and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable <UNK> <UNK> and caricatures character development was awful the <UNK> little sister why was she even written into the script the <UNK> mom again what purpose the whiny girlfriend why didn't he dump her long ago the <UNK> gang how original couldn't think of a better name i guess the drug <UNK> hot girlfriend gotta have a hot <UNK> if your going to have la gangs i guess but really etc etc can't believe i watched the whole thing
<START> to quote jason connery and mark ryan on one of the many dvd <UNK> that <UNK> music over the <UNK> <UNK> was enough to get me jumping from whatever i was doing to <UNK> my face against the screen for an hour the individual stories contained within the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful robin of goes through a very convincing journey over the two series he appears in even though his departure from the programme was <UNK> <UNK> also develops her relationship with both of sons very well br br after <UNK> for many years in tv <UNK> i re encountered the series on sky 1 in the uk in the mid nineties and was even more impressed that the series seemed even better than i remembered this is no children's television programme it deals with witchcraft <UNK> rebellion and injustice and it manages to do it without showing too much blood as far as i can recall you only see a bit of the red stuff in the pilot film episodes 1 and 2 on the dvd set the dvds are great containing a wealth of extras including cast <UNK> on series 3 only the jason connery robin and crew <UNK> for series 1 and 2 the picture quality is very good and the <UNK> and <UNK> surround sound is amazing br br the idea of freedom is important freedom <UNK> <UNK> forgotten <UNK> ever forgotten
<START> left behind when the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> makes any man whose sexual advances are forced upon her <UNK> disappear <UNK> this is my career <UNK> is an attractive enough although i found her acting chops to be suspect with better direction and a better vehicle she might improve likely as not her leading man paul mine too <UNK> never will proving to be one of the most unlikeable unattractive love interests i've seen in a film in recent memory there's some nonsense involving <UNK> twins a <UNK> pan to the head obvious hot dog joke a reasonable amount of bare <UNK> production values in the low budget to laughable range scripting that would make <UNK> field cry acting that by and large only an ed wood could love and camera work a step above pedestrian the <UNK> gimmick might well have made for an interesting horror movie but angst <UNK> the premise strictly for stoned out viewing and even then you could do much better law or revelation still holds
<START> even with it's low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here it started out pretty good and fairly engaging and believable the actors and characters were interesting although there wasn't much character development my favorite scene was when they were all eating their <UNK> some seemed to hate it and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad the story starts out very <UNK> and then br br and then it <UNK> into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on no real believable end game for the villain no real explanation of what's going on generally if a movie has to use the f word for every other word it usually <UNK> down from there too i still get offended believe it or not i often wonder what <UNK> people to make bad sci fi isn't there a universe of fantastically good stories out there don't people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone else's when they put out stuff like this why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this no female actors characters either none at all this had the <UNK> to be another predator but alas fell far far short br br my final comment poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real <UNK> what gives br br my advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there make sure you got a good story before you start and edit out bad special effects it's better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy
<START> in <UNK> in <UNK> mine <UNK> the cruel owner of a mine uses poor children in the exploration and after an explosion a group of children is buried alive on the present days karen <UNK> has just lost her husband after a long period of <UNK> disease when the family <UNK> have been spent in the treatment without any money she moves with her daughters sarah <UNK> taylor <UNK> and emma chloe to an old house in the mountains that <UNK> to her husband karen is advised by her neighbors to stay at home in the night and sarah hears that there are zombies in the area when emma becomes friend of mary he mother believes she is an imaginary friend however when <UNK> friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and emma <UNK> karen and sarah chase her nearby the mine br br wicked little things is not a totally bad movie the acting is good the make up is creepy and the cinematography and the music score are excellent however the story and consequently the screenplay are very weak indeed a bad collection of clichés the beginning is reasonable with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all their resources with the illness of the <UNK> but when she arrives <UNK> the little zombies attack people without any consequences for example families do not search the missing persons then the wicked mr <UNK> comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes a typical clichés that he will die in the end there is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing mr <UNK> when sarah is running away with her mother and says that she is tired and cannot run anymore it is one the most stupid lines that i have ever seen in a horror movie my vote is four br br title brazil zombies
<START> taken the idea out of a true <UNK> incident the wind and the lion is a very good adventure film set in the <UNK> of africa br br el sean connery head of an arab tribe kidnaps an american woman <UNK> <UNK> and her two children to obtain some <UNK> for his country out of american president theodore <UNK> brian keith out of this simple plot john <UNK> gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre br br the <UNK> <UNK> locations an impressive color photography very well handled action sequences and perfect settings turn the picture in a sort of epic one with an <UNK> sense of greatness the musical score is also remarkable an fits <UNK> br br sean connery is very good as the arab leader and <UNK> he can handle almost any kind of role so is <UNK> <UNK> as the woman who shows strength under dangerous circumstances but deep inside is scared and has her weaknesses she gets to admire connery and even understand his complete different focus on life <UNK> from their also completely different cultures brian keith plays one of his best roles ever as american president teddy <UNK> br br most entertaining and very good cinematographic <UNK> in the genre give it chance you won't regret it
<START> ok by the time you read this i might have stopped crying this movie was so horrible as to be quite <UNK> the creatures are kinda cute but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing <UNK> among the prisoners and their guard after getting <UNK> on this <UNK> island even seeing barbara bach with her hair all was no payoff for buying this sterling bit of <UNK> she goes about with a <UNK> i've never used my voice before that just don't wash when one is screaming bloody murder hey the leading man was cute too but i'm still not <UNK> this is a cry into your beer ripoff of the good <UNK> island of dr <UNK> poor richard johnson who was surely born for better things is just <UNK> bad as the bad guy i mean how bad can a bad guy be ask richard johnson joseph <UNK> tries hard not to look embarrassed as he <UNK> through his cameo appearance in the name of all that's holy don't rent this <UNK> bomb
<START> a somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era obviously it was first conceived into this world for the stage but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end peter o'toole and <UNK> york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it all in all though a good film in which peter o'toole and <UNK> york get to <UNK>
<START> a grumpy old happily <UNK> decides to send for his three grown up <UNK> children and provide them a home at his <UNK> to his surprise he finds himself bonding with his <UNK> american daughter can he find satisfaction in his new role as the bachelor father br br this 1931 film in which he gives a <UNK> performance marked the arrival at mgm of elderly sir c <UNK> smith very soon to be one of hollywood's most valuable character actors with his great hooked nose <UNK> sir <UNK> looked every inch the part of the duke or general or <UNK> he would play so often the acknowledged leader of the british community in hollywood sir <UNK> would also champion the game of in southern california he would remain very much in demand in studios all over town right up to his death in 1948 br br the film's top billed star is marion davies best remembered today as the mistress of media <UNK> william randolph <UNK> the of <UNK> castle the most fabulous <UNK> on the west coast she was actually a very talented pretty <UNK> for a few years <UNK> attempted to make her the queen of mgm with her own production company a huge <UNK> dressing room but the studio already had several other queens <UNK> garbo <UNK> crawford and he eventually moved her to warner bros here miss davies gets a chance to joke clown and her scenes with sir <UNK> are entertaining br br her love interest is played by ralph forbes a handsome young british actor who was just starting to find good films the trail of as the silent days ended he had all the qualities for major stardom but sadly it was not to be celebrity would come to ray <UNK> here making one of his first screen appearances <UNK> doris lloyd also appear to advantage
<START> this movie attempts many things but never really <UNK> anything the plot time travels <UNK> and weaves along without really satisfying it left a hollow is that all feeling at the end unless its free to air and there is nothing else on forget about it
<START> this movie is <UNK> and would probably appeal to children today even if there isn't a jedi in the entire thing of course elizabeth taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is great too even mickey rooney is good so are anne <UNK> and angela lansbury the world was a different place when this movie was released and it certainly is a great place to visit
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed <UNK> from heaven the hopes and dreams and perspectives of each of the characters is endearing and we the audience get to know each and every one of them <UNK> and all and the ending was a great wonderful and uplifting surprise thanks for the experience i'll be looking forward to more

<START> with al <UNK> at the height of his popularity and warner the jazz singer having been the highest <UNK> film of <UNK> it was inevitable that the other studios would <UNK> out a few vehicles for their own <UNK> esquire characters but while the jazz singer was a sensation for its being the first part <UNK> the <UNK> idol lacks the singing voice of its star the now obscure <UNK> walker and has to make do with just his visual antics br br the <UNK> idol was an early directorial assignment for the renowned frank <UNK> <UNK> first couple of full length features for harry <UNK> reveal a very <UNK> excessive style which made <UNK> already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable a couple of pictures later and <UNK> has <UNK> to ease off a bit with some fairly regular and decent camera work however he still shows no <UNK> for shooting physical comedy the longest comic routine the stage performance seems to have a few good gags but it's all cut up into lots of different camera angles and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances <UNK> a good portion of the jokes are in the <UNK> but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funny br br of course <UNK> would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect he cuts down the line closing in on walker and <UNK> love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his don wilson get up neatly establishing the <UNK> connection between them then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the <UNK> which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in <UNK> early 30s <UNK> br br <UNK> walker <UNK> answer to al <UNK> is not an exceptional talent his comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out <UNK> love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too with a very <UNK> face kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys there's also a good role for lionel <UNK> that <UNK> and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late <UNK> and early 30s br br the <UNK> idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces in and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece and like most of <UNK> work before he met robert a disappointment

<START> simon pg 13 thriller about a babysitter who gets disturbing prank calls while sitting at a mansion is neither original nor exciting enough to be called a good film although there are some elements of suspense good eye candy and decent characters the film is just another i know what you did last summer as it falls short of being taken seriously the performances were alright but nothing special with this flick i say skip it unless you are looking for a mediocre movie you can find better films than this on lifetime sometimes okay maybe not lifetime but at least usa or <UNK> haha br br 7 10

<START> a terrible movie that is amateurish on almost every level a boring and derivative screenplay filled with stereotyped characters played by embarrassed actors for a director lacking the most <UNK> understanding of his craft the whole thing stinks it plays like a slasher movie from the early eighties down to the crappy score and <UNK> <UNK> but without the childhood nostalgia that is required to look <UNK> on such <UNK> one of the worst horror films i've ever seen definitely the worst that received a mainstream theatrical release i've never walked out of a film in my life had i been unlucky enough to see at the theater it would have been a first avoid at all costs
<START> the english are a little too evil the <UNK> are a bit too br br heroic the dialogue is overly dramatic at times and the br br transitions between scenes could be <UNK> br br still the bruce has the feel of authentic if <UNK> br br history even if it does play loosely with some important br br facts br br sandy welch is no gibson or branagh but he makes a <UNK> br br bruce and brian blessed <UNK> the scenery in delightful br br <UNK> as edward i br br while lacking the budget needed to make the final battle truly br br impressive they still an impressive crowd for the br br english and scottish <UNK> it is according to filmmakers the br br largest filmed <UNK> of medieval battle ever staged in br br the british <UNK> br br allowing for a few <UNK> and shortcomings the film still br br does a convincing portrayal
<START> season on the brink is one of my favorite books of all time an insightful <UNK> look at bob knight and his indiana <UNK> and <UNK> is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time so i made a point of watching this adaptation br br it disappointed on every level performance was less than inspired and he seemed <UNK> to play knight like he had accepted the role just prior to filming the rest of the cast isn't much better br br and it was obvious that this was first movie it was poorly directed poorly filmed and the lack of budget was obvious anytime games were being <UNK> smaller empty seats etc skip this adaptation and read the book it holds up well to this day
<START> this film is chock full of little surprises many of them funny the fact that it's written and directed by a 24 year old blows my mind some of the scenes where the high school kids are using ecstasy made me very uncomfortable because i have a kid that age and i could picture her using it as parent of a teen i found the depictions of the parent child interactions to be dead on accurate br br i enjoyed the film's many little jokes and i enjoyed the fact that not everything made perfect sense and not all the issues were resolved by the end to <UNK> mark <UNK> truth is stranger than fiction because fiction is required to stick to that which is possible while truth is not br br this is a film which plays with the viewer allowing us believe that people are what other people think they are only to allow us later to realize that the folks we assumed were right were completely ignorant of the real situation one of the film's strongest scenes a scene about which we feel very <UNK> and sympathetic about what the character is doing turns out to be based on a completely wrong <UNK> and the character while admirable is totally wrong it's very subtly done i think very realistic br br i liked the score a lot i thought it really aided the film really helped set the mood the film has a couple of screwball moments and the background music helps establish that br br the <UNK> speech is a hoot and a half got a big laugh the movie is really in my head right now saw it this morning will try to see it again time allowing <UNK> are hard to come by but a solid nine in my book
<START> i went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night i'm 20 years old and this movie was way too much for me i couldn't imagine taking a teenager <UNK> or especially a child to this movie it was crude and offensive i was totally <UNK> by its pg 13 rating and the previews that i had seen for it i had originally seen previews for it on <UNK> and i thought that it looked pretty cute maybe i just don't remember the preview correctly plus drake bell the movie's main character stars on a <UNK> television show that targets <UNK> and young teenagers i really didn't think that the movie's content would be as <UNK> as it was i should have done more research about it before i went however i'm hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has drake bell in it br br seriously do not take your kids or teenagers to see this movie the rating should have been r there are tons of sexual references drug references and disturbing events throughout the movie examples drake bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals several scenes that involve men grabbing women's breasts lots of profanity drake bell uses a <UNK> to smoke vanilla <UNK> or something like that people get stabbed hit and hurt in the movie and an elderly lady and her dog get <UNK> there are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie it was really <UNK> to women in general the movie is by the people that made the scary movie series so that should tell you something right there please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex drugs and violence most children and teenagers can't <UNK> between spoofs or comedy and reality br br i do have a sense of humor i also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre but i find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie horrifying br br as for the overall quality of the movie i didn't think it was that original or funny it dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful the acting wasn't too bad considering how bad the script was if you're an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie skip this one or rent it
<START> this is the worst war movie i have ever seen possibly the worst ever made i find it incredible that some people have actually rated it as a 10 it has a stunning lack of even <UNK> <UNK> of realism almost every war movie cliche appears in this film and is done badly on the other hand i wouldn't have watched it to the end if it hadn't been so remarkably bad that it amused me
<START> debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time and as far as i know it's also the only one that focuses on the l a punk explosion of the early eighties it's all there not just great great bands like black flag fear x the <UNK> whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over <UNK> but also the <UNK> the media and first of all the audiences the <UNK> all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh <UNK> and gasp with <UNK> about the energy the anger and the fury these <UNK> put into their music where is that today the eighties may have sucked big time when it to mainstream music but the underground was <UNK> if you need a proof for that watch performance in decline <UNK> great film how come this is not available on <UNK> <UNK> or dvd p s the follow up decline <UNK> ii is hilarious too
<START> this <UNK> following will only grow as time goes by better than any of the best picture <UNK> in <UNK> and it <UNK> repeated viewings i've seen it three times now so i know anderson was compared to some of the great american directors altman <UNK> tarantino and he may have those influences but chances are after a few more films he'll be considered part of that short list himself br br one last note <UNK> moore's <UNK> waves will <UNK> in the memory long after other 90's movie characters have faded the best performance of the year in any of the four categories
<START> there must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie in fact in the film the girl <UNK> didn't even appear depressed she just seemed like a girl that went out of control when she finally got to college mainly from doing drugs and drinking alcohol that seemed to be her problem not mental illness sure she had emotional problems because her dad left and she barely saw him as a child and her mom seemed a little out there but the way she treated <UNK> and ruby was just mean and i don't think caused by depression she was very needed which ran <UNK> off but she was like that because of her dad br br but i think the main reason this movie never achieved a theater release is that not enough happens with the plot and the story is not written well br br final verdict <UNK> i'd only recommend this if you are interested in seeing <UNK> first nude scene otherwise it isn't very interesting
<START> i watched this movie only <UNK> it was expected to be yet another entertainer by david <UNK> br br bad bad comeback by david <UNK> he has made lots of funny movies in past which made no sense but none of them was a crap bag what a waste of talent and beauty it was why actors agree on movie like this br br there was not a <UNK> of <UNK> in this movie the movie is below par and not at all <UNK> the standard and potential bollywood has br br the only thing worth watching in this movie was <UNK> but we don't need to watch a movie like this to see her being a remake of hollywood flick <UNK> its clear that bollywood directors cant even make a proper remake i consider this to be the worst ever movie i seen awful 1 10
<START> i'm not sure what the point of making this film was it looked as if it was made by some historical society to be shown in your local museum at first it appears that it could be the beginning of a mad tv or snl sketch but then the joke is on you when there is no punchline and you realize that someone was taking this seriously the story wasn't bad but the inclusion of the <UNK> members seemed to be a <UNK> that worked to get me to see the film i swear the trailer listed every character in the film down to dead cowboy 5 the reason westerns are so fun is the atmosphere and the characters it brings i just had the feeling i was watching civil war actors dressed up as <UNK> not even worth the digital video it was recorded on
<START> a lot of people don't think dan <UNK> is funny this movie proves otherwise <UNK> is brilliant delivering his one liners in this comedy the only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from <UNK> character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he's a fraud the doctor goes nuts like doctor leo marvin richard dreyfuss in what about bob the scenes where the doctor is desperately trying to get back to los angeles are silly unbelievable and unfunny other that this aspect the movie really is funny especially the first half
<START> 1st watched 2 25 2002 4 out of 10 <UNK> george p <UNK> predictable action thriller where any frequent movie goer could guess what was coming next charlie sheen is the good old boy to the president who just happens to be not liked by the rest of the presidential staff of course he gets involved in a situation where he's framed over and over again and he has one friend in the white house played by sutherland who naturally doesn't stay that way for very long his other friend is a reporter played by linda hamilton who has very little to do or say in this meaningless role and of course his biggest and <UNK> friend is the president himself sam <UNK> who stays his pal till the end despite everyone else being killed around him brainless yet action packed meaningless despite loads and loads of acting talent all pretty much wasted
<START> this movie is trash from the word go first it gives an account of a season that took place 16 years ago who cares this movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap it makes a complex person like bob knight into a cartoon character br br swearing doesn't bother me but i'm still amazed that <UNK> showed a movie with more <UNK> than a kevin smith movie on a basic cable channel the f word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break br br this movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed i rate this on the same level as jaws iv the revenge and everybody wins 2 movies that are in the <UNK> hall of fame
<START> i must say i found this movie very disappointing yes i know <UNK> gave it 3 1 2 and others think very highly of it but well the opera sequences were god awful i take it macdonald is an acquired taste yes in the short sequences i have seen her with nelson eddy she is immensely <UNK> to him but on her own god i dislike opera and despise <UNK> and she is basically <UNK> at one point i had to cover my ears gable is just ok and tracy is thrown away the plot is annoying in the <UNK> never simply tells gable she loves him and the opera and why can't she do both instead she suffers <UNK> or not so with the <UNK> she makes the supporting cast is distinctly <UNK> besides the star three and jack holt and i suppose his mother they all are just background and forgettable the sequence is the only thing that saves the movie and just yes it is fairly spectacular and moving but the oh god is great seems very contrived i immensely prefer in old chicago as far as old time disaster <UNK> go spare yourself on this one
<START> dislike this movie and everyone would understand why the plot is poor so is the acting but in my opinion it is better than halloween 5 although even this does not give many surprising moments a few scenes are really well directed but these few moments do not deliver the reason to rent it i do not despise violence in movies but features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes which do not fit to the tradition of the halloween movies the most sucking aspect about is the lack of tension no comparison to the first masterpiece br br halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me if you want rent it but don't expect a great horror experience br br
<START> in reaction to the <UNK> of the films of actual combat in that time the wartime public increasingly turned to humor as escape from <UNK> and br br charlie chaplin feared that his great shoulder arms would offend people but it became his greatest in it charlie by luck courage and <UNK> <UNK> wins the war and brings a captive <UNK> in triumph to br br the chief difference between this hilarious <UNK> and some of the serious war dramas was that in charlie's case it all turned out to be a <UNK>
<START> i happened to have seen this movie this morning on tcm very bad acting low budget and poor plot are the impressions i felt while watching the movie the only highlight of the movie was watching tender young rita <UNK> 23 years old playing a teenage indian <UNK> in love with an older man in his 50's she reminded me of a earlier version of sue <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> only a more innocent <UNK> she <UNK> up and down like a 1950's <UNK> <UNK> almost as if you would expect her to be chewing <UNK> falling all over this old man willing to give him anything as he plays it off like she's a <UNK> to him any man in his 50's that had a beautiful virgin teenage girl willing to do anything for him and be his bride would be insane not to take advantage of her it's too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didn't <UNK> more of an <UNK> of a character such as rita the only reason why i gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is rita appearance in the movie
<START> straight up i love this film i love everything about it it has a great soundtrack it has a lot of recognizable faces and it is funny as hell there are so many plots in this film and every one of them is funny in one way or another br br where as lit up the screen two years back drake is almost as memorable of a character all he wants to do is have fun he moves out of the house without his <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> work whenever he feels like it he is obsessed with sex he loves his drugs and booze and he tries to be a good friend it is his attitude that makes him such a joy to watch and he comes out with some great lines and there are so many tiny observations that you don't see coming but they make you laugh at the sheer <UNK> when it hits you one particular moment is when tommy and bill are talking about <UNK> ex girlfriend dating someone else now at the end of the conversation tommy takes his huge beer bottle and just throws it over his shoulder casually he then says good night and the scene ends it is a perfect scene <UNK> world is his own he really lives to party and have fun when the conversation is over his time is over and he doesn't care who he <UNK> in the process he has an innocence about him it's casual is his favourite saying br br another such classic scene is <UNK> <UNK> bill a <UNK> he says something to him that me and my friends will never forget because we <UNK> the film ten times and watched that part over and over again and hurt ourselves laughing it has to be seen to be appreciated br br wild life is a throw back to when teen comedies were funny raunchy had a good ear entertained us and just wanted us to get lost in their world for 90 minutes wild life does all those things perfectly if this is a film that you haven't seen give it a chance it is a classic br br also check out the army store guy that jim has problems with he is a very familiar face now and it is his first role on the big screen
<START> the summary line is some men's wet dream for the ideal woman o seriously though back to the movie which has classic cinema written all over it pun intended and quite literally shown in the picture too as you'll see br br how could someone make a silent movie in this year and age it's not completely silent for once take the music for instance with great cinematography is the answer and it's no wonder that it did win <UNK> as another user stated in this area but it's also sometimes it's downfall although the pictures are great it sometimes <UNK> too much in them instead of moving forward plot and time wise if you can cope with that than you'll enjoy it even more than me i haven't told you anything about the story but i'll never do that because i don't want to spoiler anything for you
<START> first love teenage love we all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share friends could be considered an adaptation of the classic the blue <UNK> originally from 1949 and its remakes from 1980 the most popular one with brooke <UNK> and 1999 with a young <UNK> <UNK> while the blue <UNK> puts the two young lovers in a desert island with no contact with civilization friends goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences paul and michelle who for different reasons turn their backs on family and the adult world to end up living together in a small <UNK> in southern france having only each other and their childhood innocence their friendship slowly develops into much more as they struggle to sustain themselves in this sweet coming of age story this film even to this day is controversial since the actors are teenagers and they certainly look the ages that are stated in the movie 15 and 14 1 2 the movie does contains a hint of child <UNK> nudity depictions of teenage sex and teenage <UNK> but the real controversy is not the subject matter but the fact that paul and <UNK> love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship while this worked fine for stranded lovers in another time and in a desert island having them in a modern setting presents some very difficult moral issues laws <UNK> sex between <UNK> are in effect in almost all countries and lack of sexual education in teenagers is seen as one of the causes for the rise in <UNK> teenage <UNK> and <UNK> is a movie like this one just child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own <UNK> regarding a modern society that does not <UNK> to teenage parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and <UNK> development but that are needed to prevent child abuse is <UNK> development parallel to emotional growth these are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them as an artistic piece this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem the script progresses with extreme simplicity albeit some <UNK> but never pulling any punches to state its message although by today standards it is somewhat slow the photography is beautiful and it has scenes of great beauty the acting of the two protagonists <UNK> from really awful in some scenes to <UNK> innocent and credible in others pop music unlike most productions nowadays is used <UNK> and sometimes the lyrics speak the thoughts of the protagonists overall this is a delightful piece even if the moral values are not in with your own
<START> one night at is one of those films that starts with an awful amount of promise but as the film goes on it becomes silly and loses it's way big time <UNK> tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get her own way by <UNK> her body to every man she meets all of which fall under her spell there are a few funny moments in this but they get fewer and fewer as the film <UNK> into a comedy farce michael douglas who plays the assassin is good as is <UNK> tyler although she does look like she had put on a bit of weight since this is ok but is only memorable for the scene in which <UNK> tyler <UNK> her car you will know what i mean when you see it 7 out of 10 just
<START> okay so i love <UNK> <UNK> acting even with a bad script this is not the case in the assignment as other viewers have said this was a movie i stumbled upon on cable and got so into it i didn't want it to end take one cuban american navy quinn who is an <UNK> uptight soldier and family man add a crazed agent donald sutherland who is looking for the worlds most notorious terrorist and add a ben kingsley and you have the assignment sutherland is a witness of the most notorious terrorist carlos actions in a <UNK> on a lovely day where he is so profoundly <UNK> at this mans evil that his sole reason to live is to get this man as long as he draws breath br br take one soldier on a pass in israel who is a dead <UNK> for this man and is beaten and held by kingsley until they realize they have a plan by taking on carlos by being him or being forever responsible for never helping rid the world of him makes for a very heavy assignment and guilt trip by not helping his country he is bound as a man and his military duty to chose wisely so the training begins lets say carlos training is right up there with the academy of arts and <UNK> when i say this intense and wonderfully casted scripted and executed film rates the best i am not <UNK> it all three actors could save almost any script together this is a movie to be seen from frame one to credits i am not into terrorism or movies about it but i got hooked bravo again to <UNK> quinn who for once plays a heavy that could hold up to any actor including gary <UNK> thats a compliment rent it and get lots of popcorn oh did i mention the sex it works better than last tango and its educational
<START> george and mildred was a spin off from the mid 1970s sit com man about the house though i haven't seen the series since it was last broadcast i do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy <UNK> from the eponymous couple going to live beside the <UNK> family a sort of love <UNK> <UNK> without the cynical racist gags br br having seen this big screen version of the show i find myself asking what it's a big screen version of certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name for some reason the movie <UNK> all character interaction from the television by having george and mildred leaving the street where they live behind and getting caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something george has inadvertently picked up and which leads to some cringe making situations and lines like br br did he give it to you br br no that's the first time a man has <UNK> my charms br br i meant the <UNK> br br you do get the impression that screenwriter dick <UNK> who never wrote an episode for the original sit com has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the carry on series of films in many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter lost in space movie in that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that <UNK> it
<START> one of the reviewers here wrote good acting good special effects great br br location even better ending all i can say is ugh this movie was painful to watch let me start by saying this i am a christian considered extremely conservative by many people i know so what i am about to say is not biased by the br br christian content of the film i'm not gonna bash it because it's christian i am gonna give it a 2 10 because it's a horrible movie the writing is bad over the top way too preachy and much of the preachy stuff is just plain irrelevant to the story it just makes for bad <UNK> whether i agree with the br br <UNK> beliefs is irrelevant make a good script that flows well stays on track and is believable the acting was amateurish at best but hey when you cast amateurs you get br br amateur performances <UNK> been may have been on survivor but that show br br requires zero acting ability playing on his name and reputation to sell <UNK> is in bad taste cast <UNK> who can act and you'll have a much better film the effects were horrible the scene with the <UNK> and the subsequent falling of the stars was embarrassing to watch and what was so great about the ending it made no sense yeah i know what br br tim was going for but it missed the mark big time i bought this film and expected so much more based on reviews and the br br <UNK> on their website and although i was hoping for more i got what i always get when i watch christian films an under budget poorly written <UNK> acted badly produced piece of <UNK> <UNK> maybe someday someone will finally step up to the plate with an end times film as well written and as well made as <UNK> passion was 2 10 stars
<START> okay pretty good doesn't scream rent me but i was surprised at how much i enjoyed <UNK> tales while by no means a classic the directors involved do have an idea what suspense is the scares don't just jump out at you but instead the directors build <UNK> to the climatic moments the film is based upon popular urban legends and ghost stories the writers have updated the tales rather well and twisted them just enough that the familiar endings still pack a punch the best of the shorts are the honeymoon and people can <UNK> too i enjoyed both as they have nice suspense throughout each story the was a good ghost story and the wrap around the <UNK> is pretty good too except they go for one too many twists at the end the only disappointing segment is the hook which is fine because it's pretty short anyway overall i give this a 7 out of 10 it has suspense which is lacking from most horror movies today and good acting by the cast it may not rate up there with halloween and the exorcist but it's a good little movie well worth the price of a rental
<START> got to confess right up front that i didn't watch this entire movie i missed the first hour during a sci fi channel broadcast or was i <UNK> the first hour the other reviewers sum this one up nicely it was badly conceived badly scripted badly acted br br but the worst thing for me was the <UNK> the entire film which appeared to have been dubbed sounded like it was done in <UNK> garage there was a <UNK> echo to the words which just served to make the bad dialog hang and hang and hang even a made for tv movie should have recognized this br br and the idea that alternate <UNK> are <UNK> by color <UNK> went out in the 80s folks
<START> a rare lengthy kinski feature role as crazy johnny sex crazed outlaw who is wanted in san francisco <UNK> character is obsessed with <UNK> women a sexual predator in the old west who has nothing more but stealing <UNK> and killing on his mind this movie maybe a major disappointment for many spaghetti western fans but not for many <UNK> fans overall it had two things going for it a great performance from <UNK> kinski and a great music score by <UNK> br br another story line which needed much more work done to it to be <UNK> but still fun to watch br br it would be nice to see this movie <UNK> in the future since most old movies are being re made nowadays
<START> ever since 1981 <UNK> has been making great video games such as super mario and <UNK> most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years games made by <UNK> never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new it went from <UNK> games to the <UNK> and i hear that there's a new version of the <UNK> <UNK> for release in the thing that makes <UNK> games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons br br and i have more good news super mario galaxy 2 is to be released in <UNK>
<START> i accidentally <UNK> into this film on <UNK> while channel surfing i must admit that what attracted me was christopher walken and the setting was the kind i would like so i started to watch it at first i expected a serious drama film and it seemed like so for a while until i started to giggle here and there and before i know it i was laughing so hard all through the film i really like how subtle and light hearted it is but still has a huge impact on the audience the plot is very simple and it's far from trying too hard to be funny like many hollywood comedies are yet it almost had me rolling on the floor a must see for a nice evening rest or any time in that case
<START> this is a weird and compelling film the topic about the <UNK> bombs created at los in the usa and used on japan during the latter part of world war ii is huge and of course deeply disturbing the film's plot takes on a lot of heavy issues and the actors have to carry much of the creative tension i had never seen the film or was much interested in it i have to admit until i read the book smoking in bed conversations with bruce robinson robinson wrote the story and screenplay i think the film was better than i expected from reading <UNK> point of view in the conversations about it but i can see how he thought it got <UNK> i think paul newman is pretty good but is somehow at bottom miscast he's too hollywood at one point a big mean looking guy <UNK> into <UNK> office and has such a striking presence i immediately thought he should be playing the character newman is playing the other lead who plays the head scientist is also fairly good but somehow not brilliant enough to portray the huge angst that goes with the part the immense responsibility for creation of an ultimate machine of death and destruction one of the more effective characters seems to be a <UNK> personality played by john cusack he is oddly affecting throughout and in the end is the character whose fate really hits home and who made me think most vividly of the fate of more than 200 000 japanese people in <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> this is a truly terrible sci fi horror film from 1957 in fact despite ed wood jr and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of wood now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the wood epics such as plan 9 and bride of the monster but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than <UNK> however bad movie <UNK> will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing like a wood film it's great to watch this crap fest and laugh along with your friends br br the film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet however out of nowhere a <UNK> <UNK> by and his report of this over the radio <UNK> a panic by the air force however later they realized that the <UNK> didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut but when soon after this planes start disappearing all over they realize there must be something to his <UNK> br br so far the film isn't great but it's watchable however by the time the horrible flying monster appears you know you're watching a turkey first through horrid use of stock film and crappy models <UNK> keep changing mid flight some may not be bothered by this but with airplane lovers like me seeing an f 80 turning into an f <UNK> to an f <UNK> fighter plane made me crazy especially since the planes look nothing like each other second through clever cinematography all you really see of the monster is a ball of <UNK> for half the film this is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly it will be worth the wait well no such luck the monster looks less realistic or scary than the duck from <UNK> you bet your life tv show in fact it's significantly less realistic than any of the japanese giant monsters in fact big bird from <UNK> street is even a bit scarier and realistic it's just god awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history about as bad or worse as the monsters in robot monster or teenagers from outer space the bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like bad film fans like me who are a crazy bunch will probably love it all others be afraid be very afraid br br <UNK> you might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci fi movies i am positive the crashing washington <UNK> scene was stolen from earth vs the flying <UNK> but i also saw a couple other scenes that i swear are from other films what a hack job
<START> as i have said before i am not a fan of <UNK> he's just so <UNK> i wish <UNK> would just eat him and get it over with br br in this cartoon sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage <UNK> he spots a cruise ship leaving <UNK> nearby and decides to hop aboard when he <UNK> is one of the passengers br br the ship provides an adequate stage for the following <UNK> and sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid <UNK> if only for once he's succeed by chewing and <UNK> thus finishing of the irritating <UNK> forever but as cartoons starring <UNK> go this one is quite good but it's all thanks to that brilliant cat
<START> besides the fact that this guy is a liar he is also a total idiot and a thief in the comedy community once when i attempted to watch this excuse for a television show i believe i actually threw up in my mouth a little i can't help but feel a little bit dumber every time is see one of his horrid commercials while i am enjoying great comedy central programs like reno <UNK> and american body shop it shows like this that make me worry about the <UNK> existence of mankind it's hard to believe that even joe can make someone look like an moron please begin praying now that comedy central will realize their mistake and end this show as soon as possible haven't we suffered enough
<START> that's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this film i just saw this baby at the <UNK> film festival and it <UNK> the house director doug pray is never seen in this documentary nor i think he is even heard but he has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the <UNK> he has <UNK> his film into about eight chapters and then his <UNK> group of enthusiastic interviews will be <UNK> throughout according to what they are talking about i was never big into scratching but the film does a wonderful job of keeping <UNK> for those who know little and <UNK> in jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area mix master mike from the <UNK> boys is in this film but it wasn't until after the film that i could name several heavy <UNK> in the industry dj shadow q bert etc the extreme fascination for by these talented and quirky <UNK> is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them the film also <UNK> some <UNK> light on these guys and one woman to be classified as musicians pray doesn't let his film <UNK> and if there exists a slow scene it is soon re <UNK> by hardly ever music if nothing else this film will increase your <UNK> <UNK> i have to get back to digging so i'll end this review see it it will be of interest good stuff man good stuff
<START> in a genre by itself this film has a limited audience and narrow appeal coupled with a subtle <UNK> which <UNK> the entire production nevertheless it is a remarkable piece of cinema which is as timeless as a rare work of art capturing a time in rarely seen in movies <UNK> <UNK> strength lies in the depth of its characters and the <UNK> of the settings <UNK> and <UNK> is brilliantly cast as the backdrop which could not possibly be achieved by anyone other than a pure <UNK> br br it would be far too easy to resort to stereotypes clichés and single minded <UNK> statements in this story yet the director chose to skip the forced imagery and instead focused on the essence of life in rural of the time that makes this film exceptional in its authenticity while not being pretentious in its presentation if only more contemporary cinematic <UNK> would do the same the viewing public might not be forced to choose between the over hyped hollywood that passes for <UNK> <UNK> viewing br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is in every sense of the word unforgettable it will leave a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived in or visited a classic br br follow up 10 may 2008 br br after reviewing some of the comments it's worth noting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is not and probably wasn't meant to serve as standard hollywood american cinema for mass market sales a coming of age story yes but far more than simple <UNK> of <UNK> in 1940's viewers <UNK> looking for sheer entertainment at the expense of complex development of the characters will be sorely disappointed go watch action adventure romance comedies to be amused watch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to be drawn into a seldom seen but absolutely remarkable society that has been overlooked and ignored for far too long br br the <UNK> of wrath is hardly an edge of the seat thriller yet the story and characters are what makes this american classic an enduring film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is in the same genre
<START> <UNK> named and strangely casted one dark night aka <UNK> is one of the better early horror video <UNK> original and quite raw we meet adam west briefly in this film about <UNK> and teen age meg <UNK> is <UNK> into spending the night in a crypt by the sisters a high school gang of hair <UNK> in blue <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> is interrupted by the recently <UNK> body of a mass murdering psychic wizard called surprisingly awesome make up and scare effects paints this <UNK> film with style and deliver a heart <UNK> climax
<START> in a world in which <UNK> and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list moreover it does it <UNK> and realistically and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's <UNK> stick and to add some irony to it all even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty it is not at the heart of dead man walking ' directed by tim robbins is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all and with good reason because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really and truly understand and it is what this film is actually all about forgiveness real forgiveness not <UNK> a <UNK> crime or the <UNK> thereof not saying that what's happened is okay but finding the strength to go on and to do so by choosing life br br director screenwriter tim robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by sister helen in which she <UNK> her involvement with the death row inmates to whom over the years she has her faith in god as <UNK> in the film what for her was to become a <UNK> pursuit of not only justice but human dignity began with a simple letter from a death row <UNK> at the <UNK> state prison at <UNK> sentenced to death for rape and murder matthew sean penn was reaching out to anyone who would listen when his letter ended up in the hands of sister susan sarandon who soon found herself <UNK> into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience and robbins has successfully captured sister emotional and <UNK> journey <UNK> while managing to keep it devoid of any <UNK> sentimentality which makes it not only real credible and believable but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience through the medium of the cinema what was once a personal significant emotional experience for sister becomes one for everyone who sees this film as well br br for her soul stirring <UNK> portrayal of sister susan sarandon deservedly won the oscar for best actress sensitive and <UNK> with emotional depth her performance is incredibly touching and real especially in the way in which she conveys sister underlying natural <UNK> and vulnerability which she <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> she needed to carry on with her <UNK> on behalf of and in reality a total of five since she began whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film sister is without question an individual of heroic proportions which sarandon <UNK> <UNK> here and she does it without <UNK> to any superfluous <UNK> but rather by keeping it real by subtly and <UNK> exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization it's an extraordinary performance arguably the best of <UNK> brilliant career br br turning in a career best performance as well is sean penn who was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of he lost out to nicolas cage who won for his performance in leaving las vegas perfect for the part in every way penn has quite simply never been better before or since he effectively presents as a real person rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of <UNK> the crimes depicted here not that it makes any less despicable just the opposite in fact it makes it genuinely <UNK> to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things and that's the strength of <UNK> performance it's so <UNK> real presented with depth and nuance you have but to look into his eyes to find the <UNK> of a troubled soul a terrific performance and as good as cage was in <UNK> penn should have received the oscar for it br br in another stand out performance raymond j barry is memorable in a supporting role as earl father of one of victims with limited screen time he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that <UNK> you to empathize with him as well as with sister as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly <UNK> her position is at least on the surface barry presents in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to <UNK> the message of the film br br the supporting cast includes r lee <UNK> clyde <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mary beth <UNK> lois smith <UNK> mother scott wilson chaplin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lucille <UNK> <UNK> sister <UNK> and jack black craig it is <UNK> that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty but that was never the intention what was intended was to make a thought provoking emotionally involving film which is exactly what robbins has accomplished with dead man walking ' regardless of your personal point of view this film will have an impact and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness for as we see through the character of earl true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do but is a task that can become a <UNK> work and it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like sister who has <UNK> dedicated her life to helping those in need and to filmmakers like robbins and sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her i rate this one 10 10 br br
<START> <UNK> is one of the greatest films ever made now i think paul <UNK> is the greatest screenwriter of all time but i don't really like the films he's directed of what i've seen with the exception of this and <UNK> but this is an amazing disturbing and highly 3 dimensional character study it follows the life of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> most celebrated writer combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories i don't know how but paul <UNK> manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way the acting is great so is the photography and a perfect score by philip glass although confusing the first viewing this is one of the few films that becomes <UNK> with each viewing truly an underrated gem of a film
<START> i went into this movie with semi high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood and this nearly <UNK> that love for me jason lee david <UNK> in the film is horrifying i understand it can't be easy to act with cgi characters who aren't actually there but i really found his performance atrocious along with all the other non animated characters the <UNK> were adorable yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along and therefore did not <UNK> me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film if you feel you must see this film rent it at the most it is not worth eight bucks to see it in theaters unless you'd like a good laugh at the horrible acting
<START> perhaps i'm being too generous when i give this film two and a half stars out of five but there was an occasional moment however as an american werewolf movie this one is a missed chance there are no real plot connections to the superior original to speak of but the story is similar in some ways to london br br possible spoiler warning american kids go to foreign country one falls in love with a beautiful girl another one of the kids gets slaughtered by a werewolf in the same night that one gets bitten and despite his undead friend's <UNK> by the light of the full moon he <UNK> fur <UNK> and <UNK> br br but there are some differences in the story for one the girl is one of the werewolves second there are three american kids and third there's some weird werewolf cult intent on taking over the world as crazy as it sounds that last one wasn't a joke spoiler ends br br the films suffers from many things first the weak acting drags it down immensely tom scott's performance is <UNK> at best and he and julie <UNK> who plays his love interest don't seem to have any chemistry together at all second a weak script that seems to be all over the place many elements of suspense and dark comedy that made the original one great are missing in this one and whoever said that eating out the heart of the werewolf that bit you will change you back human last i heard this wasn't part of werewolf <UNK> at all third terrible special effects the werewolf effects are done with computer animation which works for things such as dinosaurs ghosts and space ships but seems choppy fake and artificial when used for <UNK> creatures like werewolves br br however there were a few things that saved this one from total there's one hilarious scene in a paris <UNK> when andy scott is having coffee with <UNK> he drops a bunch of <UNK> on the table and tries to pass them off as chewing <UNK> by chewing and blowing a bubble also the soundtrack a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like bush and <UNK> although none of the songs have the word moon in their title like the original movie the soundtrack is great <UNK> and another funny scene when a rotting corpse played by julie <UNK> attempts to <UNK> and her <UNK> pops out had me laughing out loud br br but as a whole this film seems to lack the wit and suspense of the original and the overly contrived ending doesn't help it out much either br br 1 2 two and a half out of five stars average
<START> for many months i was looking forward to this release the previews looked good early reports on the net were <UNK> and golden eye and were excellent <UNK> by the same people it turns out i was greatly <UNK> <UNK> had the potential to be up there with call of duty 4 and other next gen <UNK> however it looks plays and feels like something from 5 years or so ago i played <UNK> on a tv and was initially disappointed that the <UNK> <UNK> had limited the graphics to the <UNK> universe lacks detail and atmosphere the feeling of they must have really rushed to finish this is always there br br the controls are <UNK> and <UNK> and i have yet to find an <UNK> for x y <UNK> sensitivity there are many parts of the single player game that are very dark visually to the point where you can't actually see where you are going why not add a torch function like in <UNK> or even better night vision the use of the performance <UNK> drug <UNK> is interesting however just as you get used to it you switch sides and don't use it again why bother i could go on with many more <UNK> faults but instead i'll just say don't bother wait for 2 or play call of duty 4 and try to <UNK> the gold <UNK>
<START> i was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and the fairly good rating this was a big disappointment this doesn't hold a candle to contemporary zombie flicks like shaun of the dead day of the dead land of the dead etc horror flicks sometimes take a while to get going you have to build up the characters so when they snuff it you feel some empathy etc but even so there's a full 45 minutes to sit through here even before you <UNK> a corpse up to that point its like watching a bad soap opera nothing of any interest or relevance happens and if you are going to watch this for the first time you can honestly start watching after 45 minutes you won't miss anything plot wise when things do get going its all very sub par stuff some of the kills and make up are done well others are done very poorly <UNK> is lacking here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most wooden acting i've ever seen br br this could all be passable if you really believed this was all taking place on a plane but with guns being fired <UNK> being let off no pilots in the <UNK> in a violent storm yet the plane stays in the air c'mon we're not all <UNK> br br oh and does it really take a whole minute for a fighter <UNK> missile to hit a plane that is a few hundred <UNK> away i know its a zombie film and you have to stretch things but this film along with the other main <UNK> listed above had zero credibility one to miss
<START> this series made for is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968 primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son br br based on a background of historical events such as the may 1968 student <UNK> in france the <UNK> franco regime the war in <UNK> <UNK> the rise of <UNK> and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment one might regard this series as a simple <UNK> of characteristic <UNK> which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment br br generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can those times as it should be stated anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is occupied in other things br br the best thing that can be said of this series is <UNK> as mother of three children she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well <UNK> that peculiar spanish <UNK> especially noticeable among women of letting all her thinking and her <UNK> be carried forward by the <UNK> of her heart without any <UNK> to the use of the brain as we say in spain common sense is one of the least common senses <UNK> <UNK> offers very little apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series indeed as an actor he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series his resources are too limited however his part as father of the working class household is not at all bad br br not really <UNK> for other audiences even spanish <UNK> in latin america the themes are all too related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references it is even <UNK> that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers
<START> i wrote an <UNK> in 1981 the year i <UNK> high school called the last american virgin i also had a friend named nancy who was the prostitute in this film apparently her daughter got a hold of my <UNK> one night when she slept over my house a year later i wake up one morning and see the <UNK> for this film i was 18 years old based the <UNK> on experiences in my life the film is a bit different from my <UNK> but definitely taken from it i did not have any proof of this matter except my english teacher mr <UNK> who gave me an a on my <UNK> i let it go never did anything about it i figured what comes around goes around i still would not take any action against anyone involved in this film i just needed to get it off my chest as i really never told anyone about it except my closest friend they agreed to keep it a secret the same year it came out i saw nancy in a market she actually had the nerve to ask me if i had any good stories or scripts for her to look at i guess thats what hollywood is all about getting stories from wherever you can it was interesting seeing parts of my life on the big screen though br br ghost writer
<START> first thing i note is the music it's nothing as amazing as <UNK> <UNK> cannibal <UNK> haunting theme or the masterpiece <UNK> from a tale of two sisters but i don't let that stop me so early in the film br br one must assume that the woman <UNK> her <UNK> for her <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> as a organized practice has never existed one would think they must take into the consideration that they are wrong and prepare for the trip <UNK> right or why go at all if you already believe the <UNK> to be true before even being tested that's fairly unbelievably ignorant and makes the movie seem that much more unrealistic and badly scripted br br that actually is similar to the <UNK> <UNK> film just totally ill prepared no guns no decent <UNK> clothing just nonsense through and through br br people don't go on <UNK> like this for college without months of planning and <UNK> br br but i <UNK> br br things don't get off to a very good start for our brave yet stupid <UNK> as they <UNK> to miss a <UNK> and their <UNK> pet <UNK> falls out of the truck nearly to it's demise then to fall into a mud hole well i guess it's time to walk br br okay then they flip a <UNK> to see whether they keep going or forget the whole thing how does that scene even make any sense all their conviction rests on the flip of a <UNK> after they must've spent time and money and <UNK> just getting out there this just keeps getting worse some of the worst acting and scripting and music ever <UNK> for the film industry br br mike talks about how he and his friend's were captured by the cannibals and put into <UNK> in mud <UNK> with 3 inch long <UNK> sucking on their blood i found that interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they run into in the jungle a man they mistake as a simple native is sitting on the ground eating such <UNK> wonder if they are the same ones really though this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is <UNK> considering the content they just agree to off themselves rather then get eaten by cannibals like it's no big decision br br obviously mike is insane but just like in the first movie they treat the natives with such terrible behavior it's simply unrealistic br br <UNK> <UNK> movie easily feels the americans got what they deserved while in this movie one can hardly blame the natives for what <UNK> the americans yet again br br and because of that the movie feels somewhat pointless we already got the point from the first movie so why was the sequel made the name is rizzo could it get any worse <UNK> with movies such as these when you look up the cast you find they haven't really acted in much other films and their <UNK> are all but non existent so you can imagine i was surprised to find <UNK> <UNK> in this movie who was in <UNK> gangs of new york now lt rizzo looked familiar and i found he was in the 2002 movie <UNK> as a very tiny role as a <UNK> captain reminds me of how william shatner went from being the <UNK> on the <UNK> enterprise to a cop in a car irony sometimes irony works out shatner never could get the music right until his recent album has been which is really good just like <UNK> of <UNK> never could get a <UNK> right and dan <UNK> never could win no br br sometimes irony is just sad like christopher reeve superman can't walk irony the man will always be a legend though because he was such a great guy i <UNK> yet again though br br at this point you can tell i'm fairly bored of even discussing cannibal <UNK> br br cannibal <UNK> message was about who are the real <UNK> and what is truly evil what the <UNK> do in natural living unknown to our moral records or what we do to others with <UNK> intent cannibal message seems to be <UNK> careful what you go looking for for you just might find it ' i will say this for cannibal <UNK> when gloria comes back and writes her <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> does not exist she saves others who would be curious and go where angels fear <UNK> but overall this movie was really bad br br 10
<START> sequels are a <UNK> lot with most nowhere near the stature of the original sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original some critics such as john charles have stated that project is better than the original i disagree somewhat but this movie is still a worthwhile follow up and fits well in the <UNK> of brilliant hong kong action cinema in the 1980s as well as <UNK> own <UNK> i do wonder how with such an awesome release of great films that his later films were not as good he only has directed two films in the 1990s and none past that but he has had much <UNK> in many of the films where he is not officially the director br br earlier in 1987 jackie had brain surgery following a disastrous fall in the filming of <UNK> of god this encouraged him to work on his next film close to home this did not encourage him to stop <UNK> his life and his stunt team for our amusement what resulted is a smash hit at home that <UNK> the original in box office <UNK> million hk dollars compared to 19 million for the original br br jackie chan is once again police officer <UNK> dragon ma and he is ordered to work with three wan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> royal warriors who is the only chinese police officer allowed to have a gun yet is thought to be staging <UNK> to make himself look better and ignoring the crimes of a <UNK> lord named tiger <UNK> michael chan <UNK> man dragon lord apparently <UNK> has too much power to be taken down directly but he is <UNK> of the <UNK> wan district now he is two wan which dragon ma takes over this <UNK> and corrupt office will soon get a <UNK> and there is a great scene where three officers who do not know who they are dealing with attempt to assault ma to teach him a lesson about complaining about police officers he soon has that district ship shape and tiger <UNK> taken care of the fight choreography and stunts with tiger and his men are quite awesome my favorite stunt was a beautifully brutal fall from the second floor into a large <UNK> and that <UNK> did not appear to be soft br br meanwhile a couple of subplots are happening there are pirates who have survived from the first film who are looking for revenge and food then there are <UNK> including maggie maggie cheung in the mood for love and <UNK> <UNK> casino <UNK> who are trying to raise <UNK> for dr sun <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> government as well as government <UNK> who are trying to find these rebels throw in a mixture of corrupt hong kong and british cops as well as legitimate ones and you have a <UNK> that is getting a bit too many ingredients but yet still seems to <UNK> this works well when there is a marx brothers influenced scene the marx brothers have done this type of scene a few times with the <UNK> being the first at <UNK> place where everyone is looking for someone while hiding from someone else many weeks were spent on this scene alone and the effort certainly shows br br there are several faults with the film there is a certain <UNK> nature that creeps in the film that seems a bit out of place  especially one small speech towards the end that jackie gives when dealing with the <UNK> <UNK> and the extremely easy <UNK> of the pirates that survived from the first film female characters are once again underused and under appreciated especially maggie cheung i was not as satisfied with the <UNK> of the plot as much as the first film either the individual scenes dominate my feelings for the film instead of thinking of this movie as a cohesive whole i do not fault the film for not being able to have sammo hung and <UNK> <UNK> like the first though i have heard the main reason behind this was that those two were filming eastern <UNK> but i do wonder if jackie could have waited a small while to get them to perform in this  they would work together for the last time the following year in dragons forever but they are missed br br i found this to be quite an enjoyable and well made film and it is rightfully regarded as one of the better comedic action films of the 1980s this film is also quite good in a few unexpected places the art direction is superb eddie ma the costumes are exquisite the cinematography is good and the movie looks quite authentic but the stunts comedy and the action is what i remember this film for there is a chase involving a <UNK> dragon and <UNK> that is superb part of the axe throwing scene would be used in shanghai <UNK> the last twenty minutes is full of awe inspiring hits falls <UNK> <UNK> as a mouth <UNK> jackie writes in his autobiography about how he used real <UNK> in this scene you can see him in a lot of mouth pain during the <UNK> at the end and is a worthy conclusion to this movie the most famous stunt from this sequence is his homage to buster keaton from <UNK> bill jr <UNK> with the exception that there is no hole and only a weak section where his head pops through br br fans of jackie and or hong kong action cinema should consider this a must own and watch i certainly do
<START> tremendous fun both as a film and as an excuse to sit back and play the <UNK> that's <UNK> game every star of the golden age of english films seems to be in this one and it was a joy to see them and the greatest of them all richard was as tremendous as ever br br there is actually a plot that <UNK> along very nicely there's also some splendid jokes and comedic moments but the key to this films triumph is the characters within it <UNK> <UNK> is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six foot big <UNK> <UNK> could be the <UNK> of a girl's <UNK> school george cole <UNK> reid and irene all have their moments but with <UNK> and richard the star of the show is <UNK> she is an absolute one off and brings a smile whenever she's on the screen her rolling walk and <UNK> accent done to perfection br br and for those playing the that's <UNK> game you can even spot arthur barbara <UNK> and ronald if you look carefully
<START> my friends and i are always on the <UNK> for chuck norris films to just bash and make fun of one of our favorites so far is i went to a wal mart christmas shopping and i came across this movie in the 5 99 bin i had to get it i had high hopes for this movie and although being absolutely hilarious at times we agreed that <UNK> of innocence is the worst movie we've ever seen made produced thought up etc who the hell would think this is a good idea not only is it confusing at times but the acting is just hard to watch the man who plays <UNK> has acting i can compare to my own vomit and chuck took a dive on this one he's not the greatest actor but this was terrible and what kind of names are <UNK> conrad and come on people if you honestly thought this movie was at all watchable great for you because it was hard for me and i seriously had a headache and stomach pains after watching it i'm telling you now if you haven't seen this movie don't for the love of god please do not subject yourself to such a horrible 90 minutes of your life
<START> so bad as good not only the script is obvious but the acting is not just poor but pathetic the worst of all is the definition of the characters unrealistic <UNK> affected reactions camera forcing to watch superficial aspects which are introduced as keys to the plot br br can't prevent laughing when at the end main character says to second something like <UNK> daughter plays no soccer and knows no such offense to female intelligence <UNK> the level of this film br br is the film about the psychological behaviour of the second character about its impact on the main character or just a sequence of events set in order to heat for the obvious ending br br make more of these i had a good time guessing what next would go wrong
<START> we just finished screening el <UNK> in australia a phenomenal piece of film work we look forward to seeing many more films from mr in the future it was wonderful to see such a well put together film with such suspense and a story that shall remain an instant classic seeing a film with great quality truly <UNK> serious potential and his <UNK> skill as a writer actor director and filmmaker has impressed many with his <UNK> performance in blood in and blood out and now he has proved to all who have see his works his potential to become a <UNK> acclaimed film maker with genuine artistic control with his lead role <UNK> <UNK> being a perfect combination between milo from blood in blood out and al pacino from scarface the film will do wonders for us here in australia
<START> i went to the pre screening of <UNK> <UNK> was here i like this movie better than i expected because the excellent casts and the powerful performance it's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man <UNK> is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his <UNK> muscular <UNK> he can only move his two fingers but he can talk <UNK> and help his new pal michael who has cerebral <UNK> and is significantly speech <UNK> i guess that's enough to start with a <UNK> drama well it is but with inspiring messages and deeply moving performances it made me looking at my life for things i take for granted what would i do if all i can do is to move my two fingers i should feel grateful for what i have and what i am capable of doing this is a good flick although it could have been better
<START> its a totally average film with a few semi alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van <UNK> films parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning the end scene with the <UNK> backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van <UNK> character not really worth watching again bit disappointed in the end production even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality
<START> the depiction of <UNK> character was so <UNK> unlikable my wife and i were hoping that the <UNK> or some other character would not only cut off <UNK> head but do it slowly and painfully br br i mean this brent <UNK> guy played it over the top like he was on broadway and he was such a relentless jackass that we had no sympathy for him whatsoever br br i could go on with specific <UNK> of how this movie failed but i prefer to not <UNK> the energy br br just skip it and go for the johnny <UNK> version either that or rent the haunted <UNK> of sleepy hollow animated it is quite good entertaining for kids and adults br br better yet read washington <UNK> original story
<START> there were many westerns made in the 30s and early 40s and although this has a strong beginning it isn't one randy <UNK> john wayne stopping at a <UNK> saloon finds it to be full of dead bodies the corpse <UNK> over the bar holding a gun eyes watching randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture and a player piano playing the <UNK> night of the year br br it was the result of a robbery by the marvin black gang to get ed <UNK> 30 000 randy is an investigator who works alone who wastes little time in getting arrested escaping with <UNK> daughter <UNK> help and literally landing in the midst of the black <UNK> <UNK> behind a <UNK> it all moves along fairly quickly only one too many chases after randy slow it down br br we even get george hayes clean <UNK> and playing two parts marvin black the <UNK> villain as well as the good citizen matt the mute who <UNK> via <UNK> messages having him play two opposite roles was a good idea but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast even for him as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to sally ah i'm fed up with this you can find george playing a vile vile double crossing villain in the serial the lost city 1934 br br i think this is the only <UNK> <UNK> film in which the title relates to or is mentioned in the film sally offers her hand to randy and says he's not alone anymore then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake <UNK> running off with randy seems too abrupt and not <UNK> prepared for too much time spent on <UNK> escaping the sheriff br br not that bad considering everything but not that great either i'd really give it a 4 and a half
<START> the idea behind dead silence is great zombie <UNK> takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show there was so much going for this film unfortunately as soon as the zombies made their appearance all was lost br br the film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy b flick horror will enjoy it the zombies were <UNK> stupid they ran around <UNK> their arms they looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for <UNK> students br br i know this is a brief review but i just don't see the need to <UNK> much into this it's a dumb movie you've been warned
<START> as the film reviewer for a local gay magazine i automatically get sent any dreck if it happens to have a <UNK> in it chicken <UNK> is <UNK> on in the background as i write this i gave it my <UNK> attention for <UNK> minutes before i found myself <UNK> shouting like a <UNK> this is the sh test film i have ever seen we're just coming to the emotional climax where the son is giving some coming out speech to his father at his wedding father seems to be taking it quite well an attempted honour killing at this point would at least have <UNK> the film up a bit and made it funnier br br i didn't particularly like beautiful thing for example but could at least see why other people did it was made with some <UNK> and i seem to remember it had at least a couple of good lines the lack of wit in this film is quite astounding even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have <UNK> jokes the nearest this movie got to being funny at least in its first <UNK> mins was the subtitled comment delivered to the fat unattractive female lead look at her with her legs wide open she's like the tunnel completely witless and i didn't crack a smile but i could imagine someone with a low iq who perhaps works in a chip shop enjoying it br br i'd imagine it's some <UNK> <UNK> atrocity if not i can at least <UNK> myself with the fact that the <UNK> will lose a substantial amount of money as even a low budget british film will still set someone back a couple of million seriously if i met the most handsome bloke in the world and on going back to his place to make sweet love i found a copy of this in his dvd collection man i love this film i'd probably kick him in the nuts and leave and this from someone who's gone about six months without any of the aforementioned sweet love br br oh lord i hate this film
<START> i had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of <UNK> <UNK> probably left over from a bad western blew across the scene the bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory opening stranger turned human sacrifice for no apparent reason <UNK> his rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat for the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated to an <UNK> shot of the car <UNK> back and forth and only the dramatic made for tv movie music informs us a killing is taking place not a make out session for the next 27 or so hours we are treated to two idiotic <UNK> who for some reason seem compelled to drive through the desert <UNK> together going after each other like a demented <UNK> <UNK> even with the shocking twists at the end we are merely left to shake our heads and wonder if the producers and director writer feel as ashamed and embarrassed as they should for creating this inconsistent incoherent nonsense
<START> i wish it were last dumb thriller but thrillers are like that they are like children numerous illogical and often annoying they want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a child's behaviour or a <UNK> plot having seen this particular child i mean thriller i understand why reviewers refer to it as a <UNK> thriller they might as well have called it idiotic for that's what <UNK> means in the movie <UNK> look it up if you don't believe me even the soundtrack is old school hollywood which is a mistake it doesn't fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony besides how dare they steal de palma's idea of stealing from hitchcock the story is absurd <UNK> wife is killed and her killers are never an issue instead first his former <UNK> follow him around and later decide to kill him why do they decide to kill him no explanation perhaps because the fbi is a dark dark organization x files which is very trigger happy about knocking off its former employees for <UNK> <UNK> reasons or perhaps because it's <UNK> to want to kill <UNK> in this movie everyone seems to be after him and while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by <UNK> assuming that there is a major conspiracy in reality the killer is janet <UNK> yes the woman <UNK> <UNK> living quarters the one that briefly hinted she was <UNK> why does she go after <UNK> at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid and followed by his own ex <UNK> and not a few years earlier or few years after the wife's murder a pure <UNK> look it up again in the <UNK> in case you forgot what it means coincidence and how about that brilliant motive of hers her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a fresh off the boat 15 year old virgin in ny and then by a bunch of horny jewish men one of whom <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> grandfather as a result <UNK> has been playing a hooker in her spare time among other things in order to kill off all the <UNK> of the men who so <UNK> her once <UNK> grandmother how <UNK> look it up is that the finale then shamelessly rips off the <UNK> <UNK> scene from north by <UNK> except that the love interest is a killer and she doesn't get saved br br the movie also offers some dubious off <UNK> dialog and some not so great acting check out the silly and obvious way in which <UNK> follows <UNK> at the cemetery let's also not forget the moronic plot device of <UNK> reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very <UNK> but it wasn't a gun how brilliant <UNK> in the tower now there's another string of illogical <UNK> <UNK> j <UNK> was is and always will be a director without style without flair and the man who directed philadelphia let's give him another oscar
<START> as a young teen when this came out i completely related to it as an adult in the present sex obsessed american culture it doesn't have enough nudity to be called tame br br if you are looking for american pie type <UNK> <UNK> or fart and <UNK> jokes <UNK> will disappoint with <UNK> and a guarantee br br if you like bill murray and you like good clean fun you will probably like and enjoy this film very much similarly with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shack etc br br enough said just go watch it and stop it it's <UNK> for crying out loud why read a review just enjoy it and have fun and ignore the trash talk by others films like so many other things in life are <UNK> to each his own br br always beware the who <UNK> <UNK> taste
<START> the history of tv to film adaptations are <UNK> with <UNK> which almost <UNK> prove that the tradition should never have started in the first place there are however some examples which manage to pull it off just rising <UNK> would at first appear to be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment as this hilarious series was based within the tiny confines of a northern <UNK> also the writer eric wasn't being paid enough to spend time <UNK> an entirely original screenplay so he <UNK> a <UNK> of tv episodes and <UNK> them together to form the body of the film this in itself didn't necessarily mean that the script would fail david <UNK> and jimmy perry did the same thing with their screenplay for <UNK> army and it worked superbly although the early <UNK> army episodes with their <UNK> pace and over plot <UNK> themselves far better to film adaptation the rising <UNK> episodes however were high energy affairs from the first scene to the breathless climax as a result as one story is <UNK> and another started the scenes within the film become disjointed another <UNK> for the movie version of a tv series is the inevitable comparisons that are made in this respect the film <UNK> in comparison to rising brilliant series despite all this rising <UNK> the movie manages to be entertaining and occasionally <UNK> it is perhaps not surprising that the finest moments occur during sequences written specially for the film this includes a <UNK> match where does a brilliantly timed <UNK> indeed while all the cast handle their roles perfectly bar a sub standard replacement actor for the late and truly great beckinsale it is leonard as that shines the most in fact rising <UNK> should have been made as a film just so could have been <UNK> for an oscar such is the <UNK> of his acting talent criminally he wasn't even nominated ultimately the film fails to match the <UNK> heights of the tv series while managing to hold its own as a comedy in its own right with some beautifully played moments recommended viewing br br one last thing the opening and closing music is by far the worst in film history
<START> after huge budget disaster films set in america like the day after tomorrow and deep impact it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale like <UNK> br br using mainly unknown actors and actresses and actually focusing on england it was a welcome change of pace to seeing the empire state building being <UNK> br br however this is not a strong film on any basis whilst being fairly shocking seeing all your favourite london <UNK> being <UNK> by a very fake cgi storm <UNK> <UNK> doesn't really deliver on anything else br br the performances are bland being saved from the pit of hell by david <UNK> and his <UNK> calm performance as the deputy he is perhaps a little too calm for what is going on in the film all that fake water <UNK> around london must have made him pretty annoyed br br it is understandable that the effects weren't going to be as good as and <UNK> but the cgi was at best average br br bland disappointing and sometimes even tiresome watch it if you must but watch something else straight afterwards
<START> i went out of my way to get this film and was fortunate to get it on vhs being a big gloria <UNK> fan it was an excellent addition to my collection other than that i really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture the plot is predictable and weak and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching sterling hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department ms <UNK> is always fun to watch if you like her as i do but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot she works in a dive so let her use her own voice it can only lend to the atmosphere i must agree with an earlier reviewer the ending borrows heavily from the big heat to the point of <UNK> from the ending i have seen worse films with ms <UNK> <UNK> but i will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen if you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film this is your movie enjoy the picture
<START> hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie i e the writers directors producers actors <UNK> etc christopher plummer veteran of movies <UNK> along among scores of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a paycheck i guess there is nothing wrong with that but once they are paid that doesn't mean anyone has to watch it br br it bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb art if you want to see art go to an art gallery don't watch this movie comedy watch a re run of the <UNK> about the same plot with less time wasted br br <UNK> coleman gives his usual performance for better or worse and some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie but plummer it was embarrassing to watch his performance in fact i was positively <UNK> on him throughout the movie knowing this was plummer of sound of music fame i see from his bio that he called sound of music sound of so guess he didn't like it as much as the of millions who liked him in it br br i wonder if today he was asked how do you rate sound of music compared to where the heart is what would he say br br probably something like where the money is
<START> post 1988 after the disaster <UNK> <UNK> films lost the quality they had earlier br br <UNK> main <UNK> released in 1989 which was a great film rest all films were <UNK> mostly except hum 1991 later in 1991 br br this is another of the crap amitabh films people rejected in early 90's br br the film he did like a friendship token to <UNK> kapoor who directed the film and he didn't take a penny the film also had <UNK> and <UNK> again not paired each other after br br the film came in 1991 when bachchan had 4 releases and 3 <UNK> amongst them br br came 2 years after <UNK> and both supernatural films which were rejected this is another type of crap bachchan wears a mask and a type outfit and performs magic changing 1 person to a <UNK> etc of course being 1991 you can excuse the special effects but the film is too bad to be watched br br direction by <UNK> kapoor is not good music is bad br br amongst actors amitabh had become too old by 1991 and looked tired his acting is okay but not on par with his best <UNK> is okay <UNK> is alright rest are forgettable
<START> this is one of the very very few films that are so overwhelming that you are very unlikely to watch it more than once or twice in your lifetime other examples are claude documentary <UNK> and come and see by the director's husband <UNK> which covers much the same unbearable territory but in a very different way br br i suppose this is just as well given the difficulty of ever seeing a print br br apparently it's extraordinarily overt christian symbolism and admission that there were active russian <UNK> <UNK> that it was hardly ever seen in the <UNK> and of course post soviet russia has very little interest in films of that era br br the one time i saw it in london was in a festival of russian movies shown during the <UNK> era i e probably c 1988 however it apparently has been shown several times in the uk more recently so at least one subtitled print must exist here br br as far as i know it has never been released in the west on dvd or video so if you haven't seen it your best chance is probably to join a film society and endlessly <UNK> them to find a print and screen it
<START> this is one of those movies that i can watch again and again and not get tired of it it is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever i liked this one even more than x men in fact this movie is sort of a cross between x men and the matrix and it came out before either wesley snipes does a great job with the character of blade he is just not an <UNK> super hero also this movie isn't to get a pg 13 rating sure comic books are for kids mainly but i like a little more in my movies let's face it if we were in these situations we would <UNK> up a storm to so it is more realistic this comic book adaptation also has something that many don't a good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy let's face it none of the batman movies had a very good ending fight
<START> towards the end of his career jack arnold a very efficient director who gave us such classic 50's creature features as it came from outer space the creature from the black <UNK> and <UNK> teamed up with former football star turned top 70's <UNK> film <UNK> fred the hammer <UNK> for a pair of movies producing the <UNK> if <UNK> western the black bounty hunter and this <UNK> <UNK> clever and highly entertaining 70's black action <UNK> on your standard 40's film noir down at the heels private detective yarn br br <UNK> displays a charming combination of dry self <UNK> humor and relaxed <UNK> self confidence as <UNK> stone a cheap <UNK> and forever in debt <UNK> los angeles cop turned private investigator <UNK> so hard up for cash that he uses a bar as his business office and just barely makes ends meet doing penny <UNK> low paying minor cases that the police don't want to bother with while <UNK> the <UNK> for one of these <UNK> simple <UNK> <UNK> trying to find some guy's runaway teenage daughter who's hiding somewhere in hollywood stone finds himself <UNK> deep in a complex dangerous seemingly <UNK> criminal plot which includes a <UNK> out jesus freak religious cult <UNK> <UNK> hippie a <UNK> porno ring a priceless missing gold <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> to a legendary silent movie star a <UNK> underground drug <UNK> operation and an ever growing number of fresh corpses br br while lacking the <UNK> playful mischievous <UNK> of robert altman's masterful the long goodbye or the haunting <UNK> <UNK> of arthur <UNK> beautifully bleak night moves black eye nonetheless still makes the grade as a highly successful 70's spin on 40's mystery suspense thrillers <UNK> capable direction keeps the pace moving at a nice steady clip <UNK> with <UNK> exciting <UNK> a <UNK> bare <UNK> fight scenes and excellent use of various <UNK> seedy l a locations the <UNK> abandoned amusement park at the film's conclusion is especially effective the script by mark <UNK> and jim martin supplies a <UNK> amount of fairly complicated and often genuinely surprising plot twists and the expected array of quirky rough around the edges secondary characters are an interesting oddball bunch with particularly notable turns by <UNK> <UNK> as an <UNK> powerful lesbian model agency owner <UNK> has the <UNK> best line <UNK> to stone when she first meets him i'm a whole lot of woman <UNK> graves of get christie love tv show fame as <UNK> loyal <UNK> girlfriend the film's casual <UNK> depiction of both unconventional femme fatale and <UNK> equally <UNK> gal friday is one of its strongest <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who did the voice of <UNK> the shadow in the 40's as a <UNK> sleazy porno filmmaker all in all it's a modest yet <UNK> winner
<START> ray is one of those movies that makes you pause you actually think about what you heard or think about what you read about this man and it doesn't even come close during my first viewing of ray i forgot i was watching a movie i felt like a <UNK> tom watching this man's life thru a window this movie is so compelling it drags you in and it involves your every emotion you go thru a emotional roller coaster ride and when it's over you don't want to do it again so soon because it has that kind of emotional punch that other movies are lacking jamie foxx deserved his oscar and quite rightfully so his performance is spectacular and it should be held up as the standard for anybody wanting to do a bio <UNK> anytime soon this movie is as good as it's subject both deserved the titles classic and legend
<START> this film is <UNK> bad you can tell that all the actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a truly terrible movie there are obvious budget constraints but with a little thought and attention to detail the movie could have been so much better for example check out the scene where mickey first goes to the <UNK> and is talking to his friend the <UNK> whilst the murdered taxi driver is lying on the <UNK> you can actually see the corpse breathing what couldn't they afford to hire a half decent extra that could hold his breath for a 2 minute scene
<START> i saw this film last night a satire of the reality style programs that seem to be making the rounds at the moment br br what can i say i absolutely hated it about as interesting as watching paint dry and with maybe one or two only slightly amusing moments br br maybe it had something to do with me <UNK> not being a fan of the survivor and big brother type shows but if this had been a video dvd or if i'd been watching at the cinema on my own i would have <UNK> not endured more than the first 5 minutes br br
<START> this is the first porn i've ever tried to review it demands a different approach than usual since the allegory will not reward <UNK> i'm american i'm a <UNK> virgin we are european we are <UNK> and sex mad it is nice when we all screw each other lots to talk about well there kind of is in fact relative to your average 60s topless <UNK> number anyway and the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> at least delivers clean detailed compositions but what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn ok then the only scene i really <UNK> got off on was the first time <UNK> steps in there are efforts to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other the one black guy suffers a <UNK> bout of <UNK> <UNK> and multiple takes or not one perhaps on imdb act does look like it was partially <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> still i stayed awake and it was eight in the morning but what does the last shot mean
<START> i wanted to see this movie because i liked prisoner of the mountains and brat brother with <UNK> jr and the thief with <UNK> well unlike the other movies the <UNK> was a total waste of time the story that makes little sense very uneven acting <UNK> ann warren was especially bad really awful dialogs poor cinematography what else could go wrong i find it amusing that in practically every american made movie when the same language speaking <UNK> russians in this case are left alone they prefer to communicate with each other mostly in broken english and when they happen to speak russian for some reason <UNK> feel <UNK> to add a lot of f <UNK> in the sentences which have no profanity literal or non literal at the same time native english speaking actors choose to speak in broken russian why is that getting back to the story most of the subplots of the movie e g <UNK> the house <UNK> latin american <UNK> etc either make no sense or do nothing more than confusing the viewers it is too bad that <UNK> and leigh all good actors in my humble opinion got themselves involved in this disaster
<START> gene hackman is a former marine <UNK> colonel who <UNK> a handful of private vietnam vets to go back to and rescue some americans who have been listed as missing in action hackman suspects that in <UNK> the half dozen or so <UNK> are secretly being held in a remote camp by to be tormented and to provide more hard labor hackman is being paid by the wealthy robert stack whose son like <UNK> son is thought to be among the <UNK> but the circumstances are such that hackman can only manage to buy old and out dated weapons though he manages to pick up the help of a anti communist and his two daughters along the way br br i don't think the movie was deliberately <UNK> to <UNK> the myth of the still holding our <UNK> for propaganda purposes the myth was real enough if anyone remembers there were many <UNK> <UNK> in 1982 and 1983 bring back the <UNK> i think instead that the film was made partly in order to cash in on the myth it was absurd on the face of it why would our former enemy refuse to return <UNK> propaganda where is the propaganda value in something that's kept secret to add the labor supply they need a hundred extra <UNK> in vietnam and the motives behind this movie with its <UNK> music and high body count were <UNK> br br but how about the movie itself stripped of its theme of <UNK> mythical <UNK> <UNK> it's a routine <UNK> <UNK> no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s gene <UNK> performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water he's just about always reliable br br of the others this being a formulaic plot derived from the dirty dozen among others i kept trying to guess which of the gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission of the three anti communist <UNK> i figured one or more were dead meat that's why asian <UNK> appear in movies like this i was right two times out of three i also figured patrick as the rookie ex officer the youngest of the group who'd never earned the respect of the others because he'd never seen combat would also have to go in some heroic mode wrong he becomes a hero true but survives intact i thought there was a fifty fifty chance that hackman would have to go too but he makes it out okay the formula doesn't really stretch for originality either charles <UNK> claustrophobic <UNK> <UNK> from the great escape is here in fred <UNK> ex tunnel rat a who is forced to crawl through a <UNK> <UNK> with a snake inside it so that he can do a <UNK> on the <UNK> camp br br the title <UNK> <UNK> is from a tribute that <UNK> <UNK> made to the men on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was common that day <UNK> was certainly right about that whether or not the men who fought in vietnam were all equally is remote from the point anyone who saw combat or even came near it putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them were heroic enough this movie and the way it exploits our <UNK> about the vietnam war doesn't really do them justice
<START> ok the end of this may be something of a letdown after what has come before and <UNK> kinski should have had his 10 second appearance cut out but there is no getting away from the fact that this is a really wonderful atmospheric euro thriller i can't believe i have never seen this till now its good to know there are films out there that are still worth tracking down and this really is stunning visuals haunting and builds an amazing atmosphere <UNK> <UNK> is perfect as our heroine and the scene on the beach with is some of the most relaxed and perfect acting you could see <UNK> <UNK> is spot on as a fellow visitor to the town who may or may not be who she seems if you miss the <UNK> days of euro cinema then chase this out there's a decent widescreen print going round and please get this out in a restored dvd someone they did it with the directors fifth <UNK> and this is a much better film
<START> i have now seen quite a few films by <UNK> <UNK> but this would have to be the most disappointing so far this film seemed to lack the <UNK> that is usually everywhere in his films and the story just never got me interested many <UNK> <UNK> appear in this film so it's not like there was a lack of on screen talent but this film just seemed more serious than his other films if there was a comedic edge to this movie i certainly couldn't find it and it made for one surprisingly weak movie
<START> who the heck is responsible for this terrible <UNK> of one of my favorite books this is just terrible terrible acting terrible script the story isn't even close to its old self and what were they thinking robin williams for sake this really defies description don't see this seriously don't not even for laughs especially not if you're a fan of the book this might just be the worst movie adaptation ever everything is disjointed and <UNK> the characters which are important in order to understand the sequence of events are seriously <UNK> and every potentially interesting location from the book has been changed example vienna new york into something profoundly uninteresting br br for those who haven't read the book it's basically a fictional biography about a writer growing up exploring his writing and so on his mother writes an autobiography which is <UNK> despite her <UNK> as a sort of feminist <UNK> the book is well written engaging and long its <UNK> is simply beautiful br br this movie on the other hand is about robin williams once again telling us to <UNK> the day
<START> this is basically your run of the mill violent biker flick complete with nifty crashes and music ok so just and crashes it's a slight notch above much of the other fare featured on mst3k but it's still the equivalent of driving a nail into your <UNK> slow and painful to give away plot would <UNK> my energy so i'll just say you're better off skipping this one
<START> the beginning of the film is promising when <UNK> anna hear the story of the incident that happen on the day she was born that raise the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous <UNK> <UNK> jacques she set to find out whether it's true or not and giving the fact the she plays also the piano that's not such a remote idea <UNK> meet <UNK> and his wife <UNK> isabelle <UNK> and their son and on the way <UNK> the fact that there are some secrets in that family as much in her own br br o k we have seen this before and it has been done in a more interesting way than here the character of <UNK> is left with out us understanding her motives to her action and she is not interesting enough to care for her the piano scenes look fake and the whole piano sub plot doesn't add anything to the character's insight but serve as to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place br br in short a very disappointing outing from <UNK> who can do better than this
<START> i have never seen the first <UNK> film and i have also never heard a good thing said about it so i see <UNK> 2 in the local blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back starring <UNK> <UNK> and debbie <UNK> it boasts now being the massive troma fan that i am there is no way i'm not going to rent this film out how can it possibly be bad with these two oh how wrong i was even <UNK> and debbie cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is <UNK> quite frankly stinks as <UNK> although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst one liners in the history of film debbie does put a solid performance in but it isn't enough the kills are terrible as are the gore effects for example check out when the guy is supposedly <UNK> on something or other and just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst i have ever seen in movie history the film doesn't even work on a so bad it's good level avoid like the <UNK> br br 2 10
<START> the opening scene of this movie is pretty incredible i've seen a number of sci fi movies with great special effects but my roommate and i looked at each other after the opening sequence and he said <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the plot of the movie is pretty simple but the nice thing about this sci fi movie is that it lets the audience figure out most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to subtly explain it the creatures in this movie are also very interesting you don't get a really good look at them until about two thirds of the way through overall a very entertaining movie
<START> ugh even the ever popular diane lane could not save this movie and the most exciting thing about the movie was seeing if <UNK> face would move one has heard so much <UNK> about his <UNK> face lift etc so like an accident on the side of the road we just had to slow down and see the wreck the plot was thin here we have a very professional mob hit man who somehow <UNK> on to a wild and <UNK> punk crook and throughout this movie we're wondering why this guy stays with this idiot let alone gets together with the guy in the first place then the crime that was not even committed has the pro to go after the witnesses he would have popped them right then and there but then we would not have had a movie then would we and why did the <UNK> even agree to the <UNK> there were more holes in this flick than in my <UNK> the acting was horrid the entire movie predictable down to the minute and even the ending and so much could have been done to make this a much better movie but if you have about 90 minutes to kill and not have to use any brain cells in the process then this movie is just what the doctor ordered
<START> ok on the whole this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with on in the world of physics and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe if you have read stephen brilliant book a brief history of time and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain concepts which i did to a certain extent greene is bearable but obviously for the sake of the masses tends to explain things in a <UNK> way this is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series br br the guest scientists were good no <UNK> but i suppose he has his own dvd s i kept waiting for him to appear but they <UNK> through the same ones for almost 3 parts very american <UNK> here with a few brits and one i bought the <UNK> 2 disc edition <UNK> and there were a few <UNK> that really <UNK> from the overall experience br br 1 the this is brought to you by at the start of each part was a necessary evil for the first part but seeing it 2 more times before it was over was very ordinary br br 2 can't be helped i suppose but there is quite a bit of <UNK> at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the button a few times br br 3 this disc set was straight from tv ie ads what happen last show for those that missed it and frequent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for more appearing throughout the presentation quite unlike bbc material which is <UNK> for presentation planets the blue planet etc my 7 10 is based on content alone the <UNK> were there but i got over them if this had have been done with that classic british <UNK> <UNK> you know the one it would be a perfect disc set in my opinion br br if you have seen this and want more then i highly recommend book a brief history of time i wish it was a movie too br br happy viewing
<START> this movie was much better than i expected after a couple of films by will smith that weren't that great like i robot he is back to being likable and fun in this one smith plays <UNK> a date doctor most of the film centers around him teaching albert how to be himself and get a date with cole a rich famous celebrity whom he works with albert is a <UNK> and goof and always <UNK> on his feet or what not all <UNK> does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around br br during all this <UNK> meets sara a <UNK> <UNK> whom has <UNK> off men <UNK> charms her so of course they go out but <UNK> may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them he doesn't believe in love himself he has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college but he likes sara so keeps going after her <UNK> friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor so sara tracks the doctor down only to learn its <UNK> so of course she thinks he's a pig then it's up to <UNK> to explain to sara and what he does so they both end up <UNK> br br final verdict good has some laughs and is entertaining i recommend it
<START> peter lorre was born to play stephen with lines like mr smith you shouldn't hold my wife like that and i told you not to keep the monkey in the house the poster for this film is an eerie green and peter lorre <UNK> in way that makes you never want to go to his <UNK> colony island this film is not available on dvd although it is a classic and very rarely shown on tv what exactly is the relationship between stephen and the monkey why does the monkey upset him so much we will never know the film should be <UNK> by someone and <UNK> should be made into a <UNK> video the film was re released in the 1950s and only a few of the peter lorre <UNK> spend any text on this film casablanca was right around the corner bogart could have been on that island but they surely did not have the budget for him
<START> i do not think i am alone when i say that 2005 has not been particularly kind to the horror genre while cursed hide and seek the ring two and the <UNK> horror all showed glimpses of interest and potential there have been more misses than hits for proof see white noise boogeyman the jacket <UNK> and alone in the dark imagine my surprise when house of wax tightly written by siblings <UNK> and carey hayes turned out to be well a surprise br br <UNK> jones elisha <UNK> is a young woman traveling with her trouble making brother nick <UNK> michael murray and boyfriend <UNK> jared they are along with <UNK> paris hilton blake robert <UNK> and dalton jon <UNK> hoping to score tickets to the final football game of the season along the way they run into some car trouble and are forced to enter a desolate town where nothing is what it appears to be br br upon hearing of this a remake of the classic vincent price b movie i rolled my eyes i did not even want to think about what disaster <UNK> director <UNK> had <UNK> up for his audience in a time when most high profile horror films are <UNK> <UNK> with bad writing static direction and amateur acting i consider myself lucky that <UNK> and the hayes brothers took it upon themselves to make a good old fashioned <UNK> fest unlike the <UNK> that i named before this flick pulls no punches and uses every cinematic trick in the book to give everyone exactly what they came for br br i am happy that the actually took the time and effort to create likable and believable characters thus making the events that much more <UNK> it also gives the young actors portraying them something grip on as she did in the girl next door elisha <UNK> proves to audiences what a skilled actress she really is in the 2003 remake of the texas chainsaw massacre jessica <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by delivering a raw and emotional performance one that put the viewer right there with her here <UNK> does the same <UNK> michael murray a cinderella story in one of his first more mature roles is no <UNK> as nick murray exudes charisma and a hard edge as well as some impressive <UNK> on top of it murray and <UNK> <UNK> perfectly and have <UNK> <UNK> chemistry br br more so than anything else the press and the american public have made a field day about paris <UNK> major acting debut as i expected hilton does not embarrass herself in fact she is just as good as anyone else in the movie do with that what you will like <UNK> and murray hilton has screen presence she is sexy and playful i cannot think one of reason why she's gotten the worst of the film's harsh reception other than they are simply picking on her jared tv's girls' <UNK> manages to overcome his <UNK> role robert <UNK> tv's <UNK> and jon <UNK> meet the parents do not have much to work with but get the job done with only one scene damon <UNK> <UNK> makes an unforgettable impression and his presence hangs over the rest of the film finally brian van holt basic is superb and threatening in a <UNK> role br br once more kudos must go to the screenwriters for avoiding clichés whenever possible despite popular opinion house of wax is quite unpredictable for a majority of its running time take this for example it seems as if the killer is down for the count and <UNK> <UNK> down to retrieve something from his <UNK> what do you expect to happen see the movie and you will understand what i mean it is also refreshing to see a horror film in which the characters show even a <UNK> of good sense br br unlike most horror scores john <UNK> work never <UNK> however as with dark <UNK> other releases the visual aspects of wax are award worthy and lift the film above its genre <UNK> the talents of cinematographer stephen f production designer graham walker art director nicholas <UNK> and editor joel <UNK> highlight the <UNK> imagery speaking of imagery i believe that the gore <UNK> will be thrilled with the many makeup effects and tricks in store here each death scene is more stomach <UNK> than the last considering his past in music videos and commercials it is obvious that <UNK> has a great eye for style his in your face approach is a great asset to this film's success just when you think the camera will turn away it does not he is also particularly good a building thick layers of dread and atmosphere one standout shot is our introduction to the killer as he slowly emerges from a trap door br br in a case like this i would usually admit when i am in the minority shut up okay i liked house of 1000 corpses in this case i firmly that the <UNK> have gotten it wrong i am not sure why people are so hard on this film considering it's much better than recent genre entries maybe they're afraid to admit that a horror flick starring paris hilton could possibly be worth watching who knows this is a horror film and a <UNK> stylish and effective one at that as a <UNK> horror fan all i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed house of wax in all of its lurid and sadistic glory i safely consider it a great accomplishment in modern horror as well as along with sin city the first completely satisfying release of 2005
<START> <UNK> was one of a series of <UNK> released in australia during the early to mid 1990s that explored the supposed of the <UNK> <UNK> male in the age of <UNK> this creature only needs look at a pretty young thing and he's accused of sexual <UNK> and his life is ruined damn those women's <UNK> br br as my tone might suggest i don't buy any of this anti feminist <UNK> and didn't enjoy this film the issues of sexual <UNK> and teacher student relations sexual <UNK> is here the product of a confused young woman's imagination and those professional boundaries that teachers are meant to maintain well when the teacher is a charming and handsome family man and played by jimmy well <UNK> worry about those br br sexist trash and even by reviewing it i'm giving it more time than it deserves
<START> talk about rubbish i can't think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects i can't believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish br br the front cover of the video box shows a <UNK> with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by it's cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a <UNK> <UNK> terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in but no a <UNK> island instead br br i took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i haven't watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldn't attempted it br br the biggest joke in this movie is the effects the <UNK> looked like they were home made and that <UNK> was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to <UNK> these lines and shoot on a island br br lastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through br br in conclusion i give this film 0 stars out of 5
<START> other reviews have talked about how frank this film is especially in terms of male frontal nudity well those who've seen <UNK> with its frequently naked actors and expect something similar are in for a big disappointment other than a few seconds in the <UNK> team locker room the two <UNK> side by side shower lasts a grand total of 15 seconds the female lead has <UNK> brief frontal moments a lot of this film's marketing is <UNK> to the gay male audience but those expecting even a hint of <UNK> between the two male leads best friends who have a three way with the girlfriend of one of them will be most disappointed there is not even the hint of either one's being interested in the other or even <UNK> aware that the other is part of the <UNK> a <UNK> as a film is curiously <UNK> the viewer gets very little sense of who these three young people are of how they are feeling of why they behave as they do about one hour of the original cut was deleted perhaps this is why the finished film seems <UNK> undeveloped stick with <UNK> a french film which more than delivers on its promises
<START> i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly sure it was a cheesy idea but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck the fact it had been <UNK> in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was <UNK> on impossible for the movie to be any good still i <UNK> my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today as i entered my screen i was <UNK> it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen little did i know for what i was about to endure underdog to put it blunt is horrendous it really is imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse that is just how pathetic the movie is while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond <UNK> the acting is generally poor and the movie just feels like an over long tired and downright boring saturday cartoon after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released it's an embarrassment to disney hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel br br so lets get onto the acting cracks <UNK> okay let me be honest jason lee is decent his voice suits the <UNK> and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work however with such a dodgy script he just seems to <UNK> in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield murray did what he could with what he had but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable then we get onto the human actors and well the majority of atrocious alex plays the friend of underdog jack my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor not once did i believe he was a real person in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie james belushi seems half dead in the film he has nothing to work with no decent lines he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable thankfully peter is the one redeeming factor of the movie he is great as dr and seems to be having a laugh in the role he steals every scene he is in although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick <UNK> the rest of the cast are even worse especially taylor <UNK> she just needs to end her acting career right now br br underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms the effects are so <UNK> that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has <UNK> what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super the final fight also <UNK> on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of <UNK> the dog flies other stuff happens some stuff gets <UNK> about all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain awful at worst when someone says look its a plane no its a bird no its a frog yes you read that right i just wanted to burst into tears there and then actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully br br overall underdog becomes the worst movie of 2008 at this early period and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie luckily for underdog meet the <UNK> arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse so in case you didn't get the point of my review avoid the film at all costs if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs buy a real dog if necessary just do not see this
<START> i saw this play on showtime some years back in the comfort of my home and when the final note was struck i wanted to jump off the <UNK> and give the production a standing <UNK> as it was i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs for my birthday my kids bought me the vhs version as well as the cd of the play with <UNK> in the <UNK> todd role br br i've shared the play with many some finding the subject a bit sick but none having anything but praise for the songs br br i've always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george as well as and edmund as judge <UNK> br br i must own the dvd
<START> <UNK> written well acted intense and suspenseful this show lives in the real world not as <UNK> as is 24 and i am a huge fan of 24 incidentally it has believable characters and in many ways is much smarter than most in this genre it tries to present both sides of islam so far i have watched the first 4 episodes and find the story to be more <UNK> balanced the terrorists are more complex and not one dimensional and as a result of that balance the terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains being portrayed in film and on television last but not least the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon i recommend this show for anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like
<START> do people rate this movie highly because it's a foreign war movie br br to me it's nothing more than a bad hollywood war movie in german br br this movie is so bad on so many levels to even mention it along with platoon or full metal jacket is absurd the battle sequences are pathetic the dialog and acting atrocious br br this so called group of storm troopers are <UNK> in the not ss troops there is so much wrong with this movie it's sad bad editing bad acting it's got it all br br the movie goes on and on and on as though the audience should be made to suffer as much as the soldiers did br br i read in a review that the this film had a 20 million budget br br for real where was it spent in the fake train car sequences in the pathetic special effects ugh br br as a wwii history buff and wwii movie fan i found this movie to be a serious disappointment br br for an excellent alternative war movie check out the beast not a wwii movie but still outstanding br br don't bother with this one
<START> the girl in lovers lane is one strange little low budget film on its surface the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named brett <UNK> who spends his time looking out for a young kid named danny <UNK> brown and the girl carrie <UNK> meadows that meets who would like to look out for him nothing overly interesting happens goes out with carrie gets danny out of trouble <UNK> father drinks a lot etc until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when carrie is murdered her father blames pulls him out of a jail cell and just about beats him to death now their roles are <UNK> and danny has to save br br until i read the reviews on imdb i thought that maybe it was just me reading more into and <UNK> relationship than was really there but i see now that i'm not alone it was quite obvious to me early on that and danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from 1959 the homosexual nature of their relationship while never openly expressed is still quite obvious their living and sleeping <UNK> reaction to finding danny in bed with a prostitute inability to commit to carrie and that phone call at the end when danny tells his parents he's <UNK> home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there's more to their relationship than initially meets the eye i'm sure they exist but i can't think of any movies i've seen from the 50s that scream homosexual quite as <UNK> as this one br br as for the movie i don't know any other way to put this  it's boring as i wrote earlier nothing much at all happens for 90 of the run time the characters are dull and the actors aren't good enough to give the girl in lovers lane much of a spark the lone exception is jack <UNK> his crazy jesse is the one character interesting enough to be worth watching <UNK> had creepy down pat but i guess the biggest problem i had with the movie was with character motivation and logic carrie is killed and is immediately blamed what about crazy jesse who has been stalking carrie for probably her whole life anyone think to ask jesse where he was that night her father has seen him bother carrie at the diner yet he never considers that the <UNK> jesse might have something to do with his daughter's death not a lot of logic there and what about <UNK> confession danny grabs jesse by the <UNK> and this is all it takes to force a confession out of jesse real tough guy huh why would he confess so easily and after he <UNK> no one thinks to grab him it's awfully nice of jesse just to stay put and not run off in any other reality he would have never <UNK> his guts and would have run like a rabbit if he had been <UNK> for the murder the fact that the girl in lovers lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters is something i'm not willing to do overall i'm giving the girl in lovers lane a 4 10
<START> to put it simply this was a pompous piece of <UNK> <UNK> overly <UNK> and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment after a while i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffed up <UNK> <UNK> br br and this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into <UNK> and shouldn't have all the scenes are in a sort of washed out blue steel hmmm the last time i checked <UNK> and <UNK> are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors in fact the light they put out tends to be more in the <UNK> orange range of the spectrum so where's all the blue steel grey light coming from br br this movie has fancy sets and <UNK> cgi fx but it's still dreck it's pathetic junk put out for today's movie goers who are easily by pathetic junk br br i very much enjoy vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices but this was a total hack job br br universal <UNK> 1941 the <UNK> is infinitely superior to this even though its fx is pretty primitive compared to what could be done nowadays br br i'm done with this franchise the first movie was reasonably decent the second still somewhat entertaining but this one i couldn't even finish all the way to the end because it was so boring
<START> okay it's 2005 and when you finally get to look at this film you will probably <UNK> that it is dated but here's the thing the screenplay was bold the exposure of the music industry at that time was as bold as well and it took some time for this to get music that was created by african americans to be promoted on the same level as white acts in some cases it still is but back in the 70's this film addressed some of the background many never knew now we've got american idol pop idol and other such things that allow us into the minds of the record <UNK> and how they think they should market something that sells and not market talent br br when i was a kid i loved the earth wind and fire release of that's the way of the world which contained some of their biggest hits shining star reasons and the title little did i know this was a soundtrack of a movie until i moved to los angeles and got the wonderful z channel br br the z channel showed this film as part of a harvey keitel <UNK> gee i had no idea harvey keitel did so many movies and when i saw this one i was surprised this movie is not a cinematic masterpiece but it does deserve more merit than it got it's a nice little film more than a vanity piece for earth wind and fire harvey keitel does a great job as a torn record executive trying to fight the system there are a lot of lessons to be drawn from this and a lot of <UNK> trade that was exposed br br if you can find this uncut it's worth a look
<START> rock <UNK> second venture in the science fiction genre after seconds is <UNK> a film that combines elements of the bride of frankenstein and <UNK> in one rather weird film about for lack of a better word a test tube baby that grows up to be barbara <UNK> br br hudson is scientist <UNK> in <UNK> development and gets a chance to first experiment on his own <UNK> <UNK> when it is accidentally hit by his car br br some <UNK> from the female dog are given to a <UNK> born puppy and it grows remarkably into an adult <UNK> with his success hudson takes a <UNK> from a dead accident victim and gives it some of the same stuff br br what he gets is barbara <UNK> and she develops physically and intellectually at a <UNK> rate what she doesn't do is develop emotionally still hudson passes her off as his new research assistant to friends and family like sister in law diane <UNK> son john and daughter in law anne br br <UNK> doesn't explore some of the real issues in this kind of science it exploits them instead the special effects as they are are pretty second rate hudson looks like he lost interest in the project about halfway through the film br br now what would have really been interesting is if he had gotten boy child and it grew up to be a <UNK> novel hero now that would have been something rock hudson could have sunk his teeth into
<START> this movie simply does not work the action scenes were shot to look stylish but just come out looking sloppy seagal barely fights and a lot of his scenes are shot from the back if you look in some of the scenes it is not even him but a 100 <UNK> lighter stunt double the movie is just all around bad
<START> and this movie easily <UNK> my expectations the fact that it is written and directed by peter <UNK> led me to believe it was in style with other films i'm used to and bored with seeing him in anyway i <UNK> went along to see this flick and that i'm glad for this stuff has humour and depth 9 out of 10 see it
<START> this movie really shows its age the print i saw was terrible due to age but it is possible that there are better <UNK> out there however this was not the major problem with the movie the problem was that although the film was made in 1933 it was essentially a silent film with only the <UNK> of dialog scattered only a few sentences in the film in the most amateur fashion sometimes the characters' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and <UNK> hide the fact that the film was dubbed well its true that this czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious it just looked cheap br br overall the film looked low budget and silly it's really a shame though because there was a grain of a good story a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and or has no interest in women but in the 21st century few people would really be willing to sit through this <UNK> mess even with a few glimpses of the naked and somewhat <UNK> hedy <UNK> it isn't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it <UNK> even by 1933 standards this film was a poorly made dud about the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different <UNK> looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image hollywood created when she came to america she looks like 2 completely different people br br it's such an <UNK> looking and technically inferior film i don't see how it has gotten such rave reviews for technical problems alone the movie can't rate a 10 or anything near it
<START> the first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history almost as good as the shower scene in psycho and the acting by robert walker is fantastic a psychopath involved with <UNK> star in exchange murders <UNK> the story and overall this film is very good but <UNK> one problem why guy haines go to br br the cop in the first place 4 5
<START> having already seen the original jack frost i never thought that jack frost 2 would be as absurd as it is boy was i wrong then again a <UNK> movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material even worse than you might expect i believe this is the first a <UNK> sequel and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more a <UNK> sequels br br it's hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack <UNK> <UNK> which are essentially <UNK> with eyes arms a mouth and sharp teeth start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it they are shown both as puppets with a stick underneath to move them and as computer animation which i have to say looks very cheesy the computer animation surprised me as the first jack frost had no such effects br br i'd strongly recommend that you see the original jack frost before seeing this one both of which it would be <UNK> to watch with a group of friends to get the full amusement out of it and because it would make more sense sense being a relative term br br now only if there was uncle sam 2
<START> usually i start my reviews with an explanation of how and why i watched the film i'm reviewing with this i simply cannot explain i needed to be awake early for work the next day so the last thing i wanted to do was watch a film that i didn't know anything about but something kept me glued to my <UNK> <UNK> as i watched this heather graham vehicle oh that's right boredom br br graham plays a <UNK> nut case who seems more obsessed with her marriage <UNK> than the guy she married played by luke wilson when her <UNK> decides to set off in search of better things work women and scripts presumably begins a <UNK> quest to find her husband and free him from his spiritual wheelchair it sounds like i'm making this up but sadly i'm not in reality this is little more than an acting exercise for graham as she <UNK> gives this <UNK> from friends role a work out oh and <UNK> er <UNK> is in there as well for some reason br br the tv <UNK> had this down as a comedy but i failed to find a single laugh anywhere it struck me that this was a personal journey for lisa krueger the director and writer in the same <UNK> as girl interrupted but even that had more laughs than this <UNK> character is simply too self <UNK> for the audience to care about and i felt sorry for the <UNK> <UNK> husband as he <UNK> fought for his freedom from his clearly mental wife very little of this film made sense as characters simply appeared in the story as though they were standing around waiting for graham to turn up like the extras in the truman show in fact the only positive note i can produce from my <UNK> was heather graham nice <UNK> and that wasn't because i was too tired to enjoy the film br br in truth it's very difficult to think of anybody to recommend this film to graham <UNK> a very small number of overall movie goers i think you'll agree will have to be committed to watch this <UNK> and possibly <UNK> students who collect american indian dream <UNK> will take something from this i was amazed that the average rating at time of writing was 5 0 that would make this film as good as die another day and <UNK> in my book and that simply ain't right committed is a quirky oddball mess of a movie that neither entertains or <UNK> it's complicated pointless and simply too boring for my tastes and probably yours too don't even think about watching this
<START> the show is great no words to describe it wonderful music incredible dance the <UNK> couldn't spoil it not because they were not that bad but because the show is really that good br br the <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 <UNK> it's ok to show various angles but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average they manage to film the start of a jump with one camera then cut it in the middle and show the rest of it in another angle br br no matter how much they tried they couldn't spoil that wonderful show it's a must for dance and music lovers
<START> each story has a lesson for young and old but what more i have to say may spoil a future story but i believe what i have to say is for everyone just for one particular episode the soldier and death br br okay of all the stories the one that sticks out for me is the soldier and death because is was the point in my life i realized that life was <UNK> i am not kidding the airing was on my 8 1 2 birthday and i will always remember it i didn't remember its title until tonight but i new the synopsis may <UNK> 1988 br br it is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part in life it is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact i am living proof currently 28 <UNK> old that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults br br i write this with tears in my eyes heath ledger a wonderful actor my own age died today it kinda reminded me of many lessons i have learned in my life so i write this as a reminder to young and old no one is <UNK> to whatever is in store for us br br i hate to say that death is going to happen but this story was the first time i saw death as not a bad thing but a part of life was quite literally in this story i can't help it it was a life changing moment for me and will <UNK> be br br and for that br br i love you jim <UNK> and i still remember much of your work in life up until the day you died and your <UNK> muppet show and thank you brian <UNK> for keeping the <UNK> alive honest i do thank you all of your co workers <UNK> and <UNK> br br the stage is just a stage and a show is just a show but imagination will create magic that forever the world will know br br thank you br br and for all who doubt me dance magic dance
<START> i just saw this <UNK> old <UNK> on tv best watched with a very large of dr jungle juice at hand this cheese fest is hilariously bad on the very slim plus side <UNK> was in her physical prime she looks good and you get to see a fair bit of her since she plays a go go dancer she had great legs that's for sure there's also some minor interest for screen buffs in the footage of los angeles <UNK> <UNK> and in <UNK> actors in minor parts who went on to better things veteran <UNK> ron <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> delivers a toe <UNK> early performances as sailor the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who rats <UNK> out to the bad guy you might also <UNK> the gun <UNK> security guard in the hit and run scene it's a very early appearance by gordon jump who gave such a lovely performance in as piece of br br the <UNK> of such as it is follows the <UNK> of an exotic dancer welch on the run from her murderous ex husband luke <UNK> this turkey is classic production line hollywood <UNK> a paint by numbers script pedestrian direction hokey shots edits and effects ultra cheesy stock music <UNK> sets and performances to match br br the cast is as uniformly dreadful as the screenplay although <UNK> is capable of fair performances in the right vehicle this old <UNK> is so bad that she doesn't really stand a chance and neither does the audience one of my favourite moments occurs when <UNK> <UNK> up in the hospital sees the vegas cop who's pursuing her murderous ex and asks how did you get here to which he of course replies in a plane oh the humanity and you won't be able to take your eyes off the doctor michael who has what might well be one of the very worst walk <UNK> in the long sad history of bad cameos i don't think i've ever seen anyone stand in one spot so badly before br br love interest joe james <UNK> <UNK> through the film with a fixed look that's somewhere between <UNK> and embarrassed and no wonder this bomb puts the cast through just about every made for tv cliché in the book from spectacularly dreadful turn in the dreadful nightmare montage to the pure schlock of the <UNK> horse ride along leo beach br br spoiler warning just about the only interesting thing in the whole film is the denouement in which <UNK> finally gets her own back and hilariously <UNK> the title by setting the baddie on fire whoever the stunt guy was really earned his money on this one he goes up like linda in a <UNK> yet even this fairly spectacular scene is <UNK> by the fact that one of the crew moves into shot near the end br br there are so many crappy things about that it's oddly compelling i found yourself wondering if this could be one of the worst films i've ever seen made the answer seemed to be a <UNK> <UNK> until i saw the film that followed it roger <UNK> mega trashy classic 'the big doll <UNK> which takes awful to a whole new level i can <UNK> recommend these two as a double bill you'll laugh yourself silly
<START> a touching movie about a talented woman who struggles with a society and a love that <UNK> <UNK> her the issues are subtly addressed and timeless as many of the depicted difficulties between man and woman still exist in dutch society today this movie is a tribute to all modern women without <UNK> on <UNK> not only the story is well told the acting and the scenery are great as well
<START> <UNK> thought of having sequels to iron eagle must be shot in this case once was enough iron eagle was a good movie to watch even though it is unrealistic it is still entertaining iron eagle ii has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia i didn't even bother to watch iron eagle iii but from looking at the r rating i assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies well iron eagle iv is probably the most inane sequel lou <UNK> jr returns as the always delightful <UNK> <UNK> another jason returns to fill the role of doug masters canadian jason who looks just like jason from the first iron eagle but wait here comes a possible spoiler wasn't doug killed in iron eagle ii the writers must've been for a story so they <UNK> doug masters by saying he was a prisoner of the russians this movie was the <UNK> done of all the iron eagle films why do movie makers find it to make sequels to unappealing movies ex police academy movies i have always liked <UNK> jr 's work in these films he was the only one holding this turkey together let's hope this was the last of the iron eagle sequels let it rest in peace
<START> i was surfing through imdb one day when i stumbled across the curious adventures of mr <UNK> how obscure it was i decided to set off looking for it thanks to it didn't take me long so i bought it for a dollar and when i got home i watched it although i must say i was quite impressed br br three of the paintings in a king's apartment a <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and a self portrait of the king who is just as selfish and sadistic as the actual king himself come to life one night while the king is sleeping the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> escape while the painting of the king calls the police in order to capture the couple fortunately for the couple mr comes in to help them often mocking the police and the king br br the back of the dvd case describes this film as a surreal visual delight and an underrated entry in the history of classic animation i couldn't agree more with it considering that much of the backgrounds look rather bizarre and many of the characters are weird which include the depressed citizens of an underground city and hungry lions that are <UNK> by the music of a blind man who kind of looks like andy <UNK> not to mention mr himself is somewhat eccentric the film is very creative and mostly fun to watch and its only flaw is that it can be slow moving but overall this film was very good and it comes recommended by yours truly br br grade b awesome
<START> spoiler alert br br you can listen to wong <UNK> <UNK> movies like a radio play invisible <UNK> between the characters the rooms where they stay in the rhythm that <UNK> them ahead attraction and dislike the whole spectrum of the atmosphere is played back by the sound track the dialogue is mostly completely <UNK> br br the narration is similar to a childish <UNK> look at a beautiful woman and a sad man whose <UNK> are noticeable but helpless in the mood for love is told from a child perspective but the child never appears as a narrator the aesthetic of the film is developed by an extreme light and color <UNK> harsh cuts an <UNK> almost documentary camera and a complex <UNK> sound br br the genius use of <UNK> king <UNK> perhaps perhaps perhaps whose mysterious power grows the more often it is repeated and the <UNK> <UNK> helps in the <UNK> choreography of the two protagonists maggie cheung in her beautiful dresses is brilliant the perfect <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the handsome stylish tony <UNK> the audience assumes a romance between them but wong just sees sad <UNK> the two potential lovers are revolving around each other like <UNK> knowing that they never will share the same <UNK> you wish that they will find each other they won't and the emotional power of their non love sex relationship makes the movie immensely fascinating br br it is about broken luck and <UNK> love in all of <UNK> films these are the love whether it comes too early or it comes too late to take the one and not the other person the yearning of the characters that is never satisfied their loneliness the mourning and the luck that they experience when it is too late
<START> if you watch this at home on dvd or <UNK> be sure you have great sound system the musical score through this is what moves you through the movie i have watched the movie several times and thought it was great but after just up <UNK> my home theater sound system what a difference i will be watching this movie many many more times br br if you do not have a great sound system find a friend who does and watch it there br br also watch the extra stories and behind the scenes extras that come with it the br or dvd the interview of in the 1960's talks about his <UNK> <UNK> but for those times just boys got it today i hope some of it goes to girls
<START> clearly <UNK> would like to wear jess <UNK> crown whilst at least <UNK> the old wife <UNK> plays a corrupt <UNK> <UNK> prison warden in this modern ambitious w i p film with some exceptions many of <UNK> films are <UNK> produced and directed in a <UNK> <UNK> manner shots don't always cut together and the sound mixes can be horrific while watching angel of death 2 aka prison island massacre i asked myself if is deliberately trying to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or is he just naturally shoddy like his mentor is this movie deliberately bad which would be self <UNK> or is it simply bad by neglect after a <UNK> is forced to give a <UNK> <UNK> her rapist fills her mouth then fills her <UNK> with some drugs minutes later she is <UNK> into a prison for reasons not explained and subjected to the <UNK> and rough handling of staff and other inmates as this is a <UNK> film there are lesbian scenes <UNK> and plenty of violent behavior the gore is bloody and sadistic too with <UNK> such as teeth pulling and courtesy of <UNK> <UNK> the acting is pretty awful and the fight scenes are lame but there is a love of sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what trash fans enjoy unfortunately the flat script makes for a flat movie so despite numerous atrocities hardcore sex and a guest appearance from jess franco the experience is an empty one but isn't that what most jess franco movies are
<START> about the spoiler warning it's not may contain it does contain spoilers readers beware br br okay first i need it to be known that i'm not bashing the actors they're just working with what they're given the problem was the script it was horrendous there was nothing believable about it at all sure when you have a movie based on a murderous <UNK> there's going to be the bad mistake here and there that puts you in the terribly horrific movie worthy situation but these girls just made stupid decision after stupid decision the only girl smart enough to ever try and call the police was the girl added towards the end because he'd already killed one and hit another with a car speaking of hitting her with a car why the hell did she try and <UNK> a truck rather than run to the side like a normal person also does the one who wrote the script honest to god believe cops are not going to investigate a door covered in blood frankly it wasn't suspenseful either the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were well this rant has gone on way longer than i meant to for such a bad movie so i won't bother to touch on the end besides the fact it's unrealistic and lame
<START> why remake the original assault to my mind assault was carpenter's true masterpiece it had all the elements good carpenter movies contain <UNK> threat on a small group of individuals people taking the challenge because they are forced to do so isolation just remember the guns in carpenter's original made no sound being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices and now this remake <UNK> on main character i s psychology and on his relation to main character ii the evil but honorable the anonymous threat in the carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy corruption background the just didn't understand the main plot of the original and thus produced something pretty ordinary
<START> an assassination thriller in the <UNK> of day of the in the line of fire has the added twist that eastwood's old <UNK> bodyguard frank is troubled by past failure on the job the chase becomes personal as john <UNK> assassin <UNK> <UNK> him over this <UNK> with the rather clunky exception of the love of a good woman <UNK> <UNK> raines <UNK> going to set <UNK> mind at rest than taking <UNK> down personally br br <UNK> is a <UNK> presence not simply <UNK> on screen but often a <UNK> actor too this is one of his good films focused and playing director <UNK> game eastwood is too old but a the audience don't care <UNK> it's him and b his age is written into the script not only in the narrative but also as a recurring joke pretty much as you'd expect but well handled 7 10
<START> i was very excited when <UNK> state first came on a e i thought that it may bring some more interesting ghostly evidence the production value looked good and i really love the <UNK> then after about few episodes in i started to feel that this show may not be looking for evidence but had a strong religious agenda br br it seems like every case they investigate has some big powerful evil demon that can't even make a <UNK> move on camera yet everyone is terrified then comes some power of christ ritual that saves everyone br br also there is very little focus on other members of the team the entire show focuses on ryan and he feels like one of those people that hands you <UNK> about his church on the street br br has <UNK> phenomenon and demons become the new <UNK> of christianity <UNK> people to <UNK> really this should be on a christian network i was very disappointed
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen its been a few years since i saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this it tries to make fun of a variety of different movies for example and instead of funny its just pathetic whatever you do don't rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you turn around and run the other way
<START> nurse betty is really an interesting movie i guess we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real that you can't explain them with any means that these are just actors and not real persons br br <UNK> <UNK> isn't a nurse at all in real life she is an ordinary housewife who works at a diner to escape from her awful husband and the problems in her miserable life she has become a very dedicated fan of a soap opera after she witnessed her husband being murdered she goes into some kind of a shock and she loses all grip on reality she thinks she's in love with one of the characters from the soap opera a doctor and decides that she'll visit him and start a family with him the hit men however think that she knows too much and go after her to kill her br br as i already said the subject is quite recognizable if you leave the professional hit men and the murder out of it and the movie was funny the story was well directed and the actors did a fine job it had everything i always want to see when watching a comedy i give it a 7 5 10
<START> this is a typically fast moving entertaining movie of the early 1930s when you have james cagney in the lead these pre code films are even better just fun stuff to watch usually when films are dated it's a negative but not so with films from 1930 1934 yeah with the <UNK> and the attitudes dress <UNK> etc they are dated but that's a big part of the fun these films have an edge to them that almost always are fun to view br br they also have a <UNK> which is appealing and fascinating you see people like the juvenile <UNK> <UNK> in this film and their goofy parents that you just don't see in any period but this one early <UNK> early on this movie the kids go before the judge and you sit and just laugh at these crazy characters that appear in court on behalf of their kids one after the other yes we get the stereotypical emotional italian father the jewish dad the <UNK> <UNK> mom and a few other <UNK> who all in dramatic form <UNK> theirs is a good boy even though things are predictable in some cases you don't mind because everyone in here is so much fun to watch br br this also teaches you that kids were <UNK> 75 years ago too stealing robbing <UNK> lying hey that's the human condition this movie <UNK> the theory that people were <UNK> back in the old days no people have always been rotten or good the degree was aided by their environment parents financial situation and other things here we get a bunch of dead end kids who wind up in <UNK> school br br the ridiculous and <UNK> liberal storyline has kids acting immediately like angels once they run the show at the <UNK> school not <UNK> in the slightest for causing a man to fall to his death and setting the institution on fire the explanation he was a <UNK> and deserved it so much for real justice and <UNK> and <UNK> shooting a guy bit never having to even be <UNK> by police because he's the good guy notice the subtle anti religious dig in which the only guy seen praying is the evil warden that's no coincidence no accident that sort of negative association things has been going on ever since the <UNK> code was <UNK> in the late '60s and was seen as you see hear in the pre code early <UNK> br br dudley <UNK> by the way is outstanding in his bad guy role of mr <UNK> i especially his voice was very effective and could picture him playing one of those similarly evil roles as an institution boss in a charles dickens film adaptation cagney played his normal role the take no <UNK> tough guy who gets the pretty girl dorothy griffith played by <UNK> blake frankie <UNK> also was effective as the leader of the boys jimmy smith just the looks on face alone made his character believable some thing he was the real star of the film but i'll still go with cagney the rest of the <UNK> school kids weren't too believable and they were really ethnic stereotypes but they were all fun to watch br br i thought the most interesting part of the film was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these kids were and witnessed the good and bad and stereotypical parents in the court after the kids were arrested those scenes are pure 1930s dead end kids stuff they always showed the kids to be bad news at the beginning of the film but by the time the story was over they all looked acting more like <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> hardly rough <UNK> it's very far fetched but it works entertainment wise br br overall a hokey but very entertaining movie typical of cagney films and those of the early <UNK> almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their entertainment value
<START> five characters in search of an exit clearly has to be one of the more clever and better twilight zone episodes ever made because of it's abstract ideas and thoughtful plan where the characters have to search to discover identity and it ends as a surprise you have a military major a female dancer bag <UNK> player a clown and <UNK> who all awake together in the bottom of a wall and none know how they got there and they don't know who they are so the episode starts out with very interesting drama and suspense from the very beginning making it so soul searching for the viewers interest to want to know the characters true identity and backgrounds plus the episode even adds more intrigue for the fact it places different types of characters with different views and <UNK> all with one goal in common to escape and find identity and peace that's very compelling for the viewer only in the end i don't want to spoil for those who haven't seen a surprise fall happens proving that many times you might want to stay where you are away in your little <UNK> world and be away from the masses of other people's world as you will see the characters are loved in a different way by people in a much different form really great and cleverly done a real shock twist surprise that makes the viewer see the unexpected and cruel fate that happens sometimes when you search and seek
<START> was excited at the opening to hear part of de but wanted more so i bought said hans <UNK> piece possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written this movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w o the religious <UNK> you get to tour the <UNK> and parts of rome with excellent cinematography the opening at where the god <UNK> or largest <UNK> of <UNK> is created with stunning visuals is an immediate clue which <UNK> the excellence of this movie who doesn't love hanks the storyline and twists in this film are just superb and well drawn out until the amazingly twisted climax this film suggests a satisfying compromise between science and religion though plenty of closed heads will <UNK> on both sides science without religion is lame religion without science is blind a einstein
<START> said the continuity <UNK> as <UNK> assault was about to be broadcast after seeing the first two minutes i started thinking <UNK> might want to get a new agent after seeing the next ten minutes i started thinking <UNK> might want to <UNK> thereby saving a potential audience from any more of his performances br br <UNK> this is a truly terrible movie i wasn't expecting much and why should i if the name <UNK> appeared in the credits but within seconds of the opening title credits that featured <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> bombing <UNK> i realised i was going to be force fed <UNK> turkey three months after christmas br br the attention to detail is non existent <UNK> planes carry <UNK> <UNK> then were told character spent six years in an <UNK> prison which would make the setting 1997 what <UNK> were bombing the <UNK> in 1997 i guess the producers didn't think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous <UNK> but i know i did the producers also probably hoped the audience wouldn't notice the lack of continuity such as <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> that suddenly turned from <UNK> to f 4 <UNK> then back again but i did even stranger characters would take off in f <UNK> then when they arrive back at base there jet has changed into a soviet built br br oh and if you're expecting a dumb action movie you're only half right because it's dumb but most of the plot <UNK> around a basic instinct revenge plot i'll give the producers some credit maybe credit is too strong a word because after seeing plots featuring from hell policemen from hell flat mates from hell we now have a fighter pilot from hell which means every single <UNK> of the 20th century has featured in a from hell type plot with perhaps being the worst movie of the lot
<START> for those viewers who thought the 1979 film alien the first to depict a male <UNK> being <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> night of the blood beast made 21 years earlier may come as something of a surprise in this film america's first man in space back on earth and after examination is thought to be dead he later comes to again only with a half dozen or so alien growing in his <UNK> the mama alien also pops up to <UNK> the small band of scientists who are <UNK> our hero and she seems to have the body of a bear and the head of the rock creature from a 1969 star trek episode anyway with its short <UNK> minute running time small group of scientists and cheap looking monster this film suggests nothing less than a grade z warm up for the outer limits which would premiere four years later but without the fine writing that that show usually <UNK> despite the lurid title this film is decidedly sci fi not horror and offers no scares no <UNK> little suspense and little food for thought afterwards it looks as if it cost around 100 to make but probably cost twice as much and its musical score often seems to have no relation to the happenings i won't use the word action on screen by the film's end many questions remain just how was our hero to give birth to these <UNK> why does the alien need to <UNK> people to learn our language to justify that title no doubt why can't the space traveling aliens land on our planet rather than needing to <UNK> rides on our ships how was our hero <UNK> to begin with these are all matters that this little <UNK> can't be bothered with it really is for 1950s sci fi <UNK> only
<START> as a native of the city where the story takes place buffalo ny it's fun to see the local sites but the story line is so local and fun too br br the small scale promoting of this film requires strong word of mouth to accomplish the wide viewing it deserves please make this film the success the big fat greek wedding was
<START> this is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class as well as the teacher to sleep br br utterly boring long silent yes silent strings of unrelated video clips br br instead of this movie watch the paint dry or the grass grow it will be more interesting unless you enjoy seeing <UNK> being <UNK> to everyone around them br br the director should be embarrassed of this lame waste of film br br it deserves a one for the movie quality a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script or lack thereof
<START> i saw part of this film on the sci fi channel but missed the ending i bought the dvd to see the whole movie and i'm glad i did br br a young mother and her two daughters move into a house out in a backwoods area that they inherited from the husband who died from an illness it's very run down but the three women make the best of it the teen daughter <UNK> taylor <UNK> is warned by a local boy about the zombies that come out at night she ignores him but since he has a cute friend she joins his group meanwhile the younger daughter chloe grace makes a friend in a zombie girl her age named mary it turns out that mary and several other kids died in a mine in <UNK> while working as child labor now that they are zombies they attack and kill anyone who's not a blood relative br br this movie was directed by j s <UNK> whose previous films include the <UNK> 1981 and 1990 two movies i didn't like in the slightest bit this is why i was surprised that i actually enjoyed this movie the film is deliberately paced which i liked this allows you to get to know the main characters most of whom are likable child zombies have been used at least since george romero's 1968 classic night of the living dead still i found the tool using child zombies in this movie interesting it would seem that <UNK> finally found the right script and cast only the stereotypical scenes of the teens smoking drinking and making out in a <UNK> car were boring to me br br taylor <UNK> also appears in the halloween remake appeared in the <UNK> horror 2005 and the horror film room 6 2006
<START> i've never seen the original movie others have commented on so my perspective is just about this movie without comparison br br i found the message of the movie to be if you only worry about yourself all will be right with the world everything will fall into place your lovers will love you more your friends will respect and like you more your <UNK> will want you more pay you more and even your own children and parents will love you more br br i find this message to be <UNK> and totally false br br kudos for the very funny <UNK> scene at the end there isn't a mother out there who won't laugh during that scene br br overall a very disappointing movie plot i didn't find myself rooting for anyone in this movie i thought they were all pathetic self absorbed individuals that i just didn't care what happened to them and that's not a movie people want to see
<START> blind images are great the action draws you in completely even though the movie is a bit long by the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high points the lead actors have the most incredible screen presence the story is heart wrenching the film score is nicely understated completely moving in its own powerful way not your standard melodramatic <UNK> <UNK> like moments add poetic <UNK> to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions hope you get a chance to see this film it <UNK> into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light
<START> the movie gets a score of 3 because it <UNK> to be so very different it features a cast acting while you can hear their thoughts and desires this is truly a weird film and an experience i won't forget the only problem is that the experiment though in some ways interesting is generally quite dull and <UNK> in fact it's amazing that a norma <UNK> and clark gable film could be this dull the film is based on a eugene o'neill play and it really does seem quite <UNK> in fact it would have been best just to keep it as a stage production it just didn't translate at all to the big screen br br so this movie is only recommended to die hard and those who love gable films so much they just have to see all his films
<START> the tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better than average production values but very surface and slightly altered biography <UNK> <UNK> discovery of we've only just begun and <UNK> marriage troubles admirably the superstar montage was a nice touch yet notably leaves out the <UNK> with neil the contribution of tony guitar <UNK> etc is sweet in her karen persona but it doesn't include the <UNK> and sides of the real carpenter's personality anderson is in fine form as the creative and take charge richard and <UNK> makes her mark as the loving but overbearing <UNK> the most haunting moment of the original broadcast is the use of goodbye to love in the background of a commercial displaying an <UNK> <UNK>
<START> if you're looking for a movie that's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not so great acting cheesy special effects and typical sci fi plot then this is the movie for you not at the acting was bad in fact a few actors were actually fairly decent the special effects weren't the greatest to say the least the animals looked completely computer animated there was an annoying <UNK> to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played over and over again throughout the entire movie overall a good movie if you're looking for something completely cheesy and fun to make fun of not a good movie to watch if you're looking for something serious
<START> there is nothing mean spirited or evil about this movie it's just terribly dull dull is the photography the film stock appears old and faded and washed out maybe it was even <UNK> blown up to <UNK> <UNK> dull is the script which is tedious and ish that is kind of 1960s <UNK> cocktail party cool like our <UNK> grandparents might have spoken if they were trying to appear really straight the of <UNK> characters were mostly annoying true they were real to life but hey if i wanted to see truly ordinary people doing really mundane and ordinary things i'd just watch myself i wouldn't all the way down to a cinema and blow five <UNK> and an evening watching someone else do it br br i expected a funny bright <UNK> com what i got was more like what two intelligent and moderately talented 19 or 20 year olds might have produced on their first day with a new video camera br br i gave this a 4 out 10 because it appears that someone tried at least
<START> this show is brilliantly hilarious i started watching in 2007 and had never heard of it before then after one episode i was hooked i'm never home to watch it so my wife bought me the entire series on dvd non stop laughs need i say more i wish it was still on tv because it is definitely worthy and a whole lot better of crap on currently on tv br br i wish they would make a movie seriously who wouldn't go see it kevin <UNK> name alone will bring a huge <UNK> to any movie the guy is make your stomach hurt funny br br just a really good down to earth believable show if you have the chance to buy it on dvd do it its worth it
<START> i wanted to see this movie because i am a very huge <UNK> and <UNK> fan and when i saw it i liked it br br this movie is funny not hysterical but funny i mean i laughed at a lot of the funny parts and i just plain enjoyed it br br though it is not of the best of the perfect straight man and the perfect <UNK> you should see this if you really love <UNK> and <UNK> br br out of all of the <UNK> and <UNK> movies that i have seen i can't say i've seen one that i hated this is decent funny and entertaining <UNK> and <UNK> at least made some pretty decent movies in their later years br br all in all i liked this movie it is not one of their best ones but i liked it br br 7 10
<START> this movie would receive a much higher vote from me in general and i will talk about why but first and foremost it receives four stars and should stay at four stars because of the directors ridiculously tasteless portrayal of rape and sexual assault not far into the movie <UNK> sexually <UNK> a woman he rescued earlier and while she briefly becomes somewhat <UNK> by his actions this attitude only lasts about five minutes before loving <UNK> sets in and carries her character through the rest of the film i know many will argue that it's not that important in a kung fu beat em up and as a fan of the <UNK> i can't say that it's all that unusual but that doesn't stop it from being completely tasteless every time i see it br br what i will say in this movie's <UNK> however is that it's somewhat refreshing to see a martial arts or even action movie of any sort that offers no actual hero for the viewer to get behind <UNK> is portrayed as a rapist and murderer a societal <UNK> whose only student becomes completely mentally <UNK> before being <UNK> down by the police the final shots of the movie leave one with the feeling that <UNK> himself is <UNK> for a major breakdown and no longer seems to care for the woman he earlier <UNK> into loving him and has since followed him with puppy dog like devotion br br whether this was truly the intended message of the movie or not one can't help but feel a little hopeful that <UNK> might be on the brink of suicide by the time the movie is over this is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and its interesting to see a film that leaves you with a sense that its violence is not to be celebrated if only karate <UNK> had treated the subject of sexual violence better either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved or by leaving it out all together this would have been a much more interesting film
<START> this movie was <UNK> awful i wanted those hours of my life back for god's sake stay far away from this awful ball movie at all costs its not worth mentioning the title but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit <UNK> movie like this and where do i begin the dumb a kids in the movie the zero plot or story the garden variety college frat boy esquire scenes of <UNK> <UNK> or the very bad acted teen angst innuendo my god it never ended i remember thinking i would have rather <UNK> the movie theater floor then sit through this one again br br but what do you expect most people with the brain power to look up reviews are not going to be the target audience here at all so go see 2 again or the jet lee one if your <UNK> to yourself look this movie will just cost you your soul your money your energy and your brain cells <UNK> the warning
<START> i viewed this movie for the first time last night and i enjoyed every aspect of it dancing the acting the dialogue the plot the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created i would highly recommend it br br jennifer grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as frances baby <UNK> she has a natural ability and flair for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor but what is wonderful about baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character this is not simply a movie about dancing but the <UNK> have also given us a chance to see baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life grey portrays her character with such realism and <UNK> that you end up feeling deeply for baby as she experiences all she does in this movie br br patrick <UNK> is magnificent in his role as johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive he gives his character a <UNK> personality strong appeal and great depth the chemistry between <UNK> and grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie br br <UNK> <UNK> is great in her role of penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film the other members of the supporting cast <UNK> and the late mark <UNK> deserve a special mention here also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience the dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved br br the script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and <UNK> the viewer in a powerful fashion the plot although exceedingly predictable is given more than enough life and <UNK> to make this movie successful br br furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes br br dirty <UNK> is a truly powerful magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance i highly recommend it
<START> hollywood movie industry is the <UNK> one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to <UNK> theaters with the same old crap re invented over and over again take <UNK> for example for each x man and <UNK> there are <UNK> <UNK> ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitch perfect mostly because of mr gore to bring a ton of look alike creepy woman based horrors e g the ring 2 the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the <UNK> br br the first grudge wasn't entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing <UNK> grudge 2 is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to <UNK> the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge 2 the critic goes the same way br br tired scares bad acting except for <UNK> <UNK> and clichés all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is <UNK> <UNK> investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle <UNK> to death allison <UNK> <UNK> who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dull br br the chills are all over there a girl alone in the <UNK> someone who shouldn't enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more <UNK> than ten world wars or the <UNK> <UNK> hey doesn't that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day it's getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood
<START> as a long time fan of studio <UNK> and especially <UNK> miyazaki films i went to the film right on the opening day when i went out of the theater i had this strange feeling that something was missing this magical feeling i was experiencing in all miyazaki films before but i couldn't say why it failed this time after i thought about the other <UNK> movies i may know the reason this film had most of the elements of a great miyazaki anime cute characters wonderful key animation a great soundtrack composed by joe <UNK> and the warm story telling giving you the feeling of watching a high quality japanese animation film however two elements were lacking a deep story and <UNK> the purpose of this film was obviously to entertain small children with a simple story line as in case of <UNK> so a complicated story as been told in spirited away or princess <UNK> is not really necessary but on the other hand this story was simply too superficial i could not connect to the main characters because there was no character development dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long i really hate to give only 7 stars for a miyazaki film because i would give 10 stars to all previous movies right away but this time it was simply not this wonderful <UNK> experience
<START> i have never seen a movie that annoyed me that much it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things this is not a funny movie i must say that the plot line is awful i did not had patience to watch it so that i only saw half of it but it was enough for me the characters are not very inspired just terribly annoying this movie is all about a goofy guy trying to hook up with his <UNK> <UNK> daughter when he finally manages to talk to her she asks him to go at that night at her home to watch her father's owl and he thinks she had invited him to go with her at a party and to be at her home at 6 <UNK> he gets to be very disappointed finding out that he only has to take care of the owl and that she has a boyfriend after her father leaves home leaving precise orders about taking care of the house and his beloved bird appears a secretary a son and all sort of not funny stuff happens in the house but he finally <UNK> up with his <UNK> daughter trust me this movie is terrible
<START> first off let me say i wasted halloween movie night by watching this garbage second let me inform you that the current dvd available by <UNK> show is not uncut so you gore <UNK> will be very upset third that one scene is the highlight of the film and since it's been cut well you see where i'm going br br i know a lot of horror fans dig this movie it is atmospheric shot in the woods with some very nice scenery <UNK> and such but after the opening kill which has a very brutal shot of a <UNK> being <UNK> through a <UNK> <UNK> you get no real brutal kills after that and with a slasher movie you sort of want that at least i do the director and co do nothing new with the killer in the woods idea several of this type of movie were all made right around the same time in the very early eighties the only thing this has going for it is that you don't hate the actors as much as you might in other films they are sort of likable the kids have a reason for being there one of them owns a deed to some property on the mountain but what is not explained is why his family has property there there is no cabin or house so why buy property in east jesus especially if you aren't a hunter or <UNK> well i'm sure some people do buy land for camping purposes but that just seems unusual anyway two <UNK> backwoods <UNK> show up and start stalking the <UNK> and picking them off one by one and as i said before you get pretty much nothing in the way of decent deaths after the <UNK> kill in the beginning the ending has a sort of off the wall kill by connie but even that isn't enough to save this from being almost equal with the completely forgettable film the forest which is mind numbing br br if <UNK> show had been able to get a real uncut print then this review might have been a little more <UNK> but this is the day and age of uncut <UNK> dvd releases of old obscure films for <UNK> <UNK> like me when you slight us you get the <UNK> review sadly the presence of the great <UNK> george kennedy is the only highlight of this movie to set it apart from the other garden variety trash that was <UNK> out back in the day
<START> wow fantastic film in my opinion i wasn't expecting it to be this good i was captivated from start to finish it's a very well made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials <UNK> had to go through in order to convey his ideas to the world <UNK> his life as he writes origin of the species fighting both personal demons as well as the ignorant society of the time in order to do so he struggles hard with his mind body and soul as personal matters get to breaking point and even his family seems to slip away whilst the rest of the world stand against him as he knows that his <UNK> literally shake the very <UNK> of their lives culture and meaning of existence it's a subtle movie not over exaggerated in any way in that typical hollywood way this is a bbc produced british film yet thankfully very powerful in meaning and this is thanks to the amazing well directed scenes as well as the superb acting by <UNK> <UNK> acts as more of a light supporting role but i did enjoy her in this and she's as good as to be expected as always her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and endearing you could feel the connection and their real life husband wife bond definitely shines through their performances but the star of the show is definitely <UNK> and he does a brilliant job a very touching performance i both understood and <UNK> with him as he <UNK> his own <UNK> health and impending insanity to try to understand what he has <UNK> and come to terms with what it all really is and means as he found his thinking <UNK> his feelings and found himself losing it all including his wife who of course was a firm believer in religion and a strict christian whilst he was in the realm of science two worlds which could not see eye to eye so their relationship was at stake too br br anyway a really very good well acted emotional drama and dare i say i did shed a tear during the tragic climax which was truly heartbreaking as well as beautifully poignant and moving the film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic as well in fact i can't wait to watch it again as there was a lot to take in first time round which i missed easily one of the best films i've seen this year
<START> there's nothing wrong with <UNK> but this one is pretty <UNK> lots of nudity but it's all fake of course it's always fake it's a movie but you know what i mean there's no sexuality or <UNK> it's all random nudity and poor acting of lust and sex with each other br br part of it is of course your personal <UNK> these women clearly have some body issues with their <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> not to mention that overly <UNK> look so if that's your thing great you get to see all that here br br i don't think anyone's expectations are very high when looking at a movie title such as this but for many people it would be pretty much like looking at cyborg they almost seem real but it's really more creepy
<START> i am <UNK> at the major comments here for this ok surf film it really <UNK> from the california <UNK> school of <UNK> to beach antics and isn't really plausible the idea that the lead kid learn to ride a board so well in a <UNK> wave pool that he beats the real surfers at their game in the real ocean is just plain silly in australia where most urban teens do surf this film was laughed at audiences took it all with a grain of sea salt made in the 80s but with its heart in the 60s it is fun to watch and looks and sounds good but it is not a in a classic class at all even the actors didn't this we're seriously in <UNK> bridge or ride the wild surf or beach <UNK> <UNK> land here oz stars like and big <UNK> hero <UNK> lopez are <UNK> in to add head <UNK> recognition to our farm boy's wave <UNK> but it only made the crowd in the cinema <UNK> it is for 10 years olds who do not question much it's not even in gods hands and that was silly too
<START> spoiler alert i worked as an extra on this lifetime tv movie filmed in seattle it's really interesting when you take part in the production of a movie because usually they are still in the process of either still writing parts as was the case here or making editing cuts and major changes from the final parts br br my husband and i both worked as extras in this movie and i recall them discussing on the set how it was yet to be determined whether or not the little girl dies in the end frankly i never thought margaret <UNK> character really got adequate punishment for her crime of hit and run lying to police covering up etc could you imagine how the ending would have had to change if she had ended up killing the hit and run victim instead of her ending up coming out of her coma okay just something to think about br br by the way i play a police detective you can see for a split second and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often we've counted four times margaret colin was great to work with and very down to earth although lisa <UNK> now a lifetime regular was <UNK> br br overall the movie turned out to be about a 7 10 but like another poster commented is still a real tear <UNK> and makes a great saturday afternoon cable flick
<START> i really love anything done by savage steve holland the writer director of this great movie also see better off dead and how i got into college wonderful anyway this movie is really humorous and delivers some unexpected things where else but in this movie can you see <UNK> moore as a talented singer and <UNK> as a twin i recommend this to anybody looking for some old fashioned slapstick comedy george with the turtle raft not to mention some really well written sarcasm the christmas tree on the roof of the car this movie constantly throws you unexpected things even after you've seen it 100 times like i have enjoy
<START> this has to one of the most pathetic predictable and badly acted films i have ever seen clint eastwood has never been worse never have i seen somebody less convincing on screen i was laughing at him the whole way through then there's this romance kinda thing between him and the gorgeous <UNK> russo which was even more pathetic than the one between mr connery and ms zeta jones in <UNK> br br one imdb user <UNK> the question what's not to like about this film i'm asking what is to like about it and the answer is john <UNK> he is an absolute genius and probably the best movie villain ever he even saved con air you know but that's it br br this movie is called in the line of fire but 2 the rip <UNK> seems to be a more appropriate title watch only if you are a die hard john <UNK> fan otherwise avoid at all cost 1 2 out of five
<START> i absolutely loved this movie as a child i can't seem to find it anywhere i was mentioning it to some friends just the other day and not a single one of them remembers it can anyone help me out my older sister vaguely remembers it there was also another movie i remember that was half live action and half animation but i can't remember the name of it the characters were animated and the background was real i seem to remember it being about a <UNK> and i believe the setting of the film was in australia i'm going out of my mind trying to obtain copies of these films that were such a memorable part of my very enjoyable childhood edit i searched imdb for this other movie and found out it's called <UNK> and the <UNK> all i had to do was type in <UNK> in the search bar under characters and the name of the movie in the list was like a bell going off man i love imdb thanks
<START> one of the major <UNK> to the decline of western civilization filmmaker penelope indie breakthrough is that it can perhaps appeal to non punk fans as to the hardcore ones more importantly it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely market worthy when bands would play or at the least try to play in some cases in <UNK> dirty <UNK> to an audience that had as much self respect as they had respect for the bands for the fan such as myself there are precious interviews with some of the quasi legends of <UNK> punk <UNK> some dead some still living and still hard working in the scene br br performances and interviews include the likes of the circle <UNK> x black flag in the pre henry <UNK> days catholic discipline fear the alice bag band and most memorable in my opinion being the <UNK> while i knew of a few of the bands and performers in the film the <UNK> and black flag mostly i had only heard rumors about lead singer the late <UNK> crash and from the footage in the film he seems to be one of the if not the of the punk movement he doesn't take himself too seriously he loves to drink sometimes when he speaks it's complete <UNK> and the attitude he brings on stage is both funny and in a free form way <UNK> a performer like that would probably scare steve miller and jackson <UNK> out of their <UNK> br br decline of western civilization may not turn on every non punk fan that seeks this film out it's hard to find on video but it shouldn't necessarily turn them off either like a kind of <UNK> that's <UNK> into the party gets the behavior of these people down pat their motives their likes and <UNK> and the power that was their on and off screen <UNK> a few of them almost come off as normal some don't but they're only offensive to those who aren't too open to things on top of that the film is a must see to the kinds of kids that think they're punk fans just because they listen to good charlotte and blink if you want to get the real scoop on the movement and genre of rock you <UNK> to love give the <UNK> a chance a
<START> i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success at least he'd have wound up with something br br the film struck me as pointless rambling and very stylish like some other recent french films not to knock it most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever we should be grateful i suppose for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a wind blown <UNK> winter and for <UNK> conversations that challenge our ability to understand what's up br br but there can be too much of a good thing <UNK> is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the <UNK> night carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood you'll love it if you're <UNK> the <UNK> lots of people die catherine <UNK> dies in a suicide by motorcycle i don't know why young girl dies too and i don't know why she dies either she gets slapped in the face falls to the <UNK> and dies br br there is supposedly an explicit sex scene too i'll have to take their word for it because although it is <UNK> photographed it is <UNK> photographed in almost complete darkness don't worry about the <UNK> being shocked they'll probably be asleep by this time anyway br br depardieu isn't a bad actor as we see him <UNK> from a carefully <UNK> handsome young man well handsome except that his nose can't seem to get out of his way to a <UNK> murderous hairy physical wreck we feel sorry for the guy <UNK> has a wan pretty face with enormous half eyes and wide <UNK> like a doll her next movie should be a remake of <UNK> i walked with a zombie then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band i guess it's a band as far as i could make out the band is made up of about a dozen <UNK> and a dozen musicians playing electric <UNK> every viewer will find the <UNK> sound interesting but <UNK> fond of easy listening might not enjoy it if you don't like the music there's a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with <UNK> walking stick br br i must say i found it barely worth sitting through and it's a too at times it was like waiting in your car at a <UNK> crossing while a long long <UNK> train <UNK> slowly by sometimes stopping entirely i wish it had had a few jokes
<START> you want to know what the writers of this movie consider funny a robot child sees his robot parents killed <UNK> as i recall and then moves between their bodies calling their names yeah what a comic moment this is the worst movie i ever paid to see
<START> i was at the <UNK> of the movie last night in rome i am not an expert in the book however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie the pacing of this movie is much faster than the <UNK> code many things were <UNK> otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace i think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for hanks brown and company br br there are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form i am not giving any spoilers except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way how <UNK> was found is also different those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story some minor details are are also cut from the movie br br although they did film in rome they had to recreate interior shots since i went on a walking tour of rome the day before the movie i can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel <UNK> is not in the movie and not much is shown about hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the <UNK> <UNK> of course they had no access to that area and i am not sure if anyone actually knows what the <UNK> <UNK> look like has her break in this movie as victoria and does a good job as eye candy for hanks br br this movie should be received better by the critics and public but you never know ron howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie that this is just a movie
<START> yes i had the misfortune of watching this film when i was younger at a friends house as his mother was a teacher and she wanted to screen the movie and see if there were any inappropriate scenes that a parent might object to well other than the unfunny jokes i think this one was in the clear well the unfunny jokes and the strange scene where the look a like ernest hits on a girl so yes ernest gets thrown in jail thanks to a look a like and proceeds to try to escape and there is other stuff to it like him becoming at one point shooting electricity and in a very painful to watch finale flying there are a couple of jokes but nothing to much to mention except for the gun <UNK> from soap i think that is the only scene me or my friend's mother laughed out loud at this and camp are the only two ernest movies i have ever seen and from what i have seen in them i am not going to track down the other films ernest was good in small doses but a movie is just to much even when it is as short as this one i figure though the films made money mainly because all you need is <UNK> and a location and a theme and you have your movie
<START> my partner and i sat down to watch this film over a bottle of wine last saturday and although we initially had our <UNK> once the story got going it was in actual fact rather gripping the scene in which one of the characters in brutally murdered by <UNK> <UNK> was particularly shocking and <UNK> the work of korean new wave auteur park chan <UNK> the weapon of choice was a particular <UNK> and allowed us to see into the psyche of heavily <UNK> the <UNK> of a loving warm grandmother into a murderous <UNK> the dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical in expressing the <UNK> paranoia the protagonist <UNK> of <UNK> en scene furthermore enhance the unnerving and atmosphere of the nights events combining with the oscar worthy performances to create a chilling and thought provoking masterpiece the ending which i won't spoil for you here reminded my partner and myself of m night <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the sixth sense for it's mind <UNK> twist that has left me thinking weeks after viewing definitely one to watch repeatedly
<START> i can't remember when was the last time i have been so terribly disappointed by any movie probably i expected too much happening in a way you can expect action in dogma style movies of course but there is just nothing going on in here luckily i was watching it at home and could switch channels whenever the silence and dumb <UNK> faces started to kill me and that was very often it really isn't too much of a pleasure watching ugly people who don't talk and move slowly stroke pigs and french kiss men not to mention ugly bodies having explicit sex if only it made any sense the whole murder situation is ridiculous seems like it was only created to show one more <UNK> since zero characters are capable of actually solving the crime having only four pseudo developed characters and a movie going nowhere it is pretty soon obvious whom the director picked as a killer and that makes no <UNK> either despite all the boredom and suffering i must admit that it somehow touched me in an <UNK> way maybe you should check it out yourself though i don't recommend it
<START> it was definitely worth viewing i don't regret that but also it was kind of ordinary something that i would expect from a movie titled like that love story was nice to watch humour was involved but nothing surprised or <UNK> me shooting tough guys etc ain't worth it any more
<START> i found this movie to be educational entertaining and very moving i was impressed when i learned of just how much justice had contributed in during her time in <UNK> br br wendy <UNK> is highly under rated and it is good to see her again in a canadian production other easily recognizable stars are leslie hope 24 and john corbett sex in the city br br while the story line of this movie may not be completely factual it did leave me with the desire to learn more about the word of a great movie for inspiring young women br br i say the movie is a must see
<START> <UNK> cross dressing little boy finds success on the spelling <UNK> circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing shirley <UNK> directed and stars as the child's grandmother and it is always fascinating to see long time actors getting their chance at directing a film the material that they're drawn to and the actors they choose to work with here the only person well cast in bruno is <UNK> the child actors seem to have been picked for their <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> hearted <UNK> holds their close ups for excruciatingly long periods nothing about these <UNK> seems natural not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even each other as the boy's disgruntled father poor gary <UNK> <UNK> around the edges in mock shame always with a <UNK> look on his face towards the end of the film <UNK> turns the whole thing into a of <UNK> scenes and even concludes with the kid <UNK> the <UNK> in rome another <UNK> <UNK> from a talented actress turned director who much like sally field and her film beautiful cannot seem to stop <UNK> at and <UNK> the audience shirley uses <UNK> for <UNK> and childhood innocence as a punchline the children in this cast roll their eyes crack wise with mature comments use big words but when one <UNK> mouthed boy calls our <UNK> sized hero gay <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> him to go over and punch the kid out in front the media <UNK> that for progression from
<START> flipping through the channels i was lucky enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie i must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately i love older films and this is or should be considered a classic one of the most wonderful <UNK> of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl i highly recommend this movie
<START> in 1932 <UNK> bogart was a relative unknown an <UNK> actor who was starring in one of his first films and because he was an unknown the movie they gave him was clearly a b movie a quick film with relatively low expectations after seeing it i could see why it would still take bogart many more years and another film studio before he became a household name while the film isn't terrible it certainly isn't good making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today br br bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company however when a vacuous rich <UNK> comes his way his dreams all seem to go on hold as one of the characters in the film said the combination of the two is like oil and water they just don't mix br br while bogart is throwing away his promising career his sister is going full speed on the road to having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash <UNK> has no idea his sister isn't the actress she claims to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is <UNK> sister all this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable however what follows is one of the dumbest scenes i have watched in a very long time by now the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with <UNK> sister <UNK> but because she's now poor and no good for bogart she's about to fly away and kill herself <UNK> finds out chases the plane on foot jumps on the plane as it's taking off and <UNK> up the <UNK> to take control of the plane and save her this is so utterly silly and ridiculous i found myself laughing out loud up until then i might have scored it a 4 or 5 this sunk the movie to a 3 how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me br br the bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film on top of that it's all wrong for bogart as the action hero at the end and the <UNK> lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s <UNK> and solid better suits the man one of america's great actors but clearly out of his element here br br by the way those who love pre code films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one practically everyone in the film believes in and practices pre marital sex and <UNK> <UNK> in the film things you never would have seen after the <UNK> and more <UNK> production code was adopted in 1934
<START> having read the books and seen the 1982 anthony andrews jane br br seymour version i have to say that this is not good at all br br according to the books <UNK> is supposed to be a seemingly br br <UNK> aristocrat when he's being <UNK> and witty and clever br br when he's being the <UNK> but here he just looks bored as br br <UNK> and mean as the <UNK> <UNK> is supposed to be br br the most beautiful woman in europe not a tired and <UNK> looking <UNK> she looks middle aged probably due to br br bad make up richard e grant has done much better things and br br elizabeth <UNK> acting is uninspired and flat the wit and br br dash of the books and the andrews seymour film is here replaced br br by <UNK> and flashy editing that just don't make the cut br br i might add that to a person who hasn't seen any previous version br br or read the book it would probably look ok
<START> i absolutely <UNK> this movie as a child and still do as an adult to say that is even an understatement my sister brother and i watched it one year at our <UNK> house during christmas vacation they had taped it from tv our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for <UNK> activities the next day not so we became <UNK> they could not have <UNK> us if they tried it became a <UNK> <UNK> tradition we loved everything about it the time the romance the battle scenes the villains etc br br come on who can resist hating that psycho bent with his constant sir classic moreover who can resist cheering wildly when justin falls off the balcony what a <UNK> moment i always had a special place in my heart for <UNK> and they were so romantic the theme song alone can get me to tear up a little this movie is incredibly moving and i challenge anyone to stick with it until the very end it's worth it
<START> my best guess is this piece of work will come out on dvd sometime before christmas br br this movie was terrible the time line jumps all over the place this wouldn't be so bad if it left some suspense for the end it was entirely predictable bitch girls pick on <UNK> <UNK> wants to know why they hate her so much bitch girls die a terrible death <UNK> girl goes home and looks crazy <UNK> girl brought evil spirits with her makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other creepy kid understands what's going on oh and the younger sister not being good enough for <UNK> sick mother sending younger daughter to bring the golden child home br br to be fair there were some great moments here and there first of all sarah michelle character dies in the first few minutes definite plus didn't see that one coming i didn't expect the wife to pour bacon grease on her husband's head either if the movie had kept up those kind of thrills i would have loved it the beginning showed so much promise br br i was disappointed because i enjoyed the first one it made me jump i didn't expect most of what happened and though i <UNK> some of the movie it was still a fun watch i didn't watch any previews for this the sequel because i wanted to be surprised i was but in the wrong direction
<START> funny thing charlie sheen donald sutherland sam <UNK> and stephen lang have all had incredible performances who can forget sheen as the <UNK> <UNK> in wall street or sutherland as the the cynical korean war surgeon in mash <UNK> and lang have both also had successful tv and film careers law and order killing fields de <UNK> <UNK> etc so what in the world would any of these fine actors be doing in a stink bomb like this br br shadow plot of a washington coup <UNK> is not really that bad unoriginal maybe but not that bad sure it's been done seven days in may a fine film but with a little <UNK> it could still have been entertaining br br shadow main problem is in the execution early in the film sheen political <UNK> extreme ridiculously and <UNK> <UNK> a potential public relations <UNK> by <UNK> a <UNK> later <UNK> with <UNK> mute <UNK> <UNK> up half of what is supposed to be <UNK> is explained on the news as gang wars has anyone remotely associated with this film ever lived a day in washington sheen is about 20 years too young way way too young to be so senior in a white house administration <UNK> response to <UNK> a political crisis is so <UNK> with false <UNK> he looks as though he attended the david <UNK> school of acting and when was the last time gang wars spread to <UNK> we're talking about a section of washington where citizens voted against having a <UNK> stop so that they could maintain their <UNK> br br i agree with another reviewer that this film would have been unbearable without the fast forward button i taped it off hbo a year ago and then took 3 separate viewings to <UNK> through it br br in summary don't buy this film don't even rent this film if you see it at blockbuster run away as fast as you can
<START> for all <UNK> and purposes <UNK> might seem like just another lightweight bollywood musical to some extent this might even be true especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses but somewhere behind the scenes either <UNK> who had the <UNK> for this story or who directed the film decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations br br this is not simply about a handsome man <UNK> with 3 women <UNK> on whom to choose as his life's partner <UNK> <UNK> character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times and they with him despite being aware of the other two <UNK> <UNK> relationship with <UNK> and is particularly interesting in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily there are quite a lot of suggestive <UNK> in the <UNK> body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewer's maturity the theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was <UNK> that the ending was tame obviously designed to please the masses and <UNK> criticism
<START> this movie changes its way a third of the way in its totally pointless boring and stupid i hated this movie so much that i will never watch it again some bad films can be really funny this is just a british art house picture that should never of been made 1 out of 10
<START> the stranger jack matthew <UNK> arrives in the studio of the crook collector of <UNK> max vincent <UNK> and tells his ambitious companion and <UNK> in <UNK> jamie <UNK> <UNK> that he is jack's brother jamie does not buy his story <UNK> jack and ties him up to a chair when max arrives jack <UNK> us 100 000 00 for each one to protect him in a <UNK> of the <UNK> spanish judges with a wealthy and dangerous collector max invites his stupid <UNK> piece mark <UNK> junior who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from mars to <UNK> the <UNK> team however jack double crosses the collector and then he <UNK> jack jamie and piece br br the low budget spanish judges is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast <UNK> <UNK> is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor vincent <UNK> they are not able to save the stupid story further the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work and actually they are silly and not funny my vote is three br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all for money
<START> dirty harry goes to <UNK> is what burt called this fantastic first rate detective thriller that borrows some of its plot from the <UNK> dana andrews movie laura not only does burt reynolds star in this superb saga but he also <UNK> it and he doesn't make a single mistake either staging the action or with his casting of characters not a bad performance in the movie and reynolds does an outstanding job of directing it henry <UNK> is truly icy as a hit man br br detective tom <UNK> burt reynolds is on a <UNK> case in underground <UNK> when everything goes wrong he winds up chasing a suspect and shooting it out with the <UNK> on a bus during the <UNK> an innocent <UNK> dies john <UNK> the killer <UNK> this scene anyway the <UNK> police department <UNK> burt down to vice and he takes orders from a new boss <UNK> charles <UNK> of oh brother where art <UNK> in the basement <UNK> winds up in a real <UNK> of crime <UNK> and his fellow detectives arch <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> brian keith set up <UNK> on a high <UNK> call girl rachel ward of after dark my sweet who has a <UNK> apartment that she shares with another girl br br is seeing a local politician earl <UNK> of police woman on the side who is <UNK> for <UNK> but the chief villain victor <UNK> <UNK> of the dirty game wants him to end the affair is reluctant to <UNK> victor so victor has cocaine <UNK> billy score henry <UNK> of <UNK> billy <UNK> a hole the size of a twelve inch pizza in the door of apartment and kills her br br <UNK> has done the <UNK> during the <UNK> he has grown fond of to the point that he becomes hopelessly <UNK> with her <UNK> mission in life now is to bust victor but he learns that victor has an <UNK> inside the <UNK> police department the plot really <UNK> up when <UNK> discovers later that billy shot the wrong girl and that is still alive <UNK> takes her into protective custody and things grow even more complicated he <UNK> his machine of the title to deal with victor and his <UNK> br br william widescreen <UNK> of the action is <UNK> unfortunately this vastly underrated classic is available only as a full frame film definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the picture especially during the <UNK> scene on the boat when the <UNK> cut off one of <UNK> fingers this is a rather gruesome scene br br burt never made a movie that <UNK> <UNK> machine
<START> it's not surprising that the majority of higher rated votes were <UNK> by females aged 45 this is the <UNK> in women's lives when they become the <UNK> of aged and ill parents i lost my mother from complications of cancer in june and went through most of the same emotions portrayed by <UNK> in this film yes it made me cry but the tears were real the characters were real and the plot development extremely accurate kudos to the entire cast and crew for a wonderful portrayal of life and death and the promises of tomorrow
<START> as a history of <UNK> this even close <UNK> dies to help the indians i am sure the other members of the <UNK> weren't <UNK> in that decision but as a western this is fun flynn looks and acts the part of the dashing <UNK> and the <UNK> owen is always nice to hear
<START> this show makes me and many others hate their lives let's face it <UNK> is perfect she's bland pretty gets good <UNK> everyone goes to her for advice she's popular she goes to an amazing school with amazing rooms reasons why i gave this show a 3 1 the acting is horrible sometimes i just want to hurt the people who put these <UNK> actresses especially victoria justice on television 2 the characters are unbelievable and <UNK> you have your typical popular girl a <UNK> shallow stupid stereotypical girl who is portrayed by a horrible actress then you have a typical jock guy who is somewhat normal and actually nice then the stereotyped smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of hers then a stuck up rich pretty boy that would be happier <UNK> into a mirror all day then the wanna be actress who is played by another <UNK> actress and last a normal nerd person guy 3 the plot is boring and lame 4 i hate how spoiled these characters are can't they just be normal 5 everything ends up perfect for them and we all are reminded of how much our lives stink
<START> the sequel that no one asked for to the movie no one wanted there are obviously too many flaws with this movie to name here so i'll just concentrate on the acting miles <UNK> would have been better suited to play the <UNK> asian sidekick <UNK> mainly because he would then have no dialogue lisa foster delivers her lines displaying one emotion <UNK> charles brings life to his part by <UNK> every five words and finally the flamboyant john <UNK> type guy no comment is needed br br see conan the barbarian if you need to but don't waste your time with this low budget loser

<START> all the boys seem to be sexually <UNK> by mandy lane all the girls seem to be jealous of mandy lane but nothing seems to become of it and this viewer wonders why mandy is beautiful and a <UNK> to every boy she meets but we never get to know mandy or any of the characters in the film mandy accepts an <UNK> from her student friends to go to a secluded ranch three boys and three girls drink and drug in the film the teenagers drink booze like its water and take drugs to experience a psychedelic trip and there is absolutely no sex in the meantime the teenagers disappear one by one but the others are all drunk and high nobody including those watching the film cares or is at all concerned nobody including the audience seems to give a damn a fellow student is the <UNK> of the entire event there is a security guard <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> played by <UNK> who guards and <UNK> the ranch <UNK> through the film the killer is revealed the tension is suddenly released like air let out of a balloon the events are completely predictable and the film just completely <UNK> out mandy meets her match but we don't ever know why and at the end of the film there is still no sex does mandy <UNK> the boys or does she simply bore all of the boys and girls to their deaths this absolutely confused viewer can only conclude that mandy wishes to get rid of the female and male competition by killing off the manipulative girls and the nasty boys br br is mandy worth all of the attention the director jonathan <UNK> seems to think so but this viewer does not the able cinematographer darren provides some stunning images but in fact his focus seems to be on <UNK> who is quite the stud not all of the boys love mandy or do they if you want to be bored enough to find out how this film winds up my advice is to sleep <UNK> through film until you see the <UNK> mandy and <UNK> <UNK> but don't wait for anything to happen yep you guessed it mandy remains a virgin and there's still no sex i rank this film a 3 out of 10 but not because of mandy why because all of the girls love <UNK> and all <UNK> eyes seem to be on <UNK> in a <UNK> position but unfortunately girls and boys this film never seems to get beyond a disappointing and <UNK> sexual fantasy mandy goes to a secluded ranch and nothing sexual ever happens the audience is led to horror on a ranch and cannot help but wonder why
<START> this is absolutely the most stupidest movie ever produced in front of a camera i cant believe i was enough to rent this piece of junk i have seen some bad movies in my time but this takes the cake ice cream and <UNK> too <UNK> i still cant get over how bad this thing was the acting was a joke the plot was non and the camera work had to be done by a 3 year old child i have never seen a movie take so long to go nowhere i mean the whole movie could have been shot is less than 30 minutes i guess this guy had some extra time on his hands like 3 hours and an extra 60 bucks in his <UNK> and decided one night hey lets go make the stupidest movie ever made and they did just that give me a break i'm heading back to the video store right now to get demand my money back anyone else who has watched this piece of trash should do the same
<START> as i'm listening to my parents watch this after i gave up 10 minutes into the film they have absolutely no idea what is going on when charles dickens <UNK> into the camera i half expected him to turn into a demon yes he looked like one unfortunately that didn't happen br br this movie had various reasons i did not finish it one it was <UNK> slow i mean seriously it was you can only understand 10 of what is said and the characters were poorly introduced br br if you have an english accent and you like a of talking no action terrible acting cheesy laughs and the same music sound effects played over and over and over then this is the movie for you br br 1 10 completely horrible br br avoid at all costs
<START> <UNK> <UNK> but sadly unfunny satire of detective movies with <UNK> faced michael caine playing a british author of trashy crime stories traveling to the to assist in writing the <UNK> of a would be gangster soon he realizes he's being followed and his life is in danger caine <UNK> the proceedings with considerable sly wit and low <UNK> sarcasm but his actual performance is <UNK> of energy <UNK> shrill bursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere and he <UNK> with nobody on the screen other cast members particularly mickey rooney a silver haired lionel and <UNK> scott do very well in <UNK> <UNK> roles though al <UNK> has an insulting part as an apparent cross dressing homosexual <UNK> gets insulted without being able to defend himself an <UNK> position writer director mike <UNK> has the <UNK> of a good idea <UNK> the detective movies of the 1940s without <UNK> the hard boiled talk and <UNK> but he hasn't a very sharp sense of humor when a bogart <UNK> asking a question about a <UNK> is the best joke what follows is <UNK> indeed from
<START> i <UNK> i would never allow myself to <UNK> into to the bogus authority figures of the sixties who told me things were better in the good old days  the current australian prime minister is a <UNK> example of just such a mind set br br but i switched over to a decade under the influence because i found watching the much <UNK> <UNK> documentary on the other channel such a <UNK> experience i found the values expressed by the <UNK> <UNK> too ugly to accept as reasonable so <UNK> so devoid of any sense of outrage at a society that can <UNK> killing someone to steal his very ugly shoes so lacking in any worthwhile purpose that they can report without <UNK> the exploitation an audience by <UNK> them to hold those shoes above their heads to lock in a <UNK> deal for themselves with a company of <UNK> was just too much to continue watching br br a decade under the influence depicted a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity corruption and in high and low places br br i have noted the change in film making that accompanied the exposure of america's disastrous foreign policy <UNK> in vietnam and so many less reported places in my www com <UNK> website a decade under the influence documents the precise moment at which that change took place br br before the seventies the armed forces were depicted in american films as an <UNK> fighting force comprised of decent human beings who into <UNK> heroes on the battlefield after the seventies they are generally portrayed as a <UNK> <UNK> by a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> before the seventies the fbi agent and the honest cop tended to be depicted as your friend and <UNK> after the seventies the fbi agents were all incompetent and the best a cop could <UNK> to was to ignore their <UNK> and his <UNK> corruption and <UNK> justice in his own <UNK> manner br br before the seventies the <UNK> american little guy the average joe the jimmy stewart type would face down the problems encountered and thereby gain some insight into underlying wisdom of his elected leaders and justice of the american way after the seventies kevin <UNK> that role but now he is the voice of one crying out in the wilderness for evil to be exposed or accepting his lot and making out the best he can br br and now those old time religion <UNK> have been stripped of any honesty and <UNK> and portrayed with a certain amount of justification as <UNK> <UNK> and self serving <UNK> br br a decade under the influence tells it like it was a decade under the influence tells it like it is now it depicts the redemption of the american film industry from the hands of the artistically morally and intellectually <UNK> studio <UNK> it shows the <UNK> of the hollywood <UNK> by the independent film makers who promised to get a <UNK> and tired audience back into the cinemas the fact that their failures were numerous and at times disastrous merely <UNK> the greatness of their achievement an achievement reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitudes of the big box office stars such as clooney <UNK> affleck etc and the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is an excellent starting point for anybody with even a vague interest in the residents most of their classic videos are present although earth vs flying <UNK> and don't be cruel are curiously missing and the concentrates of their various cd <UNK> projects offer <UNK> glimpses into how the ones have been spending their time since they realized mtv was no longer putting them in heavy <UNK> or indeed showing videos period br br all of the videos on this <UNK> feature striking imagery and <UNK> music with a choice of the original tracks and newly recorded ones and two of them the third <UNK> <UNK> roll and one minute movies are in the museum of modern <UNK> permanent collection check out this dvd and find out why
<START> i have been reading comments on imdb for some time now an 8 3 average for this movie just plain gets on my nerves i don't mean to pull one of those i just signed up for an account so i can post on this movie bits but i just did the only theme you will come away with from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be <UNK> br br now i realize many film people love this movie nevertheless it is crap the thing that really gets to me is the fact that the director expects you to have sympathy for the in the movie if you do have sexual relations with your sister you should probably be an <UNK> from society just my personal feelings i guess yet i sat through 2 hours of this <UNK> expecting some really deep reasoning behind <UNK> <UNK> br br i tend to like a lot of foreign movies but this is my first encounter with a korean flick and it has put them last in line in my book oh i feel better already after a little <UNK>
<START> about the discussion on the south the <UNK> and the <UNK> well i am from the south <UNK> near the south pole to be exact is this southern enough seriously some stories are universal we have never been to <UNK> nor lived the classic period of homer but he speaks to us today so does shakespeare and <UNK> and stories from far unknown places also reach us when told with sensibility intelligence humor just like o brother besides we all the rest of the world have our own <UNK> too and our own depression era ever heard of <UNK> during year 2001 our politicians and racism our gentle souls just like <UNK> and tommy i simply loved this movie folks despite the subtitles despite being on the other side of the world and please forgive my errors in english i tried my best br br ps i believe nobody <UNK> this favorite phrase when <UNK> asks george nelson what does he do for a living while handling him the machine gun
<START> this movie is bad as we all knew it would be most times i usually love the bad 80s early 90s trash can comedy haha no pun intended i list <UNK> school career opportunities hot shots summer school and many more made around this time this even has the classic yet forgotten comedy of dean cameron aka <UNK> school section 8 <UNK> and party maniac for summer school but this movie is just to slow it takes almost 30 min to get going and we have to sit through pointless dialog between to half wits the sheen boys e c and yes i can hear the <UNK> <UNK> to trash me with obviously you don't watch 2 and 1 2 men well charlie was not at the level he is now during this flick not that he's anything worth watching now charlie only shines when his co stars support him and <UNK> isn't anymore than an <UNK> wonder <UNK> offering little support actually this movie was written by <UNK> and it shows it has no real ending come on <UNK> even the <UNK> school 2 writers <UNK> out an ending no idea how any issue brought is solved no hot babes no swearing to <UNK> the bad plot characters acting i'm now tired of this <UNK> just save your time and watch the movies i listed above you'll enjoy them much more
<START> i have no idea how accurate the portrayal of flynn appears in this film but even as a work of fiction it is one of the worst films i have ever seen br br the script is all over the place and leaves you wondering how he got from one scene to the next you are just not given the minimum information needed to keep some continuity and understand his present situation and it is difficult to understand <UNK> and other characters' motives behind some of their behaviour br br add to that a series of silly and implausible situations and you have film that comes across as one of your dreams that seems to make sense while you are asleep but when you wake up and you try to remember it it is just strange disjointed and totally unrealistic br br there are many long boring musical sections of the film that to me are either bad direction or a bad director trying and failing to be artistic br br none of the characters are even likable and the flynn character comes across as a self serving liar thug thief <UNK> murderer bear fist fighter <UNK> and <UNK> who will do anything and step on anyone to further his own dreams and somehow despite all that great opportunities just seem to miraculously fall into his lap br br this film is not entertaining nor satisfying in any way and by all accounts not even historically accurate so why even watch it to rub salt into the wound the dvd had one of the worst <UNK> i have ever seen it wasn't even in wide screen or <UNK> 5 1 it had terrible <UNK> and many many <UNK> from what looked like a film reel that had been gathering dust and <UNK> somewhere
<START> cult director lucio fulci is probably most famous for his gory zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his <UNK> reputation as the godfather of gore <UNK> absolute greatest film however dates back to 1972 and while it is definitely gritty and violent it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films non <UNK> <UNK> un <UNK> aka don't torture a <UNK> of 1972 is not only by far <UNK> greatest film this <UNK> and utterly brilliant giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre the stunning atmosphere and <UNK> suspense the great setting the intriguing story the brilliant performances or the intense moments of sheer shock i don't know what to praise most about this ingenious giallo don't torture a <UNK> truly delivers cinematic perfection in every aspect which makes it an absolute masterpiece of italian horror cinema br br contrary to other <UNK> it is not seductive beauty queens who are <UNK> one by one but little boys who fall victims to a killer on the loose bodies of little boys are found in rural <UNK> while the police are desperately searching for the killer the little town is basically full of strange people and the <UNK> are screaming for a <UNK> br br the film is stunningly suspenseful and <UNK> from the very beginning with a gritty dark and constantly tense atmosphere that has yet to find an equal the acting performances are among the best in italian horror cinema <UNK> one of my personal all time favorite actors is excellent in the lead as journalist <UNK> who is investigating the crimes sexy barbara <UNK> delivers both eye candy and a brilliant performance equally outstanding performances come from irene <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who is utterly brilliant in her role the great score by <UNK> <UNK> brilliantly <UNK> the suspense and atmosphere and the film is <UNK> shot in fascinating <UNK> landscapes although not as gory as many other fulci films this film is definitely gritty and <UNK> in its violence with a few shockingly brutal scenes br br don't torture a <UNK> has everything brilliant horror requires this is not quite as easy to get hold of as most other fulci flicks but i assure that searching it will pay off any horror fan must see this personal favorite of mine and i highly recommend any true lover of film in general not to miss this a masterpiece
<START> i took my family to see <UNK> this past weekend we had so looked forward to it but had my kids not been there my husband and i would have left coming from a <UNK> community we found the fact that all of the male in the film having drawn on them was a little disturbing we felt like we were watching cross dressing <UNK> or something it was just odd to hear a male voice come from a female body after checking some of the production notes on a different website i felt like the animators might have slipped up on this fact i know this is just an animated humorous show but by putting female body parts on a male i had to suspend my disbelief so much that i just couldn't enjoy the movie like i might have i know can be found funny but they were definitely over used none of the other animals in the movie seemed to have gender specific body parts drawn on them and i would have preferred the <UNK> in this show to at least have the correct ones if they had to be drawn on at all the kids however still enjoyed the movie though we took the time afterward to make sure they knew the difference between <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> the dvd version we bought had sandra <UNK> on the cover but we've discovered it was a picture of her from another movie unfortunately she is in this movie very little you can however see how far she has come br br the one other bright spot in the movie besides her very small part were a few of the location scenes shot in nyc and new jersey in the 1980s br br the sound is terrible sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear sometimes the dialog has been <UNK> without any background noises at all which is <UNK> for example sometimes when they are in the car the noises from the car are too loud and then suddenly there is absolutely no extra noise at all the director is fond of close ups on faces and then it's clear that the movie has been over dubbed because the words don't match the lip movements through most of the movie the voices sound like the people are speaking into a tin can br br background music when there is music is distracting instead of adding to the movie br br the direction is laughable goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke especially during times when there is supposed to be tension like in the middle of gun battles the writing is terrible there are some subplots that make no sense and most of the characters come off looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all to their motivations the writer director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men that were together in vietnam but none of it makes sense these top <UNK> and former soldiers don't seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people moving the actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning it's simply a combination of bad directing and bad writing br br the production values are so bad that at first we thought we had stumbled on someone's student film that just happened to have sandra <UNK> in it if you like laughing at really poorly done student films then this movie is for you otherwise avoid this movie
<START> wow what a wonderful film making mr im has done it again br br his last work 2000 was a great film but this one is even greater selected as an official feature film in the festival for the second time in a two year row this <UNK> years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a korean culture br br simply is about a great korean painter ' <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who was considered as a <UNK> in the late <UNK> century the basic story of this film tells the life of <UNK> <UNK> up and the historical background of his time he was an orphan but in his teens he was picked up by a noble man called kim moon this mr kim becomes a mentor of <UNK> as well as life long friendship and continues to support his great talent that he knew in the first place with <UNK> great effort and natural talent his fame grows faster and faster as the strength of his country korea falls down br br <UNK> personality portrayed in the film is very complicated and one of the best actors in korea <UNK> min goes deep inside of <UNK> soul suffering eyes reveal the struggle of a great <UNK> life he is very serious sometimes but all of sudden he changes to a wild maniac he drinks like an alcoholic and sleeps with anytime even he said in the movie without an alcohol and a woman i can't draw an alcohol and women are my only <UNK> in the peak of the fame to his own style he travels all around the country and never gives up his pride as an artist for the authority or money i don't want to give out every details but i think you surely did get some ideas about the film br br the most amazing thing about this film is a cinematography it is just so breath taking how they captured every beauty of landscapes yes each scene is like a work of <UNK> painting and the script is perfect too it mainly deals a deeper meaning of what makes a true artist for example kim <UNK> to <UNK> in the movie that <UNK> one holds a <UNK> one has to set an aim in <UNK> this is very moving and inspiring line and there are many more br br go see this film if you are going to be in the festival br br will be the greatest film ever made that deals with the life of a painter in film history
<START> wow i just got one watching this br br how crappy post production is on this movie br br i kid you not i literally could've done a better job myself br br all of post production is flawed all of it whoever cut this film should be banned from the film industry br br that aside the script was a <UNK> absolute br br not to mention jack bauer and his <UNK> the pirate in <UNK> accent wtf is his character doing there but to me the biggest flaw of all was character development dynamics dialogue wow i cant believe how bad it was br br i give this movie a 2 out of 10 1 for samantha who is a great actress too bad the production made everyone look like amateurs out there br br the other 1 goes to cinematography which was indeed good br br other then that my friend this is one bad movie br br i don't even feel like making an elaborate post on this it was just horrible production poor actors didn't know what they were getting into
<START> what is enjoyable about watching random movies at random times is that one never quite knows what to expect or where the next great piece of cinema will emerge recently my viewing has taken the form of <UNK> classics like raging bull or <UNK> of the lost <UNK> but this time my vcr took me away from modern <UNK> and <UNK> me right down in front of lionel the <UNK> children this is a <UNK> directed film about three youthful children a mysterious event with their father <UNK> to the open fields of england and eventually the <UNK> inherited by merely waving at trains at first glance this seemingly simple children's film doesn't seem all that hopeful as it has been lost on vhs <UNK> for some time but within the first fifteen minutes of this film one realizes that it is more than just your common place children's movie  <UNK> children was created during a time when <UNK> was more than just saying no when family meant everything and where adventure was ready for you around every <UNK> track bend this is more than an adorable film it has amazing cinematic techniques used it keeps the regular viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions and gives three perfect companions to follow along this <UNK> minute voyage <UNK> children is a lost treasure that needs to be seen by families and film <UNK> alike br br there are several moments that stand out proudly in <UNK> children that <UNK> this from mediocrity to excellence  one happens to be our three children bobby <UNK> and peter modern cinema <UNK> us that these three children cannot provide ample darkness laughter and insight into the world surrounding them but children prove otherwise from intelligently spoken lines both from acting and the script to sincere kindness and dedication to this small village all the way to the final meeting at that train stop these children are more than just child stars <UNK> a story they are leading us with emotion <UNK> and a realism unseen by today's children there is more imagination packed in this small vhs than i have witnessed in film for years a favorite scene that could have been handled with <UNK> of which i have seen in other films was the birthday scene for bobby the way that <UNK> <UNK> her between guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing keeping our eyes excited about each scene as well as our mind another scene that captured my attention was when the children were working on gifts for <UNK> when asking one man for a gift <UNK> has him merely state no i will not i don't like <UNK> the children's reaction is hilarious  providing moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout filmed in the 1970s this tiny feature provides genuine laughs than most modern comedies it is a creative film coupled with great choreography and direction br br that is to say as much as i loved this film it wasn't perfect <UNK> does a great job of keeping us guessing as to what happened to father but it did feel like the event occurred the children were kept in the dark and it suddenly resolved itself by the end more detail to father not much more would have <UNK> his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction also there is one scene in this film one of those <UNK> wide screen shots of the english countryside that is just breath taking but when looking a bit closer you happen to see cars in the background it made me chuckle but didn't distract too much from the overall picture cinema like this is sorely missed today and oddly it seems that only the british have the <UNK> to produce it films like love actually or <UNK> of <UNK> demonstrates the power and excitement for community towns places where everyone knows everyone and we aren't afraid to be <UNK> this is more of a theme that american audiences could have more of  more understanding of what is happening outside instead of remaining secluded to your own events br br overall i loved <UNK> children i didn't know what to expect when i first put it in the vhs player but from the opening scene to the exploding train set to <UNK> birthday <UNK> proved that he could handle the most child friendly story with ease his ability to make the child actors feel like real characters to involve the adults less and to involve the children like they were adults was outstanding this is a film to be viewed as a strong alternative to anything disney releases the continually occurring themes of friendship kindness to strangers and forgiveness <UNK> through the tv with grace and power <UNK> children is more than just a kid's film it is a feature that should be a <UNK> to modern audience viewing not only does it give a great visual to the english countryside but it also teaches and shows how life would be greater with an emphasis on imagination and courage instead of fighting any cgi bad guys br br grade <UNK> out of
<START> what should have been a routine <UNK> gig at a secluded lake house turns into a night of terror as high school student jill johnson <UNK> belle receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker while trying to stay one step ahead of him br br the first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there the remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80 minute feature film that's a good idea because its <UNK> everything that made the original bad however if they wanted this film to work more effectively then they should have hired a better lead actress better director writer etc there's no suspense everything can be figured out long before it happens and it's a very dull film since not much happens at least there isn't much to sit through since its less than 90 minutes br br if this premise were to work then the lead actress has to give a realistic performance <UNK> belle gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen and throughout the whole movie she seemed to be reading her lines you get a lead role in a hollywood film that will be viewed by millions of people and you give no effort at all why did they hire this girl sure she's pretty but she can't act at all yet i suppose this won't matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this film up the rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid <UNK> even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all br br this movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film boogeyman that movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false <UNK> and when a stranger calls is pretty much the same jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid this type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes the stranger appears he has to be one of the <UNK> killers ever he carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat the ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter the film is directed by simon west and he is really bad at building up suspense he was using every cliché he could think of and the results weren't very good the house was amazing and i'll give the film credit for that it was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer in the end if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie rating 2 10
<START> how much do i love this film now i'm not a fan of bad films but i do love a film that is so bad it's good this is one of those juan <UNK> <UNK> pace has a great butt looks <UNK> on screen and definitely doesn't make a bad turn at his acting debut i believe billy zane is suitably mean and moody though i still constantly feel that there is something more in him i felt it in titanic the look on his face when la <UNK> <UNK> on him for example totally broken shocked and put down fierce kelly <UNK> is a pretty face no seriously i think that's it it's worth catching this to see one really hot guy some big <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> nasty <UNK> from billy laugh at the dialogue <UNK> in the scenery and madness of the whole affair i'm <UNK> go watch it again now yes i bought it

<START> the filmmakers try to paint the influence of the and robert parker as a travesty on par with the german <UNK> of france and the reign of <UNK> but they never find a victim in this film we hear wine makers critics and <UNK> <UNK> that while the wine industry grows it becomes increasingly <UNK> but the film never makes a case that this has resulted in the loss of any good wine or exploitation of any person or culture other than naive wine <UNK> readers with lots of cash if they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a dull wine so be it br br if this were a film about the diamond trade where the <UNK> market <UNK> results in human suffering the style might have been appropriate but as it is it just comes off as anti american anti <UNK> and anti <UNK> had the filmmakers been around in the <UNK> they most likely would have <UNK> the <UNK> of american <UNK> in the effort to save french wine
<START> this could have been a good movie if more things were explained way too many plot holes to find this enjoyable the ending in particular is off left field spoiler alert how did the <UNK> get back to <UNK> so fast and <UNK> shows up at the house in a matter of two minutes way out of <UNK> here how did anna get hold of the money no explanation at all if the pete the cop knew <UNK> was in danger why didn't he have a cop at the door in the hospital this and many more questions remain too bad because the premise was there just bad writing and execution br br good cast is wasted here <UNK> goes from bad to good to bad <UNK> character lacks development and is just blah as the bad guy br br this could re made with a cohesive story line and better writing of course it would be much more violent with lots of gratuitous sex and everything the editing would be jerky as well i guess so let's leave well enough alone
<START> if you are planning to watch <UNK> and are on imdb reading reviews about it you have already wasted too much time over this stupid idiotic awful movie br br it's a horrible horrible horrible copy of the movie ' i choose to ignore all the other <UNK> and bad reviews i had heard about this movie and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it i thought that after all its david <UNK> who is making it and it has govinda how bad can it be but after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense i couldn't take it any more and turned off my computer br br overacting by everyone in the movie stupid dialogues total time waste i gave it a 1 star rating because that's the lowest you can do if i could go lower i would have given it a 100 rating
<START> i was invited to an early screening of the movie about four months before it was released i had to watch the film and later fill out a <UNK> on my thoughts it was the hardest thing to sit through on earth the show just <UNK> by and you quickly begin wishing you were dead the thing is there are two types of mormon films the good ones with actual good stories and the crappy ones that just plain stink saints and soldiers now there is a good movie but with these wannabe comedies the writers and the actors just try too hard basically they try to be funny when they are not no wonder why there is such a small target audience for these films they're filled with <UNK> <UNK> that aren't funny to begin with and they just try to poke fun at average things it's the story that makes the movie and the stories for these movies are just weak i bet you can guess what my <UNK> looked like when i was told to fill it out after the movie
<START> the story of how the communist leader who freed the <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> was eliminated by the western powers through the hand of a story of struggle and injustice of hope and the search of freedom the story could be the one of any african country a very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty if you have to see only one foreign film this year see this one
<START> totally disgusting and cheap <UNK> humor i loved it it is the most disgusting and totally horribly acted film except for nicolas read who plays an un dead court <UNK> to comic brilliance but being that as it may i laughed so many times and i have to hand it to the film makers it wasn't pretentious or ordinary in any way <UNK> fighting zombies on their rape victims what other movie has this not for the but with a pizza a <UNK> and a six pack of beer you got it made if you have a cast iron stomach and a <UNK> sense of humor like myself
<START> as a bit of a michael <UNK> fan i sat down to watch one of his good old fashioned <UNK> i'm still waiting br br the film is based around a group of us <UNK> trying to get rid of a bunch of <UNK> terrorists who have taken over a nuclear <UNK> <UNK> reese <UNK> <UNK> was an english member of the <UNK> unit and of course she became <UNK> involved with tom <UNK> <UNK> i must ask since when have the brits had female <UNK> members as far as i know if they are ever needed they are got from other sources even if they did i can pretty much guarantee they wouldn't be as wet as <UNK> reese i would also think that tom <UNK> would be a little more responsible in his position or have i lost the plot i know there is always the romantic angle in these films as it helps provide the <UNK> factor but does it have to be throughout especially when there's more important things to be taken into consideration like nuclear <UNK> br br the <UNK> of the <UNK> on the us aircraft <UNK> intrigued me the sacred pen as carried by one of the supposed tv news crew are there were no security <UNK> to find out who or what goes on board one of these ships especially with the <UNK> of people that was on it mind you if there was i suppose there would be no story br br i could go on but when it got to inner body bomb in order to safely remove a bullet i gave up on the action drama movie bit and enjoyed it for the comedy it actually was br br by the way would a news reporter really say downtown <UNK>
<START> when this movie came out in 1995 i found it amazingly great especially with sandra <UNK> after having watched her brilliant performance in speed i was ready to enjoy any of her movies br br back to the net it was a movie that keeps you in <UNK> all in all i enjoyed it so i give it a out of
<START> this was one of my favorites as a child my family had the 8 track tape soundtrack it took us years until i was in my <UNK> for us to get a video of the movie my dad taped it from hbo or something every summer when we go to the beach my mom brother sister and i we lay on the beach and sing all the songs from this movie loved it
<START> one true thing proves that it's the characters which make a movie streep will surely receive an oscar nomination for her role a beautiful drama one true thing is a prime example of movie making in the late 1990's there are still people out there who care about making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects it's no best picture or anything don't be silly but the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like a shock wave i cried twice in this movie which says a lot for a 24 year old man
<START> a space odyssey is a <UNK> intriguing space travel journey with a profound look at <UNK> future it is one of the very few great films of our times it gives us something to think talk and argue it wonders about our importance in the universe and <UNK> our imagination and curiosity it <UNK> us to dig for insights br br as a science fiction fantasy it is one of the most original films ever made kubrick's camera dances to the blue <UNK> with planets floating through the light years it's an experience in the poetry of motion a rich statement to the power of cinema br br but 2001 reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all it's instead a philosophical <UNK> a magnificent <UNK> on man's place in the grand scheme of things and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else br br 2001 is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost <UNK> terms the people in this classic science fiction epic hardly matter kubrick relates a <UNK> in images of mountains the desert the technology the space capsule the computer named hal who is more interesting than the humans and the time <UNK> the final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius br br as a terror story too it is a <UNK> achievement not on the same scream inducing level as hitchcock's psycho but in an innocent and far more haunting way the film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the <UNK> vision of man in kubrick's fantasy the golden age of man was a neglected instant between a man <UNK> at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear powered spaceship floating in a <UNK> <UNK> around the earth man has indeed evolved br br as a spectacle 2001 <UNK> the mind eye and ear with stimulating images and <UNK> we are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment the film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments the first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually without a single line of dialog the zero gravity toilet with its great list of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> gravity by walking the walls <UNK> upside down the frightening moment when we realize that hal is reading the <UNK> lips the magical of sun moon and earth the returning home to charm the <UNK> br br 2001 is filled with poetic imagery the view of the sun rising over the earth the <UNK> of the bone into the air in slow motion the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a <UNK> ballet br br 2001 is also a work of great visual <UNK> it allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny <UNK> in every man its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery they insist upon an answer where there can only be a question every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of kubrick's <UNK> but for those who can accept <UNK> the climax is deeply moving
<START> i saw <UNK> during the approximately 2 days of its theatrical release it is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs the simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way followed by the bullies and villains getting their just <UNK> is both sympathetic and heartwarming it is also thought provoking with <UNK> <UNK> this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty personal behavior and bullying movies have different and different purposes this movie which is delightful to all ages offers an interesting humorous look into our own experiences everyone will recognize personality and <UNK> types of themselves and others everyone will see the humor the humor makes the move enjoyable and brings understanding of life situations to a new level br br for lighthearted laughter and a <UNK> <UNK> movie <UNK> is an excellent choice memorable
<START> my boyfriend and i decided to go see this movie after we heard on the radio that it was a good movie worth seeing even up there with cars within the first ten minutes of the movie i was horrified for starters the <UNK> which should be females had male voices then i realized they really are supposed to be guys i put the <UNK> <UNK> aside for a bit and tried to keep watching the movie with an open mind but it was just so corny i couldn't help but shake my head i probably checked my phone about ten times to see if it was almost over the plot was decent if not predictable but it took way to long to reach its point i was having trouble sitting through it and i'm 19 the children in the theater were actually getting up and running up and down the <UNK> i felt like joining them but my biggest problem with the movie was that it was loaded with drinking references not to mention that the <UNK> <UNK> actually hot <UNK> and stole a car then <UNK> and drive broke into a boy's house to push him out of bed he deserved it though then ran away from the cops whom the writers of the movie made look like terrible people this isn't the kind of thing i would want my kid to be exposed to there's way too much of that in the real world if i wanted my child to watch guys drink and drive and lead cops on a chase i'd pop them in front of the 10 <UNK> news children's movies are supposed to be an escape from reality not an escape into <UNK> what happened to the good morals and happy endings that children's movies used to <UNK> that's why disney's old movies like beauty and the beast lady and the tramp the little mermaid etc are classics if you want your kids to see a great cartoon with basically the same plot as <UNK> rent the lion king you can get a great story without the awful drinking and driving and grand <UNK> auto references the writers of <UNK> were obviously trying to continue the great trend of making a children's movie that a parent could enjoy as well but they did so in very bad taste i would never take my kids to see this and i suggest you save your money and watch something else
<START> when in 1982 the thing came out to theaters everywhere it had a cold reception and very poor box office results becoming almost a failure in john carpenter's career as a horror director however time has proved that the thing was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the film's fault nowadays john carpenter's the thing has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic and not without a reason as this new version of john w campbell jr 's story who goes there previously adapted as the thing from another world is closer to the original tale and keeps a <UNK> feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia br br the plot of the thing begins in the winter of 1982 in a u s research station located in the remote <UNK> of <UNK> when the members of the crew notice a norwegian helicopter coming their way the two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a <UNK> dog who makes its way into the american base after the <UNK> are killed accidentally the americans try to figure out what made them to be insane soon they'll discover that the <UNK> dog the <UNK> were hunting was not a normal dog but a creature able to <UNK> every living creature and not only that it has a tremendous <UNK> br br director john carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the <UNK> slasher halloween where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock the thing could be seen as an evolution of that style as even when carpenter makes great use of rob special effects which were labeled by critics as repulsive on its day the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent and very well done displays of gore the feeling of loneliness as well as the bad <UNK> between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the thing even our main character r j <UNK> kurt russell ending in a situation where nobody can be trusted br br this plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel and was blatantly ignored by the previous version not completely a bad thing just a big difference making this version feel less like a remake and more as a new conception of the source novel bill <UNK> script handles the characters with brilliant <UNK> giving us enough to <UNK> them but not too much to completely trust them making them an essential factor in the film's haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie the mystery and the suspense are at the max as never one can tell who is the thing and who is normal <UNK> the paranoia and <UNK> of the plot with excellent results br br the cast is very effective and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real carpenter's regular <UNK> kurt russell as <UNK> carries the film and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse definitely one of his best performances <UNK> <UNK> is also terrific as dr blair a scientist that goes insane after discovering the <UNK> purposes br br the thing is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go <UNK> although they exist the most notorious being the very low key and at times score by <UNK> <UNK> it's not exactly bad but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it's not one of the best works by the legendary composer also due to some with the special effects some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes although nothing of big importance or actually annoying br br when talking about john carpenter's films most people will almost instantly name halloween as his favorite film but personally i would go with the thing as i consider it carpenter's greatest achievement so far and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made i would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made 10 10
<START> the cell is a rather difficult film to <UNK> if you read the plot outline a <UNK> <UNK> inside a <UNK> serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction but that doesn't really do this movie justice there is a fantasy aspect within the sub conscious minds that is stunning with lavish visuals and incredible mind <UNK> scenarios there is drama as the aforementioned <UNK> played by lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy <UNK> makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing and there is most definitely a horror <UNK> due to the sickening actions of the serial killer's evil persona the movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will while i feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience i find it to be completely fascinating br br right from the opening credits with lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly <UNK> in a white dress you will know that you are in for a visual treat every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her patients they are guaranteed a feast of visual and <UNK> delight the costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour the camera leaves at the door and <UNK> a world where up and down are the same the characters become <UNK> of their own <UNK> and <UNK> into creatures worthy of such stature if you don't enjoy anything else about the cell you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes br br the casting is top notch also jennifer lopez is in her element here <UNK> her natural compassionate and almost <UNK> sensibilities while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings makeup and costumes she is incredibly sexy and i personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the <UNK> com world she has been <UNK> into that would allow her to experiment further vince vaughn is fairly convincing as an fbi agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman but it is without a doubt vincent <UNK> that has the biggest impression here it's an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer we are disgusted at his actions yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life he looks <UNK> powerful within his realm yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world it's a great performance from an underrated actor br br while the cell doesn't work as well on every level it <UNK> attempts some of the actions of the characters are not believable and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic it is an occasionally shocking visually astounding head trip that <UNK> multiple viewings
<START> this old stinker makes the flash gordon movies look sophisticated it's so terrible i love it and i wish i could find a tape but none of the <UNK> i've checked list it the rock band leader who calls himself commander cody must have loved it too because he named his band after it
<START> this is a thoughtful film that lays bare the <UNK> of the so called upper class and those who work for them the <UNK> and have <UNK> robert shaw does a <UNK> job in his role as the <UNK> correct <UNK> steven who helps lady franklin sarah miles overcome her mental depression at the outset however steven has many mixed feelings regarding this lady of the upper class he inevitably falls in love with her which of course is the societal boundaries that separate them br br i have not read anything prior to this and only judge the movie as i have seen it i consider it a very honest story about the realities of daily living and the conflict of what we might wish or expect from life and what we get it's a fine drama worth seeing again
<START> i want very much to believe that the above quote specifically the english <UNK> translation which was actually written not spoken in a <UNK> letter a <UNK> sends to the protagonist was meant to be self <UNK> in a tongue in cheek manner but if so director <UNK> <UNK> apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude <UNK> actually takes himself seriously here or else has so much disdain for everyone especially the viewing audience that he can't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke br br some <UNK> are able to get away with making <UNK> bizarre films because they do so with <UNK> and unique personal style e g david lynch and <UNK> <UNK> others use a <UNK> approach while still <UNK> surreal elements into the fabric of the story e g <UNK> and david <UNK> later less bizarre works in x <UNK> throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then <UNK> him to find fault with it well here it is the pacing is <UNK> and choppy in particular continuity is often <UNK> with superfluous characters abound e g the gypsy mother and child most of the performances are overwrought the lighting is often poor particularly in the <UNK> discussed sex scene <UNK> scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason and the list goes on br br not to be completely negative it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions i liked the musical score even the <UNK> industrial <UNK> music being played in the <UNK> abandoned complex to which the main characters <UNK> in the second half of the film perhaps a reference to andy <UNK> of the '60s much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful an obvious attempt at contrast with the <UNK> city settings and even well into middle age <UNK> shows that she still has <UNK> her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn't sink into <UNK> br br there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as x more <UNK> <UNK> is admirable even when the experiment doesn't work but <UNK> tries nothing new here the film is a <UNK> of elements borrowed from countless earlier films and after several decades of movie viewing and literally thousands of films later i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal poorly crafted tripe at this early moment in the 21st century one is left asking with the exception of jean pierre <UNK> are there any directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore rating 3 10
<START> harry <UNK> has a quote right on the front cover of the dvd stating the next icon of horror really i have heard a lot of hype surrounding this one but wasn't totally convinced however i am a die hard horror fan and will give just about any horror movie a chance no matter the budget or the rating cause ya never know where your gonna find the next gem not here not <UNK> <UNK> is poorly conceived poorly acted and un funny just because you have the actors who played freddy jason and <UNK> and a buffy <UNK> topless with tons of gore does not make you an expert on horror sorry i don't even want to describe the plot because it is so idiotic honestly my money is on rob zombie there is a man who knows old school horror forget this trash
<START> watchable but pretty terrible how shocking that this was the great gregory la last directing credit even in his better known roles i don't care for gene kelly he seems to me to be smug hostile and self involved here paired with a minor actress like marie wilson he seems to show those characteristics in <UNK> br br marie wilson playing an <UNK> who falls for a military man is exceptionally hard and unsympathetic the actors seem to be working hard to get past the hard <UNK> core of the picture and they do ok br br the know it all butler is apparently meant to be funny but he seems like an extended riff on the <UNK> bits for which franklin <UNK> was famous and in which despite their stereotyping he was generally funny unlike this guy <UNK> <UNK> is as always very appealing in a rather underdeveloped secondary plot
<START> a real life <UNK> adventure is a great tv film for all ages the movie focuses around <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who wants to go on travel for gold in <UNK> the only person who hires her is pierce thomas madison bruce campbell what comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget this tv film was just great the acting is 1 especially by bruce campbell and <UNK> <UNK> and i also learned some information about the i recommend this tv film to all without <UNK> it is also based on a true story br br 10 10
<START> this is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen it has no good features at all br br it looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title graphics br br the lead male transformed from deaths door to superman eh you what br br other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting br br i left the cinema feeling cheated br br needless to say i could not this film to anyone
<START> what a tedious turgid boring mess this is a classic example of all that is wrong with contemporary english theater film about as exciting as a closet full of dirty <UNK> the very opposite of living film only the presence of <UNK> <UNK> gives it any spark
<START> stewart's age didn't bother me at all in this movie although he was portraying a much younger person i still recall my fascination with story and while i was thoroughly adult by the time this biopic was made i had to see it br br not only does this <UNK> a great performance by stewart it also gives a lot of fascinating technical data making it understandable to those technically challenged such as myself and the look of the plane itself was great br br i quite loved this depiction of a period before my birth and <UNK> the childhood love i had for <UNK> and for the idea of air travel
<START> the second film about the adventures of the pair <UNK> is 10 times better than the first the humor is great and <UNK> and the script is well executed taken from the original 1965 comic book by i fell asleep with the first film although i am a great fan of <UNK> and was reluctant to see this sequel but i am glad this movie proved me wrong excellent comedy for everyone highly recommended
<START> the <UNK> is a tale of foreign intrigue with seagal at the center as a deep cover <UNK> who has a package which everyone wants and are willing to kill to get the flick is uninspired with less of the usual action stuff which put seagal on the movie map fire fights hand to hand combat <UNK> stunts etc and more of a story which is convoluted uninteresting and full of meaningless filler what action there is seems token and gratuitous while seagal looking more and more like a <UNK> chop <UNK> through this insipid flick <UNK> and bored while <UNK> no improvement in acting ability somewhere around the <UNK> man or fire down below seagal flicks took a nose dive and the <UNK> is just an <UNK> of that trend nothing here worth watching except for the most die hard seagal fans c
<START> if <UNK> <UNK> had been a hack he would have directed mother and son instead of mirror this is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world i am convinced a son without a name takes care of his mother without a name they love each other i guess no they don't i'm sure these aren't characters they aren't even actors playing characters at least it could be pretty but even the nature seems ridiculously touched up and changed wherever it was necessary with a <UNK> computer and could <UNK> have come up with a technique as hackneyed as a distorted aspect <UNK> you would have to have been born yesterday to buy this garbage 1 10
<START> could be considered some mild spoilers but no more than in anyone else's review of this film br br i knew that nothing could <UNK> live up to the absolute brilliance of the original carrie which was more of a film about social criticism than it was about setting the gym on fire carrie white was victim <UNK> and her story conveyed the <UNK> that the truly exploited must feel br br whoever conceived the rachel character for the rage must have completely missed the subtleties of carrie for the audience to genuinely share the <UNK> rage s he must be a sympathetic character a true <UNK> who is more a victim of <UNK> than of his her own <UNK> rachel is entirely too unpleasant to convey any sort of the emotional depth and connection of sissy carrie and she looks and acts like she should be right along side the and popular that she ends up <UNK> she like the rest of them has a soul that is every bit as corrupt whereas carrie was a complete innocent br br it just doesn't work there's no satisfaction in seeing the pretty children not even the home improvement boy getting <UNK> in this movie's climactic scene and it's so unnecessarily gory there was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym br br and there is one person in particular that this movie should not have had the <UNK> to kill off but i won't say who it is if you've seen the original carrie it's the sort of character who dies <UNK> br br at least they did create the connection to carrie appropriately it's explained as it should have been but that and the arm <UNK> which was done rather nicely is just about the only thing this movie has going for it br br yet another hideous scream knock off and it <UNK> the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made br br rating 1 out of 10 i wasn't expecting much but i was still horribly disappointed an unsympathetic character a series of irritating pop culture references thrown in for no good reason and an ending scene that <UNK> in comparison to carrie 's <UNK> shocker
<START> you would really need to remember the <UNK> and have a clear understanding as to where and how they <UNK> into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this movie br br there is no plot as such basically it's a crazy mixed up <UNK> of various unrelated sequences but it is interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its <UNK> in short it was a classic cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late '60s experimental cinema it contains some good songs some ultra <UNK> cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique br br i give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons first it took a lot of courage to make such an <UNK> movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly <UNK> at the time if a feature movie <UNK> at the box office the consequences can be dire for all concerned secondly it was for the most part a creative success and finally as already mentioned it is <UNK> a classic of the genre and as such it is now historically important br br unfortunately head came too late in the <UNK> career but there again they would not have been allowed to make it earlier on because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image br br clearly the members of the group knew only too well that the whole <UNK> <UNK> had just about run its race when they started work on this project in a way it was to be their <UNK> song and they were determined to let it all hang out they were tired of being treated like mere <UNK> in the high powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited over the <UNK> few years in short they wanted out and they were going to say a few things before they left br br history however has <UNK> the band let the critics be damned the <UNK> left behind some of the best most polished and successful pop records of the decade yes they had plenty of help but at the end of the day they stood in front of the studio <UNK> they <UNK> the movie and tv cameras and they did the <UNK> they were fun and just a little bit crazy but unlike some of their <UNK> they were never threatening you could safely introduce a monkey to your elderly aunt br br head probably borrows a bit too heavily from the beatles hard day's night but it's still worth another look for those who were around at the time or for younger who have the ability to appreciate its significance br br enjoy
<START> my wife and kids in my opinion is an absolute abc classic i haven't seen every episode but i still enjoyed it there are many episodes that i enjoyed one of them was where junior george o gore ii got his <UNK> license if you want to know why you'll have to have seen it for yourself before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen in <UNK> now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> this film had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie but it revealed incompetence at almost every level br br the presence of roger moore in the cast list is usually a sign that the movie is not going to be anything more than mediocre because moore always has lead roles and he can't act but this movie also had ian <UNK> and lee marvin in it and was based on a <UNK> smith book so i thought i'd give it a chance when i saw the dvd for sale in the bargain bin br br it was a mistake the opening scene appeared to start in the middle of a reel with sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been <UNK> the scene showed a at sea with a german crew this bad editing was a sign of things to come but the scene with the was interesting enough to keep me watching the special effects were good and the crew wore the proper uniforms and spoke in german <UNK> that the director at least paid attention to historical detail i was surprised br br so i kept watching and then moore appeared and my were confirmed bad acting clichéd lines clichéd cinematography and cheap humour but worst of all there is a disastrous attempt to blend the light hearted feel of the film with serious drama and tragedy it just does not work br br the film ends as suddenly and as badly as it started  in the middle of a reel
<START> there are bad movies movies that are horrible and then there's a tiny <UNK> body of movies that are so horribly bad that even after seeing them just once the sheer awfulness makes it impossible to forget them even decades later this is exactly such a movie and it's hard to believe that the original film in this series was actually quite good let's see george kennedy the <UNK> <UNK> tough guy mechanic of the original has somehow been promoted to <UNK> captain and after the <UNK> comes under missile attack don't ask he <UNK> to stunts like shooting a <UNK> gun out the <UNK> window despite presumably flying at <UNK> 2 all the while doing the sort of wild high g <UNK> <UNK> that would have ripped the wings off any real <UNK> never mind the effect of the passengers but the absolute worst part of the film at least to dedicated airplane buffs like myself is that this atrocity starred one of the coolest <UNK> and most <UNK> remarkable planes ever to fly the <UNK> or just plain <UNK> as its pilots refer to it deserved far better this abomination is the equivalent of taking a high class beauty like audrey hepburn and putting her in a <UNK> sequel thankfully the release of the ever hilarious airplane the following year brought the whole airport franchise to a well deserved halt as anyone even <UNK> a fifth installment would have been laughed to death by studios and movie fans alike br br 1 10
<START> i just want to say that this movie was excellent br br i loved it from the beginning until the end br br the acting was great the director did an amazing job and i would like to see it again br br jennifer <UNK> did a very good performance the guy that interpreted his father <UNK> was another great actor but i can not recall his name br br i can't wait for el <UNK> ii br br <UNK> looks so good and i think he is one of the most talented actors out there there is of latin actors that do a great job like it is shown in this film br br rent it rent it rent it
<START> i was lucky enough recently to see ingrid <UNK> name attached to a film i had never seen or even heard of on <UNK> what a stroke of luck br br to marvel at her flawless and <UNK> performance isn't the only reason to stay up late and watch this movie the writing is wonderfully comical and the performances are excellent br br walter <UNK> not my favorite was nearly perfect and goldie hawn <UNK> was fabulous tender at times demanding then just plain goofy there are times in the film that even the most hardened film viewer will get caught up in the story and forget that it is a movie br br that bergman can steal a dance scene among a crowd of 20 year olds was amazing to watch she is <UNK> in her return to the screen at age <UNK> the supporting cast was great and the lines the lines are exquisite br br a top 5 romantic comedy of all time
<START> very good political thriller regarding the aftermath of terrorism and the using of political torture to obtain one's <UNK> in <UNK> out the terrorists br br the story is <UNK> where two families are <UNK> affected by the terrorist events br br this is one of meryl <UNK> best roles in years she plays a cold <UNK> cunning director of the cia who allows these things to go on she is out of the george bush dick <UNK> school of handling the war on terrorism had her part been expanded miss streep certainly would have been up for an award at oscar time br br jake <UNK> is our hero a cia agent who really can't take what's going on br br we have a terrorist who actually has a heart and it costs him his life in this well directed finely paced film br br alan arkin appears briefly in the part of a conniving senator mr arkin seems to get better with age
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that x is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever seriously if i could have figured out some way to climb inside my video <UNK> i would have <UNK> pierre to within an inch of his life no one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid both at the same time except maybe <UNK> in emily <UNK> <UNK> heights after spending <UNK> minutes with pierre i need a large glass of <UNK> never have i been so angry at a main character ok having said that x is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes i've ever seen in any film which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking and i'm talking graphic here by the way x will beat the hell out of you though so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it
<START> i watched all three segments and am so disappointed in the story line spends so much time <UNK> duvall he does nothing else in the show and tommy lee jones would never be so weak as a young man unlikeable yes but weak never we never see how or why they go to back to <UNK> <UNK> which is a dirt hole in the original why would they ever leave austin where they are hero's for doing nothing during the whole movie i was rooting for blue duck by the end of the movie and he was totally miscast there is no warning about how many segments there are it just ends this mini series could have been somebody tragic it looked like it was directed by the parrot and the <UNK>
<START> how does david lynch do it unlike the <UNK> of thick black framed glasses wearing types and pretentious movie critics who praise his name i just don't see how this guy keeps getting paid to make such tripe how can lynch <UNK> together <UNK> footage from a failed tv pilot into a nonsensical poorly acted mess have critics rave about it actually include it on year's best lists br br i'm <UNK> if you're looking for a good film noir rent bound instead if you're looking for a good puzzle movie try <UNK> but beware of this over hyped stinker unless your idea of a fun night is throwing away 2 1 2 hours of your life 3 50 of your hard earned cash
<START> i had no expectations when seeing the movie because i was seeing it with a bunch of friends and had no idea what it was some parts were silly and some parts were lame but overall the movie was worth watching i like <UNK> looking women this movie has plenty of it the <UNK> do look really lame though
<START> i say remember where and when you saw this show because i believe if fox gives talk show a chance spike will be right up there with conan in a few years because like conan he is incredibly funny and seems to be just grateful at having his own show which adds to the humor br br the funniest bits spike has had so far are the idiot and comedy for <UNK> and if your not high and get what does that say about you br br in summary this show is funnier in 25 minutes than snl in an hour so lets hope talk show gets the attention it deserves such as an extra half hour more money and a band
<START> i watched this last night on sundance altman must be the most hit or miss director of note ever this show despite its star power is utterly non compelling and its political insights which i as a proud liberal in no way disagree with are shallow and clunky and seem ripped from the <UNK> of usa today despite the fact it's coming out of the mouth of someone as <UNK> as mario the drama as such is not very dramatic and the comedy is not funny the only points of interest really are seeing how new <UNK> live their lives and the loyalty of a cast and crew to a show that keeps <UNK> has some cult following from 1988 sometimes it seems like altman's sole contribution to cinema has been the art of having all your actors talk at once the effect of which is one feels <UNK> like they're a stranger at a wedding
<START> this trash version of romeo and <UNK> passes in manhattan in the present days romeo will <UNK> is an a hole and violent member of family <UNK> and juliet jane <UNK> is a sexy with beautiful legs and breasts and <UNK> girl of <UNK> family the <UNK> situations this romantic pair will face are very funny although being a cult movie <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> de <UNK> festival it is not recommended for all the audiences if the viewer is fan of peter jackson's former movies bad <UNK> toxic <UNK> body <UNK> and other trash movie he will certainly love this flick otherwise he will hate it since i belong to the first group my vote is eight br br
<START> cheaply <UNK> together of recycled film footage music and ideas this film cannot really be called well but for me when i watched it as a teenager it was quite amusing i didn't know battle beyond the stars before in retrospect it has got something nostalgic regarding the sf wave of the early eighties and the special effects of this time its trashy old fashioned look and its <UNK> provide a certain attraction to enjoy this movie i recommend to concentrate on the <UNK> relationship between the characters of vince <UNK> and david <UNK> in addition i liked the idea that a bunch of <UNK> discovers its heroic qualities after been <UNK> confronted with the challenge to take care of a child
<START> my architect is a great film about <UNK> <UNK> search for himself via the legacy of his famous architect father louis <UNK> dead since 1974 the film builds slowly but perfectly and what starts out as a seemingly lost identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love loss family and perhaps more importantly our life's work br br i had never heard of louis <UNK> prior to this film although i was vaguely familiar with some of his work through the words both good and bad of louis <UNK> colleagues you get a very good sense of what <UNK> must have felt as memories are <UNK> and stories <UNK> sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling <UNK> how to feel about his father as i listened to each <UNK> my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible sometimes in the span of a moment so you get a good feel for the <UNK> that emotions must have been riding br br the final sequence in <UNK> totally made the film for me the <UNK> of which the people of <UNK> spoke of louis <UNK> work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me and hopefully for <UNK> br br i think <UNK> <UNK> finally found what he was looking for
<START> plot br br a chair from ebay br br random people br br random people talk dude it's right i'm feeling it lets get married now br br if you are a hippie then you will love this movie you must be high or drunk otherwise you will question your life watching this junk br br this movie was clearly not thought out from the beginning to the end and the other comments are probably the crew padding the reviews if this wasn't aimed at my <UNK> i don't know what it is aimed for i found the plot everyday boring it's something that i would do and trust me it's not worth filming going on a <UNK> and filming half of the silence does not make a movie
<START> the fact that a film is on dvd doesn't guarantee that its quality is very good the fact that a film's quality is <UNK> doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it this review actually applies to 2 films paired on a single dvd br br the plots of these films are of little consequence they are of interest only to people who collect holmes films  anybody who merely wants a few of the better offerings would do well to purchase some of those made by jeremy brett  or in a <UNK> basil <UNK> there are a few other very good holmes films featuring good actors on a one shot basis  such as seven per <UNK> solution or private life of sherlock holmes in any event these films are considerably less <UNK> br br here we have a pair of films featuring some of the best actors to do holmes even if the results tend toward disappointing this appears to be the only disc with these films on it although deadly <UNK> appears by itself in the same version on other <UNK> br br sherlock holmes and the deadly <UNK> dates from <UNK> although it neither looks it nor sounds it some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produce by hammer studios not that hammer hasn't turned out some really schlock stuff but where christopher lee was concerned they usually did a better job the print a direct transfer from a rather worn 1 1 33 copy in black and white the quality of the color suggests the original may have been in color and the <UNK> ends of the film's aspect suggest it may originally have been 1 1 <UNK> or more br br the film is set in the early 20th century  not improbable since holmes was still working then and didn't actually die until 1957 however the script is not adapted from any actual doyle story it involves an egyptian <UNK> and professor <UNK> shows up as a world famous <UNK> as well as the prince of crime the plot is melodramatic and banal br br the biggest <UNK> of this film is that  for whatever <UNK> reason  hammer filmed it in germany it was nonetheless filmed in english it was then dubbed in german and then re dubbed in english so what you hear isn't lee nor any of the other original actors but a bunch of <UNK>  not that outside of lee i doubt anyone would know any of the other actors this is too bad since lee see his <UNK> of the <UNK> makes a quite decent holmes as it is his voice double is condescending and plain as bread <UNK> with no nor <UNK> br br the music for this film is primarily <UNK> in a possible attempt to be period too bad nobody thought of <UNK> as it is the music doesn't relate to what's happening on the screen and often is at odds with the action br br the other film is sherlock holmes and the <UNK> band from 1931 starring a young raymond massey the quality of the picture and sound is fully up to that of the <UNK> effort and in fact a bit better massey makes a quite respectable holmes although he certainly doesn't own the in the way <UNK> did and brett does the other <UNK> who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers the acting  as is true of many films of this period  owes a lot to the post victorian stage and to silent films br br it should be noted that while the deadly <UNK> is available on dvd by itself the <UNK> band is available only with the former film br br there is very little else to be said of this film the settings seem to be an odd combination of the <UNK> horse drawn <UNK> and the 1920s electronic devices such as a primitive taken altogether it's an interesting <UNK> and a sufficient to buy the dvd with the pairing rather than a dvd with deadly <UNK> only
<START> when i first saw <UNK> moore it was in the excellent series about silent films called hollywood there she was in 1980 her hair <UNK> <UNK> as it was in the <UNK> a <UNK> witty and charismatic elderly lady the very definition of presence then i saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like ella <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> then the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the scarlet letter and now here she is in the power and the glory giving a performance of <UNK> power working expertly alongside one of the talking <UNK> finest actors spencer tracy br br i found the movie a little lack <UNK> story wise but moore and tracy give such brilliant performances that the story hardly seems to matter both actors age from youth to old age in the course of the film and this is done mostly through acting alone with minimal make up and hair changes moore is almost <UNK> as the elderly wife and the scene where she finds out her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most <UNK> performed scenes i have ever seen she does most of the scene without dialogue which is where her silent acting experience gives her the edge even over tracy contrast this with her delightful comic playing in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and tracy is struggling to <UNK> to her astonishing what this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful it is that hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through its fingers and spend most of her life in retirement
<START> after visiting the museum in forth worth texas usa enjoying the art and the architecture also of the <UNK> modern art museum and having a delightful conversation with the <UNK> <UNK> lady i purchased this a dvd with rather high and was not disappointed in the least br br the <UNK> approach dramatic tension revealing interviews <UNK> footage and stunning architecture are also mixed in a coherent whole to explore the life of the late iconic louis i khan br br the documentary begins <UNK> classical music plays <UNK> are <UNK> with a <UNK> shadowy face <UNK> <UNK> letters <UNK> <UNK> a train window passing a backdrop landscape  a journey  focus and out of focus the search eventually <UNK> to an article in a newspaper khan reads from the front page of the new york times where his father is simultaneously praised as the best american architect alive and his death announced br br when i first read that <UNK> i have to admit i was looking for my own name i was his child too his only son i didn't know my father very well he never married my mother and he never lived with us  he died when i was eleven br br so years later this <UNK> son is still haunted by unclear <UNK> thoughts and feelings about his father who seems to be a great professional and public figure but who's <UNK> personal life escapes him and affects him to the point where he <UNK> to do something about it br br for years i <UNK> to be satisfied with the little pieces of my father's life i've been allowed to see but it wasn't enough i needed to know him i needed to find out who he really was so i set out on a journey to see his buildings and to find whatever there was left of him out there it would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questions br br so the documentary is two <UNK> by a slow <UNK> discovery of the world <UNK> architect we get to know 1 his ideas buildings and the <UNK> perspective and 2 his families <UNK> people's life he affected and the human perspective br br the dvd also offers added insight with a q a with the writer director and additional footage that includes such great louis i khan quotes as everything that everybody says is the truth it's their truth it might not be factual and a good idea that doesn't happen is no idea at all br br this movie is a journey of discovery self discovery and discovery of a man a great man yet a human <UNK> like all of us we get to know him through the eyes of an <UNK> and slightly bitter son but with the <UNK> and <UNK> to really explore without making easy conclusions and without judging br br by key interviews with people who <UNK> with him in various capacity we slowly put some pieces together until that final interview with this man from <UNK> who really seems to bring it back home with visceral and sensible comments br br brilliant architect brilliant documentary
<START> i just finished this movie and my only comment is oh wow jennifer <UNK> is ok as the <UNK> but <UNK> butler as the female dance <UNK> is pure sexual dynamite having watched her in <UNK> i was not prepared for the pure <UNK> <UNK> and raw sexual excitement she <UNK> onto the screen br br i gotta see this movie again if only for <UNK> butler as
<START> although i enjoy steve <UNK> work <UNK> the almighty like so many other overdone films turned out to be a lot worse than i hoped it would be br br this turned out to be a cheesy family movie the kind that employ famous comedian to improve their image but ultimately fail to deliver br br the usual <UNK> <UNK> humour is almost absent from the movie and though he did make me chuckle a few times there was nothing hilarious about him in <UNK> the almighty br br his 3 kids although were probably somehow important for a biblical character were really quite useless in the movie and terrible actors even his wife was somewhat of a third leg for such a simple storyline br br spending so much money on making a comedy was a huge mistake although <UNK> career might profit from this movie there's no real reason to go see it br br if only there was a little less of his family a little more of carell molly shannon and maybe some other snl cast it could have actually been a lot more entertaining br br 4 10 for a few chuckles here and there
<START> to <UNK> the previous <UNK> comments if you're a stooges fan avoid this one at all costs my basic question is being the experienced troopers of comedy that moe and larry were why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio columbia was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors this movie plays like someone who's giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard moe and larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant joe de rita despite his background in vaudeville is just not up to the job as a replacement for curly <UNK> or even joe <UNK> if that's who moe and larry had left to pick from they should have just closed up shop and enjoy their retirement years leaving us fans with better memories of far better films they had done earlier always leave them laughing is the <UNK> for comedy and always quit while you're on top hence <UNK> leaving the sitcom while right up there instead of sticking around for the inevitable decline
<START> okay i'll admit that if i didn't have kids i never would have seen this film and would never see it but considering all the rotten kids movies i have seen such as spy kids 2 or babe pig in the city this is a significant improvement and it had enough in it that i wasn't totally bored out of my skull or <UNK> suicide something i did repeatedly in the other two movies sure the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly but it is a kids film and compared with other films in the genre this is definitely better than average frankie and amanda actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after <UNK> at least on <UNK> or doing voice overs br br so if you are looking for a film to see with your kids you certainly could do a lot worse
<START> you know those movies that are so <UNK> bad that you have to laugh half <UNK> wasn't one of them which sounds good right but no it's not it's not a bad attempt at a horror movie that's fun to watch because it's lame or not well acted or has bad special effects or anything else like that no half <UNK> is just plain boring they don't even make an attempt to be scary until the last 20 minutes are so it's just kids running around in the african bush country and getting high off of elephant dung for the first 75 of the movie and it's not even funny the last 20 minutes though are hilarious i have no idea what happened but it was really fun to watch that cgi <UNK> rip out the throats of all of those white guys i couldn't tell apart anyway if you're in the mood for a bad horror movie don't rent this one because you'll go to sleep before they get to the fun stuff if you do accidentally rent this movie i'd recommend fast <UNK> to the end and skipping any scene that happens in daylight you won't miss anything you won't have any idea which character is which or exactly what is going on even if you do watch all of the back story
<START> no <UNK> is not a great movie br br it's not a good movie br br it is however an average movie with some good effects and a compelling storyline and of course <UNK> may it may actually be one of my favorite sf horror flicks for the very simple reason that they try to reason their way through the science of the space vampires how often do you see that not even in alien the sf horror flick of all time does science come into the story at all in <UNK> they are trying to make reason of an <UNK> world br br now do i think it's successful no i think the movie has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that hooper is <UNK> to keep <UNK> and on track and that the viewers have to focus on more than one <UNK> and there are one too many road <UNK> br br to be honest the movie is eye candy and fun to watch but there is great potential here for a superior remake to take a hold of what hooper was trying to do and really create a strong scary sf horror movie br br if the remake does happen however i demand that <UNK> may have a cameo
<START> this is a cute little french silent comedy about a man who <UNK> another that he can't stay in this castle for one hour due to its being haunted and once the guy enters the house it looks much more like a crazed fun house or maybe like the after effects of <UNK> while there are ghosts and <UNK> there is a weird <UNK> of animals odd special effects and gags as well it's awfully hard to describe but the visuals alone make the film worth seeing however understand that the self indulgent director also had many funny gags that totally fell flat and hurt the movie his camera tricks weren't so much <UNK> but annoying and stupid ignore these and keep watching it does get better the film is fast paced funny and worth seeing in particular i really liked watching the acting and <UNK> of max <UNK> he was so <UNK> and funny too bad he is virtually forgotten today for an interesting but very sad read check out the imdb biography on him
<START> jeff <UNK> wanted to makes fun of <UNK> so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it the twist is that instead of <UNK> old l ron <UNK> as the cult leader there's a centuries old space monster who turns his followers into vampires our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult his <UNK> is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the cult it doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing his blood the screaming was shot very cheaply on video and i just plain ugly the space monster which looks like a giant <UNK> cat that looks <UNK> mad and has no skin is alternately a clay <UNK> and a large scale <UNK> puppet both of which look awful the acting and writing are both terrible and the director doesn't even try to disguise the fact that this movie was made for nothing avoid this non scary pitiful little excuse
<START> any time a movie feature a dwarf or a midget in a prominent role the odds are 10 to 1 that the director threw him in because he didn't know what else to do to keep the movie interesting in this case the featured little guy isn't all that bad he manages to keep his dignity for most of his scenes except the part where he drags the leading man down the stairs of the <UNK> but the movie itself uses him like a <UNK> chew toy br br the problem here is a common one with low budget exploitation movies there's a <UNK> of a decent idea in here but the director and the screenwriter don't know how to develop it a good director would take the various story elements brain <UNK> mad doctors with secret <UNK> and a <UNK> car chases fist fights dim witted monstrous frankenstein style assistant mind control betrayal and conspiracy etc and make an exciting involving film full of cheap thrills and fun br br instead what we get here is a bunch of people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab then a cheesy operation where the patient <UNK> paint followed by some of the same people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab some more followed by another <UNK> of the initial group driving around and having an accident followed by a <UNK> escape scene that is mostly about a woman putting her shoes back on followed by a <UNK> chase the actual high point of the movie followed by a confusing series of events where everyone in the movie apparently escapes from everyone else followed by a lovely <UNK> in the countryside where everyone either chases <UNK> into attacks or escapes from everyone else again followed by well not much else br br somewhere in here is a scary <UNK> blonde dressed in white a well meaning heroic type who is sort of <UNK> good looking a three foot lab assistant a big <UNK> with a mass of <UNK> rubber <UNK> to one side of his face a kid who wonders into the middle of the movie to provide more of the frankenstein factor a brunette who sort of falls in love with the hero for no apparent reason and the mad doctor himself who must be the <UNK> man in the history of evil super villains because nothing goes according to his plan but things work out for him anyway and all because he remembered to stick an into the <UNK> brain at one point in the operation br br this was by no means the worst movie i've seen or even the worst exploitation movie i've seen or even the worst badly made exploitation movie i've seen but it just lies there <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to detail at every point and there is no real reason for even bad movie <UNK> to watch it
<START> the title is from a passage in the bible 28 28 let's just say it is taken horribly out of context but nonetheless that is where the title of this <UNK> movie <UNK> the other reviewers cover the plot details so i wont rehash but the husband who is a psychiatrist delivers a lecture on inferior function where he <UNK> how a person can meet another another person and they can experience a <UNK> crisis in their lives where they <UNK> to be masters of themselves and incapable of fair judgement he is saying this at the <UNK> at the exact moment as he lays eyes on <UNK> <UNK> in the audience the woman who will become his mistress not very subtle for showing that this is indeed what will happen to this poor man br br i think the whole premise of the movie is implausible and just didn't work here is an over the hill psychiatrist and we are to believe this young beautiful woman falls for him and comes between the happiness he and his wife shared what's even more implausible is how the betrayed wife responds when she learns of the infidelity not only is she understanding but she insists her husband <UNK> on a several month vacation with the tramp so we all can get a little relief from this unbearable stress give me a break i wanted to reach through the screen and <UNK> not just the <UNK> but the dim wit wife br br the fact that the whole movie takes place as a flashback after already revealing the end of the movie at the beginning the fact that the husband had a terrible accident it leaves no doubt as to the outcome of the <UNK> affair i think this was a poor decision as it leaves absolutely no plot twists to look forward to as the whole movie is completely predictable you already know the wife's <UNK> to the affair at the beginning of the film as she <UNK> the mistress to the dying man's <UNK> and expresses no ill will towards her br br not only is the script <UNK> but <UNK> coward is horribly miscast even though it is his screenplay he and <UNK> have absolutely no chemistry on screen whatsoever its interesting that michael redgrave was originally cast in that role but was replaced during filming i wonder what that was about in the end neither the husband or the wife cause you to feel any sympathy for either one of them i do think margaret <UNK> played the part of <UNK> quite well but she couldn't possibly overcome all the <UNK> this film had also as is the case of many british productions of this era the dialogue is hard to understand due to the <UNK> fast speech pattern of the actors i saw it on tv and couldn't even rely on closed <UNK> to fill in the <UNK> for me br br don't waste your time on this one
<START> i first saw this film in <UNK> when it first came out and i was <UNK> by it it is a passionate and deeply moving work that should be experienced by all <UNK> of motion picture art what a shame that it has never been released in dvd format perhaps one of these days that will be <UNK> as it would be a shame indeed if one of the best films ever made was forgotten and left to fade away in some film vault forever br br why is it that <UNK> movies like <UNK> <UNK> and get widescreen and <UNK> releases and often a special edition with multiple <UNK> and extras while great art pieces like 'the <UNK> are all but forgotten
<START> lucio fulci a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety ill <UNK> tries his hand at black humour in touch of death a made for tv movie about lester parsons brett <UNK> a psycho who <UNK> and murders rich <UNK> in order to pay his gambling <UNK> br br starting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal <UNK> <UNK> of his latest victim via chainsaw <UNK> machine and hungry <UNK> touch of death starts <UNK> enough but fulci soon loses control of proceedings introducing a weird sub plot involving a mysterious <UNK> killer and some heavy handed scenes there are several more graphic murders which in true fulci fashion are extremely violent and gruesome but even the high level of <UNK> doesn't stop this from being one of <UNK> <UNK> efforts br br as i have found with many of his other movies a <UNK> storyline is not exactly high on the agenda when lucio is behind the camera this film has many <UNK> which left me more than little <UNK> why didn't lester <UNK> all of his victims using the <UNK> method seen at the beginning why are all of his victims either hairy or <UNK> what the hell is that ending all about br br fulci is considered by many to be one of the of horror cinema i don't understand his popularity finding the majority of the films of his that i have seen so far to be generally lacking both decent <UNK> and technical <UNK> touch of death certainly does nothing to change my opinion
<START> <UNK> main criticism of this film namely that macy suddenly looks jewish upon <UNK> his glasses is misplaced the glasses are just the little bit of change needed to convince others he's a jew the scene in which he says to his boss <UNK> but you know what my background is along with another discussion with his mother suggests that he's had to fight this same <UNK> in the past the glasses now make him look just jewish enough to confirm his and co <UNK> existing <UNK> then there is his new wife's large nose and taste for loud clothes which of course means she's jewish the whole point of the film is how those little stereotypical <UNK> become the entire basis for judging others br br if he has a <UNK> he must be gay if he has long hair he <UNK> <UNK> if he's hispanic he's got a knife and if he has round black glasses and he's slight of build he must be jewish those statements all sound equally im plausible to me if the conclusion people were jumping to in focus was reasonable the whole point of the story would be lost
<START> this movie was a pleasant surprise for me in all honesty the previews looked horrible up until the point where emma thompson and alan <UNK> appeared so i rented it with <UNK> but i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it had great acting a few good plot twists and of course emma thompson and alan <UNK> it's definitely worth checking out
<START> based on the book space vampires by colin wilson this is in my humble opinion one of the best pieces of sci fi horror to come out of the eighties the effects done by <UNK> still hold up by todays standards the actors are mostly british and being british seem to give this film a greater depth of realism br br the film was <UNK> by the critics and sadly failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the atlantic tobe hooper blamed the <UNK> work that was done before its release as the main cause for it's low but for whatever reason it still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent film with a great cast and well paced plot br br not to be over looked
<START> this movie gives golf a high mark it was well acted and well directed giving you a view of history that some non sports fans will enjoy the historic factor alone gives it a high rating the golf course was really done well i am in the <UNK> and have seen as a fan and as someone who loves the game the movie was well done on all levels a must see 5 stars the acting was superb disney has another winner in its bag of great movies if for no other reason watch the film to give hope and <UNK> to young people whom may not see the hope in their life i would tell you that the setting while in the late <UNK> and early <UNK> is very realistic the costumes and <UNK> were right on the mark as well above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film a must see for fans and non fans alike
<START> rita hayworth is just stunning at times and for me the only reason to watch this silly film despite the overdone 1940s <UNK> rita was one of the all time <UNK> women of hollywood in fact for a couple of years i can't imagine anyone that looked better except maybe elizabeth taylor in her prime br br anyway the co star of the show gene kelly does not play his normal likable at least the kind of guy we all know him from in <UNK> in the rain here kelly's danny <UNK> <UNK> much of the time phil <UNK> who i loved on tv at sgt <UNK> is so stupid in here as genius you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokes and they are stupid br br the visuals are good with great technicolor which almost looks terrific you get to see a lot of pretty women in here too not just hayworth unfortunately the story isn't all that much it centers around hayworth deciding about a career choice along the way we get the normal <UNK> treatment of marriage and we get an <UNK> dumb ending all in all an <UNK> film except as a showcase for <UNK> beauty
<START> during production this series was titled to the <UNK> a title that everyone on set at the time thought was cheesy enough then word came through that it had been <UNK> for the <UNK> as if this the addition of this new word would evoke heavy <UNK> meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters this same heavy handed lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the very fabric of the entire series and the same tired and boring love triangle storyline is actually stretched out over 7 episodes any television program that decides to use the <UNK> storyline for even a single episode is pushing it but to <UNK> it over seven episodes is unforgivable there are reasons to watch however with the scenery of the <UNK> of <UNK> certainly providing a beautiful setting and the seemingly <UNK> performance of <UNK> hitting all the right comedy marks this however is not enough a number of performances are noticeable especially when placed against the static and <UNK> <UNK> which jonathan <UNK> refers to as his face i have already mentioned <UNK> in the role of <UNK> yes thats as far as character development and back story goes but i was impressed by the actor maurice <UNK> who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast having appeared in everything from classic movies such as richard <UNK> <UNK> what a lovely <UNK> and 'the eagle has and tv including <UNK> city the bill <UNK> cheers doctor who in the 80s star trek and even going to hollywood with stallone in judge <UNK> whose performance reminded me very much of actual teachers i have met often incapable men whose lives are <UNK> with a very sad streak it is refreshing to see that <UNK> is still getting work having also appeared in the 1998 british film 'the acid <UNK> and even more recently alongside the wonderful maria <UNK> and sean bean in 'the <UNK> the standout reason to watch this series even though his appearances are very few another actor who tries his hardest to elevate the program is ben miles in the role of the sex mad <UNK> man' brother once again what an original character as with <UNK> the <UNK> says it all after <UNK> this miles has since appeared in the hollywood movie for and the 2001 star <UNK> film 'the affair of the alongside brian cox <UNK> <UNK> christopher walken and jonathan <UNK> unfortunately the fairly capable actors i have mentioned are <UNK> to relatively small roles in comparison to the dramatic <UNK> that is <UNK> and todd both of whom seem to have been in <UNK> for too long and haven't yet learned to act even the tolerable frances grey is made to suffer in the presence of such <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and unfortunately for her the lasting memory i have of her from the set is of the ad asking for another take of a relatively complex shot because during the take she <UNK> her <UNK> out of her crack ' familiar faces appear in each episode child actors from <UNK> programs and dramas such as point 4 <UNK> and other <UNK> from commercials such as mr ben's they'll remember me for this <UNK> 'the <UNK> and others that i don't even want to remember each episode tries to with such as teenage <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and rocket building things that <UNK> hill was doing better when my parents were young overall this series was a disappointment and a wasted opportunity to craft a genuinely interesting and well developed drama series unfortunately for them they took the easy route both in the writing and for the most part in the casting i would recommend both <UNK> and 'the <UNK> to fans of good drama the latter in particular which managed to achieve this if you like the <UNK> of <UNK> don't for the <UNK> reach for the holiday <UNK> instead it probably contains more character development
<START> this was <UNK> first all talking picture and the results are mixed the movie is a biting satire of hitler and <UNK> their henchmen and their <UNK> way of life especially regarding the <UNK> of the jews it was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people <UNK> br br when compared to <UNK> earlier works this is quite pale in comparison the sweet funny style of his <UNK> in my opinion is far superior to his first <UNK> there are lots of meaningless bits that drag on if this was a silent it probably would not have happened br br i find one of the funniest moments to be the musical <UNK> moment and the globe dance one of the most touching moments is obviously the speech at the end br br the great dictator is an effective and at times moving film that is a very big part of both <UNK> history and movie history it is flawed but chaplin is in great form
<START> ok firstly if your not a fan of the whole low budget horror genre then don't bother with this you really need to be a fan to get the gag br br the move is basically about snakes on a train lots of them br br there is an ancient curse involved and a crazy ending which i wont spoil the gore effect are full on and real <UNK> but the movie is mainly one big gory gag about snakes <UNK> the hell out of a bunch of people trapped on a train br br the suspense is built up well and there are some memorable and well composed scenes some of the acting is a bit hammy watch for the surf <UNK> but thats not really the point give this movie a go know what to expect and you wont regret it
<START> go to the video store and get the original i do not understand why hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign movie and remake it mostly martha or <UNK> martha has a much better cast beginning with the heroine <UNK> who convinced me much more in the role of the work obsessed <UNK> than the more famous catherine zeta jones to the italian cook and the niece suddenly <UNK> of her mother and forced to live with an aunt not fit for child br br in many ways the american version of the movie is a copy of the german original they just <UNK> the actors however they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and not very believable to <UNK> a father for the little girl in an american context br br i was thinking about that maybe the father could have been puerto <UNK> or cuban or mexican well there are so many guest workers in the u s take your pick but i doubt that any of them would have shown up to shoulder the responsibility as the italian father did in the original therefore the american movie leaves that part out but keeps the italian cook and by doing this the whole story changes in the original martha is so removed from reality that she thinks it is okay to send her niece off with a complete stranger in a foreign country br br the american martha is <UNK> and therefore the movie is <UNK> and does not have that edge the german movie has br br in the original the italian cook is not so good looking but much more charming the little girl is more of a brat but much more believable and martha is more representative of a career woman in today's world than the watered down version we are presented in the american version and the whole opera music in the american version was very annoying i loved the italian songs in the original and bought the cd br br hollywood recognized that mostly martha was a great movie maybe the distribution companies should have put it in more theaters or it should have been shown in english without subtitles in any case the original is so much better by the way this reminds me of another remake shall we dance is one of my favorites in the original japanese version and totally forgettable in the american version
<START> if you're even mildly interested in the war between the states this film is worth watching it is great historical story telling no flashing <UNK> no <UNK> charges no carnage just the story of a sorry group of union soldiers stumbling into the farm of a <UNK> woman and her son and taking as much as their <UNK> conscience allows this <UNK> moves up and down as events unfold affecting his sense of humanity in conflict with his sense of duty to his men and his cause ultimately he reaches a compromise that any of us would be hard put to top br br i appreciate the historical treatment of the war in kentucky a slave state that tried to stay neutral but eventually <UNK> to remain in the union under mysterious political circumstances involving the <UNK> of certain roughly half the soldiers from kentucky fought for each side but there's never been much treatment of what it was like to have lived there through those times this film makes a great contribution simply in the look and feel of the time and place
<START> another indian legend you never heard of before is let loose as the name implies this is a vengeful <UNK> who likes to <UNK> the <UNK> of people while they're still using them as usual ancient burial grounds can you say <UNK> have been disturbed by clichéd greedy land <UNK> building stuff br br the cgi if it had been better might have made the effect more <UNK> looking but they <UNK> on the budget and it shows to comical effect the unleashed creature probably should have been kept off stage during its first several killings that might have added some mystery or impending doom atmosphere but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looks like and it wasn't impressive the deaths are just poorly done again with shoddy cgi i guess ancient spirits always kill by using cheap special effects as for the victims they look they're going to laugh any moment while they do goofy screams it's always obvious who's going to get it a character with only a few lines shows up strange noises are heard cgi <UNK> fly exit character repeat several times br br still there's a few chase scenes featuring the monster that actually made this thing watchable unfortunately the director seems to be using these as a device to fall back on so it's used too often when he can't think of anything else for his characters to do overall it's pretty silly but i've seen worse this flick is cheap but it's oddly fun to watch
<START> poorly directed short film shot on hi <UNK> or <UNK> it appears it screams student film video all the way the premise is limited in scope and the short actually feels a lot longer than it runs some interesting acting moments and some decent production value but not enough to lift this film from the hole it has fallen into
<START> despite this being one of john cusack and <UNK> moore's early films it is one even hardcore fans can miss unless they absolutely have to complete the collection i have rare moments where i can handle better off dead but this movie is ultimately worse i am just not a savage steve holland fan and he did both movies so if you don't like the cheesy random comedy and amateur animation steer clear of this one <UNK> even for the <UNK> moore fans she can't sing and the 80s <UNK> did not save her there are too many predictable twists and too easy jokes i suppose if you want mindless entertainment or something you can leave on in the background and ignore while you do something <UNK> then go for it otherwise don't watch this movie if john cusack or <UNK> moore couldn't save it you know it's got to be bad they are the only reason i didn't give this movie a 1
<START> i love watching the <UNK> mile i mean watching peter <UNK> run the mile is like watching <UNK> <UNK> the 100 <UNK> i think peter <UNK> is a excellent actor and should do another running movie he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing no man alive can out race rain murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him i've watched the <UNK> mile of times and will watch it more great movies get watched more than movies that are not i thank the makers of this film for giving years of there lives to make it they are great people and i bless them all thank you for letting me get my word out again thank you all
<START> hilarious clean light hearted and quote worthy what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie ever since i was a little girl i've <UNK> of <UNK> a blue van with flames and an observation bubble br br the cliché characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen <UNK> harold and andy <UNK> make up most of my favorite parts of the movie and who didn't love the hopeless <UNK> of don't forget the airport antics of <UNK> <UNK> dressed up as <UNK> dancing <UNK> and playing the <UNK> <UNK> the clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless br br a word to the wise if you didn't watch this film when you were little it probably won't win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do you've gotta play
<START> the daily christopher had some choice things to say about this film among them watch it all the way through its <UNK> miserable minutes and i guarantee you'll be shaking your head and asking <UNK> we really <UNK> to this ' yes we have for if ever a movie <UNK> to the utter cynicism <UNK> and moral corruption of those who <UNK> and make british movies it is this abomination continues aimed <UNK> at <UNK> with <UNK> underwear filthy minds and <UNK> that the <UNK> when they walk this sex comedy is so <UNK> unfunny and that it is enough to put you off sex and indeed films for life before <UNK> sex lives of the <UNK> men is not merely a truly vile film it is <UNK> of a new national culture of instant self <UNK> and <UNK> that is now being celebrated on screen normally i don't listen too closely to the critics but in this case was bang on the money this film goes beyond bad indeed it goes beyond being merely unfunny and enters some bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for an hour and where the definition of <UNK> seems to be <UNK> t in a <UNK> it's depressing to anyone with half a brain who grew up with the <UNK> monty python spitting image not the nine <UNK> news and <UNK> towers br br <UNK> sex lives of the <UNK> men would have quietly <UNK> after its cinema release and joined the equally dire spin off the fat <UNK> 2004 and the ill starred all saints vehicle honest 2000 in the celluloid graveyard but as it seems destined for endless late night schedule filling <UNK> and misguided best film ever <UNK> from people who should know better so i must <UNK> in advance for trying to right a wrong that the british film industry in all its wisdom has inflicted onto an <UNK> world yes i really am sorry to bring this one back from the celluloid dead but i actually remember thinking it can't be as bad as the critics said it was but as god is my witness it was worse br br acting dire from start to finish special mention to <UNK> legs on a young man's <UNK> crook br br soundtrack cut and <UNK> mostly <UNK> based <UNK> <UNK> friendly pub <UNK> <UNK> which brought back horrible memories of seeing those <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> walk to a watered down imitation of the <UNK> <UNK> madness on every single comedy variety programme in the eighties and <UNK> of by <UNK> as the title music what the hell trying to evoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes ever offered by the young ones indeed ever offered by any comedy show cheap shot way below the belt br br script written by a 12 year old who's just read every single back issue of <UNK> and <UNK> in one long red bull <UNK> session surely c'mon no real proper <UNK> grown up person could possibly set this kind of retarded <UNK> on paper and mark <UNK> was in it mark <UNK> the least annoying member of the league of gentlemen and <UNK> fan taking part in such a <UNK> heap of fly blown cinematic <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> british comedy <UNK> not any more he's not on the subject of league of gentlemen somebody give me a pair of lead <UNK> <UNK> boots and steve <UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> and a long weekend in a room before i die please br br cinema british or otherwise just doesn't come much worse than this kent the <UNK> eyes 1971 is a new wave masterpiece compared to this <UNK> <UNK>
<START> have wanted to see this for a while i never thought i'd be watching it in a <UNK> square london with 15 000 other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boys br br quickly that experience specifically a new departure from it seemed to suffer from the same problem the hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der <UNK> the long structure was a chain of short ones i e songs produced a more fluid integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms neither could they resist song a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing <UNK> on the action of the <UNK> steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was i'd go so far to say <UNK> overall it was very exciting though which is surely what <UNK> was trying to achieve br br it is a very exciting film with editing taking the place of <UNK> of tension or action in fact the film though beautifully shot and <UNK> acted it has a silent film melodrama but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style <UNK> through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in and there's a huge range of perspective too either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time br br super film which can be <UNK> <UNK> of sound as that's how the finished product would have been conceived 8 10
<START> i'm a big fan of <UNK> even though i haven't watched every episode or read every manga br br i really liked the first <UNK> movie and to tell you the truth i was a little nervous that this one wouldn't be as good or action packed as the first mainly because this one in australia only had a pg instead of an m which is a pg 13 us or 12 uk but i was wrong thankfully the animation was more improved although some drawings of the characters at points looked rushed and was very good especially in the fight scenes br br speaking of that let's talk about the fight scenes the animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining i especially enjoyed the battle with and the fight with fighting the shape shifting female warriors all the characters you want are here <UNK> <UNK> and if only was in the movie could save her from the female warriors in dramatic fashion and maybe they could have a passionate kiss in my summary at the top i say that this more as a piece of cinema than just an extended episode and it does the action is very cinematic and the animation quality looks very fancy especially during the fighting overall this is a excellent anime film that is a must see for any <UNK> fan 5 5 10 10 50 50 100 100 alright i'll stop
<START> i can't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the imdb website have i been <UNK> with the special edition <UNK> version edited by produced by bernard <UNK> this film should be <UNK> in i'm sorry for all the uk <UNK> references but if you're elsewhere and you've got no <UNK> to cut or you haven't got a beer <UNK> collection to <UNK> then this film might just be worth 90 mins of your remaining <UNK> as long as you haven't got any paint to watch <UNK> the plot has more holes than a pair of <UNK> <UNK> and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham <UNK> what on earth is <UNK> doing in this film
<START> this is a thoroughly enjoyable well acted film it is funny and sometimes hilarious the finale is a bit disappointing since it tries to wrap everything up into too neat a package the film is better remembered for its priceless vignettes the jane austen staging the camping trip as examples b h does not attempt to mirror the <UNK> attitudes toward homosexuality and <UNK> most of the characters are quite accepting of sexual diversity in that sense it is a <UNK> vacation from <UNK> society and it is a celebration of a <UNK> a <UNK> of rigid sexual categories perhaps a happy <UNK> of things to come
<START> this is a movie with an excellent concept for a story but that got <UNK> but a large number of clichéd sub plots hackneyed and unrealistic portrayed characterizations and performances and some frankly implausible and highly <UNK> and not to mention convenient as plot points to move the story to its <UNK> finish br br the lack of anything that marked the lead as actually gay other than some <UNK> references to crow bar or that he's gay was <UNK> it wouldn't have hurt to actually show him do something even if it was just meet a friend for drinks br br it's worth checking out and has it's merits there isn't much even now a few years after the movie was released in the way of movies that feature both a lead that is gay or a significant gay plot line and that is also about african americans for that it's worth checking out i wouldn't look too hard for it and i wouldn't waste my time looking for it to own this is a rental and not a <UNK> rental at that
<START> this movie wasn't good i thought it'd be a cute disney movie just like the original wrong it was awkward for christina <UNK> whom i expect so much more than this you could just tell by watching i think doug e doug did the best he could sit 5 year olds in front of the this any older and they might start to fall asleep
<START> julia catherine mary stewart is working hard to become a doctor suddenly julia finds herself the guardian of her young niece amanda after her parents are found murdered julia has a new neighbor the mysterious kevin finney rob lowe her <UNK> life comes crashing down when it becomes apparent that the young amanda holds the key to a terrible secret for she too is now the target of the killers julia must discover whether kevin is friend or <UNK> and <UNK> the sinister mystery before the murderer strikes again according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br this thriller quietly falls apart at the <UNK> but it is interesting some of the time stalker sean <UNK> background <UNK> scene outside the police station and mr <UNK> <UNK> restaurant are <UNK> played but early on it's difficult not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers <UNK> twists his foot in some red paint at the murder scene unfortunately this is not an intricate plot point and there are worse story stumbles <UNK> overall dead silent is not a bad way to spend some time if there is nothing better on or you're into lowe and his co stars br br dead silent 1999 roger <UNK> catherine mary stewart rob lowe <UNK> stewart larry day
<START> wow the french are really getting the hang of it if we look at their first <UNK> movie we see a good story with nice actors especially thanks to gerard <UNK> but very lame special effect in a fantasy story like <UNK> special effects are really important well they did it right this time it looks terrific i think mission <UNK> is the best <UNK> story ever written in the movie there's not one moment you're bored go and watch this one thing they didnt go exactly by the script which i think is a little bit for example in the comic breaks the nose of the <UNK> <UNK> all the little <UNK> start breaking of the nose of their <UNK> <UNK> really funny to see well they didnt put it in the movie instead they the nose under the <UNK> <UNK> they will never look for it here guess again was funny but not as good as the original another thing i disliked about the movie was their choice for music it <UNK> the film to but never the less it's a must c br br da jean holland
<START> i enjoyed this movie okay it just could have been so much better i was expecting more action than what i got which was more of a comedy than anything else granted it was serious in parts and it had a good fight scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all which is hard to do with a vampire movie a vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another his sister is going through a difficult break up but she is being pursued by a vampire of all things granted this vampire is rather nice and not into sucking blood so that is all there is really to it except for a plot of another vampire after certain royal vampires so he can gain ultimate power some of the problems with this movie is that its plot went here and there and the movie had a very uneven flow to it that and it seemed to shift genres a bit much too one minute action the next pure comedy however the girls were cute there is good action the comedy was worthy of a chuckle or two and jackie chan makes a rather energetic appearance or two this movie probably just needed more development in some areas such as the villain who is basically not really explored at all so for a movie with a few good fights and a chuckle or two this is rather good though why was it rated r i have seen stuff we have made that is pg 13 that is a lot worse than this

simmons who plays merit rival for her affections it is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress as <UNK> inept as <UNK> whose only <UNK> was that she was the mistress of the producer

<START> i love juan <UNK> <UNK> he's my absolute favorite bad movie director and throughout his whole career he <UNK> tried to cash in on simply every successful contemporary trend in the horror and fantasy genres after the big hit that was superman j p made his own and hilarious <UNK> man he picked in on the violent slasher movie madness with the insane pieces and he really over <UNK> himself with the return of e t the <UNK> and downright laughable sequel to spielberg's sf blockbuster the <UNK> is obviously inspired by the series of <UNK> underwater monster movies like the <UNK> and six from start to finish you can <UNK> yourself by <UNK> all the stolen ideas and shameless rip offs of these and other classics when a completely new and fancy type of submarine <UNK> near the deep <UNK> a second mission with u boat designer hayes on board is sent out to investigate what really happened to <UNK> one in the dark depths of the ocean the rescue mission discovers an underwater <UNK> where the government secretly experiments with mutant sea creatures the monsters are quite aggressive but there's also the danger of a government enemy among the crew members the <UNK> is a forgettable film but it nevertheless has some ingenious  though very dodgy  monster models fans of blood and gore won't complain neither as the <UNK> attacks are quite gruesome and <UNK> the acting is very wooden although many of the cast names can definitely do better it's <UNK> that you simply enjoy the clichés and gory effects in the the <UNK> because if you start <UNK> about the screenplay you'll find that it makes absolutely no sense
<START> okay i really tried to tap into the so called silly surreal humor that this film sets out to be i'm told that the japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one <UNK> to america go figure and has less political references apart from all that i found this sexual political farce just as boring and pointless as standard porn the central female lead is easy on the eyes and could actually act i would love to see her in a non pink film where she could actually <UNK> her acting <UNK> and no not the ones you're thinking of it's obvious that japan can and does produce just as much crap as other countries i couldn't recommend this to anyone with the distant possibility of someone who has a jones for asian porn go see a real japanese film
<START> this movie is everything but the true story of <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> claims are <UNK> by the fact that he made the entire movie without even once meeting <UNK> on whose life this movie is supposed to be based the excuse being that meeting the woman would have <UNK> with director's conception of the story the film wastes the opportunity of the society of the plight of low <UNK> women in the indian society and ends up as a stereotype portraying <UNK> as an angry woman whose sole motivation is revenge no wonder this <UNK> <UNK> film was successful in the west as it <UNK> to their non bollywood tastes
<START> <UNK> is the one sci fi show which <UNK> the interest in science fiction in me br br but <UNK> is so much more then plain and simple sci fi comedy drama and much more the acting is very good luckily <UNK> survived also it's <UNK> and showed with wars that it is not dead yet i hope there is a future for <UNK> in my opinion it is also not <UNK> that some of the characters in the show are muppets you have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty <UNK> is br br <UNK> set a new standard in television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than <UNK> i love this show br br
<START> i'm not sure this film could ever match the first one even if it starred the original seven notwithstanding the fact that four were killed it just doesn't have the spark and chemistry all the actors seem tired and look as if they are just going through the motions to get their <UNK> br br it's interesting how <UNK> <UNK> is magnificent in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel yet when he stars in <UNK> and <UNK> in the 1970s his character in the same matching black pants shirt and hat evokes the same mystery and presence of the 1960 film's chris adams br br there's nothing in this 1966 flick to make it worth watching even on cable
<START> the time i wasted seeing this movie i demand back i felt sick afterward but not because it touched me in any way it's pretentious trying to get the audience to feel bad for the people involved but i couldn't care less the characters are soulless and stupid you don't get an explanation for some of the scenes and it doesn't leave any thoughts afterward to come up with your own explanation all of the students in the movie has issues but since you don't feel for them you don't believe their problems br br if i could write better in english i'd never stop but i can't so i'll stop now br br don't watch this
<START> i saw the episode about living on minimum <UNK> it went as far as an oprah appearance for the said episode it's bad enough people struggle making ends meet week to week then having this <UNK> <UNK> the problem i didn't appreciate the constant complaining from him or his significant other throughout is how any people have the power to pay their medical bills from the er sure he shows that the bill is high but he paid the remaining balance from his own pocket after <UNK> from his harrowing experience how many poor people have that type of <UNK> after 30 days to pay off their bills instead they are starving and robbing peter to pay paul complaining throughout the episode isn't a <UNK> thing for him the movie and restaurant scene is appalling another <UNK> he has that poor people don't

<START> i suppose for <UNK> this film was supposed to be cool but looking back now 45 years it's charm was just as silly as it's entertainment value granted the special effects do well on t v with the series that started in 1964 but for the big screen i once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting i must agree about the <UNK> scene near the end where it attached itself to the obviously not well staged or trained overall it's pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and i still do recommend it for fun laughs sake this was probably one of irwin allen's biggest films and i think he thought a lot of it <UNK> went on to play genie on t v micheal was her husband now that is a cool part about this film i always enjoyed seeing real life husband and wife teams star in the same movie neat
<START> can u believe a college professor made this film br br the same man who made br br the film is horrible and has some of the weird scenes ever br br the main message is nice but presented badly br br the film looks like a <UNK> of amateurish scenes etc and bad performances br br direction and everything is poor br br music is okay br br naughty streak works and he does well <UNK> is bad <UNK> and <UNK> are bad <UNK> <UNK> when he looks at the mirror

<START> some might remember if having seen the film <UNK> a scene where ellen page has a moment of praise for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her favorite horror film jason character then asks if she's ever seen a <UNK> gordon lewis film and to wit he has a copy of a movie i forget which at the moment and shows it to her at the time i saw <UNK> i had seen <UNK> and a few <UNK> films but not lewis now i can see that it's not just another one of <UNK> <UNK> pop culture in references but something that actually is an <UNK> on the tastes of the characters and maybe more <UNK> how to judge them based on their tastes in other words <UNK> gordon <UNK> reputation is <UNK> some many years after he ended making his gore films and it's that of a schlock <UNK> no more no less actually less br br it's interesting then to take <UNK> as a basis of comparison because both filmmakers approach at least in the case of the gore gore girls and well any given <UNK> picture similar material where <UNK> is extraordinarily conscious about his craft getting an audience wrapped up in whatever little story there is by the power of the movement of camera and music and style lewis takes the easy route to get at an audience which is with an immature script and putting it lightly lackluster direction the gore gore girls reveals a filmmaker who isn't interested in entertaining his audience in an actual compelling way as a horror film but as a side show or a <UNK> he can't direct actors worth a damn he lights like it's a porno movie and for every one possibly clever or funny one liner there's ten that either totally stink or are too clever by half or not clever nearly enough br br that being said perhaps as the best <UNK> thing to say about the gore gore girls a mystery movie about a detective 2nd rate sherlock holmes guy played by somewhat amusing frank and a newspaper reporter amy farrell investigating a series of murders of go go dancers is that it serves as the <UNK> for countless more troma style pictures perhaps this is faint praise however and really the best thing that can truly be said is that <UNK> <UNK> take my wife please has a few scenes and steals every one of them without having to try much it's sad since it could be the kind of picture that could entertain on an <UNK> bad level but even on that score one may laugh more out of embarrassment for the production some of the actors i e that guy who plays the cop my god than out of some guilty pleasure enjoyment br br even the gore itself is somewhat of a letdown at first one thinks that lewis is at least delivering on this end showing these women being murdered in crazy and vicious and exaggerated ways but with the killings it all goes on longer than necessary i don't mean this in terms of shock value for that it's fine but there needs to be something else to really make it stick that showing women's faces <UNK> and eyes <UNK> is fine if you're 12 and seeing this as one of you're first <UNK> films it becomes dare i say it dull dangerously dull for such a daring so called movie br br this was <UNK> last film until 30 years later an apparently worthy <UNK> song came with a sequel to a film he made earlier brought him out of his retirement from movies and job in writing books on how to make it in business however whatever experience he had coming up to this one doesn't show it's not a failure but it could have been and it's just simply schlock take it or leave it
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen completely ridiculous the story is bad the animations are completely childish and <UNK> the physics of the <UNK> are hilarious from how much they are completely wrong <UNK> i even wanna believe that this film has disney label on it <UNK> the actresses are somewhat beautiful but there are so many good films with astonishing actresses that are far more valuable to see than this one final remark bad film don't bother to watch it if you're looking for films to see with your kids consider other <UNK> like monster inc or an enchanted story on theaters seriously
<START> the world now seems to be in an odd stage of <UNK> in which objects such as dvd and cd players are <UNK> in size it is obviously much <UNK> to have a smaller <UNK> than a larger one this is not so with theater screens as is the case with the <UNK> the enormous widely known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release and to this day as long as the <UNK> right br br the main problem with <UNK> walking on the moon 3d is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage it is dull <UNK> and relentlessly eager to please and <UNK> us with its corny special effects and inspiring quotes from famous names such as neil armstrong and buzz <UNK> another problem with the film is that it doesn't even take the time to sit down and interview those lucky few who have had such an extraordinary experience as to have been to the moon instead the writers have simply pressed copy and <UNK> and hired famous voices such as morgan freeman bill paxton and matt damon to imitate their famous quotes this <UNK> is <UNK> repetitive and tedious br br i'd say without one <UNK> <UNK> that i didn't learn one piece of information from the film that i didn't already know br br and it repeatedly insisted on irritating the crap out of me with its <UNK> sentimentality every three minutes there seems to be a cue for tom <UNK> voice to say something like without the <UNK> of these brave men and women watching the film is like watching a bad commercial for forty <UNK> minutes br br 1 4

<START> <UNK> the school is a result of a new trend in turkish cinema having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas of course it doesn't mean that they are all grand i think <UNK> is one of them it is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not it is not successful on being scary either so what is it actors are so average especially <UNK> is pretty annoying with the teacher role i am sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder maybe <UNK> on one topic such as making it scary or vice versa but directors have missed the target this time out of
<START> mike <UNK> in finest form i was not a fan of closer so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances just one slip in tone could have <UNK> this compelling picture but <UNK> and his very strong a list cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling <UNK> br br philip seymour hoffman as usual is <UNK> and brilliant here playing a damaged but ultra smart cia <UNK> and it is in the <UNK> between hanks and <UNK> characters where the comedy <UNK> rarely is movie humour laugh out loud and also smart this hits the spot time after time with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and <UNK> at the state of the world often simultaneously br br one other major plus is the length of the picture the film is based on george fat book of the same title the temptation for screenwriter aaron his claim to fame is the west wing must have been to make a fat movie but what we get is a breath taking 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping <UNK> br br this film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the <UNK> of touch of it's <UNK> witty script even if it does <UNK> the obvious link between the help that <UNK> and wilson provide and the ultimate consequences 9 11
<START> i like the wind and the lion very much it was a good movie i thought that since i'm young and it was made so long ago i wouldn't like it all that good but after i saw it i was amazed of how good it was my family liked it my friends liked it everyone i showed it to liked it i liked it because it showed how <UNK> and people in was treated during the early <UNK> by the germans french and even the americans if i was a high school history teacher i would definitely show it to my <UNK> from a high <UNK> point of view i give this movie a good 10 out of 10 my grandparents liked it so much they bought it for themselves my little 3 year old cousins even sit down and watched it br br
<START> in my opinion this film has wonderful lighting and even better photography too bad the story is not all that good and mr cage sometimes loses his accent but two thumbs up for lighting and the <UNK>
<START> i would give this movie an 8 5 or a 9 i thought it was just straight up hilarious i don't know how you could not think this movie was funny but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was <UNK> bit too much gross stuff because personally i think when they fly off of <UNK> and stuff like that is much funnier but i'm sure there are people that think the other things are very funny so that is not my but anyways great movie go see it and after that you should definitely go buy it also if you do not like this movie that is fine because i'm sure there are many people who think that this movie shows how <UNK> our society is or whatever this is just my personal opinion and you have yours also the jackass box set is definitely something worth <UNK> or buying or whatever you do to get your videos
<START> this is a black and white film from france br br simple plot gangster on the run seeking getting help etc we have seen this type film many times over the years what makes this film different are mainly its acting style all the actors perform quietly no one yells hardly anyone loses his temper there are quite a few deaths some surprising there are beautiful women as well but no sex scenes no car chases either br br just talking it is so refreshing to listen to people talk here we must read subtitles as well br br the acting is near perfect by all especially the lead played by br br <UNK> <UNK> in a smaller but vital role jean paul <UNK> these 2 actors were among the best br br i said above the film is flawed there are a few script <UNK> in few spots they are minor the acting is the thing in this movie production is first rate as well br br ratings out of 4 <UNK> points out of 100 imdb 8 out of 10
<START> <UNK> i wouldn't waste the time on reviewing a film like human <UNK> chop the 2001 version not to be confused with the earlier film of the same title which is probably better known in the west as the <UNK> story but since the reviews already here are quite vague as to what it actually consists of i figured i'd best post something more detailed so as no one actually gets tempted as i was into buying it because of the film's <UNK> i honestly would just say stay away br br major spoilers are contained below br br human <UNK> chop i was expecting to be like a chinese interpretation of the popular japanese guinea pig films anyone who's watched enough of that series can see where its makers are coming from there's a strong sense of humour running throughout it you can't watch the ludicrous he never dies without laughing and the making of guinea pig is a fabulous turning of the whole thing on its head proving it was just made with some glee by fairly good natured <UNK> all the <UNK> films have a punk rock <UNK> shot on video aesthetic occasional flashes of genuine artistry mermaid in a <UNK> an angry political agenda and a <UNK> deranged <UNK> that sets them in a league of their own br br human <UNK> chop has none of the above br br it's shot on <UNK> film with <UNK> good production values it's 90 <UNK> minutes long and it's utterly devoid of anything redeeming the plot tells in flashback at a police <UNK> of the suspects of the <UNK> torture death and eventual <UNK> of grace a heroin addicted <UNK> who is kidnapped and <UNK> by her <UNK> and his henchmen when she steals money from him br br despite its fleeting attempts at being a morality play the film possesses a detached <UNK> feel to it and one can't help but <UNK> on the <UNK> of those behind it although it half <UNK> paints grace as an innocent victim the mean spirited nature of its screenplay and the <UNK> constant vicious dialogue <UNK> towards a shocking utterly <UNK> she deserves it point of view which makes the whole thing almost impossible to watch far more time is spent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and when her <UNK> are eventually deemed guilty and <UNK> it seems like a <UNK> <UNK> on behalf of the writers who've long since stopped caring less br br what makes it <UNK> as to why anyone would want to watch such a film is that even the kind of people who do really get off on mindless sex and violence in the movies would be severely missing out the torture is just a continuous stream of <UNK> verbal abuse psychological abuse and then increasingly bizarre displays of power on behalf of the <UNK> use <UNK> heroin addiction to make her do their <UNK> and when i say that don't get me wrong incidentally unlike guinea pig with it's frequent <UNK> of nudity that gives an almost teenage feel of mock <UNK> to the proceedings in spite of the <UNK> human <UNK> chop has no such sexual overtones there isn't any actual nudity in the film and the violence is performed purely out of <UNK> by the <UNK> protagonists who early in the film are seen <UNK> a dog into a bag and <UNK> it against a brick wall don't worry not real just a cheap special effect br br the only actual bloodshed in the film is towards the end when they <UNK> <UNK> body and <UNK> the bones all very poor special fx nowhere near guinea pig level and by that stage you'll probably be already feeling too miserable and sick to even care what's going on br br the film is <UNK> bleak and <UNK> along a similar line to buddy combat shock and i guess could even be compared at a push both movies deal with the <UNK> physical decline of an individual who exists in a nightmarish environment devoid of any social or morally <UNK> characters and both movies in a particularly visceral manner with the <UNK> inevitable <UNK> doom br br in fairness neither it's violence whereas guinea pig could easily be accused of this but one can't help but wonder where the place is for a film like this it fails to many any real points in its frank presentation of such brutality and with a <UNK> pace a virtually non existent plot line and the aforementioned lack of any entertainment value i just can't understand what would encourage anyone to watch something like this i only made it to the end purely for the purpose of being able to review it fairly which i hope i've now done br br overall score 0 of of 10 welcome to the bottom of the barrel
<START> for me pink <UNK> lived up to it's reputation as being the shocking disgusting repulsive trashy film i was expecting it to be that really contains everything but the kitchen sink we are treated to almost two hours of <UNK> that never lets up rape sex sex with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> murder <UNK> and a horrid display of singing out ones <UNK> it is about a strange couple who begin a competition with a trailer trash family trying to steal their title as the <UNK> people alive divine a fat guy in drag is an unbelievably vile human being who actually becomes painful to watch trust me when i say that this film is not one to be quickly forgotten especially the end scene in which divine eats dog crap off the sidewalk i have always thought john waters was over rated and i cannot say i like this film but it is an experience if you ever get a chance to see it
<START> i totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who <UNK> the film having read the book being impressed by it although this is a kind of literature that you cannot really like similar to <UNK> <UNK> writing i expected being shocked but the effect was more subtle than this isabelle <UNK> is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi layered character there are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and i can imagine few actresses who would do so well with so much disregard for their own reputation or image there is this <UNK> distance cruelty and at the same time there's this <UNK> hurt and pain there's a person who's in control and controlled at the same time maybe this is not realistic although when you read the newspaper you'll read about much worse than this but there's a truth to it that is very difficult to bear i think it's an excellent film but i did not enjoy watching it it's not boring but there are times when i wished it would end btw her male counterpart is very well acted as well and i think well chosen too
<START> the <UNK> angels did come out the losers in this movie sonny stated to the director that nobody does this to the angles and gets away with it his version was the two <UNK> were to be to death but his suggestion was ignored they were <UNK> to even appear much less be technical <UNK> in a stink bomb of a movie like this <UNK> angles on <UNK> <UNK> c'mon although in <UNK> autobiography he says f k <UNK> <UNK> and that if they was smart they would be riding read his auto he hates <UNK> can you imagine the angels <UNK> into town on their <UNK> machine sounding <UNK> <UNK> not too <UNK> they would get laughed out of town
<START> i've watched this movie movie casually and i've never stop watching because is so ridiculous any dog can play this act and will be better then the actors actors of this bad remake of the fatal attraction there is no directing no playing only an unlucky copy of the adrian <UNK> movie if you have doubt to suicide watch this and you can choose for yes br br i can't imagine people that went to cinema to see this rubbish maybe someone that had an empty afternoon and choose the first cinema near house to stay 2 hours with some others to forget problems but it's hard to go back home relaxed
<START> this is better then the first the movie opens up with sheriff sam then sam and anne pack there <UNK> up and head to the while jack <UNK> along br br people are shot get glass through <UNK> get <UNK> by get stabbed with <UNK> eyes <UNK> out head explosions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shoved into faces <UNK> throats <UNK> to death killed by <UNK> arms are ripped off <UNK> by anti freeze <UNK> down <UNK> hit in face with <UNK> and pans fingers <UNK> bitten off <UNK> through mouths bitten on the neck exploding people <UNK> <UNK> and shoved in br br the <UNK> are hilarious they put it into a <UNK> and turn it on then it says <UNK> was <UNK> they put in in a <UNK> thing and it gets burnt br br this is just a great movie then they start thinking of other ways to kill it and the <UNK> replies <UNK> not <UNK> br br it was worth then ten bucks spent to buy this br br 10 out of 10 stars
<START> especially by <UNK> this is the essential <UNK> tarzan that i grew up reading when i was a kid i have read a few negative reviews on this film and couldn't help but wonder what their issue was they obviously didn't see the movie i did or they were expecting something that was more akin to the saturday afternoon serials br br this was the tarzan that was of the novel and the film makers should be <UNK> for <UNK> the source material and taking it seriously <UNK> was excellent i still think he is one of hollywood's most under rated actors this was a movie that he shines in br br the photography and the apes done by rick baker both were amazing you definitely felt the since of the jungle the 2nd half <UNK> attempt at being <UNK> really pulls you into the emotional conflict he had was forced to resolve br br i highly recommend this film
<START> not all films made in 1931 are this <UNK> and the fact that this was best picture must have given even greater <UNK> to the development of television br br typical of all novels it isn't possible to bring the entire story to the screen to say nothing of developing character <UNK> so <UNK> in the first third of the movie does an about face but no one knows why and it makes no sense and what is there about dunne that makes makes her so <UNK> <UNK> may <UNK> scenes are priceless as usual br br this film has a role to play in the history of cinema but it is long and boring
<START> this anime <UNK> the tale of the battle for king every 1 000 years 100 children are sent to earth to fight to determine who will be their next king in the original japanese the creatures are which literally means magic evil object each is paired with a human partner and given a magic the human can use this book to <UNK> incredible powers in the and when a is defeated their is <UNK> in flames alternately a book can be captured and burned directly after that the returns to the world br br the titular character is <UNK> in japan a 6 year old with electric powers he is paired with and 14 year old genius is initially reluctant to fight but learning that some are evil and deciding the battle for king is wrong he decided to fight to become a <UNK> <UNK> br br bell has drawn comparison to pokemon but a better comparison is to <UNK> like <UNK> the and human have a one to one <UNK> relationship also unlike pokemon both shows have an actual plot br br bell features character growth and <UNK> relationships and some fairly adult story lines like love vs racism slavery mind control etc it even has some decent plot twists and mysteries
<START> i seriously enjoyed watching this movie for the first time some years ago and whenever it gets aired again somewhere which luckily happens from time to time in european cable television i experience the same thing i'm moved entertained and end up wishing there were more movies like this one br br it all deals with leo kevin <UNK> and his group of friends living in urban london leo as a gay guy who follows a friend to a hilarious new age men's group and falls for straight guy <UNK> played by dashing james <UNK> who turns out not so straight after all thrown in as side characters are the equally great tom <UNK> and hugo <UNK> whose side story alone is worth watching the movie simon <UNK> as the leader of the men's group turning in a great as ever performance but it's really hard to pick some folks out here because every character the female ones like jennifer julie <UNK> and harriet <UNK> as well are <UNK> acted maybe even kevin <UNK> looks a little pale compared to his co actors but it benefits his somewhat subdued character br br the idea behind this movie is a simple one there is never only black and white are difficult and may not always stand the test of time br br leo <UNK> as gay but ends up falling for a woman as well who turns out to be his teenage sweetheart and long time girlfriend <UNK> starts out straight but gets to learn that gay may be more than just an option for him and being <UNK> might not be that bad after all darren and jeremy <UNK> and <UNK> are gay and loving it and even the straight folks in the movie like angie <UNK> female roommate get their fair share of love and funny moments up until the end of the movie the comedy bits especially tom <UNK> who's just hilarious are funny and on point and the emotions are believable as confusing as they may appear at times reading this summary br br what i like about this movie is its genuinely positive notion whether you're gay straight <UNK> or simply not sure this movie leaves you feeling that it's just okay not to be sure and that not being sure might be something worth living out as well sexuality is portrayed fluid in this movie and none of the main characters seem to have a real problem with it apart from all the gay straight camp fights that you sometimes get fed with in other gay themed movies i can only <UNK> agree with the subtext of the movie that what you feel certain of one day when you think you identify as gay straight whatever can look very different on another i have never seen what to call it <UNK> or maybe just the absence of the <UNK> need for sexual <UNK> being portrayed in such a heartwarming and true to life manner br br this movie <UNK> going where few movies go gay or straight movies by not playing on <UNK> and stereotypical <UNK> of sex and relying on that it goes further and assumes that there may be a life to sex after well known and i think the times are more than ready for that and other movies exploring <UNK> themes like this one br br and for all others who don't care about that heck it's just a funny comedy worth watching on a rainy saturday evening with some popcorn on your hands give it a try br br loved it
<START> this movie looked like the out takes of the deleted scenes from a high school film class experiment it made no sense it was well acted but i only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this <UNK> the alien machines were created with i technology and no creativity they were <UNK> the under lit and barely seen aliens were <UNK> with legs where were the <UNK> the editing done by director writer producer make up artist jumps all over the place with some scenes repeated numerous times most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of <UNK> <UNK> the next time wants to make a movie someone needs to slap him in 2005 alone he produced 11 movies that doesn't include the writing editing directing or visual effects credits on other movies if the rest are like this <UNK> load then he's just making fun of us this was a slapped together rip off of spielberg's movie nothing more i'm looking forward to x man the have eyes
<START> yeah i made it all the way to the end it was pretty hard though br br sometimes i was wondering if there was even a director on set the acting well i don't even know what to say i thought the girl who played emily tried her best with the boring sometimes wacky and sometimes predictable dialog br br i know that it was low budget but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look and sound like a 100 minute long audition tape br br i'm not even going to talk about the ending br br the best thing about the movie was the music br br that being said i do not recommend this movie to anyone even for lesbians who don't have many movies to watch overall this is nothing to waste your time on if you're looking for a sad lesbian themed movie check out the children's hour lost and delirious or high art those will all leave you depressed and gloomy but you won't have to suffer cinematic hell in the process
<START> i finally got hold of <UNK> on dvd with the widescreen format intact and rousing henry <UNK> score to the max after having viewed <UNK> for fifteen years on tape i have to say that the dvd version was both great and disappointing the u s version is so much better than the dvd european version the u s version of <UNK> moves much faster the editing on the dvd version is terrible feels like an unfinished cut and the many scenes not seen in the american version add little or nothing to the final problem in fact one new moment almost destroys the entire movie when caine peter <UNK> meets the male alien at the <UNK> i love this scene in the u s version though on the dvd the male alien speaks to caine and what he says is <UNK> hilarious it's the <UNK> of hilarity br br it'll be much less terrifying if you just come to me the male alien says in a deep 1950s style voice i was <UNK> when i saw this it just doesn't belong in the movie that scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick i'm glad hooper or whoever cut that scene when the movie was released in north america there are several changes that were made for the u s version that make <UNK> that much better and i wished the dvd had the u s version the editing is sharp and <UNK> without being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the u s version are even more boring on the dvd version because of added scenes and the opening credits on the dvd is terrible much better in the u s version more subtle br br i love this film it's basically aliens making a pit stop over earth and sucking up as much <UNK> as possible the film has too many flat uninspiring sequences talk talk talk but when the action goes to london it's fun the film really shines in these scenes one can see hooper finally doing what he's great at chaos <UNK> horror <UNK> should have had more of these chaos scenes they're the best apocalyptic scenes ever put on film it's also the best zombie movie ever the zombies are hungry for <UNK> not flesh and they're crazed and <UNK> and terrifying not the slow moving <UNK> of other zombie movies also a lot of people have criticized the ending but i love it it leaves you high and dry like one of the <UNK> <UNK> victims br br and to think this movie came out during the cute and <UNK> 80s when people <UNK> to e t or <UNK> or other sweet and boring feel good sci fi movies no wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super <UNK> point of view br br as for the dvd well it ain't great the image is <UNK> and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever but it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format i just hope that they'll release a clean crisp u s version on a dvd and with commentary by hooper and
<START> the basic story idea of enchanted april is excellent two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their <UNK> to rent an italian villa for a month to further <UNK> costs they get two other strangers to come along what makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation in particular showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their <UNK> on life unfortunately this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film ann <UNK> plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous her <UNK> eyed expression and <UNK> stares really make you wonder if this isn't a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot and to make it worse <UNK> owen plays a character so obnoxious and <UNK> that i was very close to turning off the film he was that awful and unbelievable i noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10 which is very very difficult to understand sure the film has great ambiance and a good plot but these two <UNK> silly performances cannot be overlooked as they <UNK> the rest of the picture sorry but this film was <UNK> for a re make
<START> writing about something so wonderful is completely hard actually it's almost impossible to describe the <UNK> of this movie this is a marvelous story about sex and gender and it's almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex feeling this film was made for people that like to feel and just to feel life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way we look at it and something starts growing inside our minds even our hearts it a pure poem i've watched some gay movies and i almost always got really <UNK> with unnecessary scenes of sex not because i don't like scenes of sex but generally they are so pornographic that i'm forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means <UNK> no is totally different from that ones three are the main characters we have <UNK> <UNK> and two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle <UNK> likes his best friend <UNK> <UNK> likes and likes <UNK> imagine what this could turn in <UNK> hands but in the contrary makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life adding a question in our mind that made me think <UNK> in the end of the movie why and that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart the scenes actually sometimes <UNK> to be boring are moments of the most delightful poem which we are able to feel but totally unable to write down in words and maybe because of that we are unable to understand the question in the end of the movie i'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of <UNK> some people want to understand a film almost <UNK> it others are so used to common american gay movies that can't appreciate the real value of this master piece watch it close your eyes in the credits and feel everything feel yourself feel the wonderful song for all this and much much more i give a nine and i just don't give ten because ten of ten is perfection but i confess i almost did it
<START> this film is a brilliant retelling of shakespeare's classic love story complete with kinky sex body <UNK> and <UNK> it does follow the same spirit as all the other troma movies except combat shock that sucker was depressing but it's not only for troma fans anybody who <UNK> <UNK> visuals and a hilarious script will without a doubt fall in love with this movie br br don't expect pretentious artistic wannabe crap like the version of r j with claire danes and leo <UNK> this one knows its a silly movie and draws its humor from that the acting is also surprisingly good and you can just feel sammy pain as he tries to put his brain back into his head br br the soundtrack which contains many original and high energy bands like the wesley willis fiasco <UNK> and the is also four star this movie should be viewed by all because it remains faithful to the original story while still being jam packed with <UNK> trademark gore sex humor
<START> i love watching australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing the dvd cover looked promising but you know what they say don't judge a dvd by it's cover br br i also noticed that it won best actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic it just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film making and get it right before <UNK> himself too thin the music was pretty ordinary the story really didn't go anywhere it was just a sequence of fights strung together with poor script and cheesy dialogue br br i will say this to all aspiring filmmakers though watch this film it will give you hope that your film will win something at some festival br br however good on them for getting in there and having a go hope they learned some lessons and their next venture is a little better
<START> this movie should be <UNK> sex in the 70s in a part of new york city called <UNK> village and <UNK> br br this movie does little to talk about sex in the 70s except focus on the <UNK> of public and private sex spaces in new york city i doubt that the <UNK> bar was symbolic of actual sex in the 70s and that kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film br br don't get me wrong the time period looks like a blast and it's rather important to document the scene to which the film refers but as far as calling this film sex in the 70s the title is a bit misleading technically it's no oscar <UNK> but the <UNK> of it feels appropriate for the subject br br overall an eh
<START> there really are no redeeming factors about this show to put it simply its just terrible absolutely dreadful it's just a dreadful reality show not only that it's dreadful fiction br br imagine this a bunch of overly imaginative teenagers get together one night and go hey let's make a <UNK> show just like ghost hunters and <UNK> so they grab a camera <UNK> local residents and film random landscapes behind a painfully trying to be dramatic yet failing monologue this show is basically a bunch of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary the only difference is this show actually has a budget and writers a wasted budget and terrible writers br br oh the problems how do i count <UNK> well first off let's talk about this from a personal level i am not a total <UNK> when it comes to the <UNK> i am willing to believe in whats <UNK> and whats not and i'm sure there are a lot of people who feel the same so if you're going to do a show about the <UNK> you have to do a good job convincing the viewer that what they're seeing is either <UNK> or not because the viewer can easily believe otherwise i hate to compare but i don't see why not at this point take ghost hunters for example in ghost hunters you can tell that the cast is <UNK> with the audience they're not totally skeptical yet they're still willing to keep the possibility of any <UNK> <UNK> in mind they have to look at something and be willing to say this is possible that its simply nothing and with that in mind they set out to try and prove themselves wrong they use technology and several other <UNK> along with constant <UNK> to determine what is <UNK> along with bearing the fact that what they may be <UNK> could be nothing in mind not only are they trying to convince themselves what is real and what is not in the process they are trying to convince you that element of doubt is not present in <UNK> state strike one br br in <UNK> state the cast simply says there's this spooky place and its haunted so we're going to find some spirits and immediately you know and saying to yourself okay convince me otherwise the cast is not professional in their interviews in fact sometimes it seems like they're just <UNK> local residents of these so called haunted areas they have no real evidence to back up their claims besides <UNK> and theories and the best they can must up is somebody who claims they can contact the dead with no one ever backing up who this person is and how valid they really are they could have easily just picked some random person off the street and said pretend you can contact spirits for our show and went at it in the episode this just happens without any convincing evidence towards the end of the show they bring this sort of individual out where he does a random painfully scripted reading of a supposed area of how something is haunted in order to convince its audience very very poor effort i feel that one of the main problems with the show is that it feels scripted during one of the episodes the cast gets attacked by one of these <UNK> <UNK> at times in an attempt to be dramatic these sort of dramatic sequences would make any <UNK> laugh and even those who are on the fence realize what they're watching is just a bunch of <UNK> esquire trash if the show's aim was to try and convince their audience that these <UNK> events are real they're doing a <UNK> poor job at doing so strike two br br however there is always the counter just one last viewpoint to see if the show is actually worth something what if the show isn't trying to convince you that these <UNK> events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction it even fails on that level as well if the show's creators were trying to craft fiction to entertain its audience the writing is too poor and even on a fictional level it fails to convince the audience that its cast members are really experiencing the unknown in all its full horrifying glory the writing is simply not compelling and even dare i say boring strike three br br so what remains of this show is simply a bunch of teenagers who are too willing or too <UNK> to believe in the <UNK> simply because its simply much more amazing than reality who set out with a camera a bad script and bad actors to generally just make a really bad horror documentary thats all the show is at this point there is no reason to see it not even for the entertainment factor and there's no reason to care about it to be blunt its lame there are absolutely no redeeming factors about this show
<START> this series while <UNK> and <UNK> has the <UNK> and good <UNK> that does come from living on an island br br i lived in an out of the way part of hawaii for a few years and found some hilarious quirky and fun people in some remote non tourist areas br br every time i see the reruns of this series i <UNK> compare my memories of experiences in out of the way parts of hawaii with the memories portrayed and <UNK> in key west br br this series is not reality television i hate reality television br br it is from the era when people still wrote creative tv shows give me a young writer who takes their inspiration from the angels in the <UNK> <UNK> in the palm trees and <UNK> in the any day
<START> by now the <UNK> stale right br br the jokes have been done its all over the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone after all br br wrong br br the game is still intact the jokes are here folks sure they're all rehash but so was monkey island 2 and 1 for that matter br br the difficulty is well placed somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2 the ship fighting sub game is badly <UNK> in the tradition of sub games and this game has the best joke of the whole series when asked for your <UNK> card to an <UNK> beach always <UNK> you don't need to see my <UNK> its worth the price of the game by itself
<START> i honestly found wicked little things to be a very cool and fun horror film my friend had given this to me and i really saw it as nothing but a crappy low class gory horror film then after i watched this i was wrong it was very cool and very good and while ill say it seemed a bit unnecessary at times and while it may not be the best horror film ever its still good i thought the acting was very good especially from the girl who plays the mother she seemed very believable and to me very likable and while it is a little and over the top its good overall i gotta say if the horror fest films are not your style then you should have no business watching this but if you like horror films or a wicked little time than check out wicked little things 8 0 out of 10 stars
<START> this movie is awful just awful someone bought it for me as a christmas present because they knew i liked a good horror flick i don't think they understood the good part all i can say is next year this person is getting <UNK> <UNK> from me avoid this movie it makes you bitter peace br br
<START> miles <UNK> once again assumes the role of the mighty <UNK> in this the first sequel to the original film br br what can i say this pretty much represents b movie <UNK> br br the plot is ludicrous the script is terrible the acting is hammy throughout the special effects well let's not even go there all in all this movie is a <UNK> delight br br highlights of the film include <UNK> and <UNK> his mute companion not his <UNK> being attacked by invisible <UNK> in a cave certainly saved on the fx budget there <UNK> battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid and of course the infamous scene br br there's one question i have though at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when <UNK> supposedly destroys the <UNK> as the narrator tells us how in the hell did <UNK> destroy it and manage get out alive did he fashion some form of primitive <UNK> <UNK> or something br br oh well such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm they just don't make them like this anymore
<START> star rating <UNK> very good okay you could go out for a meal instead avoid at all costs br br the tale of the titular adam mark <UNK> <UNK> and paul tom murphy two heroin <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> and their daily about in their meaningless lives searching for the next fix that will make their day along the way they try and <UNK> with close family and friends who they've managed to let down and destroy over the years br br i know a lot of irish people like to drink but it seems some of them have problems with heroin too by the looks of this movie i know there is a bit of a drug problem over there like there is in many parts of the world so another humorous take on the subject matter is not an entirely unexpected thing br br i don't recall the last irish movie i saw the film is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any film i've seen lately and judging from that obviously i'm not as <UNK> on their humour as i could be the film is rather funny in certain parts but it's obviously another comedy that isn't afraid to raise near the <UNK> laughs the scene in which the mentally disabled boy is robbed down the back of an alley is certainly true of what a pair of <UNK> might do to feed their habit but is nonetheless utterly despicable and i'm not sure if it was meant as dark humour in any way but it certainly didn't put a smile on my face it's also in stark contrast to their previous actions where they're seen showing their soft side <UNK> a baby to and <UNK> in light of this some may find the ending sad others may see it as just <UNK> br br overall i just failed to see the point to the film i didn't see any motivation in the <UNK> it was telling it just seems to <UNK> along without really involving the audience in any way unlike <UNK> which dealt with similar themes it's an <UNK> effort for the most part that had me on the verge of <UNK> off despite it's very short <UNK> minute running time really no more enjoyable than following two real life <UNK> around for a day
<START> this show demonstrates the depths to which uk tv pre <UNK> drama has sunk with these dull scripts mediocre acting poor plots awful dialog one is forced to watch a dvd of any old er episode to see excellent hospital drama br br none of the actors employed on this show seem to be able to actually act br br if you want low quality but easy to <UNK> soap opera style tv this is the show for you personally i like something with more meat on the bone sadly as with all other uk <UNK> <UNK> i'm funding this <UNK>
<START> i had watched this as a kid but not being much of a jerry lewis fan i had completely forgotten it not that it's in any way memorable the film revolves around <UNK> which seems to be in the <UNK> of every comic star in this case a german officer and while not as bad as leonard <UNK> claims <UNK> it a bomb rating it's not exactly classic stuff either certainly <UNK> behind <UNK> the great dictator 1940 even if <UNK> <UNK> ironically the scenes prior to the appearance of the would be wacky general offer more <UNK> than the rather forced humor at nazi expense br br the film was really <UNK> last gasp during his <UNK> in fact this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years it's painfully apparent here that his particular brand of <UNK> wouldn't pass <UNK> in the age of mel brooks and woody allen
<START> jaded should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like <UNK> behavior or friend of the family br br jaded is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to <UNK> and it's not that common in society from the beginning of the movie with the first scene you expect more strong scenes br br the <UNK> scene wasn't in my opinion a well created scene i think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie that's why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the end br br the performances are extremely good from all the five female characters these women gave strong intense but believable performances that demonstrate the <UNK> dramatic abilities br br the legal concepts helped a lot to understand the <UNK> difficulty because the legal term of <UNK> is different from a simple <UNK> from the point of view of <UNK> defense <UNK> needs to be <UNK> as a <UNK> a huge crime grade b although it's a different crime pat and <UNK> defense claims that meg enjoyed and asked for it this is where the movie turns interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth the only thing for sure is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime br br watch jaded if you like legal issues that aren't very common in your society if not give it a try because it's a very good and strong drama
<START> this film is full of interesting ideas some scenes are truly hilarious the dialogs are witty and <UNK> the tension in the film comes not so much from the <UNK> plot as from the relationship between the characters the film tells two stories in parallel br br the first story involves the characters played by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is an <UNK> drifter with a somewhat ridiculous macho <UNK> who is followed by a naive young man played by <UNK> with plenty of good natured smiles many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters for example when <UNK> tries to teach <UNK> how to be <UNK> br br the second story tells how a salesman played by jean gives up his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony i wish i could describe this better br br after a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and they meet indeed in the end in a surprising but also logical ending br br the film is a successful mixture of the witty but superficial gangster films the director's father the celebrated michel <UNK> used to write and the typical french film with lots of psychological depth and lots of care in the display of emotions
<START> i would like to <UNK> my <UNK> at nbc <UNK> las vegas the show had been top notch for the past <UNK> tom addition was great he really brought a nice fresh addition to the show what does nbc have now lame reality and night time game shows i mean come on keep the old and tired law and order not even putting jack mccoy as da can keep the show interesting gee let's keep quality program like deal or no deal or ed er should be put out to <UNK> to nbc is worse now than it was in pre seinfeld cheers days with cable and internet nbc cannot afford to fall flat on its face please bring back vegas i remember when homicide life on the street ended the way it did at least they had a two hour series final hey cbs are you listening please pick up vegas it is a great show
<START> this is the <UNK> film noir film i've ever seen very weak script only provides opportunity for jack palance and rod <UNK> to deliver exceptionally well lines that were made for an acting audition palance and <UNK> both <UNK> they are indeed serious actors who can portray their respective roles with power emotion and drama the story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace mostly taking place in a living room the director obviously moved the actors around in a circles as they delivered long lines to keep the slow pace from becoming noticeable to the audience the action doesn't pick up until the last ten minutes of the film if you're one who's looking for more depth in a crime drama this one's not for you
<START> get the cd instead the show is tame and the editing sucks the crowd gets way too much screen time as does till the cameras spend more time on the same kid shaking his head around in the same way which leads me to believe it's the exact same shot than they do during richard solo in the scenes change so quickly it's impossible to tell where the camera is pointed and the <UNK> are simply redundant not worth the tape it's recorded on
<START> nice attempt to bring <UNK> language alive in a post apocalyptic setting but the final result is dreadful futuristic <UNK> is not convincing at all the budget was obviously not very big but the production designer could have come up with a slightly more creative approach to the matter alex cox has made some good films e g <UNK> man and highway <UNK> man but i really don't know what he was thinking here just an opinion
<START> <UNK> is one of the better films of all time and is about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses no feelings no love no truth and definitely no freedom a world where people become afraid when someone speaks their mind expresses himself or show affection a world where no one is free and no one has any idea what the meaning of any of this is just like the world we live in the world in <UNK> is a world of lost souls trying to become <UNK> but focus on the complete opposite of what <UNK> them <UNK> social acceptance and mediocre <UNK> br br <UNK> deserves full attention by every human soul because we could all use a fresh wake up call
<START> i haven't seen this movie in years the last time i did i was really drunk after 5 <UNK> of <UNK> at my local <UNK> but even then i though it was quite awful this movie is pretty terrible compared to the other <UNK> movies the first two were quite good 3 was quite crap but miles better than this the story takes place <UNK> years after 3 were charlie the bounty hunter from the previous movies is found floating in a <UNK> in outer space by a crew of some kind of space <UNK> em people and taken on board once on board the last <UNK> eggs left in the galaxy which charlie has brought with him from earth crack open and we then have <UNK> on board the space ship cue an obvious <UNK> rip off and a lot of terrible fx and you pretty much have this movie in a nutshell only good thing is when we are re introduced to <UNK> or so we are lead to believe who is now a villain and wants to <UNK> the <UNK> instead of destroying them
<START> this show is <UNK> on brilliant it's a modern day married with children the scripts are witty as they are <UNK> with clever sarcasm they are also realistic dealing with issues that face many parents of teenagers today as well as the on going burden that you might not be the worlds greatest parent and how is the best way to deal with this however at the same time it manages to remain light hearted and fun which with all the drama and action on television these days is a very pleasant and welcome change it is something you can sit down in front of for 30 minutes and relax laugh and relate to it isn't the world's most hilarious comedy yet will make you laugh at least a handful of times an episode michael <UNK> is brilliant in the lead as dave he fills the big shoes that the heavily sarcastic script requires and then some he and anita <UNK> <UNK> have fantastic chemistry and <UNK> off one another very well this show has a strong future if it is <UNK> at the correct target audience and put in the right time <UNK> also if fox release it on dvd the following will be stronger and larger as is a classic example with <UNK>
<START> this movie is about six men who are assigned to transport money from bank to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> short was in iraq for the war serving his country and now just is being helped out making a living by his friend mike matt dillon making sure he does not loose his house mike tells him that this wasn't the life his parents were expecting for him and he should be living a better life than he is now with his brother jimmy <UNK> andre telling <UNK> that him and jimmy have always been family to him and would do anything to help them out mike tells <UNK> about a plan to make a heist the money would be around <UNK> million split six ways among the other transport men too although <UNK> does not like the idea he tells his friend mike as long as no one gets hurt he would be in the last night <UNK> was forced to talk to a <UNK> lady about putting up his brother in foster care giving him a dilemma to lose what matters most in his life although the plan sounds safe at first greed isn't everything when it comes to taking lives br br when it comes to <UNK> your either in or your out so when you don't go with a plan its hard to play the hero and stop greed driven people when it comes to having large sums of money this movie comes with a star <UNK> cast to keep you interested starring jean reno laurence fishburne fred ward <UNK> <UNK> and milo <UNK> short i have recently only remembered him in <UNK> the yard which was about a kid who lost his brother and lives his dream to go to college this was probably one of his best movies i have seen him in and this one he fits the character so well it's great to see him on the big screen again in action
<START> despite the fact that the plot follows the well known recipe of who did it which has <UNK> all the perry mason movies so far the characters of the present film are not so well developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood of course in general the perry mason movies are not significant but even for their low standards this one is weak
<START> this comic classic of english school girl antics is and was one of the great art house classics then the art house disappeared with the arrival of videos and so did the audience for this movie the loss is not to the art houses or to this great film the loss is to those who will never have a real opportunity to view this memorable laugh filled cinematic masterpiece but i am preaching to the converted aren't i who else would search for this flick
<START> this <UNK> and angry film is against not just the war during which it was made but all war it doesn't care what war it is it might be the most emotionally involving experience i have ever had with <UNK> <UNK> work there are no sides to the two main characters in this <UNK> drama which doesn't intimate a point in any <UNK> symbolism as per <UNK> usual but <UNK> showcases people and their lives and <UNK> what bergman has already proved he understands about a person's reaction to a movie br br his top <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and max von <UNK> play an but <UNK> married couple who were once orchestra musicians now they live in a <UNK> farm house on an island part of the building frustration we grow to share with these two people in the detail that nothing in their house seems to work they are not <UNK> <UNK> either they are a rather familiar marriage that has more or less <UNK> from life and is essentially <UNK> they only get wind of distant rumors of a war that has been going on forever is concerned with the danger to their lives and to her desire to bear children her husband von <UNK> <UNK> off that the war will pass them by their <UNK> is interrupted by screaming fighter planes flying low over their house the killing of a <UNK> <UNK> the arrival of dubious troops their <UNK> and eventually their capture by what appears to be the local side but <UNK> have long since <UNK> br br they are sent back to their home witness gratuitous destruction and suffer the <UNK> consequences of such an <UNK> <UNK> marriage this one of my top favorite bergman efforts is a study of a couple <UNK> from their safely self unaware lives and <UNK> by a manipulative despair testing them both to reveal who they really are she lacks compassion to some extent too self serving and restless to have any patience for his <UNK> <UNK> into crying his <UNK> emotional issues have led to the <UNK> of the very <UNK> and excitement that attracted them to begin with the immense last twenty minutes <UNK> interrupted by images of the overwhelming gray sky are among the closest to real emotion that bergman ever filmed br br all systems of dogma and faith are the <UNK> in this very essential and downbeat portrait the basically <UNK> personalities of and von <UNK> characters are <UNK> into the <UNK> world of war because they are accused of being <UNK> but the film shot on <UNK> small home island of doesn't give any information about where or when it's set who the two sides are and for what they're fighting to an <UNK> <UNK> caught in between the knowledge base is likely to be quite similar br br and von <UNK> are not <UNK> for the apparent enemy but they're <UNK> for who are apparently their side this 1968 <UNK> allegory could be about the common citizens of iraq or <UNK> or vietnam or israel or <UNK> or
<START> oh sex lives of the <UNK> men what foul demon created <UNK> this is a film that you watch <UNK> a little during the runtime and then when you mention it to others having seen it you just cannot help but smile as you talk but it's not that sex lives of the <UNK> men is actually a funny film and one that <UNK> you to smile when talking or thinking about it it's just that the film is so bizarre is so insulting and is no shameless in its attempt to get across a meek laugh to do with sex and sex lives in general that you just cannot help but have your mouth break out into a grin do bear in mind that what follows the <UNK> is a sinking of the head a <UNK> shake of the head and a raise of the <UNK> finger and thumb to both <UNK> as you gently rub them in an attempt to <UNK> about your time watching this trash br br but that's what the film is it's trash it's very brave and shameless trash but trash none the less whoever came up with this idea put it to paper and then spread it around the industry trying to get it made must either be very brave or very desperate it's strange to have a film that is most definitely something but one that does not have under any sort of <UNK> a <UNK> narrative this follows on from that idea that most of european cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open ended and themes take <UNK> over most other things in sex lives of the <UNK> men the same situation and technically the same joke are <UNK> over and over again and that is an that consists of <UNK> is a very very funny thing ' these ideas are perhaps more suited to an american film so it's no wonder that after a while watching this film things start to feel a little out of sorts br br the film begins and ends in the same manner creating a feeling of a <UNK> journey a <UNK> journey that has gone absolutely nowhere and absolutely nothing has been achieved three <UNK> sit around a table talking and what not their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to whatever crude and disgusting stories situations or scenarios each can possibly think of the odd thing here being that whenever one man says something nasty the other <UNK> but has an equally filthy story to give in return creating a <UNK> in what these men find to cross the line and what they do not the men are dave vegas and <UNK> crook two people joined by coleman whenever the film sees fit to throw in a third face to crack some more nasty sex jokes or break some peculiar stories they are employed by jeremy a man who has deeper issues and problems but issues of which the film is more concerned with <UNK> for the sake of humour rather than study br br so what's the situation in sex lives of the <UNK> men the three to four men are in a crisis and for the duration of the film we will adopt the role of the hapless fly on the wall as we witness what foul play these people get up to over the period of about a week if the humour revolving around dave and <UNK> is disgusting and repulsive then for jeremy things are just spooky it all begins rather <UNK> and it appears there is a female he likes and one who equally likes him in return but when the essence that jeremy is merely a stalker creeps in that's when the jaws drop the character of jeremy is used and put across in a way that makes <UNK> love and stalking in general merely look <UNK> jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing out letters of abuse to ruth davis <UNK> some sort of psychotic persona more associated with <UNK> <UNK> writing his to <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> but whatever sympathy we might have for him at this point is rendered absolutely false when later on it is revealed the true origin of their relationship suddenly we as an audience feel cheated into feeling a <UNK> sorry for him earlier on and for whatever reason he did do what he did in the first place just seems cowardly and <UNK> to say what it was would ruin whatever few surprises <UNK> within the film br br quite sad how in one of <UNK> letters he writes about something or other <UNK> it to have no artistic vision  just one big mess i hate it when words said by the characters echo the film they're in sex lives of the <UNK> men does not explore someone's psyche or particular interest in a fetish or why they feel the need to go around having as much sex as possible it just uses them as a front to pile on ridiculously unfunny jokes and situations rather than take group sex and explore what drives a person to seek it down it makes a <UNK> joke out of it tickets with numbers on rather than get into the mindset of a fan of <UNK> the film has someone hang from a basement ceiling and warn everyone of salt and as he <UNK> <UNK> covers his face in disgust and the camera fades to the next scene without too much of a fuss it's a relief the film got to no audiences abroad this is one section of british culture indeed of the british mentality that i pray will be confined to our <UNK> and ignored <UNK>
<START> well that's what this should have been called anyway mainly due the the ridiculous ham <UNK> use of what can barely be called symbolism by the director it would not have surprised me to find out that this was a one of <UNK> earliest efforts and b at least semi <UNK> turns out a is wrong although i don t know about b i will bet she attended <UNK> school though and had a rather terrible same sex relationship of some kind this is the message that was beat down our throats by this film and the short film which <UNK> it the name of which i no longer recall br br at any rate the character development was clumsy who introduces herself by saying what her name means nobody the symbols were about as subtle as an all glass elevator full of teen age girls losing a cable and <UNK> <UNK> stories all over a <UNK> honestly the cry of a <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> she was a <UNK> and <UNK> off the table that was ridiculous to the point of parody and it was only one of far too many symbols meant to show even the dumbest of viewers what her point was and that was that she had a crappy childhood and feels the need to make movies about it ala vincent <UNK> instead of seeing a <UNK> ala all of us who get on with our lives there was nothing tender nothing sweet and nothing moving about this film it was poorly <UNK> trash and the actors could not save the brett over the top hey this is my point in this movie use of film techniques writing and acting sorry but it was terrible
<START> spoilers for the first ten minutes or so of star witness we're introduced to a quote typical urban american family <UNK> in a <UNK> city which is another way of saying warner <UNK> version of nyc except for the young children including the charming <UNK> moore and <UNK> sally <UNK> they're a pretty dreary lot and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star walter huston but wait folks wait all of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out drawing the family in against their will and after that this baby never lets up there's suspense an oscar nominated script good acting everything you want old movies to is here i do question <UNK> sales performance he must be an acquired taste but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot he's treated to special status in the credits so warner bros must have really been high on sale but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me perhaps it is lost to time period an <UNK> factor you had to be a 1931 <UNK> to understand also the climax is typically melodramatic nevertheless this right now is the best release of the studio that year i have seen so far however i've only seen eight so perhaps that's an <UNK> view do not miss this when tcm shows it 8 out of 10
<START> this movie is a real waste of time and effort the film lacks plot and depth the visuals are decent but nothing to write home about there are far better films out there
<START> an insult to both poker and cinema this movie manages to make the most dynamic brilliant and fascinating figure in poker history into an utter bore still a fun film to make jokes about from the lame gangster movie clichés of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of that second hour hilariously <UNK> <UNK> wins all three of his world series titles without playing a single hand on screen his infamous dealer abuse 1 scene his coke habit 1 scene his incredible memory 0 scenes they couldn't even get any real poker players what did they cover a lot of high angle shots from inside a house in the <UNK> oh and a montage of <UNK> waking up every day and shopping for meat which doesn't come anywhere close to making sense why do i care so much about this little sopranos summer camp trying to cash in on the poker <UNK> because i think there's still a great film to be made about <UNK> <UNK> waiting for someone willing to do it right
<START> i first caught up with jennifer years ago while out of town when it showed up on tv in the middle of the night i fell asleep before it ended but it stuck with me until i had to track it down its appeal is that though there's not a lot to it it weaves an intriguing atmosphere and because <UNK> <UNK> and howard duff real life man and wife at the time display an <UNK> low key chemistry <UNK> plays a woman engaged to house sit a vast california estate whose previous caretaker jennifer up and disappeared shades of jack nicholson in the shining although in this instance it's not <UNK> who goes or went mad duff is the guy in town who manages the <UNK> <UNK> and takes a shine to <UNK> who decides to play hard to get she becomes more and more involved not to say obsessed with what happened to her predecessor in the old dark house full of <UNK> and locked the <UNK> and the romantic <UNK> are by far the best part of the movie as viewers are likely to find the resolution a bit of a letdown there's just not that much to it except a little <UNK> at the tail end that <UNK> brian de palma's <UNK> but it's well done and again it sticks with you extra added attraction this is the film that introduced the song angel eyes which would become part of the standard <UNK> of ol' blue eyes
<START> having been brought up in city as a child i recognize many of the local people in the movie so for me it's like a trip down memory lane to see the city story again as a matter of fact my is in it in one of the very first scenes uncle <UNK> the one in the <UNK> shirt who his chair out to get a better look at the singer stripper br br unless you've been there like mr page and i both have you couldn't possibly understand the story it tells the reviewer from new york calls john <UNK> racist most likely without ever having had an encounter with mr <UNK> or his father and what is your point in bringing up mr <UNK> now it has nothing to do with the film that you're supposedly reviewing how in the world can you sit back and judge either them or this film when you've probably gone no further yourself than the south <UNK> it's been my experience that people who do that are simply attempting to feel morally superior to the folks portrayed in the movie by most accounts of the time both mr were basically good and decent men their families were respectable people as were most of the people who lived in city br br by the way why is so hard for those who live outside of the south to believe that there are good and decent people even in small towns in <UNK> and why do they assume that everyone living in a small southern town is a racist my parents lived there and yet they didn't tolerate it in our household others didn't tolerate it either but the myth that everyone in the south is racist lives on through the <UNK> ignorance of others br br the movie itself is simple and direct it isn't the whole story hollywood added a certain <UNK> when the film was made parts of it were absolutely on target other parts of it <UNK> on fairy tales and if it's the source that anyone uses to decide how folks in small southern towns are they need to get a grip and understand what most of us do it's only a movie
<START> this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about times lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing i have to admit that the whole audience i was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were greek or italian so i guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me all this movie does is make you sick watching all these <UNK> make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes god and i can never get that 90 minutes back
<START> this outstanding film has about the best acting that you'll ever see and that alone makes this a must see the entire cast is excellent but then again it had to be in order to keep up with dustin hoffman and meryl streep it didn't take me long to get hooked on this film and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good this is top notch entertainment this is a rare film that actually deserved all the oscar recognition that it received see it for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed
<START> perhaps the weakest film in the <UNK> series despite the presence of john carradine miscast as an egyptian high priest and george <UNK> as his predecessor hilariously <UNK> by a bad case of disease supporting <UNK> <UNK> jr as the titular creature if indeed it was him under the <UNK> as his contribution is <UNK> at best it's a watchable 60 minutes in itself i guess but the standards have considerably <UNK> when compared even to the two previous entries and the end result is strictly routine and not at all memorable just about the only interesting feature here is the fact that the female lead happens to be the reincarnation of princess <UNK> mentioned a great deal in earlier films but never actually seen
<START> i can get very tired of murder mysteries with the exception of a few really excellent tv series otherwise there are just too many of these murder plot themes i don't like the theme of the two over clever selfish <UNK> killing as an intellectual exercise i've no interest whatsoever in hitchcock who appears to have been associated with this in some way i don't intend to find out about but don't <UNK> me the theme is in itself excellent the whole movie is so well done and of course sandra <UNK> is <UNK> as always br br <UNK> character is as in miss <UNK> not rated by the male team she works with in spite of her obvious skills and the boss mostly ignores her ideas eventually forcing her aside and giving the case to her male partner of course sandra works out what's going on and nearly gets killed in a very dramatic denouement it's intriguing how the boy who worked out the murder plot can't allow her to be killed by his colleague he has a conscience of some sort and perhaps could be saved while the other is a true psychopath br br <UNK> hard shell is caused by misery in her past that's tied in <UNK> with the murder case her colleague <UNK> that <UNK> solving this case in spite of being <UNK> by the dense superior finally discovers what happened to sandra herself in her teens that she must now face up to and <UNK> and the last scene shows her starting we hope anyway to do just that br br i can see from the few other reviews i've had time to read that this movie would attract a group those interested in the two <UNK> boys away their time with their grisly philosophical determination to trick the police and get away with the perfect murder the relationship between them that's so cleverly depicted the ghastly <UNK> to the <UNK> past a police theme and some <UNK> and mirrors as well as for hitchcock fans br br for those who've why <UNK> character has to have a <UNK> past really i think this would be a far less interesting movie if she had been just a detective trying to <UNK> what was going on with a willing sidekick helping out and a male <UNK> boss the link between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show the detective becoming too involved or otherwise how would she lose her arrogant <UNK> confidence and thereby nearly lose her life that's hardly an original theme in fact it's usually an extremely irritating theme as this male <UNK> boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired <UNK> to get off the case and leave it to someone who clearly doesn't have quite the skills to solve it nice though the sidekick is i was getting very worried towards the end re what might happen to <UNK> character as her emotional involvement in the case and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime dangerously drove her on with this case by herself br br i wasn't disappointed re the relationship between <UNK> character and her sidekick that goes along interestingly and at times very <UNK> br br the relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing if that's what you were interested in watching i felt it was kept low key in some ways either because the movie makers didn't want to get into boy boy friendships too much or because we weren't supposed to think emotion ruled their relationship the movie cleverly makes you wonder which boy's in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying <UNK> at various stages br br there one thing i wish had been <UNK> and that's what happens after the movie ends when <UNK> character arrives at the court you need to see to movie to know why she's there br br very well acted by all i certainly can't agree with those who complained against <UNK> acting she was superb the part suited her very well indeed the story is gripping even if murder mysteries aren't your thing and they aren't that often mine
<START> i blame birth of a nation myself for <UNK> the long running tradition of hollywood of history of which there can be few greater examples than this apart from getting the names of <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> crazy horse and the <UNK> and president grant <UNK> right the <UNK> correct and the fact that <UNK> and his men were indeed wiped out to a man the rest just takes <UNK> and invention to ludicrous limits throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the <UNK> exposition try <UNK> and his wife's learning of the phony gold rush to excuse the invasion of the <UNK> territory <UNK> <UNK> in front of <UNK> <UNK> the rights of the red indians and to top it all <UNK> <UNK> into the <UNK> office to beg to return to his post honestly there's plenty more of the same some of these scenes almost comical in their <UNK> and yet and yet it's still a great <UNK> with flynn as dashing as ever <UNK> as <UNK> as ever the young anthony quinn getting a start as crazy horse and director walsh as <UNK> as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the <UNK> action sequences ford taught us in liberty <UNK> to believe the legend before the truth here i think we're closer to the legend of the legend but hey it's only a movie and a <UNK> wonderfully enjoyable classic hollywood movie at that
<START> william h macy is terrific in this alfred hitchcock <UNK> film macy stars as a film critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends the characters that ensue are hilarious james <UNK> gives a terrific performance as a <UNK> private detective as always macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal performance see this movie whenever it is on t v and check your video stores because this is one you don't want to miss
<START> interesting cartoon included on the dvd of the lost <UNK> of <UNK> i especially like the way the color was used in the background art very artistic for columbia whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget and the results looked like it br br i do wonder however how a certain um finger gesture ever got past the censors granted the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in <UNK> than it is today you'd think someone besides the animators would have noticed though especially since it's seen three times in the scene in question and based on the context i suspect that its inclusion was intentional something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors would notice
<START> after hearing that some of the people behind the low budget flicks terror in <UNK> and it came from outer space and stuff were involved in making this movie i decided to buy it unseen on dvd i wish i hadn't the other movies were funny tongue in cheek and kinda stupid while is devoid of any humor at all and it is so god awful that i'm getting angry just thinking about it the worst actors possible the worst script possible the worst special effects available and the most <UNK> sex scene ever <UNK> and the whole thing goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes please do not ever make another movie
<START> just before dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it this movie has great suspense great acting very well done camera work nice job mr which makes a extremely well made slasher though low on gore for the 80s it still has the effect on you after it is over the opening kill <UNK> through the <UNK> looked so real and the fist to the mouth death left me stunned overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars if you are looking for a gore fest don't look here but if you want chills sent down your back see this one there are 6 deaths and one of them you don't see but it leaves you mind to think how was she killed the stranded theme reminded me of <UNK> the hills have eyes which followed kind of the same concept but in the desert with but still slasher fans give this forgotten gem i promise you you will be
<START> a low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore however it is not an excuse for poor writing it is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical the dialog in this movie was on par with most <UNK> videos shown to fast food staff in training br br i also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it with that being said no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself that was perfect i see better character acting on canadian television br br this movie had a paper thin plot bad acting poor dialog and holds no intelligent ideas at all this simply proves to me that some independent films are that way for a reason if your looking for a quick scare rent anything else even the cable guy was a scarier film after watching this film i think i would have been better off watching a re run on the x files
<START> i didn't particularly like <UNK> doors or twice upon a yesterday so i certainly didn't this poor second rate excuse for those films an idea that's been done to death what would happen if and the script is shoddy and <UNK> not to mention the obvious attempt at adding sex nudity simply to gain an r rating and certain scenes that just weren't necessary but were there to push the boundaries i really don't need to see a kid <UNK> or a struggle with a especially when they have absolutely no connection to or use in the film br br the acting was also very poor the only actor i found the least bit satisfying was her daughter the rest were two dimensional and quite unbelievable the people i watched this with left the room about halfway through i managed to finish it but not without fast <UNK> through part of it br br overall nothing new here it's a generic and boring film the few rather amusing moments are far <UNK> by the silly or stupid ones this would be dull even if it hadn't been done before if it weren't such a rehash i'd rate it a five but even for an indie film this was severely lacking and as a rehash it loses on originality as well 3 10
<START> sex is a most noteworthy aspect of existence it is perhaps the most interesting activity there is between birth and death le de <UNK> studies human sexuality in a dry and boring manner actually worse than being simply boring seeing nude 40 year olds is well unpleasant br br i guess there is some shock value in having adults as old as our parents talk about sex but after twenty minutes this stops being interesting perhaps if the characters were all 20 years younger the film would be more visually captivating br br le de <UNK> is not worth the time
<START> i used to watch this too at junior school in <UNK> around 1975 the odd thing is that from time to time i still think about it i am now 40 the big question running through out the length of the series no idea how many episodes 6 was the identity of the person riding the motorcycle <UNK> ask friends in the past about this series and they have no idea what i'm talking about and think its some kind of weird dream i've had i've never understood to this day the educational benefit of this but thought at the time it was great but slightly scary i seem to remember that there used to be a break of some sort in the middle of each episode no idea why would love to see it again got hold of a short clip via the bbc cult website
<START> in wwii america has developed a brand new huge <UNK> plane lois lane and clark kent go to cover the story when the plane is going on its first mission lois <UNK> away on the plane before it takes off there are also some japanese <UNK> on board who have every intention of flying the <UNK> to tokyo will lois be able to warn superman what do you think br br fast moving colorful cartoon the animation is a little jerky but much better than anything we see today the color and sound have been beautifully restored just two problems the lousy music score and the racism especially in the title that aside this is pretty good an 8
<START> movie i have ever seen actually i find it one of the more entertaining episodes of <UNK> 3000 i have seen not that it was good but for anyone who has seen <UNK> the hands of fate knows this one wasn't two bad the monster in the movie looked terrible everyone wore <UNK> swim suits and the plot was laughable i still don't have a clue as to why they made the monster they never really gave a good reason the lead female had to be the gal i have ever seen they would have done better if they cast the gal that was killed at the beginning as the lead on the plus side the <UNK> acting was great
<START> just saw this film at the fantasy <UNK> berlin i am not impressed br br as far as the story goes too girlfriends return from their mexico vacation while waiting for their <UNK> they get to know a couple of boys who then take the last and of course wrong <UNK> bus to the city on board is also one other older man so <UNK> portrayed that you instantly guess that he is one of the bad guys the other one is the driver br br the <UNK> takes them into industrial <UNK> and then one after the other goes done a little blood some cut of <UNK> some violence mostly playing with the fear of the girls in the end after some ups and downs <UNK> and there's some not too new scary moments everyone is dead but the driver and the girls the girls end up in some garage where one of them is killed after <UNK> that she had slept with the other girlfriends boyfriend the other girl which is the conclusion is sold by the left over <UNK> yep weirdo got killed in some <UNK> box to asia a <UNK> harbor being the final picture first story tons of <UNK> questions you ask yourself loose ends and a conclusion that is not a good revelation but a total disappointment i can't see how such a <UNK> <UNK> is supposed to have <UNK> dozens of women as is <UNK> by a <UNK> full of drivers <UNK> second acting mediocre at its best br br third scare factor ok but i am bored by torture as a means to nothing but itself trade with humans could be a good reason for a horror flick but it's not used as one just as a background br br fourth music and sound some nice tries but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape warehouse garage and truck sounds have not been really explored music would have been worse without it but apart from that some pseudo moving <UNK> string theme for <UNK> when the girls reach their final destination ok i guess br br verdict avoid it
<START> i can <UNK> say that this is the worst film i have ever seen and i usually love foreign films the movie is nothing more than poorly made violent pornography if you choose to see it prepare yourself for endless <UNK> gratuitous nudity shots and a stupid <UNK> rape scene which i'm sure is the main appeal for the people who like the movie br br additionally the plot <UNK> <UNK> and none of the characters is likable many scenes are filmed from the woods surrounding the river the girls are on to give a constant feeling that someone is stalking them which was a pathetic attempt to make up for the lack of story to tell br br perhaps i wouldn't have wasted my time to see the movie if it had been accurately described in reviews
<START> right up or down there with toys and jurassic park 2 and the phantom menace br br the premise sounded cool some of the commercials looked semi promising but alas the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot <UNK> and that was shown on the small <UNK> 30 second <UNK> br br if you want amateur writing second rate effects ridiculous costumes and an all around <UNK> by all means watch it the plot is recycled sci fi fodder too bad too because coming in i thought it would be bad but held out hope it may be the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen a lot br br bottom line don't watch it br br unless of course you liked any of the above 3 movies
<START> first of all i have watched this show since i was a little <UNK> and i have always loved it sure maybe i didn't understand it when i was that young but i still enjoyed it and now that i have been able to understand it for several years i love it even more the score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score i have ever heard every note is perfect i don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it br br moving on to this particular production this is magnificent of course no one could play mrs <UNK> besides angela lansbury and she does it perfectly and she should she has been playing this part for several years george is absolutely brilliant the best <UNK> todd i have ever heard he has a wonderful voice yet he can throw his voice so well his <UNK> is incredible as you can tell by the audience's reaction to it the judge toby <UNK> and are also so wonderful in their roles everyone is perfect well i still have to fast forward through <UNK> green <UNK> and bird she just doesn't sing that song well at all br br this show can be appreciated at all ages but it is not always accepted i am not your typical middle aged theater lover i am only 15 years old yet <UNK> todd has given me a greater appreciation for music than i have gotten from any other musical
<START> is an excellent miniseries dealing with drug <UNK> in europe this is the european produced <UNK> series on which the oscar nominated movie traffic is based on if you loved traffic then is a must see br br overall i would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone that is interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view the screenplay is exciting and unexpected as it weaves through the lives of drug dealers <UNK> <UNK> and police officers unlike other movies that <UNK> the issue of drugs presents it as is
<START> i too had waited a long time to see this film as far as i know it has never been released in australia so in the end i found a copy on the net and ordered it through there weeks after my order <UNK> it finally arrived and i was extremely excited to finally be sitting in front of my tv ready to watch a film that sounded so interesting and controversial and filmed in an area of the world where so many good movies are what a disappointment within the first few minutes i realised i'd ordered a b <UNK> but was still full of expectation i convinced my son 18 to watch it with me as i love sharing when i find a movie of value with good underlying statements and or story lines about half way through he got up and said he couldn't stand watching it any longer it was so predictable and amateurish i agreed but watched to the end the acting was atrocious even for b grade standards the stereotyping also predictable and i feel for the good folks of lake arthur who must've <UNK> after seeing the film depicting them in such a way no doubt some racial prejudices still exist in many parts of the world not just the states but really in this day and age i doubt they'd get away with all the ridiculous presented in this i had to double check the date the film was made as their attempts at <UNK> filming of the more gruesome scenes was something i'd expect from a high school <UNK> first attempt at making a film like i'd like to see this film put into the hands of experienced <UNK> and film makers its an old tale but one that could still pack a punch if dealt with <UNK> so disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations the soundtrack was probably the only thing i enjoyed
<START> i am from texas and my family a couple of years ago to <UNK> with my brother he suggested we go to see the church with the <UNK> i was absolutely blown away by the <UNK> that took place there the movie is great barbara <UNK> and william <UNK> were perfect for the parts they played it is amazing absolutely amazing if you have not seen the <UNK> in person it is worth the trip to go see it the wood is beautiful and the architecture is astounding just being in the <UNK> gives me <UNK> <UNK> to read about the history of the <UNK> and then to see its beauty is breathtaking see the movie it is great then see the <UNK> in person
<START> i absolutely positively can't believe my fellow imdb reviewers all the praise about how original this movie is it's like they've never seen ring or the million of <UNK> that's come out in the 10 years since that movie and some of them claim to be horror movie buffs i think not <UNK> is okay average i'd say i give it 5 out of 10 but there's just no way it's original and great and the most frightening thing i've ever seen as one reviewer said <UNK> people this one is plain it's predictable br br i swear if i see another ghost movie where the hero <UNK> the past of the ghost in order to find out why she's so mad and after them i'm going to scream br br original give me a break you people need to get out more or at least stop calling yourselves horror movie fans
<START> the man from <UNK> opens with a singing cowboy <UNK> a guitar on <UNK> this is how we're introduced to john <UNK> john wayne heading into town and looking for work when he helps <UNK> <UNK> george pre <UNK> hayes foil a bank robbery with his fancy shooting the <UNK> offers him an undercover job as a deputy to investigate the dalton valley <UNK> apparently the <UNK> winners of the big prize money in the <UNK> are a tight <UNK> band of bad boys in the employ of spike barton ed who also happens to head up the <UNK> <UNK> serious <UNK> to the supremacy of <UNK> top henchman <UNK> kent <UNK> <UNK> wind up severely ill or dead br br even back in these 1930's lone star westerns john wayne had a charismatic presence that hinted at future star quality if for nothing else seeing wayne so young in these films is a real treat the movie itself clips along at a quick fifty three minute pace much of it taken up by stock <UNK> footage of and indian parade and dance in the deciding <UNK> event <UNK> avoids disaster by discovering a <UNK> <UNK> inserted into the <UNK> of dynamite a <UNK> <UNK> on which he must <UNK> br br the ending is no surprise as <UNK> bad boys <UNK> winning the <UNK> events and go for the whole thirty thousand dollar pot of prize money <UNK> in the local bank but the <UNK> and <UNK> are there to foil their plans and save the day for the dalton valley <UNK> and as we've seen before in films like the arizona <UNK> and randy rides alone wayne's character <UNK> out the film in a <UNK> with a pretty young lady this time the <UNK> daughter <UNK> carter polly ann young who for him throughout the film
<START> why does c thomas <UNK> do these movies cruise one time co star does a huge blockbuster of <UNK> and <UNK> follows with this lame effort br br where do i start here production values i'll start with the good stuff the look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest the set ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad br br script terrible a series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like <UNK> throughout the movie the amount of times the scene faded to black and a second later in the same room was <UNK> very poor storyline but so was the cruise <UNK> takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off br br special fx okay i don't want to be too harsh here as i imagine the budget was smaller than <UNK> lunch bill but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done some shots are quite impressive mainly far off destruction shots of bridges washington liner but in the main the alien machines and <UNK> themselves are dreadful also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others br br acting i'm a fan of <UNK> but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low budget flicks he has <UNK> to the over acting bug a long time ago look at his performance in the <UNK> and compare it to this movie there is no comparison he <UNK> his facial expressions his <UNK> arms and legs where did he get that running style and for a final coup de <UNK> look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family hysterical but after saying all that he is still the best actor on show here busey is embarrassing to look at and peter green <UNK> is truly dead now baby <UNK> <UNK> through his one and only scene i honestly could not understand one word he said i even went so far as trying to <UNK> the subtitles on that scene but the dvd did not have subtitles this seems to be a real keep it in the family affair too as son the director's wife and the line producer all make it into the film none of them are good br br direction not bad but not good either br br score dismal br br overall a lame duck effort that will do nothing for <UNK> in his attempt to make it back to the big time he should take a look at rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the a list but if he keeps doing stuff like this he won't have a career soon enough br br 3 10
<START> carlos wants to make fun of <UNK> action racial stereotypes and related topics on his show which makes him a lot like supreme court justice thomas he's there because of his race and then <UNK> it he can supposedly make fun of <UNK> to no end because he is himself mexican and i would also <UNK> he can get away with making fun of the mentally challenged because any lay person can tell he's not the <UNK> tool though he is definitely a tool of some sort br br he is a hack comedian who even with a staff of writers can't put together 3 minutes of genuinely funny material in a 30 minute show i can't think of a single comedian who is regularly on tv that carlos can hold a candle to except maybe larry the cable guy not too surprisingly he also has a show on comedy central to <UNK> to the exact same audience no doubt br br if you ever see the <UNK> jerry seinfeld chris rock jon stewart etc talk about comedy you really get a feeling for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a funny interesting comedic voice all that work was completely <UNK> by <UNK> his comedic voice is in part stolen from other better comics and in part hidden by his <UNK> for yelling his unfunny <UNK> racist tripe <UNK> show is beloved by some of the at least i don't suck that badly crowd who i firmly believe watch it to feel better from his <UNK> about the <UNK> down of society unfortunately carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on that topic
<START> i don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about the main thing you'll notice is the extreme <UNK> of the entire production the acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street the sound is really annoying a medicine <UNK> <UNK> with all the gusto of a <UNK> going off in your ear while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one fifth as loud <UNK> on set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree with dialog taking a distant back seat the theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released as large portions of the film don't have any music at all camera work can best be described as a <UNK> mess with close up shots where a medium angle would be much better <UNK> walking around and <UNK> the camera every which way absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand if the cameraman was a foot <UNK> than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone's heads well so be it editing is just a butcher job everything is tossed together in the most abrupt manner possible nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word i don't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder i tend to think it was the latter br br i only made it about three quarters of the way through this thing before i turned it off i just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production i couldn't take it anymore it's like a <UNK> grade audio visual class project
<START> this movie is a sleeper i've watched every miniseries that was ever on tv some many times and this one is the best wonderfully cast superbly acted and the characters are well developed helen morse perfectly fits the part of jean <UNK> <UNK> in control sharp and a bit <UNK> she <UNK> well off of joe <UNK> the cowboy <UNK> it'll be okay sort of guy i was sorry that the movie didn't stick to the book in that there was no romantic interest between <UNK> and jean <UNK> for those who don't know this is taken from a true story about english women <UNK> around for 3 years by the japanese who indeed did not know what to do with them very few of them survived <UNK> talked to one of them and this is her story this movie deserves to be in everyone's collection who loves wwii stories
<START> this is one of the stupidest movies ever not the stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest this is <UNK> 1 2 minutes of sleep inducing material probably jim worst movie ever the last 30 seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for on the other hand if you are a die hard jim <UNK> ernest fan then like me you must add this film to your collection it does have brief rare moments of humor although they are few and far between the mere fact that this movie is so hard to find makes it a <UNK> item and a must have for your ernest collection i was lucky to find this film online at a dirt cheap price a couple years ago i believe i paid 1 99 plus <UNK> for it and it was the only copy i could find anywhere even though this is a truly all around horrible movie it is still a must have if you are a jim <UNK> fan and an ernest movie collector such as i on a scale of 1 to 10 i give this movie a 2 but thats only because i've never seen a 1 before
<START> i was expecting this movie to be a stinker but i wanted to see for myself but i was surprised how good of a movie this was i know longer movies often don't do well at the box office but why this was pulled and not allowed to be viewed by the public is beyond me it <UNK> my interest throughout and the scenery and photography is breathtaking at times the plot was good and the morality play was a good one i liked the realism which was along the lines of <UNK> i had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it
<START> i can't believe it were they crazy in filming a movie about <UNK> in southern california for god's sake there's palm <UNK> everywhere in one of the opening scenes a guy says welcome to <UNK> and throws down a newspaper the newspaper says something like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doesn't have a <UNK> it has a times as in <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> times <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> newspaper maybe the film makers should have done a little research i mean my god at least get the name of the newspaper right or film in locations that look at least remotely like <UNK>
<START> dark harbor is a moody little <UNK> into murky emotional waters that run extremely deep it's basically a 3 character piece featuring a finely layered performance by the always great <UNK> with polly walker and norman <UNK> also excellent <UNK> the other two sides of this strange triangle a perfect late night cable film with a surprise ending to boot
<START> hilarious from start to finish there's got to be great courage to handle the theme of death with a smile specially when two funeral <UNK> are battling for control of the market a classic <UNK> and a revolutionary one where every funeral is a show lead by christopher walken a treat in the role of the <UNK> american but the rest of the cast is great also and this one is another success that only uk is capable of making surprising among the ensemble cast is <UNK> <UNK> that strikes in another <UNK> accent included always sporting a smile on its face it seems like a <UNK> that there could be so much comedy to be taken from a movie that could be called four <UNK> and one wedding but you'll understand when you see it
<START> ok so paris hilton sucks in it typical <UNK> <UNK> but the rest of the actors are just great i watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film <UNK> michael murray is and he's just a ace actor total hero man the main girl who is the sister to nick <UNK> is such a brilliant actress thumbs up i think it's so different to films out their these days most of them to go with <UNK> ghosts but here you have a theme about wax i totally got <UNK> out by the wax models in the house although they looked so real i still haven't got the story with the twins at the moment i am just waiting to get the dvd then watch it all over again thumbs up to such a great film 11 10 all those people who don't like it please don't bother 2 <UNK> my opinion as mostly everyone thinks its cool to do so also i think the paris scene when she <UNK> to her underwear is totally <UNK> why not just get a dog <UNK> some cat be more entertaining then that when paris death scene came up i thought it was poor as she still kept running although a knife just went up her foot hmm interesting br br <UNK> all the way
<START> this documentary is <UNK> with problems br br how arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family i understand you think the subject is interesting i was bored with it this isn't a fascinating story to me and i don't know why you would think it was br br i don't want to come off as mean but i have to say most of the people in this film are just not attractive and that's ok not everyone is pretty but your camera technique to stick the lens in their face so you can't help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it is filling your <UNK> tv is not enjoyable i had to put my hand up half the time to shield myself from the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under eyes and yellow teeth really i'm trying not to sound <UNK> but pull the camera back so its not like total strangers are breathing in my face br br the camera work in this film is rank amateur level it's the kind of camera work you see from everyone with a camcorder at a family <UNK> uninteresting framing <UNK> even static shots are done <UNK> put a little effort into it if you're going to do this for a living br br i honestly can't see what the big deal is about this thing
<START> i saw it at a german press screening without giving too much away most critics really seemed to like it very much there was even applause afterwards which is quite unusual for that species from my point of view and until now it was the funniest movie of the year it keeps the charm and wit of the three w g shorts and it is <UNK> with many references to these and other movies of course there are obvious <UNK> to monster and werewolf movies especially to an american werewolf in london jaws king kong and even to peter jackson's <UNK> dead alive but also to other genres br br characterization was better done in chicken run but that movie had a complete new cast where introduction was necessary here you are already able to know the two main characters so the new wallace and <UNK> movie is enjoyed best if you watched and liked the shorts already yet it also works on its own chicken run had the more convenient but also more storytelling plot instead this new <UNK> masterpiece keeps that <UNK> and somehow more isolated feeling of the w g shorts children should also enjoy it very much especially because of the sweet <UNK> if you love cute <UNK> this is a must see for you and because <UNK> has a lot do to and really steals the show children also love dogs but many jokes are thought for a more adult audience there are even soft sexual <UNK> in it the movie manages like shrek 1 2 and the <UNK> to <UNK> high level entertainment for the whole family with adding a british and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of american animated movies br br the animation is  as expected  superb and they kept true to the <UNK> style because they didn't put in too many digital effects i realized just a few when it came to <UNK> <UNK> br br finally the score works fine in the movie although one of the main themes definitely is borrowed by randy <UNK> <UNK> score br br the bad thing is it will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from nick park co
<START> this movie was horrible and corny james <UNK> is rolling in his grave this movie was nothing at all like the book and made a mockery of it no one should see this movie unless they want to gag
<START> my daughter liked it but i was <UNK> that a character in this movie <UNK> as if it isn't awful enough to see product placement actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies at least children movies should be more <UNK> i wonder was that intentional did big <UNK> <UNK> the film what does it take to <UNK> smoking from films at least films intended for children and <UNK> my daughter liked it but i was <UNK> that a character in this movie <UNK> as if it isn't awful enough to see product placement actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies at least children movies should be more <UNK> i wonder was that intentional did big <UNK> <UNK> the film what does it take to <UNK> smoking from films at least films intended for children and <UNK>
<START> i love the jurassic park movies they are three of my all time favorite movies br br and i hate this game if there was one game i wish i never own for the super <UNK> was this one br br how can a game based on a classic movie be just too awful and to make it worst i was scare of this game when i was a kid br br how dumb was that but then again i was a kid when this game was first out br br the game play in this game is just odd one minute it's a action game and then it's a <UNK> what in the world is wrong with making up your mind when making a video game br br the sound in the game is just terrible to listen br br the music is just too sick to listen to br br the in the game don't work most of the time br br jurassic park the game is just a waste of time and money and won't be a classic br br avoid at all cost
<START> as a father of four in his forties i thought this film made compelling viewing if not edge of the seat stuff i deserves a far higher rating than the 4 3 that it had when i wrote this i gave it 7 br br i agree with some of the comments about the characters but cameron diaz was again <UNK> in yet another very different role the plot was a little silly but the point of the film for me was beautifully summed up in the final quite surreal sequence a moving ending for any parent br br i could imagine that a young single bloke might find the film quite boring but for other people not fixed on high doses of <UNK> would find something sweet in this
<START> this movie had all the potential and <UNK> of a great feel good great love story the cast is perfect the visuals work the original premise works the characters work but the story moves from one chess move to the next in a most predictable way not one character in the movie has any depth or has any depth explained by the director all we know about catherine zeta jones character is she is obsessed with her world nobody is allowed in and nobody challenges her world that much is obvious but the remaining characters all have their own <UNK> that are really never explored or exposed aaron character had so much more to offer to the story but wasn't allowed <UNK> character is so easy to understand that her performance comes across somewhat predictable and phony in the end everything <UNK> back to the forced <UNK> world of catherine zeta jones which the audience never totally falls for honestly her <UNK> world is not much more than a portrayal of a selfish self obsessed spoiled lady who most people would not have much time or sympathy for in the real world the director needed to make her a hero and never does in the end it is character that ultimately wins because he wins br br not a lousy movie just a movie that could have been a lot better with more depth of personalities allowed in explained and exposed br br cheers
<START> 2 outta 5 stars br br i have no idea what the title is supposed even less of an idea of what is supposed to be going on in this movie half the time yet it still kept me sort of interested this is low low budget film making along the lines of el <UNK> filmed in <UNK> and for what it's worth the shots are very well composed and visually stylish directed written by and starring comic book writer artist michael i guess it's no surprise that the film looks good unfortunately some of the acting is beyond bad and the rest is competent at best himself comes off the best but only because he doesn't actually speak much he just <UNK> around looking cool most of the time or running from crazed <UNK> who are trying to kill him the sound is also pretty bad almost as if it was unfinished in places maybe they couldn't afford to pay for the music they'd planned to use strange vaguely science plot similar in tone to the man who fell to earth but most of the film <UNK> down to a standard run from the bad guys and kill them before they kill you plot ultimately too <UNK> to be successful but not without interest for adventurous movie <UNK>
<START> it is important to realise that <UNK> was a committed <UNK> film maker who held some very specific and particular theories about what film could achieve and how br br it is simply <UNK> to compare alexander <UNK> <UNK> with anything from a similar period in the us this film comes from the oldest film school in the world from another continent from an entirely different approach to cinema br br to appreciate this film a little more try finding out about and theories of montage for example or read the <UNK> entry on <UNK> film theory if you're feeling really bold you might even investigate the forms of <UNK> br br it follows that if you watch this film without some understanding of <UNK> ideas and ideals you probably won't get it in alexander <UNK> the main characters aren't playing themselves they are meant to be of their <UNK> character <UNK> and his <UNK> are deliberately shown larger than life because they represent <UNK> heroic aspects of the entire russian people br br the acting isn't wooden it's meant to be slightly mannered it represents a completely different school from the more <UNK> narrative style which hollywood was rapidly <UNK> <UNK> films are especially designed not to be realistic if anything seems somewhat obvious whether lighting or language or a pose struck by an actor it's meant to be that way <UNK> was one of the early of film as an art form not just as entertainment br br if the editing sometimes seems to consist of a clash of images well that's the idea shots are meant to contrast with each other <UNK> films contain and <UNK> elements of a political philosophical argument namely <UNK> <UNK> br br so sit back shout <UNK> for russia and her folk hero <UNK> boo at the cowardly <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> and enjoy the difference
<START> i waited a long time to finally see what i thought was going to be a fun caper flick and was shocked to discover shoddy direction awkward dialogue a lackluster pace <UNK> slapstick gags and an overall <UNK> that <UNK> the film throughout just not funny the sets looked cheap the costumes by the usually excellent are <UNK> and distracting even the title song is annoying the whole children's book characters doesn't come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job for a film that seems to aim a <UNK> at the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> systems the filmmakers have no problem in being unfair themselves allowing hispanic black and gay stereotypes played at such a cruel level the look of the film resembles any episode of love american style this is not a compliment tacky seventies fashions abound in this world of white collar <UNK> that only lends an air of <UNK> to every situation outside of a clever initial idea and two capable stars in jane fonda and george segal this dated exercise in social commentary comes off as forced and mean spirited to <UNK> especially to gay people if you want a better caper film you're better off with the hot rock with george segal and robert redford or what's up doc with ryan <UNK> and barbra streisand now that's funny
<START> spoilers ahead mel has got it going on from the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs dave shows why he is a comedic force cary carries the movie most of the time but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from robin hood right from the beginning this movie <UNK> it's self not to be taken seriously if you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie what makes this movie special you say throughout the movie you see and walk beside each other becoming great friends as robin <UNK> <UNK> but it is never told or fails to grasp that he is black until the crowd says a black sheriff <UNK> he's black that is a timeless scene simple one of the most movies of our time
<START> this outing of <UNK> includes one of his best <UNK> ever frank <UNK> <UNK> makes the film <UNK> and <UNK> compete for the laughs and both receive plenty <UNK> works for a small no where town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials when things go wrong the city fathers allow <UNK> to take the fall frank character befriends <UNK> and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and <UNK> good name this film shows the usual <UNK> scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film this may have been <UNK> last good outing when you have an extra 90 minutes get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon don <UNK>
<START> this film is about a mysterious love letter that turned 4 people's love life upside down br br the idea of the film is interesting and the film could have been funny however this film is simply what a romantic comedy should not be the characters are <UNK> introduced at first so it gets so confusing the supporting characters come and go without adequate reasons as if they exist just for one particular scene and then <UNK> into thin air the pacing is awfully slow that it makes 90 minutes seem more like <UNK> minutes br br it could have been romantic and funny but this film spectacularly failed to do either
<START> surprisingly effective british drama about two very different people who find common ground and in particular the of one of them an <UNK> spike type youth <UNK> with <UNK> is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth robertson with cerebral <UNK> robertson has never known anything outside of the home but <UNK> has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world together they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength <UNK> physical shortcomings the two leads are terrific especially robertson who must surely have spent some time studying the disabled to pull off this <UNK> role he appears in almost every scene and acts up an absolute storm to anyone who doesn't know they might think he really has <UNK> highly recommended
<START> i just saw this at the philadelphia film festival it was the most wonderful movie the best i've seen in quite a while the <UNK> character of is an open exploring and as <UNK> in the film love filled person portrayed by the beautiful <UNK> the accompanying music is <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> to the soul br br each character seems to be conflicted in some way and their interactions w conflicts make for a great story the tale told by a k <UNK> as the old man was most magically done i wanted it to go on and on br br that <UNK> seemed to remember his place throughout added get power to the story a refreshing change to the bubble headed plots of many modern writers br br all and all an excellent film go see
<START> so often these lifetime flicks are one dimension with over the top characterizations and performances and with contrived plot lines and <UNK> which are intended to trade any semblance of reality for drama br br but most of all many of these flicks provide characters where it's difficult to feel a trace of sympathy or empathy for even the good guy good gal characters much less the bad ones br br however here the performance were all good the characters realistic and the relationships among the three leads as well as the ex husband father and the two females <UNK> true throughout br br the mother's boyfriend was portrayed as being about halfway in age between mother and daughter and the actors were age appropriate to this in term of their actual ages none of the characters was portrayed at an extreme either all good or all bad and all <UNK> true br br without in any way <UNK> his allowing the relationship with his <UNK> <UNK> to advance to the level which it did you can still feel some sympathy for him without blame br br neither mother nor daughter were perfect neither good nor bad but simply two individuals whose relationship seemed realistic and not contrived by the script writer br br lifetime flicks even those which begin with some semblance of <UNK> often end with a deranged character <UNK> a <UNK> knife or such other stories seem to need to provide the everyone lived happily ever after close br br this film presented a realistic premise story and resolution from start to finish a welcomed variation to the norm of this genre
<START> wild rebels is fun in a bad way but also frustrating due to the actual good or at least <UNK> elements in the story it deals with a race car driver steve who gets mixed up in a group of <UNK> called <UNK> angels who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank meanwhile also gets <UNK> by the cops to report back to them what the angels are up to and where they'll rob next it's not even that the film is really too <UNK> though it does of course carry the significantly crude and stupid music in the film from the band on stage in one scene to performing if you could call that <UNK> that to the regular generic score br br it's just that there's not more care taken by the filmmaker into putting a little more logic direction and better actors for the parts as it is i didn't have a major <UNK> towards the film as i did with the but it almost left me a little indifferent to it all too what could come through as being unpredictable only comes through with stupid things like the name of the florida town ho ho so it's not completely un worthy then of its mystery science theater 3000 status as of late the commentary is good on the movie even if once or twice i almost wanted to hear what the characters on screen were saying in case it might have some worth wild rebels might be more of a good time if you've got a six pack and low expectations but as it is i wouldn't watch it again
<START> i've read all the dave novels and consider james lee burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer i've also visited new <UNK> and much of to be able to better <UNK> the setting in most of these books needless to say i greatly anticipated seeing in the electric <UNK> especially since i thought tommy lee jones would be terrific as br br i was greatly disappointed the story was very choppy the interplay with the ghosts of <UNK> dead was shallow and lost the impact and <UNK> it added to the book and tommy lee jones was <UNK> <UNK> and difficult to understand as dr the best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my <UNK> to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old made for tv movies i expected jill st john or cameron mitchell to show up at any time br br the location settings were accurate and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and eerie above ground <UNK> of south <UNK> too bad the story's disjointed presentation and tommy lee's sub par performance <UNK> with the unique mood and <UNK> <UNK> of the region br br next to final comment in the novels dave <UNK> is streak because of the distinct streak of silver gray hair on one side of his head similar to how the <UNK> paulie <UNK> would appear if he were seen only in profile tommy lee had no such streak in this film probably because the <UNK> are james lee burke fans and they <UNK> the streak out after witnessing mr <UNK> poor imitation of dave br br final comment while i generally find alec baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles he was by far a better in <UNK> prisoners than tommy lee was in in the electric <UNK> also <UNK> prisoners is much more interesting and exciting with uniformly believable performances and more <UNK> atmosphere than this new movie br br in the electric <UNK> is okay to watch when one feels like out and there's nothing better on tv but then so are <UNK>
<START> it was sad that committed lasted only two weeks in dallas theaters i thought this movie had a lot going for it the script was funny full of subtle emotional shifts and it had a good message the acting was great everyone did a superb job especially with the <UNK> subtleties heather graham not only has beautiful eyes she has <UNK> eyes for that matter all the actors were attractive why it didn't do well in its theatrical release i don't know other than the studio didn't seem to have much of a push behind it but it deserved to do better and i hope it does well on video it's certainly one of my favorites for the first half of 2000
<START> the next karate kid in my opinion is an excellent martial arts flick i thought that eric chris conrad and julie <UNK> <UNK> looked good in their prom <UNK> to me ned michael was a real bully this was because he got julie in trouble with principal <UNK> eugene <UNK> if you ask me colonel <UNK> michael <UNK> was a pure a this was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes my favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between julie and the <UNK> elite in conclusion i highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial arts flicks or are fans of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is a plot driven movie and extremely entertaining nothing startling or original within the plot but <UNK> it moves along at a great pace and therefore keeps your attention i didn't really notice the acting which i guess is a good thing john mills was fine but did seem to take everything in his <UNK> somewhat considering how his life was falling apart around him he would be <UNK> on the head stand up 20 seconds later dust himself down and carry on as if nothing had happened a minor <UNK> in a film with a strong story authentic locations and a plot that continually keeps you guessing right up to its conclusion
<START> yet another foreign war movie that puts hollywood to shame real in the same proportions that hollywood productions such as <UNK> war and are unreal a moving story backed up by strong acting and great film making
<START> i liked most of this film as other reviews mentioned it has a good cast the plot is interesting enough all in all it is fun to watch br br but the ending i feel is completely <UNK> it left me <UNK> yes you expect people crossing and double crossing each other in this sort of movie but <UNK> crossing well if it's justified by the plot then why not br br but that's the bad part there's completely no need for it after a certain point it's all scheming with completely no meaning here comes the spoiler after the airport scene <UNK> and his <UNK> already have the money i couldn't understand the need for the rest of the <UNK> is it all necessary just to rub nose in the fact that he's been fooled i don't buy it br br so 6 out of 10 for 3 4 of the film and 2 out of 10 for the ending
<START> <UNK> 15 park <UNK> is a film about nature of reality br br a young <UNK> girl prone to imagining things and hearing voices possibly out of sheer boredom is taken to be <UNK> by her educated father and control freak educated elder step sister controlled <UNK> and treated like an <UNK> even if out of love and affection she has ghost of a chance to develop as a normal person when a boy offers to marry her her father and step sister <UNK> try to convince him against taking such a step a traumatic experience caused primarily due to her <UNK> existence finally takes her across the line of no return and she lives full time in a <UNK> world of her own br br the family and society around her are <UNK> of her <UNK> and want to <UNK> them with electric shock therapy anything even though they all have <UNK> of one kind or other of their own br br her mother doesn't see the irony in allowing a ghost buster to treat her of the <UNK> her step sister is a professor of physics teaching among other things quantum <UNK> a subject in which a stream of experts accept parallel multi <UNK> and many more <UNK> in space than the 3 we see a friend <UNK> with admiration an experience with a holy person claiming to hear <UNK> voices far away george w bush has real or fake <UNK> of weapons of mass destruction and is allowed to <UNK> iraq br br as some viewers have already pointed out <UNK> <UNK> away from attacking the mother of all <UNK> mainstream <UNK> which is a pity br br in other words accepted reality is what a majority or an influential minority believe in that's been the case since the beginning and lot more powerful people than in the film among them bruno and <UNK> have suffered as a consequence br br the film's controversial and difficult ending was necessary to show it's a film about nature of reality and not the case study of a <UNK> girl br br all the cast have given great performances but <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> have <UNK> <UNK> has produced an outstanding philosophical film
<START> this movie started with some promise big name cast good looking sets but then it fell apart br br most of the time it can't tell whether it's a serious movie or a comedy one minute they're talking about how there's no joy in killing and the next there is a fight scene set to funny music and funny banter br br some of the acting is pretty bad mainly from patrick <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> she also gets some <UNK> lines like when i marry it will be about love ugh br br but the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring not enough action not enough humor not enough plot not much of anything really just a lot of clichés and cheesy moments br br also a movie with dragon in the title should contain a lot more dragons than the few and pathetic cgi dragons that appeared in this movie br br can't the scifi channel show any good movies
<START> strange things happen to americans will greg <UNK> <UNK> alexandra paul and their young daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> real life daughter when they move into a large newly inherited house in ireland <UNK> corpses are found in the <UNK> a turkey <UNK> blood furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and a <UNK> old lady show up to scare the little girl <UNK> <UNK> are eventually called in to <UNK> the evil spirits but <UNK> becomes possessed anyway and chases everyone around with a meat <UNK> br br this film is full of cliches but there's a standout performance from alexandra paul too bad it doesn't belong in this movie nor any other i can think of off hand she can barely keep a straight face and her over <UNK> and hysterical screaming <UNK> are a joy to behold in any case she's a lot more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie br br score 3 out of 10
<START> for starters i once met the director when he was going to ww2 re <UNK> with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked <UNK> good i really wish he'd kept that up because as much as i applaud what he accomplished on a clearly next to nothing budget when i popped out the dvd i just wondered why i sat through almost two hours of nothing there's no real plot to speak of you don't really care what happens to the characters maybe the italian troops and some of the germans and the ending is yet another art film commentary on the <UNK> of war i could have told someone how it would end once i got through the first ten minutes i knew the germans would have a few <UNK> <UNK> to fight to the death i knew most of the <UNK> would be killed it was just too <UNK> obvious and while i'm on the subject i was shocked to see so much of the <UNK> side done well yet the <UNK> side done <UNK> all the character development was clearly for non english speaking roles the <UNK> simply got <UNK> hard in this film and i can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the us army works the phrases <UNK> actions were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the american military at all had i now known who had directed this film i'd have <UNK> it was directed and written by a german
<START> although it can be very tedious at times this movie is really not all that bad the acting is fairly well done if stereotypical and the production values are pretty high considering some of the sci fi movies that were to come later in the decade br br my biggest problem with this film are some of the very outdated characterizations in it there's the guy from texas the professional scientist and worst of all the woman scientist who finally realizes her <UNK> for a film seeking to make a statement about mankind it loses some of it's impact by <UNK> its characters through sexist stereotypes
<START> i remember hearing about this movie and how it played at nearly every drive in theatre here in toronto it's about a group of girls that are not accepted by the other <UNK> at their college so they start up their own and of course call it h o t s it's a fun movie that is just <UNK> with drive in nostalgia lots of fully <UNK> t shirts <UNK> fighting and a football game showdown like no other it's been compared to animal house which is a good movie in it's own right but to me nothing <UNK> to h o t s it has it's own brand of fun character if you are looking for a classic t movie look no further because the h o t s girls are to the rescue boom boom shorts all
<START> while driving in a dangerous <UNK> manner on a lonely road in the night the teenager cliff jay r <UNK> has a car accident with his friends lauren christine taylor alex kim murphy and eric christopher masterson while spending the cold night stranded in the woods around a <UNK> they kill time telling ghost stories in the honeymoon the couple rick ron <UNK> and valerie jennifer macdonald travels in their <UNK> to las vegas in their honeymoon rick takes a <UNK> to visit the <UNK> <UNK> in the night but the stranger cole <UNK> james <UNK> them to leave the spot since dangerous creatures attack people in the full moon in people can <UNK> too on the eve of her <UNK> birthday amanda alex <UNK> tells her internet friend jessica that she is alone at home however jessica is actually a psychopath in the the biker scott glenn quinn is crossing the country on his motorcycle when he has a problem with his bike he finds an isolated house where the gorgeous dumb heather wallace <UNK> lives with her father when the man returns from his herd scott finds the truth about heather br br <UNK> tales presents three good horror tales with monsters <UNK> and ghosts and a surprising twist in the end the weakest segment is the hook with eddie and jenny but the other stories a great the plot point is totally unexpected and gives a great conclusion to this above average horror movie my vote is seven br br title da <UNK> midnight tales
<START> <UNK> valley <UNK> is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle <UNK> <UNK> is found wandering around covered in <UNK> blood her parents <UNK> randy <UNK> <UNK> leslie <UNK> mitchell own the ranch are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself is considered a danger to herself other's ranch hand ex priest <UNK> del <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a possible case of possession when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it <UNK> calls priest <UNK> cameron who is her other daughter <UNK> madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he <UNK> <UNK> accepts the job of performing the <UNK> that will hopefully <UNK> the demon inside isabelle an innocent girl free br br directed by ethan <UNK> i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching <UNK> valley <UNK> i kept asking the same question over over again why do i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this <UNK> valley <UNK> is a complete total utter <UNK> rip off of the exorcist 1973 you literally <UNK> off the major plot points that the two share there's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past against other's the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is <UNK> by doctor's the priest with a troubled past the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where <UNK> valley <UNK> is different other than it's total crap is that it tries to give all the character's some screen time tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it's so badly written acted it just ends up being boring the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the character's are poorly written fleshed out at times i wondered whether <UNK> valley <UNK> was a spoof there's a silly scene in which a vet tries to <UNK> the possessed isabelle with horse after he states that she needs a <UNK> he enters her room with a huge <UNK> hidden behind his back there are a few scenes in which people are <UNK> accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at least br br according to some text before the opening credits <UNK> valley <UNK> was based on yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called the exorcist this piece of text also states that the <UNK> scenes were <UNK> by a real priest there isn't even any decent gore or exploitation to <UNK> things up there's a scene of a cut arm there's a dead dog someone is stabbed with a <UNK> that's about it there's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be <UNK> i would imagine the only reason <UNK> valley <UNK> has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of are seen one pair of naked female is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere a really amateurish feel to the whole film too br br with a supposed budget of about 1 000 000 i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly cheap throughout there are no special effects to speak of the production values are rock bottom the acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a <UNK> a terrible accent he is better than this br br <UNK> valley <UNK> is a complete rip off of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic the makers are thirty five years too late anyway a total turkey from start to finish
<START> spoilers i rented <UNK> or <UNK> in english on the strength of director <UNK> <UNK> later effort the others based on what a brilliantly <UNK> and <UNK> effective <UNK> that film was i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror instead i wound up with the most tedious preposterous excuse for a lame <UNK> slasher movie i've seen since the german film <UNK> which this one kinda reminded me of br br the plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes it revolves around innocent n pretty psychology student <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a jessica <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the subject of violence in films through some far fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here she winds up in possession of a <UNK> tape on which two men torture <UNK> and kill a young girl for the camera angela and her horror buff friend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it br br this leads to well nothing br br they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers since they <UNK> refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events even when their own lives at risk and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls there is only one proper <UNK> the type of camera the killers used is discovered and that's a a really weak one and b <UNK> out in the first 20 minutes the rest of the so called <UNK> just occurs through blind luck increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are <UNK> in merely to pad out the running time br br seriously <UNK> might know his stuff about ghost stories but he's clearly never read a detective book in his life the key to a good <UNK> is to have a large <UNK> of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever <UNK> and the <UNK> discovery of more and more evidence before moving in for the final twist in <UNK> potential spoiler ahead the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur <UNK> almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying <UNK> to throw us off the <UNK> until he runs out of ideas throws his hands up and says ok ya got me it was him after all as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes no such luck you're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after br br the only thing that drags <UNK> down further from just being a dumb badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous muddled up <UNK> about violence in films i have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to <UNK> in a ton of misguided confused <UNK> in between the rest of the <UNK> and say look at me i'm political the final scenes in which the point of the movie is supposedly <UNK> home are so utterly absurd and <UNK> one can't help but wonder if <UNK> feels embarrassed now when he watches this if he doesn't he certainly should this is total <UNK> night at the slasher <UNK> stuff br br overall i can't believe i wasted two whole hours it felt like at least six on this just hoping something might happen the urban legend of <UNK> <UNK> and that is basically all they are despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world is an area that can be so <UNK> exploited in good horror films <UNK> anyone but it's so easy to step over the line into <UNK> <UNK> it be cool if ' territory with it ie my little eye <UNK> hits an all time low for the <UNK> <UNK> genre on every level this one is better left dead and buried i'll award it a 1 out of 10 for some nice lighting but that's all it's getting
<START> this film is hilarious brilliant comedy but only because of one actor chris <UNK> the best <UNK> <UNK> i have ever seen it's something special about him he is just so funny br br what a shame he is not with us anymore he will sorely be missed
<START> this was only the second version of the classic story by charles dickens i had seen and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst the film opens with a quick live action piece where simon <UNK> as charles dickens begins the story of a christmas carol and then obviously it goes to animated story itself you probably already know it <UNK> scrooge is the <UNK> cold blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates christmas he is visited by <UNK> <UNK> nicolas cage who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of christmas past jane present sir michael and the silent future yet to come after all this he obviously realises the true magic of christmas and promises to be <UNK> in future the only changes i noticed to the story were scrooge having mice as friends a stupid idea <UNK> ex love belle kate <UNK> needing to see him to help at the <UNK> the ghost of christmas present showing the two kids want and ignorance scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice and he's worried he can't keep his promise to stay nice also starring rhys <UNK> as bob <UNK> juliet stevenson as mrs <UNK> jones as <UNK> nephew fred and colin <UNK> as the animation is not great quality the actors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage the only good thing that comes from this film is the good voice of kate <UNK> singing the closing song what if as for the rest it is just excruciatingly awful very poor
<START> i have always been a fan of this largely unseen filming of the gershwin opera since i last saw it in 1959 as many of you know it has been <UNK> on video or dvd in fact the gershwin family sought to destroy all existing <UNK> br br yet for some reason hopefully <UNK> an end to its opposition the gershwin family recently <UNK> the showing of a <UNK> print at the museum of the moving image in <UNK> queens br br well the wide screen technicolor print was excellent not perfect but excellent the sound was outstanding in road show quality <UNK> the folks who saw this in its original release wouldn't have seen a much better copy the program notes include the original variety review which <UNK> that people might <UNK> at the <UNK> limited release ticket price of 3 50 br br and as much as i loved it originally and <UNK> was better than i remembered it it's just wonderful sidney <UNK> as was at the point where his career was just beginning to catch fire and his charisma shines through dorothy <UNK> as <UNK> is spectacularly beautiful <UNK> peters as crown is <UNK> <UNK> pearl <UNK> as maria provides a few comic moments although her role is small and sammy davis jr as sporting life steals every scene he's in he's especially riveting in his two big numbers it ain't necessarily so and there's a boat that's soon for new york that last one won applause in the screening i saw br br and <UNK> is set bound but it really doesn't matter when the set is as gorgeous as this one the costumes are also outstanding br br sidney and <UNK> singing voices are dubbed in but they are dubbed in extremely well the exquisite <UNK> is sung by clara played by a young <UNK> <UNK> her singing also is dubbed actually only pearl and sammy do their own <UNK> br br the music is sublime of course but what really struck me this time was how much emotion preminger got out of the story people were actually in the audience a number of times once when <UNK> sings that beautiful i loves you and i got a kick out of the audience actually laughing out loud at the lines in it ain't necessarily so could it be they had never heard this song before or never really listened to it i believe that much of the emotional impact of this film is due to and performances you root for their love to win out br br a minor <UNK> with the <UNK> minute running time one or two slow spot and a stereotypical <UNK> n andy kind of scene about <UNK> seeing a <UNK> lawyer to get a divorce from crown even though she's not even married to him i would have cut that and the beginning is a little confusing both title characters are introduced <UNK> they're part of the movie before you realize who they are br br and i don't think preminger used a single close up in the entire movie it all seems to be shot in 3 4 which i'm guessing was his way of working with the wide screen br br and <UNK> has always been a cult film for those of us who saw it for those of us who loved the soundtrack and for some of us who have only heard about it let's hope they find a way to re release this and put it out on dvd it deserves the <UNK> audience possible
<START> can there be a worst film even ed wood at his horrific worst couldn't come up with something this bad cheesy stupid long <UNK> preposterous and those are the good points i saw this trash back in the early 80's when i was incredibly bored to begin with and actually sat through the entire thing without blowing my brains out although that probably would have been a more pleasant experience i actually remembered it because it was so bad it makes me sad in a way because some of the best directors got their start by making tv movies ie spielberg and it was a wonderful way for them to get their initial material before the public but crap like this just totally killed the entire process
<START> there was a time in the us that everything was possible on film so came the movies containing horror and explicit <UNK> the best known are forced entry and but of course those were made with a bit of budget all shown on <UNK> in ny but hey there were other <UNK> out there that showed no budget wet wilderness is an example of it it <UNK> the underground scene after a while so copies were available but as seen on other reviews some copies were abrupt cut at the end but the version i watched was complete well i would call this one more a porn one then a <UNK> there is a serial killer around but he likes more to watch others have sex instead of killing them when he kills it's done off screen the acting is the worst i ever seen and i guessed that the so called actors didn't like what they are doing for example in the beginning when we have the lesbian scene watch one girl stop performing and pulls a <UNK> hair out of here mouth then continues doing what was happening or when mother is riding the black man the daughter is sitting in the grass annoyed by ants but it is the storyline that made this one famous incest and racism is what this made it famous when there is blood watch the two girls sitting there waiting for a cue to act god this is worse but still one to have if you are into sleaze and <UNK> be sure that you have the full version
<START> <UNK> that's right folks this is undoubtedly the worst show in the history of television if you want to watch a sad lonely and unfunny hack comedian attempt to entertain the masses with a half hour of pale and tired social <UNK> that your mildly retarded cousin commented on at the <UNK> dinner table then this might be the show for you this is billed as edgy comedy my friends but to be honest this makes tim allen look like richard <UNK> avoid at all costs unless you're a <UNK>
<START> having endured this film last night i turned off the dvd player with a sense of deserving a <UNK> for having the <UNK> to see it through to the end throughout the film i felt that i was watching the storyline <UNK> that you get in a high budget porn movie the acting was stiff and taut camera work appalling and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local high school amateur society br br the only saving grace for this movie was that it had amy adams and harriet harris in its credits other than that it was pure <UNK>
<START> absolutely inane film starring <UNK> and <UNK> even our young children would become increasingly annoyed with this complete mess of a film br br <UNK> as what a look he had on his face sure he had to be part of this dreadful film br br did anyone notice that mother in the film sounded and looked like fay <UNK> luckily for ms <UNK> that she wasn't in the film br br there is really no excitement hear for children the jokes if any are quite stale some of the singing is nicely done but the lyrics are ridiculous
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a stunning and heartbreaking story about the two <UNK> seth and <UNK> robin <UNK> gives a fantastic performance as <UNK> suffering from <UNK> getting <UNK> and <UNK> as the movie progresses this movie is not very optimistic and it's very hard emotional but at the same time very romantic it's hard to explain but see it and find out for yourself it's definitely worth it
<START> i will not say much about this film because there is not much to say because there is not much there to talk about the only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from atlantis the lost empire are back several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters it has horrible comedy horrible animation and james arnold taylor trying to copy the wonderful one and only michael j fox as milo james <UNK> the reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were and never should be animation that has been <UNK> to the lowest extent possible and finally why would somebody who did wonderful voice over work for <UNK> wan <UNK> in clone wars want to copy michael j fox i happen to have an answer to this because they are the same person who thought he had to copy eddie murphy from <UNK> in <UNK> ii yes sadly it is true br br
<START> first what is really great about this movie br br ryan reynolds great acting there are very few actors i really like and for now he is one of them he has an amazing skill to <UNK> characters br br the soundtrack very good music played at the right time br br the idea of a nine lost in his own world incapable of leaving br br still i give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws br br horrible second part it seems that the director was very eager to make something new but despite of the efforts it was really boring br br very annoying character melissa i couldn't stand the scenes with her i e it was constantly annoying she represents everything that is wrong with american woman br br terrible explanation of the numbers the director was so busy with character development that he completely missed the point of a good story excuse me terrible br br this movie had great potential the filming is nicely done the music is really good but nothing more br br see it only if you are a fan of ryan reynolds or have a lot of time to spare
<START> wow this movie is almost too bad for words obviously the writers wanted to somehow link this to the <UNK> franchise so they got pete from the first one to <UNK> his role as jonathan only now he's a cop and has no similar character traits as he did in the first one the <UNK> in this one aren't the <UNK> from the last ones the cheap looking puppets have been replaced with even cheaper looking <UNK> little people instead of being any main antagonist or being evil they are more like the comic relief characters that appeared out of nowhere for no reason br br when watching this film for the first time it felt like i'd seen it before why was this because everything in this was stolen from another movie all the cheesy cop lines and action scenes were from lethal weapon the <UNK> were pretty much like bugs bunny and <UNK> duck except they weren't amusing at all even scenes from the original <UNK> film were <UNK> throughout this flick br br i think the target audience was supposed to be adults but the mixture of black magic cartoon slapstick cop drama and bad acting doesn't work at all i hope they don't make a <UNK> v because i don't want a movie studio to lose their money br br my rating bomb <UNK> mins r for violence
<START> despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century <UNK> <UNK> is generally well regarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman a <UNK> soldier and a brilliant in the field of <UNK> <UNK> if only hitler had given him the troops and he had desired in africa the argument goes things would have gone very differently and that's probably true <UNK> was in fact a military genius and by all accounts an <UNK> honest man br br but this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near saint he does his job trying to win the war for hitler but constantly the <UNK> <UNK> and gives him ridiculous orders which <UNK> james mason expresses <UNK> with but rarely actually questions and never ever <UNK> only when it's <UNK> obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does <UNK> think of <UNK> against him this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thing br br mason is fine as <UNK> but it's hardly a memorable performance along the lines of say george c scott as <UNK> of course <UNK> wasn't as colorful as <UNK> but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting he occasionally <UNK> into some warmth when with his wife <UNK> a young jessica <UNK> well cast but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance  as if the brits were trying to claim <UNK> for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitler br br done on the cheap with any battle scenes <UNK> stock footage and the <UNK> of southern california <UNK> for <UNK> there's nothing to particularly recommend this film a remake could be interesting i'd pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and well harris can act were it <UNK> up a little but this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty years a biography this bland would never cut it any more
<START> comparing <UNK> twelve to the 2001 <UNK> eleven did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same br br all the stars returned for twelve and zeta jones was added br br twelve had the same director br br twelve had the same producers br br twelve had the same production designer br br twelve had the same music director br br twelve had the same film editor br br did anyone notice the things than changed once the <UNK> franchise was established br br <UNK> budget was 25 million 30 greater br br eleven got great reviews but twelve largely got <UNK> br br eleven made <UNK> million but twelve dropped to million br br domestic box office for twelve dropped <UNK> br br soderbergh teamed with a different screenwriter br br movies are a director's medium of course i almost forgot
<START> well it is a good movie however you have to admit that van movies haven't been so great lately on the other hand if you are a hardcore van dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes also what i really liked is the music beautiful music am sure this will kill time if you are action fan as for <UNK> <UNK> the director of <UNK> 2 i don't think he did a good job as he did with <UNK> i cant wait when one day van movies hit the cinemas before the dvd maybe one day br br in the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch this could make your hour and half fun
<START> a hilarious comedy by the best director ever oz scott the list of eighties tv icons goes on and on <UNK> who's the boss family ties stone mr robinson night court <UNK> <UNK> wonder years <UNK> mr hand it is one of the funniest movies ever great lines meaningless subplots cheesy bad acting it is about a group of high school kids who need to pass <UNK> ed mac from night court needs them to pass their final <UNK> or he'll be fired great performance by brian bloom as the jerk kinda cool guy <UNK> but is nothing compared to b d <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a great movie for all ages so bad it's good
<START> as i watched i <UNK> but laugh at what was taking place on screen sure got a lot of play from both boys and women but i was confused as to why the actor that played in h s was 10 years old then the actor changed age to like 20 to play when he was a senior in <UNK> but whatever i thought it was funny
<START> i must admit when i saw the preview for <UNK> <UNK> i gave myself big expectations this film did not disappoint br br rarely when i watch a movie with such high expectations do i have those expectations met or <UNK> this film did that and more even more rarely do i <UNK> at the end of a movie this i and everyone else in the theater did br br i have to say i am a little biased towards quentin i grew up with pulp fiction i watched it when i was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film br br however since then quentin has not really lived up to his billing his style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar the quality honestly wasn't there i never watched jackie brown and then there's <UNK> that is until <UNK> <UNK> what quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by tarantino or sergio <UNK> but seeing how <UNK> is dead <UNK> the self <UNK> guy on this masterpiece br br so let's look at the movie which i won't give away the writing was spot on a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie not to mention this movie was set up in the classic tarantino mold great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action br br the acting was superb christopher <UNK> deserves an oscar seriously i don't say that often but honestly the man should get one for this movie he spoke every language in this movie and delivered with such amazing touch and <UNK> he stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive br br i have no problem building this movie up because this movie is the best film i've seen all year and probably all of next year quite frankly the more i think about it this movie may crack my top films of all time and is <UNK> best movie since pulp fiction take it from me watch this film i loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice br br i watched it yesterday and i'm still blown away thank you quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie you're back on top again buddy i can't say enough for <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i'm not sure why i disliked this film so much maybe i'm too old or too male or too something just who was the target audience here if you're it and you liked it then i'm happy for you personally i found it a bit of a <UNK> the characters were uninteresting and unlikeable the script was just plain embarrassing and some though not all of the acting was uninspired <UNK> tedious and occasionally nauseating surely there's something better on br br on a related issue why is it that whenever i see chris <UNK> in a film i get an urge to slap him silly does anyone else get that
<START> i'll start by <UNK> that i enjoy many movies that have low ratings on this site i find that if i can see what the creators were trying to do i can find appreciation for their work sound of thunder was a story that interested me i wanted to see what angles the filmmakers would attack in telling the story by and large they attempted to create an entertaining movie the plot was contrived but most action movie's plots are ed burns doesn't know how to carry a rifle but still holds his own well as an action lead considering he isn't asked for much the main problem destroys the whole movie is the horrible cgi it is totally <UNK> for the animals and backgrounds to look <UNK> very fake aside from that the animal <UNK> could have been really good as could the action scenes but failed because the production failed this could have been a really memorable film if they had only finished it it really looks like they meant to go back and fix all the horrible cgi but ran out of money and still released it save your money because someone failed this movie i give it three stars because it really could have been good but was totally failed somewhere i can't say it enough

<START> i suppose this is what is called southern gothic br br it stars samuel l jackson christina <UNK> and also justin timberlake is featured in a role timberlake does good work much to my surprise i didn't expect it of him br br when you're lost and you can't find your way home that's the black snake <UNK> br br the people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways psychologically and emotionally damaged betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain br br samuel l jackson plays a blues singer musician whose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother along with <UNK> a child he had hoped to have with her br br christina <UNK> character is a woman who was sexually abused when young this has turned her into a self destructive <UNK> allowing men to treat her badly br br the story lies in the <UNK> of these two characters lives it is a love story but not a sexual love story between them the older black man and the young white woman br br it is different from most films hollywood <UNK> out br br i highly recommend it br br 10 stars
<START> i am a college student and i bought this movie at a used book store because it sounded really funny from the back description nothing would prepare me for what would be the funniest movie ever made br br it is especially good to watch if you are an <UNK> like me because then you can see how silly these christian people are they seem to think non <UNK> like to live in really disgusting messy houses and do nothing but drink beer and be mean to the neighbors it's a laugh riot br br my buddies and i watch it every couple of weeks so that we may be entertained beyond our <UNK> <UNK> see this movie now br br let's hope rich makes some more of these movies to entertain us <UNK>
<START> one can always tell if i'm enjoying a movie by the number of times i cross my legs switch positions make slight <UNK> noises etc etc the lesser the better i moved so many times throughout this movie that i succeeded in knocking over my friends giant <UNK> of popcorn and getting a huge <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> a young actress who at some points in a <UNK> daughter never cries gave some promise for her <UNK> talents played poorly in a poorly written part depressing fact number one number two chris <UNK> was in it depressing fact number three chris <UNK> had lines number four chris <UNK> played a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from rich families <UNK> even worse he actually tries to act but only succeeds in sounding like a mentally disabled in an increasingly sappy independent version of a b demille film go back to <UNK> your american <UNK> br br this movie was terrible in almost every sense save josh <UNK> mildly endearing performance as <UNK> boyfriend <UNK> luckily he <UNK> from trying to have too many moments unlike all the other characters of course this is why he's much better than the rest and he actually shows some <UNK> here if you like josh or are thinking of casting a kid who knows a few things he's your man br br <UNK> is a sharp actor but the rest need no further <UNK> br br 2 out of 10 for poor <UNK> in this terrible film br br
<START> oh it's an excellent piece of work to be sure in fact several of the best scenes in cinema or at least in <UNK> cinema are to be found in this film <UNK> and max von <UNK> are as good as you would expect do these two give bad performances <UNK> <UNK> delivers some masterful although <UNK> masterful cinematography the script is quite good especially in individual scenes sometimes the film <UNK> and the pace is uneven though probably intentionally br br so what's the problem well the film is too bleak for its own good other bergman films are similarly bleak but nowhere near this harsh eventually i just gave up and i started to become a little irritated i was greatly affected often during the film but by the end i felt <UNK> it's a great film but i doubt i'd ever watch it again nor suggest it to friends or if i did suggest it i'd be very sure to warn them of what's ahead 8 10
<START> no doubt about it this is the animated short that put uncle walt on the map of success when <UNK> older brother roy suggested that the next mickey mouse short should include sound walt jumped at the chance the result <UNK> willie was a runaway hit for <UNK> it was after all the first animated short subject with a <UNK> sound track mostly music sound effects as dialog was minimal not to sound like a wet <UNK> but the short is far from perfect animation prior to <UNK> was <UNK> rather <UNK> jerky but once equipment made <UNK> and better artistic techniques came about the rest was smooth <UNK> and the sound was primitive disney wanted to use the then well known <UNK> sound system or the western electric sound system but was refused by both <UNK> <UNK> disney to use the system that p a powers was <UNK> with at the time the plot there's an actual plot line here concerns mickey as the aforementioned willie is the pilot of a <UNK> that is <UNK> by black pete captain pete to you and decides to have a jam session on ship using the various animals on board as musical <UNK> take notice if you don't think too much about the technical shortcomings <UNK> willie can be eight minutes of fun and a piece of history
<START> another of the endless amount of cookie cutter fight to the death for the amusement of wealthy films that there were so many of in the 90s <UNK> the ones created by taking the words <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and the words <UNK> <UNK> and and putting them in a random <UNK> saying that though death match is a pretty good entry in the over used genre thanks to its exciting fight scenes and the surprisingly good acting of its <UNK> cast br br the story concerns two buddies ex <UNK> world champion john <UNK> played by <UNK> faced <UNK> <UNK> ian probably previously best known for his awful performance as the main villain in ring of fire 2 and nick wallace nick hill a likable guy probably best known for the role of street fighter sergio in <UNK> 2 who work the l a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> onto ships one discovery of a of guns and a brief fight later our two heroes are <UNK> and <UNK> up an l a bar sensible john <UNK> decides to head north and look for a job <UNK> nick wallace has heard of a guy paying good money for fighters to fight in private <UNK> matches why should things change says john if you need me i'll be there predictably enough it isn't long before nick has gone missing and his good friend is fighting in the deadly of <UNK> trying to find a lead to his missing buddy br br sure enough there are no <UNK> for originality here but like i said before this films strength lies in its action its cast of real life fighters and the fairly good performances it manages to <UNK> from them ian in particular surprised me previously i'd just seen him as the bad guy in ring of fire 2 and in bit parts in tripe like the steel ring and i've always been quite amused at how bad an actor he is good fighter though but in death match he's pretty good given a decent script and a <UNK> he proves himself to be quite the charismatic leading man and his friendship with nick is very well portrayed and hill have a nice chemistry and you really believe these two characters care for each other enough for one of them to lose a job travel halfway across the country and risk death to save the other i wish i had a friend like that br br it was also nice to see <UNK> <UNK> as a villainous henchman with a little more depth than we're used to seeing from his many roles however don't be fooled into thinking he's the star just because he's on the video cover with it seems his head stuck on the body of michael from the cover of he is good while he's on screen but he isn't on much br br on the negative side the film is pretty slow when there's no fighting going on with lots of unnecessary scenes whats with gangster <UNK> pointless story about his grandfather and the end fight is <UNK> short but on the whole i enjoyed it plenty of fights most of them good isn't that all we martial arts really need and of course eye candy here in the lovely form of the very pretty <UNK> all in all a pretty entertaining <UNK> movie
<START> i couldn't believe that the adult swim guys came up with this character i laughed for days just thinking about this show having finally seen the pilot i guess i will stick around for a few more episodes is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around but is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport <UNK> with and feet with traditional wing <UNK> drinks too much and plays by his own rules as you might have guessed the only other funny moments are shooting many many people and spending time at home in the bathroom it is not funny but it is worth a look
<START> james <UNK> the china syndrome is a first rate thriller a model for those who want to make a genuinely terrifying thriller but don't know how br br most thrillers end with the standard shoot em up and chase that ends with the villain getting what he she deserves but bridges understands that such a standard finale isn't the case in some scenarios the china syndrome is thrilling in a way no one would expect it has the type of ending that's so unexpected but yet so logical br br the film stars three then current oscar winners jack lemmon best actor 1973 for save the tiger jane fonda best actress 1971 and 1978 for <UNK> and coming home respectively and michael douglas best picture 1975 for producing one flew over the <UNK> nest this isn't your standard spot the star flick that became so popular in the 70s the acting is so solid and strong that we forget who's playing the roles and believe that the characters are real people that's a testament to the collective of all three actors they may be stars but they're actors first br br there is no music score in the film <UNK> from a few background songs from <UNK> or tv shows there is nothing bridges doesn't allow any directorial style to come through on screen he is simply presenting the material straightforward with a strong dramatic story like this we don't need a score to distract us it kind of strikes me as a predecessor to the dogma 95 started by lars von trier in 1997 it focuses on the characters and story rather than style br br the story is about a nuclear power plant located in southern california spoiler an accident appears to have happened and basically the film is about lemmon fonda and douglas try to expose the truth in a way this is not a spoiler since the trailer tv spots video boxes and reviews all give this away but from this seemingly simple premise a surprisingly complex morality play springs and the suspense comes from human nature and the actions of people rather than a villain framing another guy although this is an element in the film that's what makes the china syndrome so good br br out of 4 stars
<START> i remember watching this film in 1981 when i was 7 it was absolutely brilliant i found the dvd just a couple of months ago i was nearly jumping up and down with glee i bought it and showed it to my kids they loved it too they asked what words the was singing i didn't tell them though because i don't think telling the words <UNK> and <UNK> to 6 year old kids is very good <UNK> the songs are brilliant i still remember them all i'll still remember them when i'm 60 there or near <UNK> tommy is was such a brilliant actor it's a pity he gave it up br br if you find the film buy it you'll love it
<START> i supposed gone <UNK> is a dull slasher flick yes it have some good point but it's a rehash from another flick the acts is so awful nor the plot br br the story goes from a legend about a living scarecrow on the <UNK> when an <UNK> become a prank and cause the life a boy in <UNK> the scarecrow comes alive and start a killing frenzy sound familiar right it's derived from scream friday <UNK> children of the corn you name it br br gone <UNK> is so below average film barely have a scary moment even the final scene is laughable sadly we still could enjoy it as our time killer but i prefer you to watch something else instead unless you're a big fan bad and cheesy movies off course br br 4 10
<START> this b w film reached the <UNK> movie house of my village about 18 months after its release in those days much of our full length comedy fare <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> anyone so this movie struck like a <UNK> it had me <UNK> with helpless <UNK> as we'd now put it ok so some of the sight gags were in fact recycled vaudeville but how was this boy with <UNK> of <UNK> to know that at the time in any case my favorite scenes had <UNK> unique brand of frantic <UNK> like that hawaii boxing match br br seeing sailor beware again fifty years later i still <UNK> <UNK> at the goings on granted without the nostalgia <UNK> it would probably be just another fair to <UNK> comedy but then another movie that once had me in <UNK> even more <UNK> the spike jones outing <UNK> save my child now seems dated and stilted apart from some too short orchestra bits and <UNK> weaver scenes must be some special <UNK> that makes martin lewis product stay <UNK> longer to me this one at least rates eight out of ten
<START> i would like to submit the following goof br br during the bridge scene soldiers are seen <UNK> out in the river asking to be taken away and seeking to escape some of the soldiers approach captain <UNK> boat and attempt to board carrying with them <UNK> soldiers are not <UNK> nor do they ever carry <UNK> into a combat zone they have <UNK> <UNK> packs and but not <UNK> the use of a <UNK> in this scene is absurd and out of keeping additionally if you look closely you will see that the <UNK> is floating on top of the water this is probably a very good indication that it is empty otherwise it would sink
<START> forget about <UNK> <UNK> i open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews i have read on the box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to <UNK> it isn't that i disagree with that necessarily i just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis there are points of comparison to be sure but they are <UNK> concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different in <UNK> the driving force of the narrative is existential in the box the driving force of the narrative <UNK> from a moral dilemma believe me when i say that i understand the <UNK> to compare an innovative by looking for <UNK> and <UNK> but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self contained <UNK> first and then <UNK> my <UNK> afterwards br br the box is one of those films you get mixed feelings about because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis it isn't always sure what it wants to be the twists are numerous but easy to follow if not to predict james <UNK> and cameron diaz play a relatively believable pair of <UNK> who are in financial <UNK> a box containing a button unit arrives on their <UNK> and they are informed by a horribly burned man that if pushed the button will cause the death of one person whom they don't know and they will receive one million dollars one of the things the box achieves is to <UNK> up this invisible fear that somewhere out there our actions have moral consequences before the button is pushed it has an eerie and seductive quality <UNK> yet sinister once it has been pushed events are set in motion that make the two leads question their own morality and deeply regret their <UNK> decision br br the notion that the box is an experiment is interesting because for me it provides the movie with a <UNK> if there are <UNK> beings developing an <UNK> based on data gathered by couples pushing and not pushing the button then as the conspiracy <UNK> we notice that ultimately it is a forced <UNK> be <UNK> or the species will be wiped out i suppose the couples don't know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with making the decision but they have no reason to suspect that the box can do anything so why would they choose <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> by the fact that we only care about it when presented with a problem in our own lives br br the psychological <UNK> in this movie are everywhere push the button or don't it's likely someone is messing with you take the money or don't no one gives anything away for free search for the truth the answers you find slowly reveal your demise br br i <UNK> that the box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many <UNK> boxes you can only choose to be free at the expense of <UNK> life is that freedom no it is only another box because then you become trapped in the consequences of your own morality there is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another box this is precisely why the <UNK> beings in the film are ultimately <UNK> they demand we <UNK> to moral standards which rob us of our freedom we made it to mars and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game br br the references to jean paul <UNK> illustrate this point rather well you can only enter the final chamber free or not free sure but no matter the form in which we enter the chamber it is a chamber nonetheless br br <UNK>
<START> i suppose i should be fair and point out that i don't believe in ghosts that said i'm very interested in the subject and i enjoy a scary story as much as the next guy i am a fan of ghost hunters because they at least try to give their <UNK> a scientific angle even early episodes of most haunted had a camp entertainment factor to them <UNK> state has neither of these qualities the cases themselves have the potential to be interesting but as with so much reality tv these days it suffers from poor acting and silly scripts the makers of the show <UNK> admit that writers guide the stories i hear they are even going to <UNK> in a romance subplot to appeal to the young female <UNK> the show has many other flaws too as others have stated the narration quickly becomes like nails down a <UNK> over the top visual and audio effects quickly become just as irritating i'm willing to suspend some disbelief for the sake of entertainment but this whole demon with a <UNK> story arc is just ridiculous given that the producers of this show are also responsible for brain dead fodder like <UNK> <UNK> beach and <UNK> harbor i suppose this is really no surprise if you are a die hard fan of ed <UNK> warren or a big reality show <UNK> i guess you'll find much to like in <UNK> state for the rest of us i recommend you avoid
<START> i wasn't sure about getting this movie on dvd because i really do have something against people making black and white films in the 21st century but i ended up buying it anyway i still don't understand why it had to be black and white but that's the only <UNK> i can see about the film and it sure is a perfect example to see the definitive rise of brazilian cinema not everyone can understand a film like this but it's quite rewarding to those who do unlike o <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> fits this movie pretty well and the acting is at least as good as that one or other successful brazilian films such as de de <UNK> <UNK> etc br br my only hope is that this gem doesn't get insulted and raped by a crappy hollywood remake it's amazing to see how those guys spend <UNK> of dollars and still can't make a movie that's 1 as good as this possibly low budget flick br br bravo to the entire crew 10 10
<START> this movie is so bad it's almost good bad story bad acting bad music you name it o k who are the <UNK> that gave this flick a <UNK>
<START> this movie is beautiful in many ways the plot the depth of the characters the stunning photography and acting the like scenes of battles no computer graphics here just thousands of people someone said the story has something to do with the <UNK> i find some connections with the greek tragedy tradition too br br the emperor extraordinarily acted struggles between power and love but he is forced for the greater good for the will of his <UNK> to choose the power and the loneliness the hate of his subjects and as his destiny he like in <UNK> was a good guy before becoming emperor once gained power he has to be <UNK> and cruel with innocent children his mother his father etc to defend and expand the empire <UNK> by power he becomes a monster overall the emperor is a <UNK> greek tragedy figure br br the assassin <UNK> towards a different direction from pure evil to <UNK> and morality even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new <UNK> this character is really unforgettable too br br lady <UNK> a wonderful <UNK> li is the morality nor by power or love or hate she is morality against power somehow like <UNK> her <UNK> for and against the emperor have always a moral <UNK> br br in conclusion a wonderful movie if you love cinema and you want to try chinese movies you can start here
<START> i let a friend talk me into viewing this movie and all i can say is i want to kill that friend br br that is an hour and a half of my life i will never get back and i will forever regret it br br if you've also had the bad luck of seeing this movie you will agree with me that this is absolutely the worst movie ever made ever br br if you've never seen this movie and are thinking of seeing it let me save you a waste of time and warn you do not watch this movie it sucks br br everything in this movie fails the attempt at comedy and <UNK> it just comes off as stupid trashy and disgusting try having women in the movie who are actually attractive and sexy and not fat ugly and gross to look at br br the acting is laughable as is the writing obviously this was made by total amateurs i can't believe these people were allowed to make such a stupid movie isn't there a law against that there should be br br there are a whole slew of good b movies if you are into that sort of thing but do not waste you time on this crappy wanna be movie br br peace
<START> david <UNK> much like colleague david lynch is an acquired taste a director who plays with themes like reality <UNK> sex insanity and death is bound to get the most extreme from audiences he proved this with films as the fly naked lunch crash and capital x capital z and more recently spider it's best to see with a clear mind try not to read too much about the plot or it'll be ruined for you what i can tell you is that <UNK> takes you on a trip down into the world of <UNK> that acts as a metaphor for any kind of <UNK> behaviour living out fantasies is something people always dream of but how far can you go into it before reality gets <UNK> and the fantasy takes over and turns into a nightmare those are the themes touched in an exploration of identity the human psyche physical bodies being <UNK> by disease and most importantly reality itself br br the story and directing are excellent <UNK> knows his trade very well and <UNK> brings to life an artificial world avoiding the usual <UNK> and clichés linked to stories such as this the film shows some pretty disgusting stuff but is unusually low key in the gore department in comparison to other work the shock effects he plays on are never over the top and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative it's not the most intellectual movie ever but it will leave you thinking about it wondering and pretty confused br br the acting gets two thumbs up as well both protagonists jennifer jason leigh and jude law play their parts perfectly and cleverly portray their character's shifting <UNK> and identities the dialogue may seem a little stale and <UNK> at times but that is part of the effect <UNK> was going for to create a <UNK> and alien atmosphere that puts you quite at <UNK> supporting actors as ian <UNK> don <UNK> and an especially creepy willem dafoe lift the movie even higher with their <UNK> familiar performances br br this movie takes some getting used to but if you can appreciate the dark tone blood imagery and <UNK> <UNK> story you'll love it
<START> the movie is a happy <UNK> was made to make us sleep and <UNK> what we do as we dream about the top beautiful natasha <UNK> no screenplay no deep characters nothing special so <UNK> sleep
<START> it would seem we should acknowledge <UNK> cinema for more than merely the dogma 1995 movement as <UNK> up by the danish all those years ago <UNK> or the <UNK> man in english is a surreal and deeply thought through film yet deeply entertaining and rich in content both on and under the surface as a film alone it is a <UNK> comedy on society and attitudes in the post modern world we live in a world that judging by the <UNK> man has reached the <UNK> of <UNK> and the like but along with this black comedy feel to it it would seem the film <UNK> a little deeper and raises issues at least to me of <UNK> religious spaces and our human instinct to want to <UNK> the truth amongst so much material in our world that perhaps seems alien to us br br this was in truth a fantastic introduction to contemporary norwegian cinema for me the film very much falls into that category of the european art cannon with its deep themes and ambiguity <UNK> atmosphere whilst maintaining an open finale and not so much a narrative as a <UNK> of events that may mean one thing or another so many times we've seen films that use the set up the <UNK> man <UNK> and so many times it's turned into a close to predictable routine revolving around a detective story or a chase story or something along those lines but this film allows its setting and situation to act as a mere backdrop for its protagonist named <UNK> to explore who he is where he is and what the possible mysteries behind this location really are br br the set up i'm talking about involves said hero arriving at a location with no prior memory or what happened before this i'll jump right in and say it's in my opinion he's dead and has been sent to some sort of <UNK> as have all the city's inhabitants everybody in the city that <UNK> mixes with are of the same age same mentality and same attitude suggesting to me that most of them are victims of their own suicide and have been sent to a <UNK> devoid of any emotion feeling colour or most importantly pain br br when we first see <UNK> he gets off a bus which he later discovers is uncanny in its abilities and approaches a <UNK> station in the middle of rural nowhere he is <UNK> and has a huge beard but soon he will be the opposite sporting a suit and tie clean <UNK> face and a home of his own complete with new job in which the film makes one of the best <UNK> shifts between the rural and the urban that i've ever seen but the new job as well as the new city is uneasy you can take breaks whenever you like bosses are unusually kind and there just seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything these ideas are best put across in a cinema when <UNK> still a relative <UNK> to the city is crying and is clearly affected by a film on show but everyone else watches in stone faced style there is also the initial example when one man has jumped from a window and lies <UNK> on some <UNK> but everybody walks on by without fuss br br to back up my idea on everyone already being dead and the city acting as a sort of <UNK> death and harm in general is impossible there is a particularly nasty scene involving an electronic paper <UNK> and someone's thumb but everyone's reaction to the event is stone faced and it grows back within the hour similarly a suicide attempt involving trains later on comes to nothing and instead we get the point of view regarding what it's like to be dragged down tube tracks with <UNK> on your side the city acts as a <UNK> a <UNK> society in which the <UNK> need to self harm <UNK> is impossible a place in which sexual relations can occur and break ups equally so but both under emotion less and passion less circumstances a place in which people can attempt suicide but it is impossible to actually die the city <UNK> these powers because the damage has already been done in <UNK> <UNK> and thus the film says you cannot kill yourself twice indeed you cannot feel pain or emotion in an <UNK> of <UNK> br br but the film's best part is the one that <UNK> up on you judging by the closing five minutes of the film and the side story that opens up involving some music coming from another man's house it would seem there is a fine line between the spaces the film <UNK> as and we get to see these spaces only very very briefly  so briefly that they consist of a single shot the is a colourful kitchen with music and children playing it offers life hope emotion and happiness whereas the hell is a snowy nowhere which <UNK> you thanks to its hopeless build up and eerie cut off point the introduction of these two spaces at the very end of the film suddenly informs you of the reality <UNK> and co faced <UNK> and everything that came with it the <UNK> just was not ready for <UNK> and his adventurous mind  and look where the <UNK> end up
<START> the book is better than the film mostly because of the writer <UNK> before i saw this film someone who had seen it told me the love depicted in this film isn't real after seeing this film i can see how her suspension of disbelief in this regard could've been distracting to other movie goers as well frankly some of the intense displays of love were laughable and seem to be on the edge of parody but by the end everyone should realize this is a big message piece of art it is not specifically about love at all it uses love to reveal the human <UNK> or the <UNK> borders of countries that help justify wars and hatred it is about <UNK> and the blind following of the things that supposedly separate us the critical scene for the real theme of this movie is when the hero or <UNK> for help for his stranded lover in the desert is ignored and <UNK> for the reasons shown in that scene this film is also about hope and forgiveness the hope <UNK> in the <UNK> relationship between <UNK> recovering character and the indian <UNK> <UNK> in the buddy buddy relationship with his white <UNK> who ends up dying and the forgiveness <UNK> in the <UNK> character's first hunt and then forcing out of what he thinks will be the hero's <UNK> for his war crimes betrayal of country i think the film could've been made even better than it is i don't know if a more realistic portrayal of the circumstances of love would've made the real themes and points of this film even more obvious or not but i agree this film is not about realistic romantic love as the people behind this piece of art or film imply in an early scene when the eventual lovers first meet the hero talks about how a new car broken down car fast car etc i'm <UNK> is still just a car no matter what <UNK> you put in front of it she replies but <UNK> love <UNK> love romantic love etc are very different kinds of love this is ironic because this film is really about the one love all humans should want which is the love of or for peace not <UNK> things which are usually the real reasons for wars <UNK> in something most of us want such as cars let's say otherwise we may be left stranded to die in a cave in a vast desert with ancient wall art drawings of <UNK> suggesting that the <UNK> and life supporting waters which were once there have all but disappeared i believe the english patient won the oscar because of these big messages not specifically for its depiction of romantic love awards tend to go that way the relationship of the hero and heroine was necessary to draw the audience in unfortunately this view of love may be <UNK> in the age of divorce and so many <UNK> who can't seem to get together on so many levels so ridiculous versions of <UNK> love are hard to get into even in <UNK> which film love has always been especially in good old hollywood the film may fall short of what people expect but a 7 out of 10 movie worth seeing regardless
<START> the largest crowd to ever see a wrestling event in the us took place at <UNK> 6 over <UNK> 000 people showed up to break the rolling stones <UNK> record and this event didn't disappoint at all maybe the biggest match of all time took place as the immortal hulk <UNK> his world title against the ultimate warrior there are over 12 matches in all so you get tons of action
<START> i suppose that to say this is an all out terrible movie would be unfair but it's pretty bad the sub disney storyline involves dogs playing soccer and falling in love <UNK> how cute the acting isn't bad but definitely could be better especially that of young canadian actor kevin <UNK> who during the whole movie looks embarrassed like he doesn't even want to be there anyway kids will love it but parents beware
<START> in love 2 is the third movie it seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to make this one at the risk of giving out spoilers is kidnapped and the team has to get him back nothing new there a past love of is the bad guy that was done in the second movie the battle between and <UNK> and is starting to get boring the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy i personally don't know what it's makers were thinking i gave this movie a vote of 4
<START> a good ol' boy film is almost required to have <UNK> car chases a storyline that has a vague resemblance to plot and at least one very pretty country gal <UNK> with short shorts and a low top the pretty gal is here dressed in designer <UNK> but the redneck <UNK> stop there jimmy dean is a natural as a <UNK> <UNK> but as a tough guy former sheriff he comes up way short big john is big but he isn't convincing with the bad part of his <UNK> bug eyed jack <UNK> is a hoot as always and bo hopkins has been playing this same part for decades ned beatty also does his part in a small role but there is no story it <UNK> more like an episode of in the heat of the night than a feature film <UNK> with easily predictable sentiment perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is charlie daniels singing the theme you know the one it was made famous by jimmy dean
