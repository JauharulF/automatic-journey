<START> king of masks <UNK> <UNK> in china is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film winner of 16 awards from around the world this film based on a true story centers on wang <UNK> a street performer in 1930s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face change opera he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance and no one knows how he does it he has a longing desire to have a <UNK> as his art is a family <UNK> that can only be passed on to a male heir we then go to the streets and see that people are selling their children because they can't afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free because daughters are not worth much in this society wang <UNK> story goes on from there br br the film was so astonishingly good the acting was amazing and the issues were so <UNK> and well addressed there is the gender <UNK> and the depressing fact that in this time and place no one wants a little girl also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living <UNK> is a man who dresses as a woman and while he is famous and well respected he regards himself as something low a half woman as we go further into the film the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it the brutality and corruption of the military and police and the <UNK> and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions br br this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life and <UNK> <UNK> the actor who plays wang <UNK> presents yet another beautiful performance
<START> spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers br br there are bad movies and then there are movies which are so awful that they become <UNK> comical in their <UNK> such is the case with columbia <UNK> 'the grudge ' this cinematic atrocity began when an otherwise well <UNK> american saw a japanese made for tv film <UNK> <UNK> and was inspired to remake the movie in english this began a virtual <UNK> of bad decisions which <UNK> the globe until it washed <UNK> in orlando on october 21 2004 br br the premise and i use the word loosely involves a house in tokyo haunted by a skinny <UNK> ghost who looks like a cross between margaret <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> along with her ghastly sidekick a <UNK> <UNK> but evil second <UNK> is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old japanese boy sure there is count <UNK> comes to mind with this whimsical bunch we must add a mysterious black cat who i have <UNK> named <UNK> <UNK> remember speed <UNK> as you have already guessed they were murdered in this <UNK> of doom and now desire to kill everyone who enters the premises you see as explained by a japanese detective when someone dies in a rage their ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property lines as defined by the county <UNK> or something like that i forget br br the story begins <UNK> enough with acclaimed <UNK> bill <UNK> <UNK> to his death from a balcony my guess is bill <UNK> got this job because of his kids <UNK> him for a trip to tokyo <UNK> next we endure the mildly interesting saga of nurse <UNK> <UNK> no don't go in <UNK> screams the audience but alas she <UNK> not the dire <UNK> and is predictably <UNK> out like a magic <UNK> about 30 minutes into the movie we finally see its american heroine sarah michelle <UNK> as karen sarah michelle <UNK> might be a competent actress but i could not help thinking of buffy the vampire <UNK> so much so that it was distracting it is the equivalent to having jennifer <UNK> star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in new york try as you may you just can't stop thinking about the other project which made her famous but i <UNK> karen the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care <UNK> who disappeared at <UNK> r us br br she <UNK> around meets the ghosts coma lady dies and some other stuff happens watching the fair haired <UNK> searching for clues i half expected her to find the ghost and pull its mask off to reveal it was actually old man <UNK> who owned the abandoned amusement park 'i would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you <UNK> kids and that dog of yours ' br br director takashi <UNK> who is <UNK> to be the ed wood of asia made two unfortunate decisions involving sound first he choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed this is an excellent <UNK> for <UNK> any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder second he gave the ghosts a bizarre <UNK> noise that sounds like a <UNK> <UNK> after the movie i heard several people <UNK> the theatre making the sound and laughing br br sarah michelle <UNK> ends up being the sole survivor and of course we learn that the fire she set to burn down the house was <UNK> in time for the obligatory next chapter however considering the humorous reactions of the audience they did not want a sequel but an <UNK> 'the <UNK> could be easily re edited into a comedy perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value <UNK> that this will go down as the greatest cinematic thriller since <UNK> vs <UNK> ' i would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local <UNK> theatre where it can receive the public <UNK> it so richly deserves
<START> there were a lot of 50's sci fi movies they were big draws for the drive in theaters a lot of them were crappy even back then this movie and 'the day the earth stood <UNK> stand out and both have aged well in their own way from the very beginning with its eerie <UNK> musical score which still sounds weird since <UNK> are hardly ever used forbidden planet takes you where no man has gone before speaking of star trek there's so much material in this film that got into star trek <UNK> its like a pilot for the series from the <UNK> captain first mate doctor the mad scientist alien beings babe in short <UNK> computer intelligence it is all de <UNK> now but this was the first of its kind besides it has good acting and well done artwork which even today evokes a certain awe at the imagery consider how the huge <UNK> machine is successfully depicted with some real depth i saw this as a kid at a drive in 0 when it was a new movie and it scared me of course every movie that was even vaguely scary did back then but i remember being real worried about the invisible monster forbidden planet is a movie a sci fi fan can watch several times and find something new with each viewing
<START> i'm a fan of crash and blade runner and this movie explores some of those highway death and 80s film noir themes that i like to see so i enjoyed it br br in general though the essential stupidity of the film noir protagonist is not pulled off well by the female lead and her hero is nearly a <UNK> hence the <UNK> warning
<START> in a little town in montana two brothers grow up one of them is norman craig <UNK> the other is paul brad pitt their father is <UNK> <UNK> and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion and the lessons of fly fishing in this movie fly fishing represents life a little br br the story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message some things do happen though norman goes to <UNK> to study after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie emily lloyd and he is invited to teach in chicago paul has become a reporter and is known as the fishing reporter he is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and <UNK> too much br br the movie is very well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography the mountains the woods and the river all look very beautiful if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch fortunately there is more
<START> it's good to see that vintage film buff have correctly <UNK> their excellent dvd release as a musical for that's what this film is pure and simple like its <UNK> remake murder at the <UNK> 1949 the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate <UNK> show with kitty <UNK> and <UNK> michael leading a cast of super <UNK> girls including ann sheridan lucy ball <UNK> wallace <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> young barbara <UNK> <UNK> perry and dorothy white carl <UNK> is also on hand to lend his strong voice to <UNK> for two undoubtedly the movie's most popular song it is heard no less than four times however it's <UNK> michael who steals the show not only with her rendition of sweet <UNK> but her strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend as for the rest of the cast we could have done without jack <UNK> and victor mclaglen altogether the only good thing about <UNK> role is his weak running gag with cult icon toby wing in fact to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is over <UNK> and over strained super dumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though would you believe in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect director mitch <UNK> actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned close up after close up
<START> first of all this is a low budget movie so my expectations were incredibly low going into it i assume most people looking at the info for this movie just wanted a <UNK> and essentially that's all it is br br plot there really is none it's basically saw but in china and a whole hell of a lot worse cast there is none period special effects absolutely awful in my opinion there were <UNK> and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts splatter color <UNK> etc br br i believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal shock film now it had some great potential on a bigger budget but poor scripting poor dialogue awful acting what seemed like camcorder video shots and just plain unbelievable gore made this movie truly awful br br there are movies worth taking a chance against some reviews even b rate movies deserve some opportunities blood <UNK> for example was the most recent i saw against reviews that was worth it but this was simply awful i hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against it br br i'm all for brutality and shock but the overall <UNK> and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience save your time money and chance something else you won't be disappointed
<START> this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen there was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie i have seen some bad movies but this one takes it there is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast <UNK> the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can't seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it i feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half please take my advice and do not watch this movie for i know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life
<START> this movie was my first touch with mr <UNK> so i really didn't know what to expect but what i saw just broke all my expectations in a good way br br the storyline is not complex and shows us a life of found boy orphan and particularly his connection into the community of poor people who together built themselves a hood of simple metal plate houses this little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine but one day there is a water <UNK> found and a rich <UNK> man is getting interested in the buying the place but as the title of the movie hints there is a miracle taking place our character gets a wonder <UNK> from his dead mother what is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city as well br br it was just a masterpiece of natural comedy there is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people also many funny moments and scenes are included at the beginning with the spot where sun is shining and many more br br so according to the fact that i m not a comedy lover you should see this movie because i liked it much br br i
<START> i actually found this movie <UNK> finally one worth my time to watch and rent it is true some scenes were over the top on <UNK> shouting etc but what movie doesn't stress its agenda genre or <UNK> to <UNK> almost none what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a s <UNK> reviewer on another review site but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his own review of the movie not of the movie at all anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends no car chases <UNK> being in an italian family myself i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen the movie has its tear <UNK> parts as well it is what real life can be in such an environment nice movie
<START> we loved school of rock and jack black we couldn't wait to go and see this movie it was the only time in my life the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out my husband hated it too the only funny parts were in the trailers my husband and i wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money the writing was awful it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic people who should be utterly offended the movie wasn't that long but to us it seemed like an eternity the people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry i made my husband stay because i was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts but there weren't save you money and your time
<START> yes i am just going to tell you about this one so don't read if you want surprises i got this one with the title christmas evil there was also another christmas horror on the dvd called silent night bloody night whereas silent night bloody night not to be confused with silent night deadly night had lots of potential and was very close to being good this one wasn't quite as good it started out interesting enough watching the villain if you can call him that watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie doesn't deliver you need character development but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy <UNK> about an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror and the guys he kills aren't even his targets they are just making fun of him this is one of many <UNK> attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty he then proceeds to try and kill this other guy and he tries to break into his house by <UNK> himself into the <UNK> he promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out he then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by <UNK> him in his bedroom he can't seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and <UNK> the guys throat what the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place oh yeah the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with <UNK> and the <UNK> part with his brother and that tune he wants to play what was that even about he kept talking about something that was never really explained how does it end you ask well since i have spoilers i will tell you he runs off the road in his van and proceeds to well lets just say it was lame
<START> okay this show is nothing but awesome it has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses jeremy <UNK> is so <UNK> and he is perfect for the role he is <UNK> be big in hollywood he has a bright future ahead this show better last a long time because i really love this show and i hope that it has a lot of success it is so interesting i have been waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here and it's great i tape it too i can watch it whenever i want now too bad its only on once a week though i wish it was on at least twice a week because now i wish that it was <UNK> every day hope you all like this show br br ashley
<START> full marks for <UNK> rendering of the speech over the dead kid's coffin shakespeare's mark <UNK> would be put to shame br br was it paul <UNK> or was it ken <UNK> who should be <UNK> on the remarkable dialogues they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voice over <UNK> br br there is little else to talk about in this film even john cusack has done better roles than this one interestingly the film is very male oriented the women are mere <UNK>
<START> this film by oscar <UNK> is unique its <UNK> doesn't lie in the story since many a half <UNK> hollywood production has served us <UNK> miserable plots but rather in the <UNK> way that complete and utter <UNK> in one aspect is joined with equal <UNK> in all other aspects br br the dialog is worse than embarrassing rotten acting and abysmal direction are thrown into the mix <UNK> speaking english with heavy swedish accents add an unintentional element of humor uninspired lightning and camera work are <UNK> on the turkey film cake as a sort of surprise for the audience there are a few completely <UNK> slow motion sequences where you'd least expect any to add insult to injury the whole thing is cut by someone devoid of any sense of timing br br the bad guy henchman turns good after hearing good guy's speech scene in the church is the point at which is time to <UNK> ed wood from the position as the worst director of all times move over ed wood here comes oscar <UNK>
<START> an excellent series masterfully acted and directed but <UNK> i am told by mr <UNK> and <UNK> by him after a single presentation it is now only <UNK> in private <UNK> and via the british film <UNK> at special request very unfortunate as ian <UNK> nuanced portrayal of the weary but determined bernard <UNK> is superb one of his very best performances the supporting cast including the young amanda <UNK> and hugh <UNK> are superb with mel martin playing the conflicted and <UNK> wife and michael <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> the story positively <UNK> with the tragic and <UNK> personal consequences of the great game
<START> i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie br br the 1972 movie with mcqueen and <UNK> is almost a classic steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an <UNK> actor he has no passion in his play also the action in the original <UNK> was fantastic but the remake has no action it is almost boring despite the fact that the film making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994 br br i don't understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico i think this is a mistake in the story br br so i think that there was no need to remake it or if they decided to remake a classic they must choose an excellent actor for the first role like johnny <UNK> or brad pitt
<START> this is the finest film ever made to deal with the subject of aids it's a documentary about two men living with and dying of this illness the film is beautiful heartbreaking funny and incredibly moving above all it is an amazing true love story be sure to have a few <UNK> ready before you watch this movie you will need them extraordinary
<START> seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners br br although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring i think it's seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show who can come up with something really new it's pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more <UNK> and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting <UNK> perform and letting p <UNK> and prince present a category also letting chris rock be the <UNK> was an attempt to re new the ceremony and make it more appealing none of it really worked out br br sure chris rock is a funny guy but he wasn't really a good <UNK> i really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories his presence wasn't really as <UNK> as for instance billy <UNK> br br also the <UNK> out of the awards was pretty dumb at times not letting everybody come to the stage but also <UNK> out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird br br still i can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners none of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case so does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of <UNK> contestants i don't think so i think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now with the exception of million dollar baby and the passion of the christ maybe sure i don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year for instance <UNK> <UNK> should had won for best cinematography not that i don't like robert <UNK> work he really did some amazing work for most of oliver <UNK> work but i really feel that <UNK> deserved the award way more also i would had liked seeing jim miller and paul <UNK> win for best editing and john <UNK> for best music but oh well there is no way the academy awards can please everybody of course i understand that there will always be people complaining about the winners br br it also was funny to see that most of the award <UNK> were way more nervous than the <UNK> and winners did prince said any of the <UNK> names right at once and were is sean <UNK> sense of humor al pacino and jeremy i hope they missed <UNK> were the best <UNK> of the night br br overall a very forgettable show but with nice winners br br 4 10
<START> <UNK> was the worst film i saw this year nearly every film i choose to see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say this film looked like like it was directed by a film student for his intro to filmmaking class his father makes great films his sister made a good one but brother roman no one critic had the <UNK> to compare this film to <UNK> le <UNK> contempt while coppola jr did take the same idea a film about film he tried too hard to make himself seem european artsy and witty when it's all really just <UNK> the lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film like he's either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him <UNK> somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director depardieu is alright the one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is surprisingly not the b movie scenes but rather one which takes place in italy a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car driving around picking up and dropping off random people this was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema i am guessing he was trying to spoof or rip off or both the documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out the ending was <UNK> on for the sake of a twist or artistic value i suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself and not in the way it intended no wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re edited or re shot or whatever which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before i can't believe it could have been worse than this if you want to see a good parody of film check out the austin powers films any of them the opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this entire film <UNK> <UNK> for the sake of cinema please go back to directing your <UNK> music videos leave the <UNK> to daddy
<START> jim carrey is good as usual and even though there are quite a few jim carrey moments it's definitely not a jim carrey movie br br it's targeted mostly at children and i managed to enjoy it as such movie it was promoted in israel as another jim carrey movie so those who expected a weird over the top comedy were disappointed br br the movie has nice moments and works well as a movie for kids i can't say i loved this movie but then again i'm not its target audience
<START> this film makes a strong comment about the italian people of the time the use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and i can't not mention the beauty and <UNK> of sophia loren and mastroianni i love them both their way of <UNK> is so beautiful and natural that you may question whether or not the camera is actually there the husband in his brief role is also excellently portrayed as the fascist italian who <UNK> his wife and children but in his own way a loving father the beginning scenes with hitler at <UNK> <UNK> with all the italians is incredible and really places the film historically i loved the film and i also agree that it is funny it isn't more renowned
<START> i was lucky enough to get a dvd copy of this movie recently and have now seen it for the 2nd time the 1st time was on late night tv in australia more than 20 years ago but i could never forget this strange and bleak film br br not many people like this film at all because it is so unconventional the fact that there is hardly any spoken dialogue in this move we just hear the thoughts of characters is only one unconventional aspect of it br br searching for a copy of this film i found out that the producer was dead the main actor was dead it was not kept in any british tv or film <UNK> that it was never released on video or dvd that television networks around the world <UNK> it after their <UNK> ran out in the 80's when it was first shown on tv in australia there were no <UNK> devices for <UNK> br br on the second viewing recently i could see why it was unforgettable at times it is very tense and <UNK> claustrophobic very like a harold <UNK> stage play br br again if anyone wants a dvd copy of this please email me and i'm sure we can work something out regards adam <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> ride with the devil directed by ang lee <UNK> tiger is another gem in this fine directors cap for those unfamiliar with the history of the kansas <UNK> border wars during the american civil war see this film you will visit a sad piece of <UNK> besides some superb action scenes quite bloody at times this is a story of love devotion between men one lady in particular it stars toby maguire <UNK> <UNK> jeffrey wright as the young lady jewel i never heard or seen her before i want to see more of her the acting is top notch superb production values very well written adapted from a novel br br this is a long film <UNK> minutes but well worth seeing br br my rating is br br respectively <UNK> br br jay harris br br
<START> with a simplistic story and an engaging heroine this was the horror movie that started it all john carpenter brings to life a nail biting nightmare on halloween night when laurie <UNK> jamie lee curtis in her debut career defining role and her mischievous friends plan a night of <UNK> fun only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell br br michael myers has escaped from a nearby insane <UNK> having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier he is now back in <UNK> the sleepy <UNK> town where his murder took place once he sets his eyes on laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived he begins to stalk and <UNK> her turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her br br beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you're being stalked by the <UNK> serial killer himself myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion br br although halloween is certainly outdated it is by no means less chilling the idea alone is <UNK> <UNK> inducing and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day it <UNK> seven sequels and eventually rob <UNK> equally scary remake and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today
<START> this is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the btk killer the events in this movie are not even close to the truth why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce don't even waste your time watching this for free low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of which is really what this movie did if they would allow me to give a 10 to this movie i would the acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old vhs video camera from the 80s save your time and money by not watching this movie
<START> this film is a pia <UNK> special when viewing it i was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a hollywood <UNK> in <UNK> need of another role but afraid of becoming <UNK> for <UNK> movie or soft porn roles who says at her casting session well of course i do not normally do roles <UNK> nudity but if it is artistically necessary for the film this <UNK> brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing pia at such a session saying well of course i do not normally take any roles <UNK> actual acting but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol this is probably grossly unfair the rather <UNK> tale is the fault of harold robbins book considering the nature of the story <UNK> <UNK> certainly do not receive <UNK> attention and perhaps pia who once won an acting award in <UNK> is deliberately <UNK> her part rather than attempting to act in an almost <UNK> role critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing but this is grossly unfair the <UNK> and director are far more often the guilty parties the real problem with the lonely lady is that the screenplay like the original book looks for sensation rather than substance and nothing can help with this br br the screenplay for this film is abysmal but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script <UNK> directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement as it was released my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether i am <UNK> my personal opinion or <UNK> to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing my personal rating for it would be two out of ten but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its <UNK> intended and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable being in a <UNK> mood and wanting to make it clear that i am not <UNK> pia for my disappointment i will give an imdb rating of four
<START> wow this is really not that good br br i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good it is but it is nothing special br br the movie is so <UNK> and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies br br
<START> i love all dogs go to heaven even though i'm a guy this and the land before time are the best animated films that don <UNK> has made in the movie <UNK> <UNK> burt reynolds is helped by his friend itchy dom <UNK> freedom out of the pound in new orleans 1939 charlie who's in casino business wants to share equal with his partner carface <UNK> <UNK> carface who is unwilling to share the equal with charlie pushes a car on a bridge onto charlie killing him charlie enters heaven and meets <UNK> <UNK> moore who shows charlie that his time is up by showing him a watch that has stopped and she explains that all dogs go to heaven because all dogs are naturally good charlie hides the stop watch behind his back and switches it back and he returns to earth alive with <UNK> screaming you can never come back charlie <UNK> with itchy and they go and explore soon to find out that carface has not only attempted to murder charlie he has also kidnapped a little orphan girl named ann marie <UNK> <UNK> when carface leaves charlie and itchy help ann marie escape the next day charlie itchy and ann marie go to look for money ann marie sees a couple who she thinks would make great parents for her while ann marie talks to the couple charlie <UNK> up behind the man and steals his <UNK> charlie ann marie and itchy then go to a horse race where they bet the man's money that a horse will win the race the horse they said would win winds up winning and charlie itchy and ann marie are <UNK> 1 000 for the bet charlie promises ann marie he'll use the money to give to the poor but winds up buying a new casino and gambling and buys pizza for his friend <UNK> <UNK> anderson and her <UNK> soon ann marie has found out that charlie had stolen the <UNK> from the man and used his money on the horse race and everything charlie sad about this has a dream about going to hell and the devil soon charlie <UNK> and finds out that ann marie is gone she has left to give the <UNK> back to the couple who forgive her about the <UNK> and invite her to breakfast charlie asks ann marie to leave with him and she does pretending to be sick but are captured by mice who try to feed them to king <UNK> but they manage to escape soon carface shows up and captures ann marie he plans to <UNK> her but charlie comes to the rescue and calls on king <UNK> who eats carface charlie's time is up and he must die again itchy with the help of the other dogs finds the couple who took ann marie in and get them to come with them to where ann marie is they are there in time to save ann marie but are too late to save charlie who's time has ended charlie who is awarded for his heroic effort for saving ann marie is welcomed back to heaven but before he enters he says good bye to ann marie who has been adopted by the couple and asks her to take care of itchy for him she says yes and tells charlie she loves him and good bye charlie enters heaven again as it's said all dogs go to heaven filled with wonderful animation characters and story don <UNK> has proved to us again that he is a good animator it's too bad this movie was release the same year little mermaid which is my favorite disney movie they both came out in 1989 which was the year before i was born i guess i'll have to call them both the best animated features of 1989 10 out of 10
<START> this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation women and performers both brought together in a supporting role of a <UNK> opera star are both doomed to be <UNK> to <UNK> roles in china this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture br br the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to <UNK> up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors' performance br br a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies
<START> just a regular jason lee movie there were some parts of the movie that were funny the <UNK> of the move is to live life on the edge i guess these are the types of movies that i think 14 year old girls watch at <UNK> parties it was an all right movie it is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention i think that julia stiles and <UNK> blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot its just kind of a boy meets girl movie this is that perfect movie they would show on comedy central i am glad that i didn't see this movie in the theater i would have been angry but i guess that's why i didn't see it in the theater
<START> ghost of <UNK> hollow was one of the many <UNK> movies about hot <UNK> teens <UNK> the supernatural in this case the teens can't pay the rent for their <UNK> and get <UNK> with nowhere else to go they decide on an apparently haunted house as you may have guessed once they arrive some weird things start happening and there's a twist at the end br br there's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies but it's nice entertainment nonetheless my favorite character was the foul mouthed parrot well let me <UNK> that he didn't talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie but he said things that we don't expect out of a bird the movie's pure <UNK> but harmless
<START> i wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry <UNK> was good looking but <UNK> like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw costumes what costumes a t shirt with <UNK> of black leather on it it was <UNK> clothes or lack of them that really got me do the <UNK> of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england the <UNK> and <UNK> were inaccurate and stupid but the episode with an alien was worst of all especially as his make up mainly consisted of <UNK> on his face an old trick the <UNK> monster was pretty funny as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of <UNK> as if the us accents <UNK> as did the initial <UNK> voice <UNK> raw bin hood and <UNK> <UNK> the second robin and marion were really quite <UNK> in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan
<START> this movie was a fascinating look at <UNK> culture and society that few african americans are aware my own two children are by products of a <UNK> grandmother whose father was a member of the <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> and a black skin woman whose parents were ex slaves he married outside of and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family except for one sister who took pity on her brothers plight raising 8 children during the great depression of <UNK> providing the family with food whenever she could of course she <UNK> aided this family <UNK> for her own ex communication my daughter was fascinated by the movie we have made it a part of our library
<START> warning contains spoilers br br first of all i would like to say that i really liked this game i got it for christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents i am glad that i did that br br first off i would like to say that the single player was very good the first level is probably one of the best in the game when you are at a party in london and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime <UNK> daughter of course you have to rescue her and it is quite a big level but should probably take you at least five minutes the best part and i think also the funniest part is when you are in the jet pack and people are <UNK> down big ben just <UNK> the jet <UNK> most <UNK> rocket <UNK> and blast the clock faces and the enemies down pure fun br br the rest of the levels are very good but pretty short there are four mini levels you can <UNK> and that is one of the let downs because only the first two of them are actually fun and the last two to <UNK> are just <UNK> 25 <UNK> <UNK> i mean c'mon we got loads of points to <UNK> these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad br br the multi player me and some of my friends agree is very good and challenging even if there are no <UNK> <UNK> didn't have any <UNK> but that is still some fine multi player games you can be a load of bad guys and you go against each other and you can also set traps which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character br br <UNK> 8 5 10 levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved graphics 9 10 there is the odd bad graphic but that isn't extremely often <UNK> 10 10 needs no comment just great you get to drive in jet packs and vehicles sound 8 10 replay value 7 10 the only levels i go back on are the <UNK> level and <UNK> part 1 br br i give this game 8 5 10 br br could have a bit of improvement but it's still good
<START> i've read a number of reviews on this film and i have to say what is wrong with you people this was an excellent film i thought this film was superb from start to finish and the story was extremely well told i'm convinced that the people that didn't like this film weren't paying very good attention to the film there are a number of very important scenes that if you aren't paying attention you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense i urge anyone who didn't like this film to watch it again and watch it alone so that you can truly pay attention the story made perfect sense to me and as i said was very well told every scene in the film has a point and everything fits together at the end of the film br br all the actors did a fantastic job sean connery was very good in his role as always laurence fishburne was superb as <UNK> brown playing a very interesting character kate <UNK> was a nice touch as well and looks fantastic blair <UNK> was a pleasant surprise i didn't really expect anything great from him but he pulled off a great performance ed harris was the real gem in the film he plays a truly sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is watch his eyes in his scenes just superb also there is a very young scarlett johansson as kate in one of her first roles not a bad place to start excellent cast in this film br br i would strongly recommend this film to anyone that likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers this is a great film and should be seen don't listen all these other people's opinions go see the movie and come to your own conclusions i hope that you will see the film and i hope that you enjoy it as much as i do thanks for reading br br chris
<START> i'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the american revolutionary war this ain't it and for that matter neither was the <UNK> <UNK> gibson the <UNK> but i <UNK> br br i saw this film at a publicity screening at the old mgm studios now <UNK> just before it came out the audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece written by veteran robert dillon directed by the <UNK> hugh hudson of <UNK> of fire fame and starring al pacino br br but it didn't take long for people to start <UNK> in their seats <UNK> <UNK> comments about <UNK> horribly <UNK> accent he was supposed to be an american <UNK> of scottish <UNK> and that of <UNK> kinski who was supposed to be recently <UNK> from england then the story started and it all went downhill fast br br motivations were muddled dialogue was atrocious events had no historical or political context what there was of a plot <UNK> forward on absurd coincidence by the second or third time that alleged lovers pacino and kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke donald sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a british officer <UNK> his accent was all over the map too i guess there weren't any english actors available br br lots of people left those who stayed tried to <UNK> <UNK> then openly <UNK> i stuck it out i figured that at least the battle scenes might be good i was wrong inexplicably hudson chose to film them with hand held cameras not even <UNK> the <UNK> giving a misplaced <UNK> <UNK> which ruined the sense of scale br br there was a semi famous tv reviewer in the audience a few <UNK> ahead of me the late gary franklin of channel 7 <UNK> news i could tell he was <UNK> by the behavior of the rest of us and sure enough on his tv segment the next day he gave the film a <UNK> on his notorious <UNK> scale of 1 to <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> about the <UNK> who'd <UNK> the screening the night before who clearly didn't know art when they saw it what a <UNK> br br after this disaster pacino didn't star in another film for almost 4 years hugh <UNK> career never <UNK> you can't say i didn't warn you
<START> the story of peace loving <UNK> and <UNK> fighting for land water law and order and the respect and ultimate <UNK> of the long <UNK> cattle interests and their hired guns had been worked over better in earlier <UNK> and probably later films as well there's some good action scenes and the general <UNK> of the story <UNK> a disappointing ending is well executed law and order and religion have established roots in the town but the old order of cattle drives <UNK> and <UNK> is still around as well the clash of the two occurs in a nicely staged <UNK> scene where the <UNK> ride right into a trap granger an ex <UNK> plays the guy who is <UNK> by the very <UNK> who need his expertise with a gun
<START> i saw this movie the first time at about twelve <UNK> on a saturday evening it really is the perfect time for this one i have never ever seen a movie that was actually more predictable and <UNK> with stereotypes if you want to see a thrilling action movie don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through however if you want a good laugh please watch it i even bought the chuck norris <UNK> collection thanks to my enjoyable saturday night what especially struck me is that <UNK> scene that would be expensive to make was copy <UNK> from a discovery documentary or an old tv special on the us army furthermore i was amazed by the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort in making the production look real afghanistan is as far as i can remember nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click <UNK> escapes from the terrorists sand castle with his jet pack and is taken away by a submarine probably discovery later on in the movie <UNK> throws an islam terrorist against the wall in the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long <UNK> of the korean <UNK> <UNK> in the air when <UNK> against the wall gotta love it i recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though only then you'll understand why i've been mad enough to spend 6 99 <UNK> on the box
<START> in the sequel to the brilliant bill and ted's excellent adventure bill and ted are under threat from the future as the evil chuck de <UNK> sends two evil robots disguised as bill and ted to earth to kill human bill and ted in order to change the future br br in a great comedy pairing winter and reeves <UNK> to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel though lacking the <UNK> of the first bogus journey still has the great <UNK> and dialogue from the leading pair not to mention an hilarious performance by william <UNK> who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth the grim <UNK> watch for the games sequences the best moment in the entire film but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre br br though still packed with humour this film has a more dramatic film towards it with stakes being more serious and situations more <UNK> br br this gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature the creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot the fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present as is evident in the final couple of scenes br br the first watch i hated this sequel but the second time was a real joy as i appreciated the jokes and story more and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor bogus journey has enough feel good motives jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film
<START> the movie is truly poignant unique and uplifting the story is universal in that it's a battle between good evil and the world between the most important thing is that its rating is wrong misleading and a travesty blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub titles
<START> this is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 the national film <UNK> foundation says 1969 and imdb says 1972 regardless of the exact date the film definitely appears to be very <UNK> of this general time period with some camera work and pop art <UNK> that are pure late 60s early 70s br br the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art and like most performance art it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome the film to put it even more <UNK> is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understood by us <UNK>
<START> the first and only time i saw shades was during a <UNK> it hadn't even been in premiere i remember there was someone of the directors staff there don't even remember who it was a <UNK> movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he's stands miles ahead all the rest he plays an actor who's star has long stopped rising he's helping to realise a movie in <UNK> entitled shades br br as soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is nothing against the occasional swear word however this was way beyond annoying whenever rourke uses the f word to express something it comes naturally however when someone from the cast a non english <UNK> uses the f or s word it becomes arrogant and aggressive br br we quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre and we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10 and we were looking for the 10
<START> i saw this in the summer of 1990 i'm still annoyed by how bad this movie is in 2001 br br implausible plot you'd have to be a child to think this could happen br br i'm just really annoyed by it don't see this
<START> the movie atlantis the lost empire is a shining gem in the <UNK> of films produced by the disney studios recently parents who have had to sit through the jungle book 2 or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one br br the film is one of few to attempt at an original story previous feature films were merely re <UNK> of existing stories films such as toy story finding <UNK> and monsters inc all do the same but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video and are sequels to an existing successful film the quality of those films is given way to the <UNK> a new era started with atlantis following it were <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and most recently open range the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past br br a good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years including that of young milo <UNK> voiced by michael j fox milo is employed by a museum in washington d c his grandfather was a renowned <UNK> who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis this was seen as a waste by his peers and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps after failing to convince the museum board of directors to <UNK> his expedition milo comes home to find a woman in his <UNK> apartment she takes him to her <UNK> a mr <UNK> <UNK> was a close friend of <UNK> grandfather and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis mr <UNK> is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything the crew that is to <UNK> him is the same as his <UNK> the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis not just the discovery of people it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience br br the animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation the movie is very successful in <UNK> traditional animation with computer generated images a feat not easily achieved most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two the characters are <UNK> human there are some nice chase type scenes with lots of action going on a few <UNK> are filled with jokes that the children just may not get br br the creativity of the writers really shines through the culture of atlantis is richly developed including an entire language the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources such as <UNK> the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained believable if by a younger audience that magic really does exist the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic but can best be described in this way br br although set in <UNK> the level of technology used is unrealistic the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain <UNK> <UNK> complete with sub <UNK> that fire <UNK> the giant <UNK> are driven by steam <UNK> so they did try for some era technology the female characters are <UNK> in a way that women of the age would not have been even holding roles in <UNK> this is not a bad thing it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to rather than an all male cast br br one reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song ever a tradition that began with the first feature film snow white and carried on through to the lion king almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs this is great and all what would the seven <UNK> be without hi ho after the <UNK> time through it'd almost be better without but this one <UNK> the parent not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song i for one am grateful br br the storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children
<START> i give this five out of 10 all five marks are for <UNK> who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is <UNK> on the appalling we have countless full face shots of <UNK> where he could almost be doing anything taking a pee perhaps we don't see his hands on the guitar thats the point also we're given plenty shots of <UNK> from behind there appears to be three cameras on <UNK> but amateur fools operate all of them the guy in front of <UNK> seems to be keen to wander his focus <UNK> about the stage as if <UNK> on the guitar is a mere distraction while the guy behind is <UNK> on <UNK> in on a few chicks in the <UNK> than actually <UNK> the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the <UNK> the sound recording is good thanks to <UNK> <UNK> interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers <UNK> against vietnam etc on tracks like machine gun complete waste of film if <UNK> had lived even another two years berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes the one gem it does contain is the incredible johnny b good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> just look at the poor robert <UNK> character great performance once again who tries to <UNK> a sub machine gun from one of the terrorists everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong the biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm <UNK> in the <UNK> of the early <UNK> the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic ironic and therefore timeless die hard the story comes through as a failed attempt to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> ideas like when a <UNK> shouts <UNK> down all good guys do it and all bad guys don't so that they can blast away ad <UNK> with a good conscience that the main character does not get <UNK> down by the gas masked <UNK> although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their <UNK> just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously and it just happens that it tries to be more than just fun don't talk about the toilet mirror <UNK> episode br br i don't mind the criticism of the <UNK> movement as a shield for <UNK> and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the settled even headed <UNK> of power in this movie but the political comment is rather lame and uninspired this is <UNK> <UNK> as the movie features an early performance of judy davies she plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the <UNK> anyway her performance is a notch above that of the others and somehow i feel the movie let her down
<START> yes the cameras were in the right place at the right time it's so interesting to see how a world leader like chavez who supports the poor people in his country can be held in such low <UNK> in the us his worst sin in my opinion is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel what can be so bad about that i have always been fascinated by the us government media reaction to <UNK> castro at first castro was a good guy around 1959 when he <UNK> <UNK> soon however castro started turning the <UNK> in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats we're a decent country but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor if these guys are <UNK> then we could use more <UNK> especially where the <UNK> of the poor live in the world
<START> ok ok don't get bent out of round i was kidding br br <UNK> out is actually a better and <UNK> title <UNK> br br racism and crime dramas get the <UNK> treat meant from our x rated animator friend <UNK> boy and he does one of his better jobs here br br on the crime front it shows the truth they build it defend it then boredom and stronger rivals cause them to maybe lose it see for yourself to see what goes down br br racist i don't know with <UNK> rip and the love <UNK> also rip being black and the main point of view i saw it as an attack on racism mostly the fact that richard <UNK> liked it says as much as well and the younger pre miami vice phil mike thomas in there was a nice surprise br br it's an animated <UNK> film that's a good thing done well and well done it will make some <UNK> like the <UNK> scene but unfortunately that's based on fact br br but <UNK> really should have re thought that title
<START> i first saw this movie when i was a <UNK> in high school and the film has stuck with me through the years it's not about the soundtrack or cinematography or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting it's about the educational purpose and the message behind that is the most important it's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school and it's not really a bad thing either but it is a problem tons of girls i knew are all having children now and i guess they never watched this great movie and if they did they clearly didn't get the message behind it all it's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship any girl can get pregnant the first time it's not a myth you don't necessarily lose out on your dreams but they do have to take a <UNK> in your future because you have a child to think about first br br this movie has a clear message behind it just say no
<START> at the point in time that the lady from shanghai was being made the marriage of orson welles and rita hayworth was <UNK> the film was as much an effort by welles to <UNK> the old flames as it was to make a classic noir not received well at the time the lady from shanghai has gotten more and more critical acclaim as years pass gotten better with age so to speak br br welles is irish <UNK> michael o'hara who on a <UNK> night <UNK> the beautiful rita hayworth from three <UNK> in central park sparks do fly but then comes the rub turns out the lady is married to crippled but brilliant criminal attorney everett sloane nevertheless sloane takes an apparent liking to welles and hires him to <UNK> his <UNK> br br so far this film is starting to sound a lot like <UNK> if orson had seen <UNK> and was not at this point thinking with his male member he would have <UNK> back to the <UNK> hiring hall in lower manhattan instead he gets himself involved in a lovely web or intrigue and finds himself <UNK> for two murders and sloane as his <UNK> <UNK> br br welles for whatever reason decided that his wife would be a blond in this film supposedly harry <UNK> hit the roof as rita was <UNK> known for her <UNK> red hair this may have <UNK> him on the picture as he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw <UNK> vision of independent film making a threat to their power br br stage actor glenn <UNK> plays <UNK> partner <UNK> who is one slimy dude he winds up a corpse the other corpse to be here is ted <UNK> a bottom feeding private detective who tries to go in business for himself br br it's a good noir thriller showing rita at her glamorous best even if she was a blond here the final shoot out in the hall of mirrors is beautifully staged but i wouldn't recommend seeing it if one is on any controlled substance
<START> the first time you see the second renaissance it may look boring look at it at least twice and definitely watch part 2 it will change your view of the matrix are the human people the ones who started the war is <UNK> a bad thing
<START> i first watched this movie on its release in 1987 and was greatly affected emotionally through a combination of guilt at what my fellow white human beings could do to innocent people and the <UNK> of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against man br br particularly moving was the funeral of steve biko made even more vivid and hard hitting by the south african <UNK> played at the time i have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in south africa i consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and i can <UNK> to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just south africa but how we as white people perceive black people i have never seen any difference between people of any colour or <UNK> but after viewing this film i physically changed my life and have spent the last 17 years living in a <UNK> black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible the greatest reward i can honestly say i have received to be able to say that in my own small way i have contributed and <UNK> the balance a little but if more people thought like me and actually did something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off br br i challenge any right thinking person to watch cry freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion <UNK> at your <UNK> as you witness the 700 <UNK> brutally shot dead in <UNK> for <UNK> to learn <UNK> the senseless murder of steve biko such a champion for his own people's rights and then ultimately to understand that all this is not merely a film albeit a magnificent one but that it all actually happened and less than 30 years ago br br yes my friends watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard i couldn't i was too upset at knowing the truth that is the hallmark of a great film it was obviously the intention of sir richard attenborough to get this message over about south africa of course he has achieved it unless you happen to support apartheid god help you
<START> this is one of the <UNK> episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun but i appreciated this light hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level think about it the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland a <UNK> tiger a samurai warrior a knight on <UNK> who kills mccoy and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end despite all the danger you just can't take everything very seriously it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal so on a purely non aesthetic level it's great stuff
<START> i typically don't like reality shows particularly the ones that are <UNK> off of american idol 's success but this one i can live with br br comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent <UNK> and if they like them those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do survivor style <UNK> using comedic tactics then one will be determined as last comic standing i do like stand up comedy so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through it started the careers of such talents as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> may and josh blue br br my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama at first they lived together in a house like big brother but now they've done away with that thank god br br and there are a lot of comedians i felt were only chosen not because they're funny but because of race <UNK> attitude sex etc when other comics clearly should've beaten them out but overall it's a well made reality show which are two terms up until now i thought were an <UNK>
<START> ok first the good <UNK> performance and the cinematography although i'm no cher fan she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written the cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance br br the rest a thin <UNK> nicholas <UNK> performance and a totally <UNK> and weak attempt to portray an italian american family from new york firstly <UNK> time cage opened his mouth i <UNK> i don't know what kind of accent he was trying use i honestly don't it sure <UNK> any new york or italian accent i've ever heard it was quite surreal and it wasn't because i'm some <UNK> for accuracy his voice just <UNK> in my ears and i like nicholas cage in other performances secondly and this is purely <UNK> but i have many italian relations friends and <UNK> in new york city and frankly i've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided and that would be on a boring night at the house what a let down
<START> each of the major studios <UNK> out <UNK> one <UNK> throughout the thirties and forties with universal taking the lead while most looked as cheap on screen as they were to make warner bros which abruptly stopped making them in 1946 often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles mirrors and <UNK> effects thanks to some creative directors like jean <UNK> it is fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studio br br what sets <UNK> the blues apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avant garde experiment than a hollywood musical filmed in july 1944 it transforms an ordinary jam session into a <UNK> dream escape from war time troubles <UNK> by the tune of on the sunny side of the street <UNK> <UNK> and cameraman robert <UNK> later to work with hitchcock were allowed plenty of artistic freedom perhaps because lester young was not glenn miller and the studio could care less how he and his fellow musicians were presented the <UNK> <UNK> is put to good use with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once norman <UNK> really <UNK> this process two decades later in <UNK> de <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> team achieved different effects in citizen kane the strong emphasis on <UNK> and lit cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time in some ways this <UNK> the psychedelic sixties but with a distinctly forties film noir style
<START> the third collaboration for karloff and lugosi sees a move away from poe and into the realm of the science fiction serial karloff plays dr <UNK> rukh creator of a device that can capture light <UNK> through his <UNK> in the <UNK> mountains and translate them into pictures that form a visual history of the universe br br before several guests including lugosi as dr <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> who had previously <UNK> at <UNK> theories he demonstrates the existence of an unknown <UNK> element here <UNK> <UNK> x contained in a meteor that fell to earth in darkest africa several thousand years ago karloff joins the expedition to prove his theories but <UNK> x is a <UNK> compound it levels mountains at long range and <UNK> <UNK> at short range rukh is <UNK> however and <UNK> himself glowing in the dark rather like those old ready <UNK> commercials dr <UNK> is on hand to <UNK> a counter active for the radiation but combination of poison and cure drives rukh insanely paranoid convinced he has been cheated he seeks out the members of the expedition in paris including his estranged wife and his very touch while in his <UNK> state means death br br along the way we get the old pseudo scientific idea that a dead person's eyes record the image of their killer a remarkably distinct karloff and the <UNK> x device used to <UNK> melt <UNK> that represent the expedition members and even a touch of james whale in a cockney <UNK> in paris br br the invisible ray is great fun aside from the gothic opening it's interesting to see universal move the action around to africa and paris the film lacks pace but is always absorbing karloff slightly <UNK> his performance but lugosi is terrific universal used the basic story outline again in man made monster this time with <UNK> <UNK> jr as the glowing menace this time caused by electricity and lionel <UNK> as a much <UNK> doctor than lugosi is here the invisible ray is a <UNK> and clever little film with much to admire not as famous as other universal horrors perhaps but it works and is highly entertaining
<START> it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again the <UNK> girls is such a movie in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more <UNK> was this story <UNK> for the writer director it has the aura of reality br br the all star cast present their characters <UNK> and with <UNK> who would not want <UNK> <UNK> as an older sister i have loved her work since for <UNK> br br with most movies one <UNK> belief because we know that it is the work of actors producers directors sound <UNK> etc it was hard to suspend such belief in the <UNK> girls one feels such a part of this family how i wanted to come to the defense of <UNK> when her family is <UNK> her emotional life and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at <UNK> <UNK> hair color the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feel good quality that <UNK> far more than <UNK> and such br br the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be <UNK> and <UNK> br br it is no coincidence that the family name <UNK> translated from the italian means 'the loved <UNK>
<START> the only reason i even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it zero out of 10 was not allowed this was the biggest waste of time i've ever endured for roughly 75 minutes you are subjected to the worst acting and i don't mean that in a good way either like as in killer nerd which had great horrible acting and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also has absolutely nothing to do with a massacre the reason i even rented this piece of crap was because it has massacre in the title that said there was only one killing in the entire movie and it was pretty lame at that you spend more time watching the kids <UNK> and doing yard work than anything speaking of the kids the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since bob from house by the cemetery did i mention it was shot on video as well if you want to throw away money and over an hour of your life then by all means watch it but if you <UNK> your hard earned dollars and time then stray as far away as possible
<START> hi everyone my names <UNK> i'm 13 years old when i was about 4 years old i watch curly sue and it knocked my <UNK> of i have been watching that movie for a long time in fact about 30 minutes ago i just got done watching it <UNK> porter is a really good actor and i love that movie its so funny when she is dealing the cards every time i watch that movie at the end of it i cry its so said i know i'm only 13 years old but its such a touching story its really weird thats <UNK> is 25 years old now every time i watch a movie someone is always young and the movie comes out like a year after they make it and when u watch it and find out how old the person in the movie really is u <UNK> how they can go from one age to the next like harry potter that movie was also great but still daniel was about 12 years old in the first movie and i was about 11 so how could he go from 12 to 16 in about 4 years and i'm only 13 i'm not sure if he is 16 right now i think he is almost 18 but thats kind of weird when u look at one movie and on the next there about 4 years old then u when they were only 1 in the last i'm not sure i have a big imagination and i like to <UNK> it i am kind of a computer person but i like to do a lot of kids things also i am very smart like curly sue in the movie but one thing i don't like in the movie is when that guy calls the foster home and makes curly sue get taken away i would kill that guy if he really had done it in real life well i'm going to stop writing i know a write a lot sometimes but kids do have a lot in there head that need to get out and if they don't kids will never get to learn br br <UNK>

<START> okay now what the hell is this supposed to be is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielberg's close encounters of the third kind or a <UNK> to the glorious days of <UNK> epics such as when dinosaurs ruled the earth and the lost world perhaps it's an intellectual philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend yes that must be it whatever it is the creators of the day time ended good old john <UNK> <UNK> of kingdom of the <UNK> and writer david <UNK> of tourist trap must have been <UNK> quite a lot <UNK> when they penned down the ideas for this demented <UNK> of genres the story doesn't make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but hey who cares as long as it's got <UNK> <UNK> dinosaurs <UNK> <UNK> headache inducing light laser shows and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the voice over introduction is practically <UNK> but no <UNK> as it's all <UNK> did you know that the definition of <UNK> isn't what we all think it is time doesn't necessarily pass by <UNK> it is one giant <UNK> words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us i have absolutely no idea what all this means but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tap dancing midget aliens and well mannered dinosaurs on screen together i deliberately say well mannered dinosaurs because at a certain point one of the <UNK> monsters <UNK> knocks on the front door before menacing his targets the crazy plot revolves on a family of <UNK> living in their <UNK> powered house in the middle of nowhere grandpa is extremely annoying the <UNK> even more <UNK> is a walking talking <UNK> <UNK> for plastic surgery the youngest son strangely resembles prince <UNK> and the young mother is  incredibly hot chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot <UNK> husband on business travel the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable i sincerely hope that the other reviewer who talked about excellent special effects was being sarcastic but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing br br grandpa you know what this is don't you this is a time space <UNK> br br <UNK> i'm not quite sure if i know what that means dad br br grandpa well i guess nobody really does br br make up your mind <UNK> do you know what it is or don't you and stop talking about the <UNK> like you're some kind of expert in the field the day time ended is an incredibly childish and not worth bothering for fantasy movie though i can totally understand that some of its fans <UNK> the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects the ending completely comes out of nowhere like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the <UNK> they were eating wore out unexpectedly

<START> hollywood hotel is a fast moving <UNK> wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from <UNK> which is sadly overlooked it should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of <UNK> <UNK> for hollywood the score by richard <UNK> and johnny <UNK> has a number of other gems however including the charming i'm like a fish out of water and <UNK> in the <UNK> the best musical number is let that be a lesson to you in which dick powell and company detail the <UNK> of people who found themselves behind the eight ball a fate which literally <UNK> slow burning edgar kennedy at the <UNK> end the picture <UNK> hollywood <UNK> and <UNK> it all at once as it gets a lot of comic <UNK> out of pompous and ego <UNK> actors and <UNK> studio executives the cast includes a <UNK> of great character comedians <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> press agent ted <UNK> as dick <UNK> would be manager fritz <UNK> as an <UNK> restaurant <UNK> glenda farrell as <UNK> <UNK> sarcastic gal friday edgar kennedy as a put upon drive in manager mabel todd as <UNK> goofy sister and hugh herbert as her even <UNK> dad the racist element mentioned in another review here is a ten second bit where herbert appears in black face during a pseudo gone with the wind sequence it's in questionable taste but it shouldn't prevent you from seeing the other <UNK> in this film notably the benny goodman <UNK> including teddy wilson and lionel <UNK> in what i believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz <UNK> the dark eyes sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late but otherwise hollywood hotel is a gem well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for dvd release
<START> my <UNK> still <UNK> from the burning <UNK> <UNK> on it when i <UNK> i love this film bring on the <UNK> i'll walk over them as well to say again that i love bend it like beckham granted there's a lot of in spite of in that confession it's a bit movie of the week the screenplay is on the paint by numbers side and most <UNK> the director's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin br br the film's genius is not in what's obvious to the <UNK> field <UNK> eye character <UNK> themes construction it's in both the surface and what <UNK> deep beneath but not in those layers of artistic <UNK> that reviewers seem most often to scratch at powerful sometimes semi clad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of <UNK> female strength and <UNK> than lara <UNK> or zhang <UNK> will ever do these are real bodies <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later they are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self determination and in my book lead actress <UNK> <UNK> is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed <UNK> <UNK> but because her performance has an honesty and un <UNK> intelligence that's utterly compelling br br the result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like they're making a <UNK> with the devil to do so as in <UNK> bride and prejudice the relationships amongst women <UNK> with a chemistry that can't be neatly <UNK> into the <UNK> sweet valley high categories of best friends or sisters perhaps <UNK> is even right in her commentary to <UNK> the film's <UNK> with <UNK> bend it like beckham has an electricity that can't be reduced to the simple <UNK> homosexual love triangle its <UNK> structured script would suggest the precise nature of its pleasure is ultimately a bit of a mystery  and is all the more seductive for it br br oh yes and did i mention that it's hilarious
<START> well it's robin hood as <UNK> all right just as advertised that didn't sound very hopeful and alas it was worse than i'd suspected br br a <UNK> robin i can take a robin who <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> daughter i can credit but a robin who <UNK> not very funny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow and a robin and entire cast who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom how could anyone let such <UNK> delivery pass without re shooting the scenes again and again much sounds as if he's struggling with half <UNK> shakespeare rather than letting loose with a <UNK> <UNK> i hoped at the <UNK> that it was just a failed comedy <UNK> in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick but then it started <UNK> throughout the rest of the cast br br whatever else you say about errol flynn in the role he had the knack of delivering high <UNK> dialogue as naturally as if he'd just thought it up on the <UNK> of the moment and as this production shows that's not at all as easy as it sounds if they were going to cast the characters as <UNK> <UNK> the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines they sound as if they haven't a clue how to handle them br br i'm afraid i didn't even like the <UNK> sheriff for a similar reason the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered and in this case written with a <UNK> and a <UNK> at the audience they're out of place all right fourth wall <UNK> stuff but really not that funny br br this much promised production reminded me of a <UNK> school play the only actor and character i felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing guy of <UNK> who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on a credible <UNK> and b credible characterisation but frankly i wouldn't have said that was a very good <UNK> for the future of the series as of the time of writing i'll give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week with less stilted scene setting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue after all the opening episode of doctor who wasn't exactly a show <UNK> though it was nowhere near as bad as this but if i see no improvement after episode 2 i'm afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewer br br which would be a pity because i've got a soft spot for the robin hood legend on screen from the adventures of douglas fairbanks to the <UNK> <UNK> of richard greene but this robin fails to stir my blood in the slightest
<START> you know the story pretty kids alone in the woods when <UNK> something starts cutting them up br br well this crap is no different a bunch of kids return to a cabin where the male leads twin brother disappeared for years before suddenly an <UNK> creature stars cutting them up and their only help is a doctor biker br br to say this film was bad is an understatement it's <UNK> the acting was horrible br br the creature looked very cheesy and as all films do these days they try to get you with a twist ending which they do not br br there is one bright spot to this film lost star maggie grace as the female lead
<START> this movie is about development people growing and people <UNK> people surprising and people disappointing it has it all and more there is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut role br br this movie made me feel very human and proud of it and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all <UNK> in the world it touches your compassion rating 10 of 10 br br ps i admit it i shed a tear of joy during the final scene
<START> and an extremely bad one at that how long did this train wreck last 14 episodes or something i can see why now br br i bought the <UNK> episode from amazon <UNK> it was my first purchase so was free that is the only good thing about the experience incident br br i won't comment really on the acting since these were i guess fairly new people who hadn't really gotten the job down just right yet at least i've never seen them before in any type of major show theater or tv if i did then i have easily forgotten them br br but the special effects were absolutely horrendous true this isn't exactly a multi million project but the original star trek did better than this that was thirty five years ago i especially got a laugh out of the bad guys <UNK> or something like that ship as it chased the hilarious looking <UNK> with smoke coming out of the <UNK> looking something like a gigantic model rocket i fully expected to eventually see the <UNK> <UNK> riding on top while chasing after the <UNK> modern jet rocket <UNK> don't even do it that bad br br and that wasn't even the worst of it the wild west type shoot outs had me wondering if i was actually watching a sci fi film or a gene <UNK> one br br regardless of the hype don't waste your time i did all 80 something minutes of the disaster called <UNK>
<START> billed as a kind of sequel to the full monty about unemployed men in <UNK> this movie is a fake br br as someone born in <UNK> and still with <UNK> to the city i was extremely disappointed by this film someone said it could have been set in <UNK> and that just about sums it up for me this looked like a romantic view of northern england made for the us market probably many americans and many southern english people don't realize that <UNK> is a big city of around half a million inhabitants with a sophisticated urban culture in among giants it was depicted as some dreary dead end semi rural small town where everyone in <UNK> seemed to drink in the same old fashioned pub and where the people's idea of a party was line dancing in some village hall <UNK> this was a small close <UNK> community not a <UNK> city br br the working class <UNK> men were totally unlike their real life counterparts who are generally <UNK> and communicate with each other in <UNK> and brief dry remarks they don't <UNK> and they certainly don't sing in <UNK> br br even the rural settings supposedly in the peak district looked alien to me i recognized a few places where i used to go <UNK> but some of the <UNK> shots of <UNK> <UNK> out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of <UNK> indeed in the credits at the end i spotted a reference to <UNK> <UNK> the peak district is in the summer <UNK> with <UNK> and tourists in cars it is <UNK> between two big cities it is not some kind of wilderness br br as for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with and lust after pete <UNK> that was ludicrous and could only have been a male dream her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent none of the men was shown as having a partner or families they existed in a <UNK> br br anyone wanting to see a film about unemployed <UNK> would have been led <UNK> this <UNK> existed only in the minds of its middle class writers and film makers br br it was a gigantic fake br br
<START> writer director peter <UNK> <UNK> his title as the high lord of art house <UNK> with his latest exercise in obnoxious self <UNK> 8 <UNK> women the film follows a wealthy <UNK> and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction as they lure and blackmail women guess how many into joining their personal collection of <UNK> br br think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive and chances are <UNK> done it the female characters are little more than a <UNK> of <UNK> for the two protagonists to <UNK> of there's the <UNK> obsessed <UNK> the ever pregnant <UNK> and <UNK> who's got a thing for farm animals <UNK> has no legs and uses a wheelchair she's the half woman get it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all <UNK> of <UNK> but if this isn't it then what is br br the film goes on to <UNK> anything and everything having to do with japan a <UNK> of themes from his <UNK> worthy but less sexist 1996 film the <UNK> book but where the the <UNK> book was erotic and <UNK> 8 <UNK> women just gets horny and exploitative <UNK> work is tasteless and arrogant in its <UNK> and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur himself
<START> rock n roll high school holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the ramones i was too young during the <UNK> mid 70s <UNK> to be very aware of them although i had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time i finally saw <UNK> on television one afternoon in the mid 80s when i was about fifteen years old and laughed all the way through it isn't it every high school kid's dream to trash his school and blow it up all set to a <UNK> soundtrack i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again thinking man these guys kick ass i have to check out some of their albums the rest is history twenty years <UNK> ramones <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and three ramones shows later they're still one of my all time favorite bands and <UNK> still cracks me up every time i watch it now that joey dee dee and johnny have left us r i p all at least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by
<START> one of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from <UNK> the idea of living the <UNK> river before it's turned into a lake comes from burt <UNK> lewis who <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> into their worst nightmare but if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story with our men forced to make a decision that they know will change their lives forever in very bad ways at the end of the movie each person is gonna be forced to deal with the <UNK> of what had just to be a quite week end on the river but muted into a fight for survival the movie except some pretty evident goofs is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath the photography is excellent as well voight reynolds cox and beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake
<START> a killer cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder at his grave a cult have gathered with plans to <UNK> him by <UNK> onto the grave this of course works and he <UNK> ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look the two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the <UNK> of the city and has a drug problem are back on the case two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by <UNK> some other kind of dead thing thinking they have <UNK> they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original <UNK> sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish br br the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out now i'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible if it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their <UNK> i would probably have fallen asleep there is a bit of gore but it's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times there is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll the doll with the <UNK> voice is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a film it is just a plastic toy on a fishing line br br the ending is extremely bad you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does god knows how they made enough money to make a sequel br br 4 10
<START> i had a chance to see a screening of this movie recently i believe that it will be in theaters in canada some time around mother's day if it is in a theater near you go it's not a funny feel good movie it's more along the lines of a feel and think movie br br the director does an excellent job of character development letting you into the heart mind and hurts of <UNK> little by little at first her attitudes and <UNK> don't make much sense as her story unfolds she becomes someone you can understand as in life understanding brings empathy i found her likable by the end of the movie particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man in the shack by the lake br br <UNK> relationship with her two sons is painful and <UNK> of so many of our own experiences in this world her youngest son john who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the very edge of their seat and into the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare br br it's fun to see ellen page acting in this movie she is so very different than the young woman that she plays in <UNK> it gives me an even <UNK> appreciation for her acting ability if you loved her in <UNK> you'll love her in the stone angel br br of course there is ellen <UNK> as <UNK> there is likely no way of expressing the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor to make you forget every other character they have ever played never once in the course of this movie did i ever think of ellen <UNK> i always and only thought of <UNK> she swept me into her character hook line and <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> capacity to capture on film this renowned book by one of <UNK> most <UNK> authors is impressive she brilliantly brings to the screen both the <UNK> and <UNK> parts of this complex woman <UNK> the stone angel
<START> normally i'm not motivated to write reviews but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must i <UNK> at the <UNK> predictable plot the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and <UNK> even at the most tense moment of the movie molly <UNK> stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production even the twist at the end wasn't i've heard it said that the movie didn't take itself seriously but i could find little evidence of that in the movie br br cut should have been left on the cutting room floor do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else
<START> i'm a jean harlow fan because she had star quality i don't think her movies are good and i don't even think that she was a good actress but she certainly was great in comedies every bit of comedy in the girl from <UNK> is very good but this movie is perhaps more like a love story jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast their performances bring nothing new it always <UNK> me much to think that <UNK> beautiful body was that of an ill woman well in this movie she does look beautiful
<START> this is a quite slow paced movie slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger the viewer slowly feels that there's something wrong here br br i really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end it is clever well paced and very well acted both <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are deeply into their characters br br the little son <UNK> is also very touching br br a thriller which does not seem like one a very unconventional movie very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes br br i'll give it a 8 10
<START> i just watched the <UNK> <UNK> edition of blazing <UNK> one of my all time favorites the tv pilot for black bart <UNK> the plot was non existent and the acting was not good it was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of blazing <UNK> and there have been tv shows that have succeeded in doing take offs of big movies but this one would never have worked considering that for so many years tv would not even play the <UNK> noises when they <UNK> the movie it is <UNK> that they thought they could put a show on tv with the n word thrown around on the other hand i enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces there were quite a few actors actresses that i recognized from other shows over the years i had to write down all the names and do a few <UNK> that was fun i was arguing with my mother if steve <UNK> was from barney miller or mash i won
<START> <UNK> is an <UNK> i've heard many times when talking of certain tv shows most recently dramas like lost heroes and prison break have earned that description however as compelling as they may be and they really are i can wait a few days before i see the next episode of either series even prison break which some have <UNK> classified as the new 24 with all due respect there can be no such thing and for a good reason no other silver screen thriller is based on a real time structure that's what sets 24 apart from any other show and that's why i practically have to watch an entire season on dvd in seven days or less once the <UNK> clock starts <UNK> it's impossible to tune out br br an episode whose events <UNK> over the course of a single day was a trademark of <UNK> blue and more recently <UNK> having an entire season of a new series last 24 hours one per <UNK> the actual running time is <UNK> minutes the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials when the show <UNK> on telly was the most groundbreaking idea in mainstream television since hill street blues introduced non linear storytelling a mandatory element nowadays and it truly paid off br br ironically enough the original plan for the series was to make it <UNK> around a wedding fortunately creators joel <UNK> and robert <UNK> realized the format was more suitable for a conspiracy thriller which is probably the reason the first glimpse we get of the hero suggests a cheerful atmosphere looking extremely relaxed jack bauer <UNK> sutherland is enjoying a game of chess with his daughter <UNK> elisha <UNK> and minutes later being tender with <UNK> leslie hope the wife with whom he has just <UNK> as in the sopranos though something unexpected and shocking is just behind the corner not only has kim <UNK> out of her room jack also receives a phone call <UNK> him to get to work immediately at midnight i'm afraid so bauer is a <UNK> counter terrorist unit agent and his boss has acquired reliable <UNK> about a possible hit on the life of david <UNK> dennis <UNK> an african american presidential candidate who will be in los angeles for the whole day oh right i almost forgot events occur on the day of the california presidential primary no time for <UNK> then jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case unfortunately he has a tendency to ignore <UNK> and that doesn't sit well with george mason <UNK> berkeley a slimy man from division who has been asked to <UNK> with the operation br br the plot is very dense making the show hard to recommend for those with a short attention span but anyone willing to take a look will be rewarded instantly the writing is sharp and precise the attention to detail <UNK> and the suspense is consistently sky high mainly thanks to the real time <UNK> which considerably enhances the <UNK> level br br another great quality of this pilot is the characterization most genre shows sci fi and thriller tend to simply introduce the key players and then define them later on a <UNK> example is <UNK> where character development is minimal but then again that matches the show's unique style whereas the series debut of 24 offers a rich array of fully rounded people among whom jack <UNK> best role ever and <UNK> the real revelation of the show stand out for being perfectly described after one episode only the former divided between job and family reckless but <UNK> the latter honorable and <UNK> with great integrity a couple of supporting parts border on stereotype mason and tony <UNK> especially but two factors ought to be taken into account a this is the first episode b there's so much going on most viewers won't even complain about a flaw or two after all how many network programs manage to begin with a conspiracy a missing teenager and a huge explosion and still have equally satisfying material for the rest of the season br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices i have made and how my life would change if my choices had been different it plays right into the multiple universe theory br br the only thing that doesn't ring true is how larry <UNK> james belushi has such a hard time understanding what is going on that everything has changed br br
<START> carter wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance the pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going the flying <UNK> look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them although the story isn't strong the action is fun and draws you to the very end which i felt could've had a sequel br br campy and dark this is great <UNK> <UNK> kung fu
<START> the worst movie i have seen in quite a while interesting first half with some engaging <UNK> dialogue among dubious characters in a late night bar the movie then <UNK> into a <UNK> succession of scenes aiming for visual shock read disgust without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else br br i wanted to walk out but the director was present at this showing and my <UNK> <UNK> me from showing him <UNK> still time is precious as the director himself observed in his intro and i really <UNK> the time i wasted on the second half of this one br br saving <UNK> were the three main characters in the first half of the movie especially the female lead
<START> the 100 black and white half hour episodes of the early situation comedy mr <UNK> were originally broadcast from <UNK> <UNK> on nbc like a lot of baby <UNK> this and <UNK> <UNK> school are my earliest memories of television since both ran later in <UNK> it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original <UNK> br br mr <UNK> is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value it represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like the <UNK> and i love lucy the genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the loud <UNK> path of those two shows which is probably why they still seem contemporary br br mr <UNK> which was <UNK> by its intelligent restrained tone may appear slow and dull in comparison but it's really more a matter of <UNK> to the different style once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers credit should be give to the show's producer fred <UNK> a key figure in early television whose dramatic <UNK> are also worth checking out <UNK> television <UNK> lights out <UNK> 90 producers showcase <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> theatre etc even on <UNK> br br mr <UNK> offered a much more gentle style with <UNK> cox to be the voice of underdog a few years later in the title role robinson <UNK> a mild mannered high school science teacher his glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive <UNK> br br the series provided cox with an outstanding supporting cast tony randall played his <UNK> best friend history teacher harvey <UNK> jack warden played frank whip the loud gym teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflict elements br br there is some love interest competition involving the <UNK> nurse nancy <UNK> patricia benoit with viewers quickly <UNK> with mr <UNK> who seems a much better match for the gentle nancy their on screen marriage near the end 1953 <UNK> season captured national attention an early version of the who shot j r frenzy br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> 12 year old <UNK> <UNK> accidentally kills his older brother eugene his feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with him or feel it is not the right thing to do his only <UNK> is his grandfather who is the only one who seems to have compassion on him the realism will <UNK> true 2 life movie lovers but will not satisfy those that desire action thrills
<START> bruce lee was a great martial artist but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made it has bruce lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it doesn't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air it just gets downright absurd from then like something out of a cheap comic book maybe the idea isn't so rotten but it isn't done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view there are dozens of such martial arts <UNK> out there usually all made in hong kong i think that jean claude van <UNK> improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera even steven <UNK> films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in hong kong <UNK> of death <UNK> falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion despite bruce lee being in it
<START> i saw this movie years ago on late night television back then it went by the title of <UNK> to heaven even as a young boy i remember being deeply moved by the story and <UNK> by the visual effects of the court trial those who have seen it know what i'm talking about such imagination a perfect blend of romance drama humour and fantasy this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made citizen kane casablanca gone with the wind this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so over <UNK> voters rated it 10 out of 10 over <UNK> rated it 8 or higher out of 10 i was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until i realized so few have seen rated this movie compared to those on the list what a pity i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region 1 north america so that 1 i can purchase it and 2 others discover this hidden treasure
<START> new york i love you is a collective work of eleven short films with each segment running around 10 minutes long the shorts don't exactly relate but they all have something in common love every short is about finding love either if it's about a couple or just two strangers <UNK> the film stars an ensemble cast among them <UNK> <UNK> natalie portman hayden christensen orlando bloom chris cooper andy garcia christina <UNK> <UNK> khan robin wright penn julie christie ethan hawke <UNK> cooper rachel <UNK> and anton <UNK> with such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise i was expecting a tremendous film the problem is new york i love you doesn't add up it remains the sum of its parts some of the segments are funny original and interesting but others are so meaningless orlando bloom christina <UNK> and ethan hawke maggie q segments that it's appalling the film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone story wise it seems like something a few film students could put together having said that the film has some great moments as well one of the best being the segment about an old couple played by eli <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> walking along in brooklyn on their <UNK> wedding <UNK> and it's moments like this that made me as a viewer wish the film was more consistent because there's a lot of potential here but as unsatisfying as the overall story ends up being for me the cinematography and soundtrack saved the all thing the editing was perfect the way the film was shot was very impressive and the <UNK> soundtrack couldn't be more fitting in the end new york i love you feels like an experimental film and as in most experiences there's <UNK> and <UNK> it's how one looks at the film as a whole that will determine if he enjoys it or not it might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others br br 7 10
<START> although the actors were good specially <UNK> <UNK> as the blind <UNK> the film script is <UNK> pretentious and completely <UNK> a famous theatre director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> becoming blind after a car accident is on the run for himself and his destiny <UNK> being <UNK> since her birth is teacher for blind persons and wants to make him seeing again blind persons are seeing with their fingers nose and ears here this movie is becoming a <UNK> and the longer the road becomes the closer their relation develops which was predictable since the beginning of the film the theatre director is on the road to his mother jenny <UNK> his mother is living somewhere in russia on the sea and making artistic <UNK> of course what should she do other and she is still living because she is waiting his son to die my god this are <UNK> br br finally the son arrived mum is celebrating a big party at the beach wind is blowing and a <UNK> is playing on a real piano in the middle of a <UNK> yes they are celebrating her farewell the son arrives just in time mother can finally swallow the <UNK> <UNK> by a pretty nurse now a great artist can die in the arms of her great artist son speaking sad <UNK> about live in perfect german while the son is answering with a rough accent because the son is unable to see he is not falling in love to the nurse the film script would have become also too <UNK> but is looking for <UNK> on the way back to home br br parallel to this <UNK> the sister of <UNK> staying at home is asking a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> her who has first to booze himself to courage the occasion is <UNK> because mum tina <UNK> is on journey together with the lover of <UNK> paul <UNK> <UNK> they are after <UNK> to bring her back paul and the mother of <UNK> are not falling in love because the film script would have become too <UNK> the film script missed to make out of paul something exceptional too i would suggest an architect or a <UNK> or course a famous one when they finally find <UNK> they want to convince her to come back to paul because he has two eyes to see and is able to care for her but <UNK> felt in love to his <UNK> the theatre director did i mention that he was even a famous theatre director br br this is german film art as you may see in this pretentious production that the german film <UNK> <UNK> is not always producing good films because they <UNK> just such kind of pseudo intellectual films this film is really embarrassing i have the impression that the film script has been <UNK> together from some <UNK> in coffee <UNK> and <UNK> everybody is entitled to contribute with an idea probably also <UNK> <UNK> has contributed with some intellectual flash of wit being a co producer i was reminded by this film script to an other german film of absolute <UNK> <UNK> already the spelling of the title is not right <UNK> dvd cover writes proudly a <UNK> <UNK> film this film got also <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> br br please don't spoil your time with this film there are really good films in germany watch out for film directors like marcus h <UNK> joseph <UNK> hans <UNK> hans christian <UNK> faith akin
<START> bela made 9 <UNK> for <UNK> but it was only at this one the 4th that things started to come together all the rest in the series would use this one as the essential <UNK> for production writing and character development from here on better or worse the series would also deal with one essential theme a scientist usually bela makes experiments in the basement or the old house sometimes in the basement in the old house that causes things to go <UNK> this was also the first time that art director dave <UNK> got a chance to spread his wings he came on board for black dragons the flick before but this one is where he gets to make his craft start to click lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing and was around for all the rest of the <UNK> casting is key in these and it's a pretty good one b movie wise here you get <UNK> and <UNK> also from black dragons along with russell who would star in <UNK> cat people movies and <UNK> from <UNK> run wild a nice slice of poverty row talent if you have limited time and budget start with this one it sums up everything they had learned up to this point and gives you something to compare the rest to the plot bela steals <UNK> juice to keep his nasty wife young they both like to sleep in <UNK> if you can read that and smile the rest will be easy
<START> the subsequent two seasons of this original series was less than <UNK> the latter seasons disastrous <UNK> contributed to its three season short life span maybe if the plug was pulled after the first season it would've gained a cult following br br aside from that the first season was truly hilarious witty clever with superb writing it was promising the first <UNK> excellent <UNK> had the right ingredients characters actors storyline and so forth plus a comedy about a <UNK> reporter was original to boot nora and her fellow <UNK> on the <UNK> night after night day after day for the <UNK> br br a lot of things don't make sense to me like how this show and another <UNK> of mine gross <UNK> never made it if only the first seasons of the naked truth and <UNK> <UNK> were released on dvd please anyone out there
<START> okay i know i shouldn't like this movie but i do from pat <UNK> <UNK> interpretation of a japanese stereotype to jay <UNK> annoying yell i laughed throughout this movie as long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world it's a good <UNK> br br my favorite part is <UNK> talking to his boss in tokyo with the drinking a close second
<START> caught this movie on the tube on a sunday i thought it was so bad i looked it up on imdb to see what others thought of it i was not surprised at the amount of silly people who enjoyed this fluff i was however surprised when i looked into the comments to read the hated it categories only to find that their were none i was shocked at this i always look at the hated it's as their are always those who hate a movie no matter how good it is somehow this movie made it through <UNK> by the <UNK> i say <UNK> to that and <UNK> proudly that i hate this movie i know i should go into detail about why i hate this movie but to do so would only grant this movie more respect than it deserves
<START> br br i suppose this is not the best film ever made but i voted it at 10 stars all the same mainly because of my feelings at the end i and all the people around me were simply touched this is something you don't often feel we are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films the story of the film <UNK> around jane a young woman in the last stages of <UNK> and the friendship that grows between her and richard a man on the verge of a breakdown this could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous <UNK> and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie br br the acting from branagh and bonham carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role the chemistry between the two also lifts the movie br br the title comes from richards masterpiece a plane made of junk and his old paintings flying here is a symbol for both richards and <UNK> living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end br br a beautiful and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone don't let the subject matter put you off
<START> as we all know the sub genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded simply being <UNK> raunchy isn't enough anymore i've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days br br coming into the 40 year old virgin i knew basically what to expect i did see the commercials after all is it true that if you don't use it you lose it what i didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development there's still the weird off the wall characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink <UNK> <UNK> but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message br br the main character andy is unfortunately for me a person i can relate to in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater 3000 he has a poster for the movie on his wall and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of <UNK> andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike most importantly of all andy is a nice person he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer it's like my life story br br the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend <UNK> are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie br br i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go it's quite simple it deals with <UNK> relationship with <UNK> for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end sure its final <UNK> is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end and i assure you it does these are definitely small <UNK> on the movie but there's so much good here that i can easily ignore it's few faults br br when i say good i mean bad of course this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad for the most part i think it succeeded there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an <UNK> after <UNK> to have sex with <UNK> or the scene where andy goes with his <UNK> daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest <UNK> sequence <UNK> <UNK> se <UNK> an interesting little note about that scene the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part br br actually since we're talking about steve carell i'd like to say that he has now <UNK> on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film i was just so impressed by his writing acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles this man has talent it the 40 year old virgin proves that br br to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see i'm glad that i did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time and it <UNK> as something you feel is worth watching it's not simply a series of sex gags <UNK> together rather it's a series of sex gags <UNK> with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance now excuse me while i go <UNK> my guts out i can't believe i just wrote that br br my review from <UNK> waves http <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> page virgin
<START> i was lucky to see oliver in 1968 on a big cinema screen in boston when i was a young teenager later during the summer of 1969 i was pleased to see this film was still playing at a prominent cinema in <UNK> square london after it had won the academy award for best picture of the previous year br br <UNK> success of oliver on both the stage and screen reminded me that not all talent begins on broadway and ends in hollywood this legendary story by charles dickens which is part of the literary <UNK> of all english speaking people was admirably brought to the london stage by lionel bart of great britain his charming musical then became a hit in new york and throughout the world the film adaptation was made in england during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968 the sets and musical numbers are mind <UNK> the song who will buy required hundreds of actors and the british film director truly deserved his oscar for putting it all together in a <UNK> manner some canadian and american talent is also part of this wonderful production but mostly it is a tribute to the fine <UNK> of the british film studios such as <UNK> good show other film studios at <UNK> <UNK> wood <UNK> <UNK> and ealing have also given the world many films to treasure over the years
<START> for the <UNK> beatles fan the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws inaccuracies combined events <UNK> events wildly exaggerated events <UNK> people <UNK> errors <UNK> <UNK> quotes incorrect clothing out of place songs and shame shame incorrect <UNK> and other <UNK> i just cant think of right now the flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your <UNK> br br i didn't give this a 1 primarily due the fact that it is filmed in <UNK> and the actors the band rain give it their all the lennon character is credible and does a good job also the song cry for a shadow is heard at one point and that counts for something br br so watch it for fun but please don't take it as historically accurate
<START> with this movie only running <UNK> minutes and nothing all that good on television i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time even while realizing the era from which it was coming i was sorely disappointed it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score what no brooding music and then the rather slow moving opening sequences gosh i figured a movie about zombies even from the 1930s would have some chills to it white zombie with bela lugosi certainly did but this had none zero it was <UNK> even dramatic except for the few moments with the burning eyes <UNK> on the film to indicate the <UNK> of someone like the equally dull king of the zombies this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own but nothing more
<START> in all my 60 years of age i have learned that when we watch a movie there is an <UNK> whether we want it or not <UNK> with an specific character br br sometimes because the character <UNK> certain gesture sometimes because the character speaks <UNK> word or sentence  that we use or that we would like to use  in <UNK> situation br br the movie in question should be seen by this point of view who now find a parking space  in a mall downtown or in the street taken by a car whose driver can't remember to think that he is not the only driver in the world br br who hasn't the urge to rubber out the ill mannered <UNK> br br <UNK> said that i ask did you identify with della played by kim <UNK> if your answer is yes then try not to find absurd details  <UNK> with life's reality  in the movie because you'll certainly find the movie ridiculous br br <UNK> made you will see that the movie has moments of surprise such as 1 in the sequence in which della grabs the box of tools in the <UNK> does that box contains a gun and does she <UNK> the guts to use it 2 in the sequence in which terry dies whilst falling 3 in the sequence in which della gets attracted by <UNK> <UNK> call br br if you have already seen the movie or if are planning seeing keep in mind that there are realistic movies fiction movies political movies and movies in which you can wash your soul  to <UNK> the last one we can quote <UNK> de elite br br according to <UNK> there was <UNK> applause when <UNK> officials take certain attitudes as i have seen the movie in dvd i could not <UNK> the audience's reaction  br br as for the direction part susan <UNK> interpretations kim <UNK> lukas <UNK> craig <UNK> etc edition william m anderson  <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>  exceptional edition <UNK> <UNK> etc it is well <UNK> in context in a scale of 1 awful to 10 master piece i rate when she was out a 7 regular
<START> new york i love you just like its predecessor paris je t'aime is a compound of various stories that reflects the different kinds and aspects of love but unlike it the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter the movie offers a unique view of the city of new york with its various and different landscapes new york i love you offers a first class cast featuring such great actors like <UNK> <UNK> natalie portman ian <UNK> hayden christensen <UNK> <UNK> and orlando bloom ethan hawke james <UNK> and robin wright penn among others and some excellent writers and directors like brett <UNK> and anthony <UNK>
<START> i saw this many years after the television series and initially i didn't care for it then as my memory of the series <UNK> with the passage of time i watched again and found it absolutely hilarious based on the stage play by neil simon it has not been <UNK> <UNK> much for the big screen and that's one of its strengths walter matthau and jack lemmon are brilliant as oscar and felix and the supporting cast are wonderful particularly john <UNK> as <UNK> even now certain moments can <UNK> me to tears of laughter felix <UNK> oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request oscar cracking up and chasing felix around the apartment the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brought low by <UNK> <UNK> stories and of course the legendary <UNK> scene later ripped off by nora <UNK> <UNK> harry met <UNK> razor sharp dialogue too when the boys think felix has taken an <UNK> oscar says they could be <UNK> he could be the <UNK> one in the room fantastic
<START> the scenery is pretty and the dog is cute other than that this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it jack warden is pleasantly <UNK> as usual but the script is so awful that even he comes off badly the plot makes no sense the dialogue is dumb and there are numerous smaller faults but the dog is cute
<START> i can't help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tear <UNK> for one it's entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homes br br how can these families afford to maintain these new mega houses and what about their poor neighbors property <UNK> must surely increase after this happens plus the noise would annoy me br br second how excessive can a reality television show become it's practically the same repetitive junk week after week we're introduced to a suffering family they <UNK> the home then surprise the family and everyone breaks out the <UNK> boxes br br not to mention how boring the <UNK> part is the only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like but even that segment is destroyed by the phony <UNK> and constant <UNK> br br extreme <UNK> home edition is a show pretending to be heartfelt but it falls flat skip this one if you like reality television survivor is far superior and moving
<START> sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will <UNK> change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love story and think <UNK> how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this d n ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but <UNK> not great either was i glad <UNK> did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does 1 half good movie and won't do a film for less than 20 million and then everyone is <UNK> that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate <UNK> performance on the other hand was wonderful i also <UNK> that the director is very talented to put a film of such a <UNK> together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love stories as it is filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible 100 i give this film a mere <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> brothers bobby and peter are at it again with fever pitch the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes abandon that <UNK> when they decided to bring nick <UNK> film to the screen something that it would have been hard to do the novel of the same title dealt with a man's obsession with soccer since it is set in england where that sport <UNK> most of british sports fans it's to the credit of the writing team of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> the book into a language that would appeal to most americans when they make their hero a boston red sox fan br br fever pitch is a film that presents an obsessive fan ben <UNK> whose life revolves into the red sox season and who is an <UNK> grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them when ben takes four of his best <UNK> for a tour of a local firm he meets and falls hopelessly in love with the <UNK> lindsey <UNK> a young woman who is going places but at thirty has no life of her own br br the story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the red sox at home games in <UNK> park this <UNK> fans are probably the most loyal people in the world having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but until 2004 never won a world series in fact the ending from what we heard had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had <UNK> them for <UNK> six years drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film ms barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera jimmy fallon a popular television comedian turned movie actor has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in taxi in our humble opinion br br the <UNK> brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale
<START> i tried to finish this film three times but it's god awful case in point mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast mom stops for gas crazy gas station <UNK> mad at her <UNK> whose running the b b try to rape her she escapes heads to b b and instead of <UNK> going <UNK> and she wanting to call the cops story just continues with <UNK> behavior on both their parts wow br br other action logic <UNK> abound acting is also <UNK> and the next door <UNK> warning is delivered in a really corny badly acted moment br br moments of intense gore death <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> scenes of time filler interplay between characters br br less focus on gore more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated
<START> the ex mrs <UNK> 1936 starring thin man series star william powell this film was released the same year as the second thin man film after the thin man comes very close to <UNK> the fun and style of the thin man films but it nonetheless misses still it is a wonderfully fun highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein br br is myrna loy missed of course let's not lie however i'd be hard pressed to name a better substitute than jean arthur and the chemistry between arthur and co star william powell is real and it's fun romantic and involving br br the story and screenplay by <UNK> <UNK> and john <UNK> production company partner james edward grant the angel the bad man is close to being up there with a thin man effort but lacks a bit of the proper wit and <UNK> br br while it's not in the <UNK> of 'the thin man movies what else is the ex mrs <UNK> is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery comedy who done its of the <UNK> 40s
<START> nora is a single mother of two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s as do her friends a group of writers singers and actors the <UNK> <UNK> philosophy isn't quite out of the system  and nora didn't count on falling in love particularly with a <UNK> <UNK> won her first of two <UNK> awards in the space of four years for her amazing portrayal of nora who makes sure she does the right thing by her children but falls in love with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the same time garner  who would later <UNK> in films such as love and other <UNK> and strange planet  is well cast as <UNK> pre <UNK> daughter and <UNK> perhaps in <UNK> for his role as host of the lifestyle program hot property in 2000 appears as a <UNK> painter early effort by director cameron is a winner he went on to make the award winning miniseries my brother jack among his later projects but it's the stunning delivery by <UNK> which brings to life the intelligent searching script based on helen <UNK> award winning novel
<START> i just finished watching guinea pig <UNK> experiment i have to say that this movie although having very good fx better then i expected was not a good movie i honestly cant say that i enjoyed this movie at all of course it is effective in its way of being a shocking realistic twisted <UNK> minutes of torture but i found it to be very boring and not as gory as i hoped and also i found that the <UNK> were very annoying when they talked and <UNK> trying to sound tough all the time that ruined it even more and im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one i have now seen guinea pig 1 2 3 5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 flowers of the flesh and blood i wont say much more about <UNK> experiment other than great fx descent acting from the girl annoying fu ing <UNK> overall i give it 4 stars on account of the fx <UNK> they are awesome
<START> i found darkness to be just too dark it had a kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas not bad action scenes and a few <UNK> moments to make you go ugh but it was <UNK> to the point of confusion you don't really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a film that is shot on super 8 film you already have all that nasty grain to deal with as with nathan <UNK> movies it's just too much director <UNK> <UNK> seems to want to make an original film but he lacks the know how to do it the camera is never pointed in the right place lack of <UNK> such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to light a movie hurt as well the actors are all pretty uneven and hammy but despite these <UNK> the music is good the gore is plenty and <UNK> from silly <UNK> to really good <UNK> is this a classic like it says is it worthy of the two <UNK> worth of praise no but it is a good first try now if these guys would stop <UNK> themselves on the back about this movie from what i understand here the only one they have ever finished for a while and try again they may do better
<START> the first 2 parts seek to <UNK> to absurdity the rise of <UNK> wars and rule by <UNK> <UNK> the 3rd part <UNK> that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to <UNK> a meaningful use of human talents and resources it has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or <UNK> but that make others <UNK> with excitement it depicts a space gun <UNK> and a helicopter along with inventive mass communication devices <UNK> flat screen <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> it's probably incorrect about <UNK> buildings in the future but it portrays a child like vision of <UNK> scientific technological investigation br br to me it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded <UNK> guided by a <UNK> like morality in their quest to <UNK> themselves and live <UNK> through scientific <UNK> and a <UNK> world government the pro progress characters such as the two <UNK> believe humanity could <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> our experiments and progress for future generations always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants br br arthur c clarke author of 2001 a space odyssey suggested this film to stanley kubrick as an example of an excellent sf movie kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on <UNK> <UNK> source <UNK> special <UNK> introduction to his 2001 novel though the late clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movies it has a beautiful <UNK> art design but mediocre special effects <UNK> the toy tanks br br i personally loved it and think it excellently captures the <UNK> of <UNK> it is a bit naive about the <UNK> of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time it also seems implausible about the <UNK> of progress it seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so <UNK> in science that we kill ourselves off through <UNK> or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster but it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and <UNK> outrage for potential <UNK> of space <UNK> and deaths it challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness br br <UNK> too much rest and too soon and we call it death but for man no rest and no ending he must go on conquest beyond conquest this little planet and its winds and ways and all the laws of mind and matter that <UNK> him then the planets about him and at last out across <UNK> to the stars and when he has <UNK> all the <UNK> of space and all the mysteries of time still he will be beginning br br <UNK> if we are no more than animals we must snatch at our little <UNK> of happiness and live and suffer and pass <UNK> no more than all the other animals do or have done he points out at the stars it is that or this all the universe or <UNK> quotes from screenplay br br if this sounds like a <UNK> for <UNK> all of society to progress then the <UNK> members of the world government will seem like <UNK> but actually those <UNK> allow their citizens to become <UNK> or pursue other passions <UNK> and they would have to be <UNK> by government <UNK> laws against science and experiment and other <UNK> and <UNK> uses of power that would turn their critics into <UNK> br br in fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel <UNK> by all the <UNK> developments of science and technology so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the <UNK> freedom to experiment the progress oriented <UNK> will not <UNK> the free speech of the rebels though only preparing its <UNK> <UNK> in times of <UNK> and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress br br so it's also a story about the freedom to do science just as much as it's about the wonders of progress many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises except in cases of social bias many want to <UNK> <UNK> for example or <UNK> some don't want us to progress <UNK> and would rather we just become <UNK> in due time while <UNK> to the earth or fear reason some believe we aren't ready for advanced science technology since we might destroy ourselves but <UNK> the president of the <UNK> has an answer to the problem of danger our scientific revolution did not <UNK> death or danger it simply made death and danger worth while screenplay
<START> far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did after <UNK> even if the ratings were low so what i still enjoyed it and loved it was so funny and i <UNK> the cast wow jess <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were in there and were just fantastic the whole cast were brilliant especially the legendary frank <UNK> br br i'd love to see this cartoon again was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it you hear his voice and it played the <UNK> theme <UNK> that was just fantastic i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in i wish this cartoon and <UNK> came back i loved them
<START> i usually like comedy movies i really enjoy them but i don't really get the point of envy i mean it has a dull content topic and it's not really funny br br although the acting is generally good it's not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting stiller and black don't show all their talent in this movie br br so if you're about to rent a comedy i suggest you definitely don't go for this one unless you want to get bored and i can see i'm not the only one with this opinion because even jack black <UNK> for it take a look at trivia
<START> i was really looking forward too seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a must see movie for people that love movies about nature the movie shows different <UNK> and the animals associated with them by starting at the north pole and going down south as the movie progresses the footage from this movie is often <UNK> beautiful and i many times wondered how on earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky however beautiful a large part of the footage i had already seen in the tv series <UNK> <UNK> narrated by david attenborough i found <UNK> narration of planet earth to be much better than the narration of earth <UNK> is an easier movie it <UNK> much of the scientific detail that attenborough covers in his <UNK> <UNK> series for instance earth will tell you that a <UNK> sea is an ideal <UNK> for a young <UNK> whale because there are few <UNK> planet earth will tell you that a <UNK> sea is a good <UNK> because the water is low in <UNK> and doesn't contain enough <UNK> to support very large animals like large sharks etc to me that's an important difference that together with <UNK> far superior voice make planet earth a far better documentary than earth still however i think earth is worth watching for the beautiful footage and the fact that it's easier to understand makes it interesting for children too
<START> aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia i can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a good movie
<START> a strong pilot this two hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for enterprise the prequel to the original star trek series it stumbles a few times into trek convention and cliché candy colored space <UNK> never seem to go out of style and i can already <UNK> <UNK> references to <UNK> as seven of <UNK> but the ensemble looks strong the characters are well drawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more <UNK> in different ways than those of earlier later series scott <UNK> hits the right note as a captain with <UNK> <UNK> and daring but without his <UNK> and <UNK> and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer weapons master and <UNK> officer not just a <UNK> phone <UNK> anymore as supporting players the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in star trek the next generation deep space 9 and voyager instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short <UNK> it's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later which i hope happens because after about a half dozen episodes more variety will be needed
<START> i've had a lot of experience with women in russia and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like unfortunately they are very cunning ruthless and greedy as well as highly unfair from the robotic sex the <UNK> for gifts to the lies and betrayal i've experienced it all in russia br br i know what i'm talking about and here are my <UNK> here are the <UNK> of my three <UNK> to russia in search of a bride it includes thousands of <UNK> of many hot russian girls i met black comedy <UNK> i was <UNK> to and the story of my <UNK> and appearance on russian national tv br br http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> br br it's like reality tv you will love it i spent a ton of time putting it together so check it out the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and <UNK> in my <UNK> br br my 3 bride seeking <UNK> in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia however there is one factual <UNK> in this film and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a <UNK> and having her arrive at an airport it doesn't work that way at all so i don't understand why the media likes to <UNK> this there isn't a single russian bride introduction website that works this way and i challenge anyone to find one that does the fact is you can only order the russian <UNK> contact info email address phone number etc from the website from there you <UNK> and then visit her and if you want to bring her to your country you start the <UNK> process at your ins office and wait months after that that's how it works in real life you can't just order her to arrive at your airport us <UNK> would never allow such a thing to happen br br <UNK> br br i got everything i wanted by going abroad you can too http www <UNK> com
<START> i first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night television scared the hell out of me but then i was a teenager back in those days not as jaded about films as i am now br br castle of blood aka <UNK> macabre is a fine example of the 60s italian horror genre along with mario <UNK> black sunday 1960 curse of the living dead aka kill baby kill 1966 and mario <UNK> nightmare castle 1965 if you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing then check these out as well i also rate these along with those early poe films that roger corman was doing during the same period br br i saw the new <UNK> dvd that was taken from a french print and it's a great improvement over that old pan and <UNK> print that was making the rounds on television over the years it adds a couple of minutes of dialog in french that don't really add much to the movie as whole but it's nice to see it complete without cuts unfortunately the dvd doesn't really offer any extras beyond stills from the film br br one <UNK> i noticed was in the opening scene seeing the smoke effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the <UNK> front door i guess the <UNK> didn't catch it at the time or maybe they didn't care but it is something i didn't notice the first time that's the wonders of dvd you get to see all the <UNK> mistakes and details that weren't apparent the first time around but no matter br br but no matter it still gets a 7 on the imdb <UNK> br br
<START> <UNK> do not read any further if you haven't seen this movie br br picking up after the depressing phantasm ii ended the tall man kidnaps mike while <UNK> and new kid tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back and not end up as slaves on the tall man's red planet this one gets really silly the trio of thieves in the bright pink <UNK> were only there for comic relief and the black karate chick can't remember her name was so irritating i couldn't wait to see if the tall man killed her character this one sets it up to almost look like it was going to be <UNK> character who comes in late and ultimately is the hero but it doesn't quite work out that way by the very end of this story liz is <UNK> by the killer <UNK> mike gets a silver <UNK> <UNK> into his skull the <UNK> get <UNK> and the <UNK> get tim and there's no one left to stop the tall man the bad guy wins now <UNK> that for a surprise twist at the end br br this was filmed in 1993 and <UNK> until <UNK> and the ending of this one was at the time final and although it's disappointing and <UNK> it was also a fitting and appropriate ending for this weird little series but the fourth one changes this ending and adds nothing new but more bad jokes and an even worse and more nonsensical ending br br 1 2 out of
<START> nothing in this film interested me i thought the actors were asleep while they were performing that's not laid back <UNK> method that's just walking through and saying lines i'm afraid <UNK> performance is sad the story is however mildly entertaining if you want to put up with the bad acting
<START> i cannot for the life of me explain what the popularity of the children's television show power rangers is all about br br i never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place since the characters seem so idiotic and not worth caring about whatsoever br br the costumes look completely atrocious like multi colored <UNK> that people wear to go to the gym br br what exactly is the purpose of this show anyways but for kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems what is up with the awful hair cuts and clothing on this show anyway not to mention this show is still playing on cable television just to make money to teach kids how to fight each other when they disagree on a certain problem br br there's far better entertainment for today's children hopefully they aren't as <UNK> as kids of the 1990s who watched this show br br oh and what is up with the <UNK> erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway
<START> the movie starts with a pair of <UNK> a man and a woman presumably together <UNK> alone in the vast wilderness sure enough the man hears something and it <UNK> him so much he goes to investigate it our killer <UNK> him with a stab to the stomach he then chases the girl and <UNK> her throat the camera during the opening scene is from the point of view as the killer br br we next meet our four main characters two couples one in which is on the rocks the men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date <UNK> the token <UNK> ambition to leave a week early unexpectedly the men leave the same day and their car breaks down they end up arriving in the evening when the men arrive they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy ralph <UNK> they ignore the warning and venture into the <UNK> night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest the men get lost br br in the next scene we realize that this isn't just another the burning clone but a ghost story the women scared and lonely are <UNK> together by the fire two children appear in the shadows and decide to play <UNK> tom well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her <UNK> and asks the two ladies if they've seen her children before disappearing of course br br the children run home to <UNK> and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river this causes quite a stir and he gets up grabbing his knife from <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> going hunting the little girl <UNK> with bad acting it is apparent here that the dad isn't a ghost like his children br br freaked out by something in the woods the token blonde <UNK> running <UNK> into the night carrying a knife she encounters the father who explains he's starving and it will be quick this doesn't make sense because of the <UNK> <UNK> we heard earlier maybe he's <UNK> are <UNK> honestly even in california she ends up <UNK> him slightly before getting stabbed in the head a <UNK> <UNK> and the men seek shelter which turns out to be where <UNK> <UNK> clearly someone lives here because there's a fire and something weird is <UNK> over it the children appear and warn them of <UNK> who shows up moments later they disappear as soon as he arrives br br for whatever reason our killer only goes after females he invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife we are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating the old man doesn't tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards but <UNK> about it we aren't given the reason for the children's demise the men go to sleep and are left <UNK> the next morning the men discover the empty <UNK> of their wives after a brief discussion they split up one is to stay at the <UNK> while the other goes and gets help the one that is going back to his car breaks his leg we are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother they agree to help the woman reunite with her friends br br the following scene defies the logic of the movie when <UNK> kills the guy waiting at the <UNK> he was also dating or married to the blonde somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it she decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever you know where this is going br br overall the movie deserves four stars out of ten and that's being generous for all its <UNK> the musical score is well done it's still watchable too there are some camera angles that look professional and some of the sets are done well the plot is unbelievable there is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief but with the <UNK> 6 miles away i can't imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night i mean come on br br alan skip <UNK>
<START> i like a lot of the actors actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a <UNK> the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby <UNK> in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la <UNK> and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to <UNK> rock music the soundtrack will feature bands like <UNK> n w a public enemy <UNK> etc the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i <UNK> you nbc will do it see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
<START> this movie is a must see movie for all <UNK> should see this truthful documentary from the point of view of the soldier as should everyone in america the previous reviewer totally missed the point the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists but who just live in our <UNK> territory and what it does to the soldiers we must support our troops by bringing them home immediately before another person is killed or injured this also reveals that the government does not help its veterans those who are injured mentally with <UNK> post traumatic stress disorder or physically with lost limbs julie a roberts <UNK> <UNK>
<START> while i recently gave operation <UNK> a positive review i really didn't like this film even though it had so many similarities both were made just a few years apart both starred cary grant and both were wwii comedies however the overall tone and style of the films were quite different kiss her for me overall just seemed like a cheaper film with poor writing little energy and some very broad performances even when compared to operation <UNK> i think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting <UNK> <UNK> the combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this a budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio plus there wasn't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with cary grant an actor generally loved for his grace and class it's sort of like pairing sir lawrence olivier with <UNK> main
<START> this movie really has no beginning or end and it's really very unbelievable mary k and ashley are supposed to be <UNK> working in a <UNK> room for an italian fashion company but for some reason they're put up in a 5 star hotel conveniently located across the street from the <UNK> and all of the other <UNK> they work with are just as <UNK> model looking as they are one thing that i found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins doesn't end up with the guy i guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit nice try
<START> a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches people ripping up <UNK> and <UNK> of lurking fear also alas an ending that comes out of nowhere because apparently the auteur has lost interest in the movie or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a <UNK>
<START> elvira <UNK> peterson is the host of a cheap horror show after she finds out that her dead aunt has left her some stuff elvira goes to england to pick it up hoping it will be some money but to her horror elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house her dog and a <UNK> elvira decides to settle in the house anyways but with her striking dark looks and her stunning features she will not be able to live in peace all the <UNK> are now turning the whole town against her and with <UNK> outrageous attitude and looks everyone better watch out because elvira is on fire i really enjoyed this movie it's really fun to watch get elvira into all these adventures she's just great the whole movie puts you into a halloween mood sure it's silly and the jokes are cheap but it's a pleasure to watch it i would give elvira mistress of the dark 8 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> who directed this fine film is on a role after the decent fancy dance and the classic in japan anyway college <UNK> comedy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has followed his own huge footsteps with a <UNK> success br br the story is engaging we both laugh often <UNK> <UNK> is hilarious as he is in <UNK> two previous films and really root for the characters but to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into japanese society real life in japan <UNK> has a knack for showing real life activities with entertaining flair the result is a movie that will pull you in make you laugh make you think and both entertain you and give you insight into today's japan br br also look for the the main 8 actors from <UNK> <UNK> as they all appear again in various roles from supporting characters <UNK> to short cameos many
<START> b movie yes <UNK> yes first movie yes but <UNK> a this movie definitely had some bad sound editing lighting acting etc etc problems however this movie has many positive things about it first off the most annoying character dies first second its made to be a parody funny b rated horror movie the comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing br br the problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece take it for what it is a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie for what it is just that it is really good
<START> what was the deal with the clothes they were all dressed like something out of the late 70's early 80s the cars were even were outdated the school was outdated the nuns <UNK> was outdated and the hospital looked like something from the 40's with its <UNK> and wooden <UNK> and things nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in 1991 my mother was laughing saying <UNK> <UNK> when was this movie made when we pressed the info button on our remote we were sure 1991 had to be <UNK> did anybody else notice this my favorite part though was when the woman tells her <UNK> <UNK> husband on the <UNK> about the <UNK> cross in the mirror and he just says well look i've got a <UNK> meeting i'll talk to you about it later that line was just classic just like a man my mothers favorite part was when they gave the <UNK> of the devil child her very own <UNK> my mother said just what the <UNK> of the devil needs a <UNK> she also enjoyed all of the people <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> her other favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot driving 5 miles a hour driving right into the garbage truck dump truck front end <UNK> <UNK> he had about 20 seconds to just stop the car but he just kept going with a real dumb <UNK> look on his face i mean how fast can you go in a school parking lot whatever
<START> my take a goofy yet imaginative mess br br keanu reeves yes that keanu reeves and alex winter return as the two punk rock idiots in this sequel to the time <UNK> adventure comedy bill and ted's excellent adventure now a cult classic in this sequel bill and ted are given much more to do than travel through time they might as well travel heaven and hell too during the beginning of this sequel bill and ted are preparing for a battle of the bands competition which may make them more famous than ever meanwhile many years in a futuristic civilization the time wizard from the first film the always watchable george <UNK> is running a university <UNK> bill and ted's names there an evil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the hunt for red october plots to get rid of the two idiot rock stars once and for all so he sends two identical <UNK> <UNK> in the words of bill and ted robot <UNK> to do the dirty job br br there after bill and ted experience death and must find their way through hell with inhabitants that happens to include the <UNK> worst memories and then through heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends and their show along this whacked out voyage they play board games with none other than death william <UNK> from die hard 2 reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic the seventh seal aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more br br bogus <UNK> array of <UNK> special effects gimmicks aren't up to to date standards and even some of the humor and the for the time look and feel are somewhat dated to be honest the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year even for the 90's but with it's no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction bill and ted's bogus journey is fun imaginative and yes bogus br br rating 1 2 out of 5
<START> the film is a bit tedious it's mostly a silent film with the bulk o the story provided through a series of voice overs while making a silent film like this is not such a bad idea this is one of those films where the lack of dialog and the repetitive early scenes make it simply tedious you don't understand the reason for the tedium until well into the picture and by then it's too late the first 40 minutes of film is something of a slow piece of mexican soft porn and unimaginative soft porn at that later in the film the style of the first 40 minutes starts to makes sense but it's too late because by then the audience is lost there is some nice location shooting at the national <UNK> university of mexico i've often wondered why more films aren't shot there the campus is built on the edge of <UNK> fields that lend the campus a very <UNK> feel my biggest problem with the film is that the director writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who doesn't know the story will view it you can't ignore the audience when you tell a story
<START> aside from the great movie metropolis this is about the oldest pure sci fi movie while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad it is a great film for two reasons first it is extremely original in both style and content even in the 21st century there are no films i can think of that are anything like it second for its time the special effects were absolutely incredible using <UNK> paintings models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow sure you could sit back and knock the film because by today's standards the effects are only so so but you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences in many ways the sets look highly reminiscent of the modern cities featured at the 1939 world's fair br br i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness the end result seems to be a little of both how true br br a final note i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video all three times the sound and print quality <UNK> particularly the sound if this is available on a dvd hopefully it is a lot <UNK> and will provide <UNK> <UNK> as the sound on the video kept cutting out i really would have appreciated this
<START> a <UNK> like any filmmaker must convey a compelling story will <UNK> fails utterly in this effort <UNK> together uninspired snippets of <UNK> wisdom from a visit to <UNK> university in hamilton the footage is shot <UNK> and in video <UNK> only effort at <UNK> the <UNK> into a whole is by <UNK> throwing a vague title on the screen 9 11 <UNK> truth br br lame br br compare this with documentaries like the corporation or the fog of war which create a narrative drawing material from interviews stock footage and filmed footage in the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message <UNK> and intelligently br br the only saving <UNK> of the film are <UNK> <UNK> delivered <UNK> of historical dogma and the fact that the running time is only <UNK> minutes br br one of the more interesting <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> of his experience with national public radio he describes the conservative media as more <UNK> to <UNK> views while <UNK> liberal dogma <UNK> <UNK> its <UNK> and dramatically limits its <UNK> messages yet another media <UNK> to be skeptical of br br this documentary is for noam <UNK> <UNK> only
<START> i watched this movie after watching practical magic and the older film was far superior i liked the way the lighting makeup and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story jimmy stewart's mannerisms didn't do a lot for me in this film but i suppose they did serve to highlight the <UNK> of <UNK> character i was also struck by <UNK> and <UNK> mannerisms it was as if the director wanted him to appear <UNK> and gillian to appear <UNK> the gestures <UNK> makes when he's showing <UNK> his powers especially struck me i've never thought of <UNK> as being <UNK> so it was an interesting way of <UNK> those characters
<START> with all the adult <UNK> in todays family movies its nice to see one where you don't have to worry about that and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids yes this movie might have a few swear words there's that time where knox <UNK> but they don't let you hear the full words but for the most part this movie is truly as clean as they come and that's including movies from back in the day not only that its very enjoyable one of my favorites and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family br br the only thing i have against this movie is that it is too short and i wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are in it i'm not going to mention them because i don't want any spoilers here br br all in all nicely done and a great movie to watch so go out and get the kids make some <UNK> and watch this movie
<START> i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with but the execution was poor the script is poor and acting is bad there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard the show can't be properly <UNK> as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extent br br till now second season is worse than the first one i had my hopes high regarding this show but i was kind of disappointed still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers anyway i wish best of luck for the future
<START> this movie really surprised me i had my doubts about it at first but the movie got better and better for each minute br br it is maybe not for the action seeking audience but for those that like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal man lover and husband if you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content this really is not for you br br the storyline is somewhat hard to follow sometimes but in the end i think it made everything better the ending was unexpected since you were almost <UNK> to think it would end otherwise br br as for the acting i think it was good it will not be up for an oscar award for long but it at least caught my eye <UNK> <UNK> portrait of a prison man is not always perfect but it is very entertaining shaun <UNK> portrait of <UNK> prison mate <UNK> is great and extremely powerful on the downside i think i will put <UNK> <UNK> portrait of <UNK> br br take my advice and watch this movie either you will love it or dislike it
<START> the first film i had to walk out on and it was the cast and crew pre screening not that i was involved i <UNK> to add i made it through the first hour so i <UNK> i'm just <UNK> to comment but that was my limit br br like other comments here how did this get through any kind of <UNK> an <UNK> of the very worst in dialogue the epitome of wooden acting awful casting all wrapped together without a plot br br tara <UNK> casting was bizarre almost comic she possesses the worst russian accent in movie history br br as i left the screening the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema they obviously couldn't sit through it again either br br
<START> a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a children's film and that it certainly is though it is one made for adults takashi miike uses the fantasy genre particularly the children's fantasy genre as a <UNK> into the wild territory that is the great yokai war br br the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the hero in this years <UNK> festival only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined what follows is a <UNK> grotesque whimsical and often funny journey through the world of japanese <UNK> but wait there's also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world however the villain here is not a mere demon it is the demon spirit of the <UNK> <UNK> of those things which humans use and <UNK> <UNK> a chamber made out of pure <UNK> hate <UNK> the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall <UNK> robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning <UNK> those <UNK> played the video game <UNK> the <UNK> might remember a certain dr <UNK> performing similar <UNK> to the cute and <UNK> who <UNK> had to then <UNK> br br the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character essentially playing the straight man in a world gone suddenly mad though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not <UNK> as do many of the <UNK> themselves who seem truly <UNK> against the murderous robots some spirits being <UNK> with eyes talking walls or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count <UNK> of course in this magical world of miike's yokai war even <UNK> take a magical power when one believes in them br br in several ways this film <UNK> the normal conventions of children's fantasy as few if any of the characters are heroic their victory being a combination of <UNK> almost <UNK> faith and a desire to party the yokai spirits only <UNK> together and lay siege the villains <UNK> after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival and even then only to dance and party also the film ends not with the usual <UNK> <UNK> well that ends well fantasy ending but with a final scene showing our hero years older with an adult job now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth who then <UNK> turn to the villain who being a spirit can never really die this ending with it's yokai spirit who is the spitting image of <UNK> <UNK> warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood <UNK> but of the horrors of over <UNK> the villain is <UNK> caused when humans no longer have <UNK> for the world and the objects around them in japanese <UNK> nearly every object has some kind of spirit and so when they are used and <UNK> as we in <UNK> societies do without <UNK> they become soulless vengeful machines not unlike those seen in modern video games suggesting that though our <UNK> and <UNK> do not ever really die but can become <UNK> br br this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to and i believe it shows as there's a <UNK> <UNK> that sometimes gets swept under the <UNK> by his <UNK> for visual <UNK> though i've focused mostly on the story since lots of users here seem to write it off i do want to say that visually it's a <UNK> of cgi stop animation costume and live <UNK> that works remarkably well there's a <UNK> quality to a lot of the film and the miyazaki comparisons are <UNK> as are the <UNK> story and <UNK> comparisons though this film is <UNK> and more adult than either the yokai are beaten <UNK> and turned into machines of living hate who i believe even kill a few humans a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening while a sexual <UNK> the women with the long neck <UNK> the face of our boy hero or another characters <UNK> memory of touching the <UNK> of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy seem to <UNK> a bit too long for most western tastes especially when considering this is a children's film however these are slight enough to catch adult <UNK> while minor enough not to <UNK> any children to bad <UNK> fairy tales before <UNK> did much worse far more often br br all and all this is one of <UNK> most accessible and engaging <UNK> yet with enough visual drama and great performances the yokai spirits have a <UNK> and an absurd humor to them thats laugh out loud funny at times to appeal to audiences of all ages and a steady <UNK> <UNK> strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth the latter group the film seems to address the most <UNK> asking that they not just continue passive <UNK> of the world around them but show <UNK> to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood another beautiful funny and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn't come close to his <UNK> instant classic
<START> russian <UNK> director in hollywood in <UNK> william powell is casting his epic about the russian revolution and hires an old ex general from the <UNK> regime <UNK> <UNK> to play the general of the film and the two <UNK> the drama and the memory of the woman they shared evelyn brent of 11 years before br br try as i might i feel it hard to warm to 'the last <UNK> for all its virtues 'the <UNK> of new <UNK> was <UNK> a great film and <UNK> is a film i have always been <UNK> to see but 'the last <UNK> is rather heavy going the premise is fascinating but the treatment does really make the script come to life except in the sequences set in hollywood depicting the <UNK> of <UNK> extras and the <UNK> of a big movie production with state of the art technology br br <UNK> <UNK> is predictably a marvelous russian general <UNK> wonderfully between the traumatized and <UNK> old ex general <UNK> in his misery and the <UNK> <UNK> officer of <UNK> br br the ending is great and worth the wait but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times
<START> i saw this piece of garbage on <UNK> last night and wonder how it could be considered in any way an american movie classic it was awful in every way how badly did jack lemmon james stewart and the rest of the cast need cash that they would even consider doing this movie
<START> i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out br br since i had already seen the original when i saw this on sci fi channel i don't know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi i knew what it was within the first few minutes since i like richard <UNK> as a character actor i wanted to see how he would pull it off br br the writers producers etc <UNK> the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the aliens they could no longer <UNK> their own kind and needed help using the same pseudo science that has been <UNK> in our ears in the 90's maybe it added a bit of polish to the film or not br br this film film this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place although no resolution of the <UNK> problem br br i sort of remember that in this remake the woman became rather hostile towards the <UNK> alien i think it could have ended better but the ending is just the ending and the yarn is a <UNK> yarn being of the basic 1958 science fiction pulp stock many great science fiction stories were written in the 50's and some of them even made it to film br br this is a <UNK> thing to watch on like a rainy day or something i rate it highly <UNK> of all the remakes of old 50's sci fi this one came off well i actually enjoyed this quite a bit br br but if anyone really wants to see this story told well i suggest the original 1958 version with tom <UNK> and gloria <UNK> directed by gene <UNK> jr
<START> if you lived through the 60s this film can be at times painful and other times quite <UNK> it's all there but the small print in the counter culture <UNK> prevalent at the time these are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out don't speak too soon for the <UNK> still in spin for the times they are a <UNK> while the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of <UNK> and it's <UNK> at the time that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scientists and <UNK> in the hyper development of computer related activities a <UNK> to the filmmakers from one who was there you've captured the era better than i've seen before
<START> i'll keep this one quite short i believe that this is an extraordinary movie i see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it's badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that it's not real in its portrayal of life ok so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed hope that it isn't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives <UNK> violence is real right is it right no this movie carries an important social message which the <UNK> may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than <UNK> i have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving well not until 2008 anyway 9 out of 10 from me for this one it's very nearly perfect in my view <UNK>
<START> a warning to potential viewers if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story the most dangerous game look elsewhere seven women for satan br br only <UNK> <UNK> the original work by using the name of <UNK> and having said character murder people br br some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoilers or not br br boris <UNK> is played by writer director michel <UNK> whereas his <UNK> hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging <UNK> victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves the film <UNK> from scene to scene with a near total lack of clarity the director seems to have totally <UNK> pacing and left the viewer with a <UNK> dull film a few individual scenes are mildly interesting such as a torture rack sequence but as a unit the film fails to entertain viewers who are more br br interested in an assortment of attractive and semi attractive actresses in various stages of <UNK> might find the film watchable most will probably find their time is better spent watching <UNK> commercials br br in a side note the dvd extras included a fair amount of information on the film's history apparently it was banned for several years in its native france which pretty much ruined any chance it had for <UNK> distribution
<START> an entertaining kung fu film with acting plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop <UNK> all of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists alexander fu <UNK> <UNK> jackie chan comedy antics are fun to watch and his <UNK> companion shows particularly impressive skills for me the film's only glaring flaw is the size of the cast at times things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed out as one might wish br br but a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action and shaolin temple definitely delivers on that count the film <UNK> with a high <UNK> battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy <UNK> br br overall shaolin temple is an enjoyable low budget kung fu movie not up to the quality of a good jet li film but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre my rating 8 10 br br <UNK> notes the 1987 warner home video release i saw was predictably poorly dubbed and lacked full cast crew credits
<START> i'm a big fan of nicolas cage and i never thought he would work on a movie like this i couldn't believe the other reviews and i thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once but trust me it is br br i haven't seen the old movie but why would they want to remake a movie like this the very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic this film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb i just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point but it never does br br so this movie is a big no no for both horror movie fans as well as for the cage fans you could probably for it show up on television
<START> i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and revolt of the zombies is one of the movies in the set i am watching them with my soon to be seven year old daughter which makes most of these movies a laugh riot br br i had high hopes for revolt of the zombies after watching white zombie which is really the <UNK> to so much that is the <UNK> of zombies in cinema think clive <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> and james <UNK> live and let die funeral scene not night of the living dead br br however even though the title includes the word zombies it is little more than a love triangle involving <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is smitten with claire <UNK> who in turn is taken with his companion <UNK> grayson what a yawn fest my daughter fell asleep half way through br br i had a real hard time <UNK> who these people worked for the allies or the <UNK> but i guess that doesn't really matter br br i was shocked to see bela lugosi in the credits for this movie but of course those were his eyes from white zombie serving as the mind control device for the zombies
<START> ok as everyone has pointed out this film is a complete dog to some degree this is because it was a gory <UNK> film that had a lot of material <UNK> or <UNK> down to near <UNK> to escape the <UNK> x rating but the film has many other flaws as well br br to begin with the scriptwriter seems to have got his werewolves and vampires mixed up the baddies in this film are <UNK> and don't like silver but in every other respect they behave like vampires now you just can't do that with a crappy genre flick you've got to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get all confused and annoyed by <UNK> disbelief in the wrong thing in fact the whole confusing and poorly presented plot is something that has already been done for vampires but doesn't make any sense in a werewolf movie br br secondly the werewolf costumes are the <UNK> you have ever seen anybody in the werewolf movie business ought to know that the werewolf costumes and <UNK> are something the fans <UNK> <UNK> yet some of these werewolves are just plain goofy br br there are a couple of slightly good bits i actually quite liked the score others have mentioned <UNK> <UNK> tits and br br spoiler if such a thing can exist br br i also quite liked the plan for attacking the <UNK> <UNK> there are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving <UNK> but in this case they first <UNK> a very sensible and effective anti werewolf <UNK> and go slaughter the monsters i mean you can kill werewolves with silver bullets and we have some pretty powerful <UNK> these days shouldn't be too hard to put two and two together hmm but in typical style this movie goes over the top and adds some other very zany and amusing anti <UNK> weapons
<START> i'm a writer working at home and <UNK> murder is my <UNK> break companion good clean fun good humour and nostalgia for the days of the dick van dyke show how innocent we all were and how innocent is <UNK> murder i particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like joe <UNK> the bad guys always get caught the good guys carry on the stars clearly enjoy themselves and are having a ball without taking themselves too seriously br br one <UNK> why were so many of the villains women or at least <UNK> amanda was too <UNK> its hard to imagine her really carrying out anything as gruesome as an <UNK> br br i hope we haven't seen the last of dick van dyke and family on our screens <UNK> at <UNK>
<START> this would've been a great silent film the acting really is good at least in a look ma i'm doing really big acting sort of way br br everything is huge every line is profound every scene is <UNK> by human tragedy br br mostly i felt like <UNK> yet like any train wreck i couldn't tear my eyes away this dialogue <UNK> worked on the stage although i doubt it on the screen it was <UNK> <UNK> hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative <UNK> you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work br br if you enjoy your melodrama in huge <UNK> doses you might enjoy the movie be prepared to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure <UNK> along at its own pace br br this script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves it simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera br br imdb does us a great <UNK> at times when it uses its goofy computer controlled <UNK> score curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1 br br character driven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through <UNK> with no plausible explanation for their <UNK> or evolution it isn't character development your characters must have a motivation being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development that's a plot <UNK> br br stay away from this movie or at the very least watch it muted perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm waving the characters do br br oh and word to the wise to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see james woods in all his <UNK> male look at me i'm the <UNK> and literal representation of the naked vulnerability of man glory br br don't say you weren't warned
<START> sweet and charming funny and poignant plot less but meaningful before sunrise 1995 the third movie of richard <UNK> is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love is in love or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it it is one of the very rare movies that is should will be equally interesting to teenagers their parents and even grandparents it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects car chases or long and steamy sex scenes two young people in their early <UNK> two college students american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie <UNK> who goes to paris to attend the classes in <UNK> meet on a train they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night they talk and fall in love that's it that's the movie it could've been boring and silly but instead it is a lovely believable clever and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing at least for this viewer high praise and my sincere <UNK> go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters superb writing always interesting and witty dialogs two awesome performances and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is julie <UNK> who looks like a <UNK> angel is great in portraying smart independent and incredibly attractive young woman
<START> <UNK> minutes of this is cruel and i love the old <UNK> yes the plot is thing yes the lines are trite but whoever was at the <UNK> of this was not a fan there is so much <UNK> and i use that word with great pause that i wonder if it's an old <UNK> <UNK> episode i lost count of the number of times i noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar <UNK> to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid 60's ludicrous the producers simply replace marilyn eddie with younger actors why not let them grow and age the addition of an <UNK> family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the halloween party br br grandpa herman fly to <UNK> and back in a few hours preposterous sid <UNK> is the most yes the most unbelievable character i am including the bad robots since he <UNK> an <UNK> combination of <UNK> <UNK> but claims to be an ancient <UNK> <UNK> and yes it looks like the laugh track is missing in fact there are several spots where there is dead air as if the laugh track was to be inserted later the actors seem to wait on the faux audience it's not laughable it's sad oh and the best part <UNK> <UNK> has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were marilyn says something like where could uncle herman and grandpa be they could have been in an accident they could have been hit by a car or a train lily says responds with something like you're uncle herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track what's amazing about this is <UNK> <UNK> husband was a <UNK> in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt he never <UNK> and this <UNK> <UNK> her family check out <UNK> fantastic review of her life and career this line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her br br if you are a real fan of the <UNK> then you'll have to rent this mess it illustrates how some things are better left alone even with the nearly original cast this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago
<START> i saw this movie the first seconds the voice of t r took me on to the journey well i disliked the big glued thumbs in the beginning but the absurd humor it and the <UNK> looks of both sissy actors i do not know who played the young her but she was great and so was uma br br the two other people who where in the cinema went out after about half an hour i was with a friend and it is always a test to watch a movie i like good with one of my friends and we both enjoyed it too the maximum hilarious laughs sadness about the realistic police <UNK> both of us fans of t robbins books i found it well done thought that robbins would also <UNK> though i do not have an idea if he likes the film or not br br i would love to see the cut out stuff i heard that gus v sand had to take out lots of scenes because of the first time viewers or the producers well still it is an artistic movie much too short though it is one of my all time favorites and i am aware of it that the majority of people can't stand that kind of movie and assume that people who enjoy that films are whatever they think what a pity hopefully there will come the day that there will be a dvd with the full material hoping to see more of <UNK> keanu expecting to see her baby and all br br if you have the chance to see it think twice and enjoy it if you made the choice to watch m
<START> i can appreciate what barney is trying to achieve but after sitting through this last night at a college movie house i couldn't help but think when is this gonna end a very long and <UNK> two hours and fifteen minutes i had only seen a part of <UNK> 3 on dvd and thought i knew what to expect that said experimental films such as this are better <UNK> in small <UNK> there are a couple of beautiful horrible images including the title sequence no kidding but if you go into this expecting any kind of plot or meaning then you are in for a long <UNK> inducing ride i managed to stay awake for the whole thing if that's a compliment but more often than not i was waiting for some kind of meaning or narrative big mistake among the collection of images are a very <UNK> gift <UNK> ceremony the creation of a disgusting dish of what appears to be <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> formed with a cookie cutter and <UNK> with <UNK> this is served to the crew of the ship which is shown throughout the film a large <UNK> <UNK> with a large <UNK> turd placed in the center of it and the mutual <UNK> of <UNK> and director matthew barney which eventually <UNK> in some bizarre kind of <UNK> followed by their transformation into whale like creatures the soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying sometimes even <UNK> at one time there is a song being sung by <UNK> to go along with the <UNK> <UNK> being played before us and at other times there is just a constant <UNK> of a high pitched <UNK> which we see a mysterious woman playing at the beginning and end of the movie if this sounds like it doesn't make sense that is because is doesn't if this sounds like your cup of tea then you will absolutely love it if this sounds like something that you probably won't like then stay far away from it because you will most likely walk out of the theater during the halfway mark like several people at the screening i attended this is the very definition of an art film you get from it what you take from it but otherwise there really isn't much there other than a few <UNK> and constant construction and <UNK> <UNK> i'm glad that there is a place for films such as this but i can't say i would want to sit through it again however i can't say i wouldn't want to see one of barney <UNK> films from start to finish and compare it with this i think perhaps now that i know what to expect i might enjoy something like this more to give you an idea of what kind of <UNK> factor this film has i probably would've liked it better if i had gotten stoned then again it could've felt twice as long as it was and then it would've really gotten <UNK> definitely not for everyone
<START> i really like this movie <UNK> is an ultra cool not to be <UNK> soldier who does not want to go to war his persona is similar in a way to <UNK> in catch 22 joseph <UNK> classic novel about men and war this film however is not set in a war zone but in a pre war combat <UNK> training this wonderful film is all about the sickening realization that the vietnam war was a mistake and those men who were <UNK> to be sacrificed for a losing cause br br colin farrell is brilliant as <UNK> a soldier who showed as much genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier as he did disdain and <UNK> for the establishment that was trying to kill him <UNK> is totally cool and non <UNK> testing and <UNK> his military superiors getting their goat at every opportunity he is a jesus christ figure with a psychology degree saving his fellow soldiers and showing the ones in genuine need the way out of this man's army br br the acting and action is crisp and believable and as a sleeper <UNK> goes down with apocalypse now and full metal jacket as one of the top three vietnam films in my opinion br br five stars a top pick
<START> this is by all categories the best movie i have ever seen forget hollywood their movies always sucked this is art moon child's story starts with <UNK> a japanese vampire who <UNK> what he has become and lives in denial his wish for final death leads him to <UNK> where <UNK> from several asian countries live here he meets sho an orphan living on the street br br from here the movie is an intense experience which <UNK> on the visual and emotional part of the movie it has everything you laugh you cry you get angry excited sad happy never has a movie touched me the way this movie do and the actors are amazing never have i heard anyone speak so many languages without it sounding strange a big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece br br a last comment on this brilliant movie is that it stars gackt ex <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and hyde <UNK> of <UNK> en <UNK> in excellent roles as sho and <UNK> i am amazed at how gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting out br br this is a must see if you never see any films see moon child the crow brandon lee and the newly released masterpiece final fantasy <UNK> <UNK> children all in their original languages of course
<START> it even beats the nasty raw almost twenty years old is this show and still i laughed very much when i was watching it last night it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red clothes old school and he jokes with everything from <UNK> to his family he was only 22 years old then and this is a must see br br 8 10
<START> this is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by hollywood what a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of american history what makes the story of james j corbett especially interesting is that mr corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day in that respect james j corbett was truly <UNK> but getting back to the movie all the performances were excellent <UNK> smith was beautiful indeed she looked like nicole kidman and although it's a period piece the story <UNK> the test of time it has not gone stale ward <UNK> portrayal of john l sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic well staged and highly effective that coupled with a great script makes this movie a must
<START> although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie i am ashamed to say i rather like it not often can such a huge pile of 80s <UNK> be found outside of a <UNK> video so it is most definitely worth a viewing <UNK> <UNK> a night in my local store watch out for the insanely obvious <UNK> and <UNK> on the <UNK> costume the fact that the <UNK> looks a lot like keith <UNK> and such classic lines as the following evil wizard type bloke at last we meet <UNK> <UNK> thrilling isn't it br br amazing i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging <UNK> and a dangerous <UNK> like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety among other such <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of what goes on in the actual film none of them actually happen no i'm not joking there really isn't a raging sea or a <UNK> bird it's just trying to make you interested classic in my opinion this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value
<START> i cannot say enough bad things about this train wreck it is one of the few movies i've ever been tempted to walk out of it was a bad premise to begin with first pregnant male but then they tried to make it a spoof what were they <UNK> all those real pregnant males this was the worst movie i have ever seen if it had enough votes it would be on the imdb bottom 100 if it was possible to give it a zero i would and i would still feel i had given it too much credit
<START> william shatner in small doses is tolerable unfortunately instead of leaving his character as a minor <UNK> and in that moderately amusing it has been seen fit to <UNK> his role and <UNK> it just as occurred in the original star trek series i guess i will never understand american humour which frequently goes <UNK> the <UNK> to get the message through i vote with my feet i no longer watch the show which is a shame because the rest of the cast were good it is pity that <UNK> overdone role also affects james <UNK> performance but the majority demonstrate the way society is going i guess i don't travel the same <UNK> frank
<START> the first question that springs to mind after watching this rubbish is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the omen name on this movie it is a <UNK> embarrassing pathetic <UNK> to carry on the omen franchise when the film starts the backing music sounds like it has been lifted straight from a bugs bunny cartoon and from then on the film gets worse i dont know who wrote the script but i bet they got a e for it when they took it back to show their teacher it is difficult after a while to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and so un true to the original omen it <UNK> belief the acting is laughable especially from the leading lady faye grant she keeps pulling silly faces or is she finding it difficult not to laugh it's hard to tell the worst <UNK> i have ever had the misfortune to witness 1 out of 10
<START> after having seen marrying mafia i'd nearly lost my faith in korean movie business but this one brought my faith back br br leading female character who is university student forced to teach the spoiled rich but <UNK> high school student guy he is actually female character's age through some hilarious <UNK> these two end up being great friends br br i was pleasantly surprised that newcomer <UNK> sang woo did his job with <UNK> he was such a revelation actress kim ha <UNK> was also charming as usual br br this movie tried hard to avoid any cliches that can be seen in typical romantic comedies and it didn't show us any unnecessary nude sex scenes it was brilliant lovely fresh made me want to see it again br br
<START> whether this movie is propaganda or not i firmly believe it is not it really shows the power of media the importance of this documentary is not to show how good of a man chavez is it is really to demonstrate the way the <UNK> saw how it happened the chavez way of seeing it although it may seem wrong and bias to support a film i think the point of view shown in the movie is utterly legitimate the <UNK> people via the private media corporation of <UNK> only saw a one side perspective of the coup the neo liberal side this movie shows us the way the <UNK> saw it call it propaganda i say it's a judgment call on your part
<START> who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun and these people are supposed to be professional <UNK> <UNK> who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun and these people are supposed to be professional <UNK> <UNK> who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun and these people are supposed to be professional <UNK> <UNK> who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun and these people are supposed to be professional <UNK> <UNK> who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun and these people are supposed to be professional <UNK> <UNK>
<START> fritz <UNK> german medieval saga continues in die <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wants to avenge her murdered husband <UNK> her brother is too weak to bring the murdered <UNK> to justice <UNK> marries <UNK> the king of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she gives birth to a child and invites her brothers for a party <UNK> and the other <UNK> should <UNK> <UNK> but he is <UNK> by his brothers we see a huge battle of life and death begins and she sets the whole place on fire eventually <UNK> is dead and so is <UNK> these movies deal with great themes such as revenge and <UNK> love sure we have later seen some better movies made of those topics but this was one of the early ones
<START> takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film because i would hate to see him <UNK> from his films i came to love visitor q <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the killer and black <UNK> trilogy lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he's <UNK> still this was the first of his films i'd seen him take that direction so i was nervous of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did br br great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child <UNK> story <UNK> return to oz etc i enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either the dark underlying morals are there but it's also as silly as any kids film should be i personally wasn't bothered by the cgi and <UNK> i feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice br br if you are a die hard takashi miike fan you may not like this one but i suggest giving it a shot it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones which is very <UNK> br br to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one i suggest these other miike films <UNK> 'the happiness of the <UNK> <UNK> and 'the bird people in china ' br br good job takashi miike 8 10 stars
<START> when i watched this film the first time it was a taped copy and the title was is <UNK> terror i still own the tape and i confess i've watched it more than once from beginning to end the film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing i have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we've had some great laughs from the terrible script the film concerns a couple remember this is like early 70's so they are just too hip man who go on a week end camping trip in what i believe was supposed to be <UNK> ny they have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl <UNK> the death of the fish and that they ate it the guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them and he goes and that's beautiful man heavy man really heavy lol anyway along come a couple of vietnam vets one of who plays the <UNK> i believe at any rate they are musical <UNK> the guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove <UNK> they end up <UNK> them during the night the guy ends up <UNK> in a chicken coop and has to watch his girl friend being <UNK> by the two guys actually by the end of the night she seems to be pretty into it and when morning comes the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people and the girl has a smile on her face anyway i would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh it never fails to <UNK> me anyway if i could find this on dvd and replace my old tape copy i'd actually buy it again it's classic camp you gotta love this stuff
<START> this is a strange sex comedy because there s very little comedy but a whole lot of sex most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes basic instinct look like an edition of <UNK> i kid you not the sex in this film is so in your face it might just choke you especially if you re watching with your grandparents br br as for the rest of rita sue and bob too there s not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the f word this a rather bleak hyper <UNK> british film made at a time when channel 4 was the main <UNK> in british movies which explains its made for television low budget feel
<START> where is it written that sequels must suck scream 2 didn't others didn't but this one sure did problems include horrible actors only christopher walken could act in the entire film bad writing you will never understand what's going on and i even have done research on the idea of <UNK> before and just horrible choices for casting eric roberts makes the stupidest <UNK> michael that i have ever seen in my life br br avoid it like the plague unless you are desperate to see christopher walken in that case just fast forward to the parts where he is in the film and avoid the others br br <UNK>
<START> the interplay between the characters is a moral disaster you end up <UNK> most of the characters and you don't particularly like any of them br br even the two main characters played by david and <UNK> are so badly written that you really don't care one bit about them the movie has no plot no direction and no purpose the single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers and that's hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste
<START> i love this movie i mean the story may not be the best but the dancing most certainly makes up for it you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them i just think that you won't like this movie unless you're into broadway
<START> an underrated addition to the graham greene cinematic <UNK> its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues director <UNK> theatrical director frames his action with an oppressive <UNK> appropriate to the material and the seemingly inept compositions <UNK> suggest <UNK> both a dark thriller and a story of moral <UNK> for the female character in a 40s thriller the film has an <UNK> hero who turns mad and murderous and possibly <UNK> brilliantly brings the <UNK> <UNK> of the spanish civil war into <UNK> dangerous reality has one horrific murder an astonishing insights into class and capitalism clever theatrical <UNK> a rare <UNK> of <UNK> god and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history
<START> it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this it's truly one of the best acted most tightly structured films i've ever seen every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways relating to each of the three main characters differently the film weaves an <UNK> web of motivations and double crosses that <UNK> you and refuse to let go add to this that the slow burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything that's ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film it exposes the romance of movies such as titanic as the trite cliches they are if you're looking for a movie to watch while you <UNK> <UNK> this isn't it you have to commit yourself to this film you can't have a conversation while running in and out of the room this movie demands your attention treat it with the respect you deserve and you'll get a lot out of it unless you think titanic is the greatest film ever
<START> i found it a real task to sit through this film the sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said there was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed <UNK> to the movie these conversations switched between family groups and the <UNK> was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together it is rare that i rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking so what and why did i waste my time watching this
<START> okay first of i hate commenting on this thing but i felt like i had to stand up for this movie so many people were bashing on it and i felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion br br first off bend it like beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century if that's what you're looking for go somewhere else just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy it's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are <UNK> accomplished br br secondly the acting though not <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> ball is still good the movie doesn't need acting like that honestly so don't look for it it's a family movie if that's what you wanted you wouldn't or shouldn't even be looking into this movie honestly br br lastly it has a really cute story i think it's thought out well and it's entertaining to watch it's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished if you're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you br br <UNK>
<START> seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie and so i sat down for <UNK> minutes of <UNK> beside ed harris no one seems to own the skills of acting even sean connery who i normally worship must have had an off day during the entire filming of just case not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me br br this made this movie look cheap and unreal br br the story makes up a little it is thrilling and the plot is unexpected br br conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do
<START> i used to write comments at imdb but i don't do so anymore it happens that imdb has become massive and consequently <UNK> has ruined scores what do i mean that anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and doesn't have any expertise on the subject watches some crap or the opposite and in case he likes it delivers a 10 and if he doesn't he goes for a 1 this of course cannot measure anything correctly now for the film i truly regret ever having delivered any <UNK> to some very few films because then i must score this one with 12 or 13 which is not possible this documentary has something that i don't expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film it is simply mesmerizing and it's not just a way of saying it really is the last 25 minutes have a load of energy visual <UNK> and wisdom the words spoken by the starring guys that really there's no possible match i don't keep movies rarely would i find any sense in doing so but this one is the kind of film you should buy and keep and watch from time to time maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by i got nothing more to say this is a genuine objective 10 for me
<START> this is one of disney's top five animated features in my opinion cinderella was a perfect return to the full length feature animation film as opposed to the <UNK> films of the 40's and expensive depth via the multi plane camera returns to the film in no other way although disney <UNK> the story somewhat <UNK> you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set <UNK> a clear time period the story takes place br br cinderella is more mature than snow white and a multi dimensional character actually all of the characters are somewhat well developed except for the prince left the most flat we know he has a sense of humor and a great smile but that's about all like snow white disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture in most versions of cinderella the <UNK> are attractive just not as pretty as cinderella and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance br br favorite disney <UNK> the mice also appreciated the continuity cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film the addition of the <UNK> <UNK> as well as the following assault from the <UNK> was always horrific as a child i remember view master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it the broken <UNK> shows the <UNK> of evil lady <UNK> to give up her hold over cinderella and admit defeat <UNK> would go on to <UNK> the most wicked of all disney villains satanic witch <UNK> in sleeping beauty
<START> while i do not think this was a perfect 10 i do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it's rated here no <UNK> palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done again if it is done well and i think this movie had some strong moments the acting of claire danes as already mentioned many times was flawless as was kate <UNK> and i think bill <UNK> was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances <UNK> wife the crooked cop skip or trip or whatever his name is the cinematography was also beautifully filmed there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some <UNK> three major ones that i found as well br br here is what i didn't like about it the friendship between the girls in fact the girls' own individual personalities were not developed in depth until the late middle of the <UNK> it would not have been improbable to lose interest before then because despite the <UNK> more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested were almost <UNK> over so there was a bit to much jumping around without the character and scene development i think would have been appropriate for this type of film that however is not my major problem and warning spoiler alert br br the ending as mentioned dozens of times already was awful it was awful in two respects firstly even though it would have been predictable and very hollywood i wanted a happy ending yes it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this there is a sense that justice will be served and i did sit through it to see that i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or <UNK> that at least the cop should have got what was coming to him i mean nothing happens to the bad guys they all get away with it very disturbing br br also i do not understand the ambiguity of the ending i understand endings that are inspired to make one think but this was not a mystery or clue type movie we were watching and i would have liked to know something about what actually happened who was guilty etc with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since i somehow doubt there will be a sequel i did not want to be kept guessing br br still there was a lot to like about this movie and the acting is definitely at the top of the list i would rate this a 7 5 and say it is definitely worth a look
<START> there has been a lot of love that has been put into wes <UNK> fantastic mr fox unfortunately all the love is for himself granted there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self <UNK> quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny the worrying thing is that i think it was and this is the best that wes anderson could come up with br br the animation is good in the close up shots of the animals however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess there wasn't really anything special about the acting either with wes <UNK> to choose his buddies and big names over more <UNK> voice actors that could have probably made the film better i'm pretty sure george <UNK> voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in south park one of them where he played a dog br br the film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically despite the film being set in england all the good animals are typical americans playing baseball whilst the bad guys are stereotypical english with the most insulting english accents i cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is i didn't laugh once
<START> i rented domino on a <UNK> not even knowing it was inspired by a true story and even though it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see i found it to be rather awesome br br with richard kelly writing he <UNK> together a mass of plots and <UNK> into 2 hours of pure entertainment and once you've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it br br domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career it has an edgy acid trip style provided by director tony scott and with fast paced music and editing it provides the visual <UNK> to keep your attention with slick performances and unexpected comedy the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience br br i suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours
<START> the folks at disney have a lot to explain first and foremost why anyone thought this lesser sitcom material would ever make even a half decent motion picture in the <UNK> 60's <UNK> the unique idea of martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated x files treatment quaint visions of little green men have long since been <UNK> by the likes of e t close encounters and aliens 1 3 br br any charm the property had was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between the late bill <UNK> as tim and ray <UNK> as the <UNK> visitor the <UNK> that martians have <UNK> seemed dopey back then now it seems positively idiotic yet christopher <UNK> uncle martin sports the <UNK> <UNK> in an early shot the <UNK> on a sign for the tv station tim works at is supposed to make us think martian <UNK> the last time you saw a tv with rabbit ears eh br br disney doesn't trust quaint or relationships and <UNK> this flick with youth <UNK> special effects that include a talking space suit named <UNK> yes you read that correctly uncle <UNK> silver space suit speaks he is supposed to be a real hilarious cut up figure again i got stretch <UNK> that are funnier than <UNK> whenever the action <UNK> and it <UNK> constantly computer graphics are put into play to <UNK> things up tim is here played by the <UNK> jeff daniels who can't or won't do anything to save this <UNK> mess <UNK> christine <UNK> brings some comic <UNK> to her neighbor lady role even ray <UNK> himself is dragged painfully into the <UNK> all to no <UNK> this alien visitor is dead on arrival br br constant talk of sitcoms turning to screen makes me only hope that the i dream of <UNK> movie won't feature a talking <UNK> outfit i pray that <UNK> cat in the movie <UNK> doesn't have lines i live in fear that i love lucy the movie will proudly feature a cg <UNK> drum named <UNK> br br <UNK> michael <UNK> mickey mouse take me to your leader
<START> any one who has seen mel <UNK> the passion of the christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead though it wasn't a success in <UNK> box office or tv ratings the fox movie channel still finds a real good motive to show this <UNK> i liked the way that they trained chris sarandon and the men who portrayed his <UNK> to sing in <UNK> though sarandon didn't have long hair like any other jesus would in other films his looks are pretty close to what a jewish man would appear what surprised me or <UNK> me was the scene where <UNK> told jesus about <UNK> and don't ever forget that you are a jew though that may have not been a racist remark colin <UNK> was trying to make chris sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days keith <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> was <UNK> comparing with his previous performances in the story of <UNK> and joseph and the story of david but if you compare his portrayal of <UNK> with telly <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> you can say that he really painted well the impression of a roman <UNK>
<START> come on tina <UNK> you can do better then this as soon as the movie started i knew how it would end sure it was funny at times even laugh out loud funny but there isn't enough laughs to save this movie i don't recommend buying this at the most i recommend renting it but thats all baby mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it <UNK> for br br tina <UNK> and amy <UNK> made a good team mean girls is one of my favorite movies tina <UNK> and amy <UNK> both did great in that and they do good in this but this isn't there best baby mama had a great supporting cast <UNK> cook <UNK> weaver and steve martin add to the casts greatness br br another <UNK> movie has hit the cinema world after the great knocked up and <UNK> baby mama looks very average when compared knocked up and <UNK> are hilarious heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face baby <UNK> ending was unfunny and dull br br baby mama wasn't the best comedy of the year and it doesn't try to be i recommend it but don't expect it to be totally hilarious expect a average comedy that doesn't give the big emotional ending it tries to have i give baby mama br br 4 10
<START> <UNK> is a good word to describe this movie br br let's say every movie has a selling point a gimmick <UNK> gimmick is the awesome effects as well as fan boys nostalgia <UNK> in <UNK> gimmick is <UNK> in their tag line what if someone you never met someone you never saw someone you never knew was the only someone for you many romance relies heavily on these gimmicks and some through draw of big names leap years employs both by using the irish <UNK> as the <UNK> and featuring considerably famous names within the country br br so now that the audience are in the cinema besides all the usual elements in characters conflict or consequences crisis resolve and denouement they also look forward to stimulating dialog more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years interesting sub plots and perhaps to a certain extent a good twist in the middle or towards the end of the story that <UNK> the circumstances of the characters br br this is what jean <UNK> is trying not to achieve if they've tried to their goal was apparently in the other court at the other stadium on the other end of the planet she and her writer <UNK> <UNK> utterly failed to provide stimulating dialog most of the lines were contrived it seems that they have a bag filled with lines which she would like to use in her movie okay these are the lines and quotes which i've heard or read from either movies i've seen or books i've read before and they all sound good to me if they sound good to me they will sound good to the audience therefore all i have to do is piece them all together i am going to use all of them the result is <UNK> i can't say that the lines were unnecessary and bears no relation to the story or in driving the plot on but they seem to spring out of nowhere catching you off guard with these <UNK> quotes br br on a personal level i know people who <UNK> quotes based on most of the situations in our dialog trying to make it meaningful to themselves while <UNK> along i don't go out with them anymore because the urge to punch them is overwhelming br br secondly the characters portrayed are silly and one dimensional with exception to the unnatural dialog which implies their motivation necessary to drive the plot there was no sense of conviction in them i haven't an idea who they are they are all <UNK> <UNK> lines from the advice <UNK> of a female oriented magazine br br the gimmick in the leap years is not enough to drive the story on because the circumstances are too shallow then again there are movies with less but <UNK> better than this aren't there they made it up with my first and second point moreover the sub plots are <UNK> not that it's a bad thing for movies and thin bad thing br br jean <UNK> and the producers are trying to pass off the terrible plot with fancy locations and passable photography this is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to <UNK> the <UNK> from some viewers than the others with the good use of cinematography soundtrack and filming location these non <UNK> viewers br br it is not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it's good it is just bad don't watch this
<START> busy is so amazing i just loved every word she has ever done freaks and <UNK> <UNK> creek white chicks the <UNK> after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in israel if someone hasn't saw is excellent movie than don't <UNK> more time and go see it now i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies i saw busy in the late night show with conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her everybody who saw the movie in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine <UNK> she looks so good there <UNK>
<START> this film and it's sequel barry <UNK> holds his own are the two greatest comedies to ever be produced a great story a young aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates who are just as <UNK> and innocent as he is br br it's chock a block full of great <UNK> where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he's as dry as a dead <UNK> <UNK> great characters top acting and it's got great <UNK> and more <UNK> <UNK> then any other three films put together top notch br br and some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear and it's full of great celebrities definitely my two favourite films of all time i watch them at least once a <UNK>
<START> this was a disappointment none of the nuance of the original the brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over the top <UNK> of the american version the original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings i have watched the series many times and am still enthralled br br just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of cracker get hooked up with bbc america or bbc canada and watch for such <UNK> as waking the dead <UNK> silent witness and judge john deed watch the original touching evil then look for wire in the blood for more of the truly understated elegant performance of <UNK> green hollywood needs to have a look at this actor
<START> while the main story is supposed to take place in <UNK> this movie was shot in <UNK> romania in 18 days on a very tight budget however broken their cards may be the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment so that in the end i found the result both touching and <UNK> <UNK> coaster <UNK> provides a <UNK> performance as the bad guy the script and direction provide some gems whether you will like the movie or not however will probably depend on your take on alexandra <UNK> in the title role other reviewers have pointed out <UNK> <UNK> as modesty blaise they may have a point but i found her interpretation delightful and very fitting modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline <UNK> talent and courage <UNK> appears to be doing the same here
<START> i haven't seen anything this bad since i walked out of the james bond movie <UNK> twenty years ago i managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of <UNK> <UNK> but there was nothing she could do to save this beast br br as a cross between <UNK> orlando and <UNK> this movie failed miserably in every aspect of <UNK> the characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy the plot was wholly unbelievable the acting was with the exception of <UNK> amateur the computer graphics were worse than in <UNK> timothy <UNK> was extremely annoying i could go on but what's the point br br the only good thing i can say about this film is that <UNK> <UNK> was in it i have no idea why an actress of her caliber <UNK> to appear in such a dud but she most likely regrets it now br br don't waste your money or your time on this stinker there's nothing worth seeing here
<START> for a good half hour or so i remember myself thinking hey this could very well be bill <UNK> best achievement ever the opening sequences are atmospheric there immediately are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker the giant spider invasion in a playful way the concept is shamelessly stolen from william <UNK> house on haunted hill with three old and extremely bored <UNK> <UNK> nine losers to an isolated mansion to win 1 000 000 in an <UNK> game naturally the participants start <UNK> quickly and one by one and it takes the remaining greedy <UNK> too much time before they realize either the old folks are <UNK> or there's another murderer amongst them the film begins ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of senseless stuff that isn't relevant or even interesting to the plot but there's some nice t a to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo <UNK> i believe she's called is really hilarious to observe after the first half hour naturally the inevitable happens and the cold turns into a <UNK> <UNK> production with retarded plot twists the dumbest dialogs ever and a total lack of excitement there wasn't any budget for bloody murder sequences but our multi talented director tries to compensate this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band the film also has four or even five different <UNK> and none of them are a slight bit satisfying maybe it was an inspiration for lotr return of the king avoid this film you'll live longer and happier
<START> f <UNK> me i've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p ss br br honestly i can't express in words how bad this film actually is besides the plot that isn't really there the <UNK> crap acting the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies you know what i could go on all day every little thing in this film is either stupid pointless crap or embarrassing i express to anyone who wants to watch this movie don't br br i'm ashamed to say i have this on my rack it's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile i couldn't even give this horse sh t excuse for a film away that's how bad it is
<START> lots of singing and dancing in this one especially by gene kelly two sailors go on liberty to see if they can find love and romance they meet up with a woman who is trying to break into show business musical lovers only
<START> my first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes roughly after the tv report scene which i couldn't handle it went approximately like this br br reporter 1 hmm there's a <UNK> in our <UNK> reporter 2 i think it's aliens awkward silence reporter 1 in other news br br a few days later i watched it to the end and it wasn't as horrible as i've imagined but there are serious problems with this about half of the plot can be easily <UNK> and the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something br br what use are the detective the <UNK> people and the monsters which are <UNK> of <UNK> by <UNK> more amusing was the <UNK> scene we're all powerful gods who have lived for <UNK> and of all the games in the <UNK> we happen to play <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even <UNK> von <UNK> looks coherent compared to that br br the other half is terribly lacking what did our protagonist do to get himself <UNK> frozen why was there no big event when he was released at the end he had those <UNK> followers remember what happened to normal humans what's the deal with the masked guy how did the blue haired girl appear what's with her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br visually it's ok more or less if you disregard the egyptian gods looking like walking <UNK> with <UNK> heads
<START> the case of the <UNK> tail is a highly stylish giallo directed by sergio martino who appears to be a giallo master second only to <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> wrote this fabulous who <UNK> quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery it also makes sense in the end a big plus 'cause that's not always the case for these <UNK> as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless red herrings and ultimate <UNK> here the less you know about the plot the better br br pure giallo <UNK> present here are the beautiful cinematography the catchy music score the gorgeous females anita <UNK> is a <UNK> brutal murders black <UNK> murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few br br in most parts it's <UNK> acted <UNK> hilton his usually suave self and others do fairly well martino directs with a sure hand keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces br br if you're a giallo fan this is a must see if you like well written and suspenseful thrillers in general this comes highly recommended
<START> read my lips <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which probably has different <UNK> <UNK> in its french title is a nifty <UNK> contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an <UNK> and sensual <UNK> <UNK> br br the two leads are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who i've never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more <UNK> than usual vincent <UNK> who has brought a sexy and or threatening look and voice to some us movies br br the first half of the movie is on her <UNK> in a <UNK> real estate office and he's the <UNK> the second half is on his <UNK> as an ex con and her wrenching adaptation to that <UNK> br br writer director jacques <UNK> very cleverly uses the woman's <UNK> hearing <UNK> as an <UNK> for us into her <UNK> turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as <UNK> <UNK> as well br br none of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that <UNK> victim from in the company of men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that <UNK> as we move from a <UNK> modern office to a <UNK> disco to romantic and criminal stake outs br br there is a side story that's <UNK> redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our <UNK> br br this is one of my favorites of the year br br originally written 7 28 2002
<START> the adaptation of will <UNK> spirit to the tv screen followed many other offerings developed from comic strip pages or comic books remember the two aren't exactly the same medium it is indeed ironic that this is the one and only adaptation as of the time of this writing of <UNK> smart alec wise cracking tongue in cheek super hero br br story has it that republic pictures was interested in doing a film version and was in <UNK> with the <UNK> owner in the mid <UNK> but they were never able to close the deal the left over screen play became the serial the masked marvel one of <UNK> best perhaps that it was just as well for that studio had a <UNK> for <UNK> with material adapted from the comic <UNK> pulp <UNK> radio and the comic books br br as for this 1987 made for tv movie it's pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for a <UNK> television series whereas an old long time comic reader like myself can be a little harsh in criticism of an adaptation a viewer unfamiliar with the character may be able to give some fresh observations clear of any <UNK> notions of what this screen version should look like br br well while sitting and watching the story unfold with the characters <UNK> amid some crime wave the little lady my wife mrs ryan nailed it with one statement this can't make up its mind if it's serious or not that pretty well describes both the spirit and his creator mr will <UNK> the true creative genius in the comics br br the film is a sincere attempt to put <UNK> world on the screen the casting of <UNK> <UNK> the spirit <UNK> <UNK> and ellen was really quite well done though in a contemporary setting it was still in the tradition of the good old days as far as the <UNK> goes you know when men and women still wore hats that brings up this one final and meandering point and that is that the director and the production made a conscious effort and succeeded in giving the characters a will <UNK> look as far as facial expressions and body language we say kudos to them for their efforts br br it's just too bad that no series followed oh well in today's motion picture world comic adaptations seem to be a hot item maybe some big <UNK> producer and director could do a really 1st class spirit production for the big screen we can only hope br br update <UNK> chicago <UNK> 6 4 2008 by now everyone who goes to the movies at the shopping centre <UNK> has seen the poster advertising the new film of the spirit subtitled my city screams which is to be released christmas day 2008 well we'll see then just what we've been talking about just keep your fingers crossed to be continued br br update ii we saw the new film writer director frank <UNK> rendition of the spirit a couple of days ago well we got our wish but is this a good thing or another case of be careful what you ask for because you may get it please read our write up elsewhere in imdb com <UNK>
<START> i recently watched the <UNK> version of this film with judy and while i appreciated the story and music i found that the film failed to hold my attention i expected the <UNK> remake to be the same story except with a barbra twist i was pleasantly surprised it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame money love and the price of it all this version is so much more real than the <UNK> one with arguably better music better acting a more gripping plot line and of course a deeper love i do not understand why the previous film is on the american film <UNK> top 100 list while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any <UNK> list
<START> fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race all falls apart though when young <UNK> zombie fido eats the family neighbor from then on disaster well maybe not disaster but to some extent chaos occurs most of the people treat their zombies with fairness and one such character sleeps with his zombie very funny part of the movie if not also very disturbing too and we find the loving fido whatever he may do this is a very funny and unique film especially for the zombie genre it is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies no <UNK> in this statement i very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different i rate this 8 10 rated r for zombie related violence
<START> this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons 1 perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking but no man left alone on an <UNK> for years would react with such hysterical <UNK> to the gift of a female <UNK> 2 it wasn't an <UNK> at all but a woman the beautiful jean <UNK> br br the popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have <UNK> its origins back to this episode if they'd done it properly in fact the <UNK> of sex <UNK> are in the news as i speak br br robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made so they could have at least had her act like one her <UNK> would then have added a creepy element instead it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on <UNK> star br br the twilight zone always stretched the imagination and <UNK> normally no one cared but this episode seemed <UNK> by a <UNK> morality <UNK> what would have <UNK> to masturbation with a machine or downright <UNK>
<START> you don't expect much from a <UNK> picture and with rare exceptions mainly from edgar g <UNK> and a few by joseph h lewis or <UNK> <UNK> that's exactly what you get not much this epic about nazis in africa trying to <UNK> an arab revolt against the british isn't much different the script by longtime <UNK> <UNK> arthur st claire and <UNK> lowe is trite laughable full of unfunny <UNK> and plot holes the size of outer <UNK> the direction by longtime <UNK> no budget <UNK> al herman is semi <UNK> at best the performances though except for spectacularly incompetent and <UNK> hammy lead walter <UNK> king aren't really half bad veteran comedian <UNK> is actually the best thing about the film he plays a guy from brooklyn <UNK> as a razor blade salesman and <UNK> up the screen considerably when he shows up he's got great comic timing charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time <UNK> <UNK> is fairly convincing as an arab <UNK> despite his spanish accent and veteran bad guy george j lewis as <UNK> arab rival does his usual fine job of <UNK> even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes joan <UNK> is quite pretty and has a nice light touch and she and <UNK> have great chemistry together although like the rest of the cast she has none at all with king h b warner whose career stretched back to the silent era lends a shred of dignity to the low rent proceedings even though he blows his lines several times and <UNK> being <UNK> they weren't cut out there's a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big budget silent movie with a similar arab theme although i have no idea which one it is and <UNK> being <UNK> no effort was made to try to make it <UNK> i've seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obvious br br a <UNK> in <UNK> isn't very good of course well ok it stinks but it would be worth a look just to see <UNK> in his prime i had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor director albert brooks and super dave <UNK> but had never actually seen him in anything before it was worth watching this <UNK> rate <UNK> <UNK> just to see him in action otherwise forget it
<START> i was first introduced to eddie by friends from across the pond who know i like intelligent humor i prefer comedians who can be thought provoking while entertaining such as george <UNK> and dennis miller in <UNK> to <UNK> eddie provides the same type of social observation humor that <UNK> your thoughts on a subject all the while causing your side to split at the same time there is a wide range of subjects in this stand up and they are simply hysterical the piece on how to decide on <UNK> stage name will leave you in <UNK> br br thanks andrew and catherine and do you have a flag
<START> <UNK> shadow is set in <UNK> starts as jennifer <UNK> gina <UNK> arrives there after her sister <UNK> dies jennifer is left <UNK> large house in her will jennifer decides to sell the house head back to los angeles even though her grandmother mary ellen faye <UNK> is opposed to the sale however strange things begin to happen jennifer starts having nightmares about <UNK> <UNK> at her she starts to feel very ill after a check up in hospital it seems that one of her <UNK> have mysteriously disappeared what is happening to jennifer is it an ancient family curse will jennifer be the next to <UNK> to it br br this <UNK> american co production was co written co directed by daniel de la vega <UNK> <UNK> is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes a tedious predictable modern ghost story that i would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them the script by vega <UNK> p j <UNK> is pretty slow going tedious which is not what anyone wants i mean i'm sure most people don't want to sit down be bored out of their <UNK> the character's are all uninteresting fairly <UNK> with little or no motivation for anything they do for instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy how did he know about the demons what is his interest motivation for getting involved i couldn't see it jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable bland leading lady her grandmother mary allen is as clichéd as they come it's surprising that she is so obviously the villain i mean for this sort of mystery based horror ghost story it's surprisingly predictable routine there are gaps in both logic the story which together with the terrible twist ending which isn't much of a twist i didn't like <UNK> shadow one <UNK> br br directors vega <UNK> goes down the much used route of <UNK> almost all of the colour from the picture which often <UNK> it not too far from black and white i suspect that they wanted to give it a period gothic feel but it's been done so many times before often so much better that it didn't do much for me at all just makes the whole film look dull lifeless there's a definite 40's period look as well from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it's rather half hearted cheap looking <UNK> shadow is well made but it's rather forgettable it's not scary or creepy it's rather predictable if that wasn't enough there's no gore either there's a few scenes of <UNK> <UNK> away at people a beating heart but nothing else br br with a supposed budget of about 1 000 000 <UNK> to the chronicles of the <UNK> for it's us international dvd release this is reasonably well made but a million won't buy you too much these days <UNK> shadow pretty much proves that theory there are too many scenes of actor's speaking in thick <UNK> accents as well even though it might be realistic i actually like to be able to understand what people are saying the acting is alright although <UNK> overacts badly is obviously there for the money br br <UNK> shadow is a <UNK> ghost film that i thought was a total bore from start to finish i would rather watch the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed up zombies 1964 again instead a total waste of time
<START> it all starts with a suicide or is it a car crash i guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end director <UNK> <UNK> gives you the ability to enter his new film seven pounds <UNK> way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking <UNK> call this is one powerful movie maybe that is because i'm a <UNK> when it comes to dramas of this <UNK> dripping with <UNK> moments and chock full of devastating performances but either way a film works best when it truly touches me when it <UNK> in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre and this is from the team that brought us the overrated sappy and not all that redeeming pursuit of happiness so i'll just say my anticipation was closely <UNK> for a big letdown with all that though i was with seven pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled even though you figure out what will smith's character is doing that secret mission he is trying to complete it is the way in which he <UNK> his <UNK> that shines bright and leaves you with a tear filled smile at the end br br our entry point is a bit jarring leaving us off <UNK> trying to comprehend what is going on smith's thomas has lists of names one of people we don't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and <UNK> working with the irs allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give <UNK> gift that could completely alter their circumstances he calls an old childhood friend barry pepper and reminds him to do what it is he promised to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind even in a role as small as <UNK> you can't help but feel the utter grief held <UNK> in the background hanging above everyone's head it is his character seen maybe three times that really <UNK> the primal level of emotion being dealt with his <UNK> whether tear <UNK> and composed or head in hands <UNK> show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any <UNK> to come its way br br after that phone call begins the journey to meet new people thomas is on some sort of mission to help <UNK> the <UNK> troubles of <UNK> ill folk trying to stay <UNK> despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival this progression takes many turns from a blind <UNK> meat salesman that he <UNK> to see whether he can get him to explode to a phase two <UNK> necessity heart patient unable to print her line of <UNK> or even run with her great <UNK> duke to an abused and scared latino mother of two too afraid to leave her boyfriend to a dying hockey coach that <UNK> faith in a <UNK> youth community to a little boy in need of a bone <UNK> transplant there are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a <UNK> of hope and wanting to <UNK> each day and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting <UNK> and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style why it is up to thomas to <UNK> through the mix and find those that deserve his gift is unknown at first as is why this man seen in flashbacks as an <UNK> engineer with a beautiful wife and huge <UNK> home is now living in a motel driving a beat up car going door to door in order to <UNK> for the irs as he says though he kind of stumbled into the job br br smith's quest as thomas is a long and painful one <UNK> with moments of clarity and honest compassion as a man with the means to help he takes his job seriously crossing off people <UNK> and testing those he believes are worthy to the <UNK> degree if that means he must yell and make fun of them he must do it at every step though you see the suffering in his eyes the pain eating away at his soul taking each step towards his fate one as a saint of redemption not only for those he wants to help but for himself as well it is an award worthy performance and i only wish smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer <UNK> because while they are fun this guy is too good for them the man better win an oscar before he is done or it will be a <UNK> least in my mind br br the rest of the cast is stellar across the board woody <UNK> as the blind salesman is pitch perfect <UNK> with a joy of life his shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout whether on the phone being <UNK> at sitting in a diner eating his pie or at the piano in the park playing for all who will listen <UNK> <UNK> as the abused mother is fantastic showing the hard evolution from <UNK> to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger allowing her family to finally be safe and rosario dawson shines as the once hot young woman beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays all but given up on living life to find love and happiness it is the introduction of smith's thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman a free spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last
<START> i instantly fell in love with pushing daisies this show manages to put a smile on my face with it's great storytelling witty dialog and great acting but that's not all it also manages to keep you until the end the basic idea behind the show bringing people back to life with one touch ending the undead status with a second is interesting and could still be in later seasons but the suspenseful murder cases the unique look of the show and the highly <UNK> narrator add to the experience but pushing daisies is more than it's parts it has a certain charm that i really enjoy and i'm looking forward to enter the world of ned and chuck for a second season
<START> this is a truly abysmal lock <UNK> clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk they must have been <UNK> a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadn't have paid good money for it i'd have turned it off after 10 minutes not the worst film <UNK> ever seen that honour goes to the truly pathetic used <UNK> of a <UNK> i use the term loosely <UNK> i feel like <UNK> that so called <UNK> for the lost hour and a half of my life but this trash is nearly right down there with it definitely one of the worst 5 films i have ever seen stuff like this reminds hollywood that they don't have a <UNK> on truly awful films
<START> if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault then this film is not the film that you want to watch it was a social commentary about a woman who was <UNK> and fights back spoiler rosario dawson turns the tables on her <UNK> instead of using the criminal justice system the victim <UNK> to using <UNK> she in essence <UNK> the <UNK> system the film the accused was a much better film because the victim uses the <UNK> system and wins what the descent does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence is victim any better that the <UNK> no
<START> don't waste 90 minutes of your time on fast food fast women it's annoyingly episodic script with three story lines <UNK> together is laughably bad due to predictable writing horrific acting and even bad music i found the <UNK> main character <UNK> to watch every time she was on screen she needs the fast food br br spend the 90 minutes you'd <UNK> to this turkey doing something more exciting like <UNK> your <UNK> you'd have more entertainment value br br the only redeeming thing about this film is louise <UNK> but she deserves much better than this tired script it's as <UNK> as the elder guy she <UNK> in the movie br br viewer beware
<START> assuming this won't end up a straight to video release i would have to say void this title at all costs unless you're bored of good well executed movies that is i saw this last night at <UNK> dallas and i left with 20 minutes remaining simply because i didn't care anymore about the plot not about insulting the director that is awkward when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie a shot out <UNK> window before any shots are fired and then the window breaks with the first shot things are going to bad let's just say this is only an <UNK> of things to come unfortunately br br i'll spare you all the details but this is sub par in every manner even the half <UNK> acting by michael madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half <UNK> acting from him and the rape scene christ shut up and take it should never be used in a rape scene ever br br 3 10
<START> my wife is a fanatic as regards this show that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad <UNK> <UNK> should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison <UNK> embrace of the vampire to name a few the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals i've seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don't know if it was their own choosing or not please please don't <UNK> for another season as enough is enough bob
<START> although misty <UNK> <UNK> stripper is certainly attractive as the blonde lead this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a few times no nudity in 1954 when this film was made not 1965 br br the guy who hires her to work in a <UNK> resembles bud <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> most of the other woman are unattractive and the drunken woman is semi amusing in a creepy way br br a 2 out of 10 ms <UNK> has a <UNK> <UNK> but you can't judge any acting talent because the entire film is post dubbed some of these exploitation films usually made later than this one are interesting in some way but this is really a bore fest sid <UNK> make room for daddy directed there are some samurai like facial expressions and interesting apartments but there's really nothing here
<START> <UNK> has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie don't get me wrong i am not <UNK> the movie it is such a wonderful movie and walked out of the cinema with a <UNK> in my throat we need to understand <UNK> spiritual standing he is a true spiritual leader only a fully <UNK> man could possibly <UNK> himself from his loved ones a man with such caliber leads his family and followers by example according to the movie he spoke to his son and try to make him understand where he is coming from but poor <UNK> with so little intellect could not understand his father when things went wrong with <UNK> <UNK> could remain calm and accepted that his son is a big tragedy br br had it been any other parents they would have <UNK> their values to assist the son to get on his feet <UNK> didn't do that he is true leader who leads by example

<START> there were times when this movie seemed to get a whole lot more complicated than it needed to be but i guess that's part of it's charm detective philo <UNK> powers of observation seem greater than all the oriental <UNK> of the era combined when it comes down to that final <UNK> of how the murders were committed the dropping of the <UNK> into the chinese <UNK> was the <UNK> for me i mean couldn't somebody have just dropped it br br vance william powell had a line early in the film about archer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to kill himself i had to think about that for a while i was left wondering if there's some scientific basis in fact for that concept to be true not having studied psychology myself seems logical but then there's always the case that doesn't fit the rules br br you know i got a kick out of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who reminded me of star <UNK> dr mccoy the couple of times he stated i'm a doctor not a magician and i'm a doctor not a detective i can picture <UNK> <UNK> watching the film and saying to himself <UNK> have to use that <UNK> br br once the killer's identity is revealed it doesn't seem like such a big surprise but up till then it's really <UNK> guess but archer and <UNK> <UNK> aside the film didn't answer the central question <UNK> by the title and the murder i was really interested in who killed sir thomas <UNK> dog <UNK>
<START> those who love the book jane eyre as i do it's my all time favorite and i re read it at least once a year will love this version timothy dalton is just a tad too good looking to be mr rochester but other than that he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of <UNK> zelah clarke may have been just a little too old to play the 18 year old jane but when i watch this movie i don't think about the ages of the characters the dialog from the film is taken almost <UNK> from the book which was very smart sure this film might seem a little long but it's the only version i've seen that includes part 3 of the story br br i wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer <UNK> version as it would have helped that mess of a film br br i also realized the last time i watched this video that judy <UNK> plays aunt reed she is so versatile that i didn't recognize her she plays daisy in keeping up appearances and also played mrs <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> another wonderful adaption br br update got the dvd this week and it's marvelous to see the original <UNK> version there's lots more at the beginning young jane at <UNK> and at <UNK> and at the end they've restored lots of things i always wondered why st john had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who jane is because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the us vhs version <UNK> oliver is in it she was completely cut out of the vhs as far as i could tell they hadn't edited out any of timothy <UNK> parts so nothing new there but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the vhs thanks bbc ps i would have paid more for a special edition dvd with maybe some interviews with the stars or a making of show
<START> this film is fun if your a person who likes a good campy feature film every now and then by no means is this movie fine cinema but if you dont take things too seriously and can laugh at yourself once in a while elvira is a good <UNK>
<START> when i heard this film was directed by ang lee i made sure to see it this <UNK> director burst into fame with the wedding <UNK> and eat drink man woman a few years ago and then moved on to sense and sensibility and the ice storm now he turns his attention to another american icon the civil war br br this story takes place in <UNK> a union state with southern <UNK> these never officially joined the <UNK> army instead they formed outlaw bands called <UNK> grew they hair long and sometimes would <UNK> union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing br br the movie depicts their moral dilemma the high drama of the times and their supposedly heroic missions of killing <UNK> and <UNK> who aided the union there are no stars in this movie unless you consider jewel the singer well cast as a young <UNK> widow as a star br br <UNK> <UNK> is cast as a young german farm boy who is <UNK> for his <UNK> because the germans were supposed union <UNK> this young man is an excellent actor full of fresh faced youth whose performance <UNK> his wonder and subtle <UNK> as he's exposed to the horror of war br br jeffrey wright is a freed slave who travels with the <UNK> because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom he gives a fine and understated performance br br some of the acting however is wooden especially in the long conversations they have about morality and their costumes are too new and the southern gentleman theme of manners and hat <UNK> and <UNK> to women comes across as a bit much especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women's arms then burn down the stores and houses br br while i don't think that this will go down as one of lee <UNK> great movies i did find myself fascinated by it in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of <UNK> minutes i was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and <UNK> human beings caught up in the forces of history br br not as much action as the usual war movie but yet still recommended especially for civil war buffs br br
<START> i have never read the book a <UNK> in time to be perfectly honesty after seeing the movie do i really want to well i shouldn't be reviewing this movie i'll start off with that next i'll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable do you know why i say that because i forgot what happens in it i told you it was forgettable to be perfectly honest no tv movie will ever be better than <UNK> br br how do i describe a tv movie i have never written a review for one before well i'll just say that they usually have some celebrities a <UNK> in time includes only one <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> i am not sure the oscar winner br br the film has cheesy special effects a mildly interesting plot scenes that make you go wtf the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go wtf what did i expect it's a tv movie they usually aren't good as is this one a <UNK> in time is a waste of time and a big time <UNK> to top it off you'll most likely forget about it the second it's over well maybe not the second it's over but within a few minutes br br a <UNK> in time
<START> this is a terrible terrible film br br first of all <UNK> long the longest movie i have ever seen br br the stories are all too damn over the top br br as a matter of fact there are too many stories that the story line is ruined br br the comedy wasn't comedy it wasn't funny at all br br the story is so repulsive and badly written that it <UNK> matter if the characters live or die br br i had some expectations from this movie but my expectations were crashed completely in the first few minutes br br the only thing good about this movie is the music and obviously <UNK> <UNK> she gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors she's just a new <UNK> and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic govinda and the blonde who <UNK> his love interest also help saving this disastrous movie govinda perfectly fits in the role of the taxi driver and the blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance br br another talented actress <UNK> <UNK> is completely wasted in this movie so is <UNK> akshay does his role well but it seemed too over the top anil and <UNK> are also totally wasted br br the only one not wasted is salman because he has no talent what so ever to be wasted br br all in all this is a very impossible movie with <UNK> screenplay and <UNK> <UNK> that the storyline is shaped according to the stupid comedy scenes imagine how stupid this movie is br br 3 10 it is four hours long think and <UNK> before going to the cinemas better avoid it
<START> why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary earth how much time do you have on earth so i can explain this to you ok i will not <UNK> my review exploration on earth to <UNK> but i must stand my ground on why this is a must see the documentary takes a nature round trip on the <UNK> paths on three animal families a female polar bear and her <UNK> with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a <UNK> tour for prey and an elephant mama with her small maybe not so small they are elephants <UNK> <UNK> in africa directors <UNK> <UNK> mark <UNK> did an out of this earth job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the <UNK> shots of our three animal family protagonists the <UNK> skilled team of richard brooks burton mike holding adam <UNK> and andrew <UNK> were <UNK> in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal <UNK> <UNK> not to mention the <UNK> mo animal prey shots were u n b e l i e a v a b l e earth is also a lesson <UNK> on the global warming effect on the animals the <UNK> polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence so fellow <UNK> it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit earth today good
<START> after seeing the 1996 remake i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de <UNK> getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin the whole movie was quite funny and on my view better than the animated one but there was actually no need for a second one first of all if <UNK> is returning don't cure her and make her insane again just make her break away from jail and that's a rap i thought it was not very funny it's supposed to have only one original puppy returning i'd expected that it should be lucky since he was the most appealing and besides having roger and anita back too however they decided to have a complete <UNK> and adding not really one hundred not even one hundred and two but only three <UNK> and a parrot that thinks he's a dog clever gerard <UNK> part was pointless at the end cruella suffers way too much way too <UNK> and way too exaggerated to be true she gets baked inside a giant cake that was a desperate attempt of physical humor trying to imitate the same effect from the first one that just didn't work it was too much over the top and not too funny i actually felt sorry about cruella
<START> <UNK> is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions and its effects on a family in china da <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother er <UNK> wu <UNK> makes him believe that his father liu <UNK> <UNK> has died he <UNK> that his father is still alive as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business the public bathroom br br the movie centers around da <UNK> family and how he has to learn the importance of his father's job something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon also the movie explores his relationship with er <UNK> who is mentally challenged and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that <UNK> not only their bodies but also their souls br br the two main themes of the movie the family and the problems of progress are incredibly well handled and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of chinese society and customs br br the director <UNK> zhang tells his tale in a simple way letting the characters characters do the job it is a very simple approach but it fits the movie perfectly and i highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good zhang has enormous potential as he can tell a story without the aid of visual <UNK> or camera tricks br br the acting is outstanding in its <UNK> approach everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed the three lead characters give remarkable performances and wu <UNK> as er <UNK> surely steals the show br br even when the movie could had <UNK> to a <UNK> old days were much better message instead it takes an attitude of <UNK> like saying that progress is good and we must move on but we must not forget where we came from and keep an <UNK> between modern life and the traditions of old br br an awesome and touching film 8 10
<START> there's not much to say about this one <UNK> is some kind of fire breathing turtle he is <UNK> by a nuclear explosion he heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk oh yeah power lines i almost forgot at one time early in the film he befriends a little boy and instead of just throwing him away or <UNK> him he places him down on the ground safe from then on we have to watch this <UNK> faced little <UNK> show up and run away show up and run away show up and run away for some reason <UNK> is able to hear this kid from 20 000 feet away oh well the plot is to try to get <UNK> to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space as usual the monster is <UNK> and <UNK> a guy in a <UNK> suit the japanese army with the help of americans uses up enough <UNK> and fire power to solve the national debt and of course it does no good they should know this anyway we've seen a lot of monsters <UNK> on tokyo not to put these down because they can be fun but it's really not very good
<START> hobgoblins is a very cheap and badly done <UNK> rip off that's the best thing one can say about this <UNK> pretty much everyone in the cast was chosen for their looks and not their acting ability it was very painful to watch br br avoid this one at all costs
<START> this film concerns <UNK> non establishment types <UNK> and sexually who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs although some excellent players take part including jon <UNK> timothy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> they are grounded by a <UNK> script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue which isn't <UNK> role possesses the best lines but she often homes in on them too quickly a timing flaw which must be <UNK> upon the director the grotesque climax <UNK> every available cliche spent or not and <UNK> ends this drab attempt at comedy
<START> curiously it is <UNK> <UNK> eyes and mouth not buddy the <UNK> that emerge as the <UNK> point of buddy a jim <UNK> pictures production through francis ford <UNK> <UNK> somehow countless close ups of <UNK> face slipped passed in the post production stages and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are <UNK> unintentionally funny true story adapted from <UNK> <UNK> davies <UNK> <UNK> about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their mansion into a <UNK> for pets and wild life the movie goes beyond good intentions it positively <UNK> with earnest sincerity the movie never <UNK> with the kind of family film magic that it needed and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly <UNK> nothing here feels real about ten minutes in two <UNK> are <UNK> around in <UNK> kitchen and start throwing a <UNK> knife back and forth it misses alan <UNK> head by <UNK> yet no <UNK> are raised because it's all in a day's fun still when full grown gorilla buddy gets crazy during a <UNK> the cops are called and everyone stares at buddy through the window while he <UNK> up the living room furniture the furniture should be the least of anyone's <UNK> in this <UNK> do <UNK> failure but at least we know russo was in good hands whenever director caroline thompson needs a good pick up shot she gives <UNK> <UNK> another extreme close up i wonder what the <UNK> budget was on this picture from
<START> the intruder <UNK> is a visual <UNK> through a mysterious life br br <UNK> michel <UNK> plays louis <UNK> like jason bourne as an old man with a hidden past living simply in an isolated <UNK> in the woods for <UNK> paranoid reasons but <UNK> pretty young women who can be useful to him we learn more about him through dreams flashbacks and a journey that may unfold <UNK> or not as well as through his <UNK> interactions with family lovers business associates and a striking nemesis like the <UNK> the film <UNK> with parent child regrets and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old film with the same actor as a young man here paul <UNK> 1965 adventure film le <UNK> br br in a complete contrast of <UNK> we meet his son sidney <UNK> colin who has to be the <UNK> house husband in the world as he <UNK> and <UNK> does household <UNK> and cares for a baby a <UNK> and every need of his working wife surely director co writer claire denis must have created him as a woman's fantasy if ever there was one and a lesson to other filmmakers on filming <UNK> there's an additional extended scene where he seeks his father in the woods while carefully carrying his <UNK> baby in a <UNK> he is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is incapable of <UNK> no wonder he thinks his father is a lunatic i spent the rest of the film in dread that something bad would happen to him as the true nature of the heart of his <UNK> father is very gradually played out before our eyes br br the film is a puzzle but <UNK> is <UNK> fascinating as we watch him <UNK> countries and <UNK> <UNK> deals and the voice over narration for <UNK> beau <UNK> was annoying anyway we have to figure out from <UNK> and incidental <UNK> that he is traveling to <UNK> korea and the south pacific time passing is <UNK> by the seasons changing and <UNK> being created and healing there are lots of images of water for <UNK> and for <UNK> br br continuing her fascination with the <UNK> of <UNK> into <UNK> as well as playing a bit on stereotypes of the mysterious <UNK> and russian criminals denis has <UNK> elements from robert louis stevenson paul <UNK> and marlon <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a 40 page <UNK> by french <UNK> jean luc nancy the last for the title and heart transplant plot used for an ironic theme of limited <UNK> which does have consequences br br while louis thinks he's succeeded in being above boundaries rules and morals there is some amusement in the last act as the locals don't quite know what to do with him and try to help him solve his <UNK> odyssey even as he again lies in isolation br br several people in the audience left in frustration at the <UNK> but strikingly beautiful story telling method the unconventional narrative does raise a lot of plot questions on details
<START> the original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the tv series because most people watch for the 1930s style ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the underground can play at that game too hanging the storyline on a plot about the <UNK> march was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the <UNK> is much the same thing all the stuff about <UNK> having to <UNK> for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content
<START> firstly i must admit that it isn't a good movie and i would never watch this movie if pacino wasn't in it br br the movie is about a <UNK> strange 24 hours and he is <UNK> <UNK> sick and sometimes <UNK> i don't like the character at all it's really boring after 20 minutes you may fall asleep and i don't understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie just because of money or what br br since i'm an avid pacino fan i bought this 2002 movie people i know if you haven't bought it yet don't even think about it it's just a waste of time
<START> a slasher flick made in the early 80's has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish it turning up dead years later a group of film students attempted to complete the movie also <UNK> the films deadly curse great idea for a film but sadly <UNK> is just another wasted opportunity br br unfortunately australia hasn't had the world's best track record when it comes to horror <UNK> 1984 was an out and out dud as was <UNK> <UNK> 1987 which was half an american film anyway as for our <UNK> into comedy horror <UNK> <UNK> 1993 is best left forgotten the problem with <UNK> is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la <UNK> 1996 but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work and although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what <UNK> really lacks is any heart sure it follows the basic rules established by <UNK> but it doesn't want to play with the formula instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier br br the killer <UNK> is probably one of the most boring and <UNK> villains in horror movie history his endless <UNK> <UNK> lame one liners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like shakespeare the cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay <UNK> and the feel of the film is like it's deliberately trying not to be creepy looking more like an episode of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> by the way those attempts at mtv style hyper cinema during the research sequence just look lame dated and out of place br br if australia ever gets a chance to do horror again which i hope we still do maybe we should take a <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> 1979 book instead of trying to copy the u s we should be trying our own take on the genre
<START> you know you're in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half speed instead of full <UNK> in a movie and the <UNK> is a dreadful worst case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills actually <UNK> the hammy script and john <UNK> <UNK> art direction one can hardly blame him the movie has something to do with a series of rape murders going on in a small town with a lot of supernatural <UNK> mixed in somehow the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene and cassavetes seems <UNK> p o <UNK> at times the <UNK> itself which doesn't show up until the last scene is a well done creation but it's not worth waiting for br br 1 10
<START> i would of given this film a zero out of ten but i will give it a two reason one is that shah rukh khan appears in the film which is not really a reason last point is that <UNK> appears in this film and does a <UNK> with kamal i love <UNK> very much and have a respect that she is a great actress which is why i didn't enjoy her in this movie kissing kamal but its no big deal anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable lets actually talk about this film is it good or bad i think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn me being a fantastic critic you can see my other 250 <UNK> by <UNK> on my name i have great taste the movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema why is there no <UNK> in this movie its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks watching kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick man cant kiss properly anyway
<START> an excellent and accurate film <UNK> takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off he is not afraid to tell the truth even though it might draw <UNK> reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy br br once again <UNK> brings in christopher <UNK> though not in as high a profile a role as he played in <UNK> i found this movie as accurate well acted and well presented as <UNK> and i applaud <UNK> for his poignant <UNK> writing well done and my hat is off to the writer the actors the production crew a great film
<START> although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere and some okay shots that might <UNK> some back to the silence of the <UNK> days the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere br br the film is about <UNK> <UNK> gere who works for the department of safety and is preparing to <UNK> his office <UNK> upon him his replacement allison <UNK> claire danes stardust who quickly discovers that <UNK> is obsessed with his job and that job ain't very fun he <UNK> hundreds of sexual <UNK> who are on <UNK> in his <UNK> allison goes with <UNK> on many calls to check up on his flock of <UNK> and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement but <UNK> is good at his job even if his methods aren't he <UNK> sexual <UNK> and even has physical conflicts with them <UNK> <UNK> his actions by bringing up these <UNK> <UNK> it is this good justification that challenges the audience on some level letting us see how brutal <UNK> is and yet how out of touch he's become by being too close to his job br br when a teenage girl goes missing in <UNK> area he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was <UNK> by one of his flock but how could he know is <UNK> that good at his job allison challenges him and <UNK> pushes back their battles become as fierce as <UNK> need to find this missing girl br br although the set up for the story was okay it didn't have any <UNK> i will give credit to richard gere however who plays the <UNK> character very well battling retirement worried about everyone who's near his flock disgusted with those he's responsible for <UNK> disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does quite a change in character portrayal for gere but beyond him there's not much else some of the sets are okay dark and dangerous but there are so many other problems as to be laughable br br i'll be the first to admit that <UNK> disbelief is a <UNK> whenever watching films but that suspension has limits the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes someone as <UNK> as <UNK> would know that moving a body would be a huge no no or <UNK> through a crime scene or moving evidence it went beyond and hurt the film to no end br br the other <UNK> part of this film is that we never get into <UNK> <UNK> character allison she's almost dropped by the <UNK> at the end of the film and we're never <UNK> to what her <UNK> might be will she stay or leave will she end up like <UNK> if she does stay this isn't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground but the story as a whole needed to be <UNK> up
<START> bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan an average man who feels god is messing up his life god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways of course giving someone god's powers could take a turn for the worse bruce almighty is a good comedy jim carrey is good as always morgan freeman is first rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well the jokes are almost always on target although sometimes they resort a bit too much on <UNK> facial expressions i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god not only that but also as a black man i thought this quite well especially with the brilliant freeman there are some hilarious scenes the opening cookie scene for instance others miss the target slightly but still a good film 6 7 out of 10
<START> this movie was on the romance channel and i thought it might be a goofy 80's movie that would be enjoyable on some level so my brother and i watched it boy did it suck boy gets crush on girl <UNK> his dream girl apparently there is a difference and i'm surprised he realized she was his dream girl he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away i guess that just goes to show the power of dream girls boy ends up <UNK> as a female to be near dream girl creative in the sense that it's a far out plan but un creative in the sense that there are probably better <UNK> one might think up awkward situations ensue a match is made all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day jobs to come to the set i suspect the latter very clumsily done very pathetic it's almost never even amusing accidentally so there really is nothing to redeem it unless you're interested in seeing <UNK> <UNK> early days before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the hiv positive gay guy on the series life goes on or <UNK> <UNK> who was on <UNK> blue and probably got to stare at dennis <UNK> <UNK> but those are unlikely motives i'd say <UNK> <UNK> of the senses would be a more justified purpose i'm surprised i watched it all i guess it's the kind of thing where halfway through you find yourself still watching due to some morbid self <UNK> inner issue and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie on the off chance that it'll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health can you take the challenge
<START> for starters it's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh check out the two russian bugs br br a bug's life has a classical disney storyline but that's one of the good things about the movie family values are praised and the main characters of the film <UNK> some evolution in order to stand up against the <UNK> in the end and it also has a couple of great voice overs by dave <UNK> julia louise <UNK> kevin spacey of course but actually the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation it's just wonderful all the details great colors every <UNK> looks different beautiful backgrounds and the guys and girls at pixar made it all look so realistic all in all a very nice piece of work this is the best animation by disney since <UNK>
<START> you just got to love opening sequences like the one in seven women for satan  during the intro there's a naked girl running through the woods chased by a hunting dog and a <UNK> looking dude on a horse until she falls off a cliff and <UNK> her head open on a rock then the camera <UNK> out on the face of the guy and we notice how he's simply sitting behind a desk whilst his secretary waiting for him to sign some papers oh i'm sorry i was lost in my <UNK> he then says sweet i have stumbled upon yet another completely <UNK> movie even if you only understand a minimum of french and have a look at the original title you immediately know that seven women for satan hasn't got anything to do with satan or ritual sacrifices but simply revolves on the flamboyant <UNK> of a perverted and mentally unstable count during his weekend in the countryside this is in fact another sleazy variation on the classic <UNK> the most dangerous game about a <UNK> disturbing <UNK> of hunting people  preferably hot naked chicks in the forest for sports well actually this is more than just a variation on the 1932 classic as writer director actor michel <UNK> had the <UNK> to directly link his protagonist to leslie <UNK> legendary villain in the most dangerous game count <UNK> supposedly is the original count <UNK> son but he <UNK> his private island for the remote french countryside he also can't afford to be unemployed anymore so he's an office clerk from monday to friday and a <UNK> killer during the weekend <UNK> is a genuine weirdo who <UNK> about dancing with deceased woman but actually runs his car over the live ones his butler once <UNK> to prevent the <UNK> from killing but he's obviously doing a lousy job there isn't any depth in the screenplay and the build up certainly doesn't pay attention to suspense or sinister atmosphere really the only useful thing to do during this film is count the girls that are <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> trap and hope they'll reach seven rapidly half of the film is pointless and tedious padding footage like the overlong erotic dance act in which a statue inexplicably transforms into a muscular black guy and the other half exists of psychedelic sleaze that eventually grows tiresome as well even though all the girls look ravishing i have the impression that it was michel <UNK> intention to imitate his pal jean <UNK> and make a <UNK> kinky sex thriller seven women for satan is a french production so inevitably it also stars jess franco regular howard <UNK> the awful dr <UNK> zombie lake <UNK> himself surely has the looks of a crazy killer but not the talent to depict one
<START> drew barrymore keeps seeing her alter ego all over town and it's really starting to become a pain in the butt br br after dee <UNK> a flat from a hack writer her encounters with 'the other <UNK> become more frequent writer dude feels that it's his responsibility to snap 'the real <UNK> out of her <UNK> so he does what he can to help including <UNK> her as soon as he has some free time not very interesting and even less scary but drew is sexy as usual especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger yeah drew that's hot br br best scene just might be where drew stabs her real life mom <UNK> with a big kitchen knife hmmm and how was your day
<START> the only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its message br br spoiler they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first <UNK> about taking responsibility for their actions they blame bears and deer for <UNK> by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and <UNK> or even learn to shoot instead of twice <UNK> animals and letting them <UNK>
<START> dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy essentially what starts out as chris <UNK> trying to maintain a low profile eventually <UNK> into an uninspired version of the three <UNK> only without any laughs in order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which play dead is not in order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which play dead is what play dead really is is a town full of nut jobs fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob <UNK> character from a simple plan while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of well jake busey <UNK>
<START> at a time in our culture where reality exposed as narrative is <UNK> fiction as we know it on the small and big screen apart from that is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest fresh and innovative in there presentation than i have ever seen before the usual <UNK> feeding conventions are non existent in this film leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real life moments <UNK> one after the other on the screen while watching the movie and even upon post <UNK> it is hard to believe that these amazing performances where actually that performances every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives even so apart from that does not feel like a documentary or reality television but instead <UNK> into a category of its own with its unique cinematography and direction i look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors jennifer <UNK> and randy walker br br this movie must be seen
<START> whoever thought that another home alone film would be a good idea should have their head examined same plot different kid more villains which leads to more endless stupidity in the traps the other two films were bad enough and this is where it hits rock bottom people may as well watch the other films for plot as it's all identical
<START> i bought unhinged because i got <UNK> by the gory picture on the cover if you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box all the kills are shown and i can honestly tell you that they look much better in the still frames than they do in the movie br br having said that let's look at the plot a group of college girls driving to a rock concert by way of the deep dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid slide off the road no visible damage is done to the car but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a <UNK> state for the rest of the film or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before filming began br br the two remaining girls wake up in a big isolated house the house by the way is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film for some reason though this house has no roads going to it the only way you can get to the main road is by <UNK> five miles through the woods the girls spend the rest of unhinged sitting around listening to weird conversations between an old rich bitch who looks like george washington in drag and her equally <UNK> sexually repressed daughter the girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being that they packed more clothes than the cast of <UNK> island for that three hour tour br br by the time we the viewers get to the kill scenes we no longer care we wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering unhinged finally <UNK> up with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better film it's almost as though the ending the one good idea in the film was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it br br unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting inept directing and a plot with more holes than a <UNK> in a porno film sorry i'm not sure where that came from you will get an idea of how bad this movie is during the opening credits when for some reason that is never explained the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering don't waste your time you'll just feel unhinged and want your time and money back
<START> i didn't really like this movie that much at all it wasn't really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that's about it the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and i'm not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only <UNK> where even the slightest case of redemption could be found all in all it was a couple <UNK> below an average movie br br final <UNK> br br theaters so glad i didn't <UNK> too much money on this br br dvd purchase <UNK> let me think no br br rental if you have a <UNK> sense of humor then why not
<START> the story is similar to et an <UNK> run around on earth and tries to come back home while its stay on our planet it will create friendly ties with humans br br but unlike et which exudes drama comedy poetry this movie is only fun it is indeed a pure <UNK> production its core audience are children the movie is more more in the visual than in the message br br thus you will find some funny scenes the first <UNK> of the town a <UNK> stray <UNK> and the casting is <UNK> with special mentions to doc who <UNK> in a mac fly character and to <UNK> who seems open to auto <UNK> br br ice on the cake the main title is scored by danny <UNK> and like every other great composer you recognize his voice before he is even credited
<START> in case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar it means you watch way too much of this gory italian cult crap for you see the notorious <UNK> lucio fulci did not only produce this movie he also took the liberty of re using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own and more easily <UNK> cat in the brain the opening scene already in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe features in <UNK> later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fails miserably as a giallo since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful but it's still good entertainment if you're into cheap <UNK> <UNK> horror trash the incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of <UNK> characters <UNK> all potential <UNK> but none of the red herrings <UNK> comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately whatever remains to enjoy are the truly <UNK> make up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen like between the first and second murder massacre is a slow and almost <UNK> with its inane dialogs and thoroughly <UNK> photography thankfully in the second half there are women getting <UNK> on <UNK> and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty <UNK> the music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative my advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned cat in the brain that one features all the great moments of massacre and then some
<START> this is the worst movie i ever paid to see and with the exception of they saved hitler's brain the worst movie i have ever seen period when this movie came out i was a big fan of snl and <UNK> and therefore was <UNK> what i thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the <UNK> the tv <UNK> shows must deal with br br the writers must have thought we will throw in some <UNK> some <UNK> jokes some cheap sex and hey we have a <UNK> side splitting laughable comedy the game show skits are nothing more than cheap <UNK> take offs on let's make a deal with stupid <UNK> the sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor the <UNK> gun <UNK> was suitable humor for <UNK> street the la subway skit was bland humor using tasteless <UNK> the french chef walking around blind constantly <UNK> there is no difference with a french accent was well you get my point br br the only funny skit involved chevy chase which lasted for a whole minute this means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie oh <UNK> i've read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970's and you will like this movie if you are high well most of the country was not stoned in the 70's if the inept writers were stoned it must have been on <UNK> <UNK> medicine there were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when i saw this movie of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was
<START> i felt like i was watching the fast and the furious again but with different actors and a little bit different plot i will say the cars in the film are very cool so if you like fast cars then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining i also liked <UNK> <UNK> because i've seen her from days of our lives she is a really good singer but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie i mean songs about cars not exactly what you would here on the radio since it is a hollywood film you have to give this story a little lee way but in real life i don't think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as <UNK> <UNK> who can drive a race car fix a car engine and be a lead singer it's just all very silly br br another side note any one willing to <UNK> 25 million on a car race is a nut but it was kinda of cool at the end when natasha stops right before the finish line and <UNK> michael over priceless br br final verdict this movie is for car freaks so if you like fast cars then i'd recommend this
<START> i have just recently been through a stage where i wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films i have been very public in this forum about the <UNK> of films like the haunting and urban legend and such i feel that they and others like them don't know what true horror is and it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films i already own all the <UNK> so i rented the texas chainsaw massacre the original nightmare on elm street jaws the exorcist angel heart the exorcist and halloween now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that i want to tell you about halloween because what halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do and that is it uses subtle techniques techniques that don't rely on blood and gore and it uses these to scare the living <UNK> out of you i was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as i knew it was i wanted to look behind me to see if michael myers was there no movie that i have seen in the last ten years has done that to me no movie br br john carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers he showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens but what is about to happen what was that shadow what was that noise upstairs he knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of <UNK> horror that i think you can use i even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today but they don't no one uses lighting and detail to <UNK> scares they use special effects and rivers of blood and it is just not the same you can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall it's the moments when the killer is lurking somewhere you just don't know where that scare you and halloween succeeds like no other film in this <UNK> br br in 1963 a young <UNK> myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life <UNK> locked up in an <UNK> as <UNK> his doctor says to sheriff <UNK> i spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out because what i saw behind those eyes was pure e <UNK> that sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants and all he wants here is to kill laurie no one know why he wants to kill her but he does halloween ii continues the story quite well br br what carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score <UNK> lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror there is one scene that has to be described and that is the scene where annie is on her way to pick up paul she goes to the car and tries to open it only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house she gets them comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys the audience picks up on this but she doesn't she is too busy thinking about paul when she sits down she notices that the windows are <UNK> up she is puzzled and starts to wipe away the <UNK> and then myers strikes from the back seat this is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail we know what is happening and annie doesn't but it's <UNK> observations that carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond br br halloween uses <UNK> images of a killer standing in the background it has shadows <UNK> <UNK> across a wall dark rooms creepy and haunting music a sinister story told <UNK> by donald <UNK> and a menacing relentless killer my advice to film makers in our day and age is to study halloween it should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about after all carpenter followed in hitchcock's steps maybe director's should follow in his br br halloween <UNK> everything that scares us if you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and <UNK> then halloween is a film that should be seen it won't let you down i enjoy being scared i don't know why but i do but nothing has scared me in the 90's except maybe one film wes craven's final nightmare if you enjoy beings scared then halloween is one that you should see and if you have already seen it a hundred times go and watch it again back to back with a film like urban legend urban legend will have you <UNK> at all the pretty faces in the movie halloween will have you frozen with fear stuck in your seat not wanting to move now tell me what horror film would you rather watch br br and just to follow up after seeing <UNK> version it makes you appreciate this that much more this is a classic by definition zombie <UNK> his version but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one
<START> a sharp political comment <UNK> as a coming of age story is what this movie is the annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels it isn't supposed to but it does this tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 communist <UNK> is a heart <UNK> it is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema obviously 1953 <UNK> is not as harsh a <UNK> and fascist environment as the communist society is often portrayed one can listen to rock and roll music one of the songs played is the song hey <UNK> <UNK> ala the title of the movie but <UNK> cannot be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess unlike a heavy handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four the girl who has a father in <UNK> in italy and is awaiting a <UNK> for her mother and she to travel out to join him the piano that is taken away from <UNK> use from one of the boys the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new <UNK> because they need it the boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the <UNK> that communism has created as they engage in <UNK> with a fascist <UNK> who has <UNK> <UNK> on his hands these all leads to the actions they take later on and the <UNK> of a time <UNK> away as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the soviet empire a great movie worth seeing again and again <UNK> is not your enemy but yet it is also <UNK> friend
<START> when a friend gave me a <UNK> set of 12 amazing scifi horror movies i was understandably a little <UNK> but since the item was a gift i really didn't truly pay my common sense much <UNK> after all movies for free so what if they are a little <UNK> after much consideration alien intruder was the first of those movies ironically it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch all i can say is if this is the best of them i <UNK> to think what the rest are like br br on the surface it had some good things going for it four count 'em actors that i was familiar with billy dee williams tracy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jeff <UNK> i told myself billy and tracy have been in some good scifi star wars and <UNK> 5 respectively so they wouldn't sign up for a turkey max is a veteran soap actor who never really managed to break into film but not too shoddy an actor an jeff well he's done the good and the bad as far as films and tv go i was soon to discover that jeff had decided to add the ugly to his <UNK> of movies br br the first clue was in the opening scenes jeff <UNK> his way with gusto through an i'm mad scene before finally killing himself an amusing cameo performance really unfortunately this is without much exaggeration the highlight of the film it goes downhill from there br br next up we have the commander of the mission williams who is being sent out to see what happened to jeff and his crew busy picking his new <UNK> from among the ranks of the criminal element but this assortment aren't so much the dirty dozen more like the unconvincing <UNK> plus one of the <UNK> a computer <UNK> is shown in his cell working away on a <UNK> computer isn't that a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the <UNK> pretty lame prison if you ask me br br when they finally take off the effects are truly horrible it looks like the spaceship model was knocked up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year old who had parts left over from his <UNK> <UNK> br br but the horror doesn't stop there whilst on route to the area where <UNK> ship <UNK> the criminal crew are rewarded for their good behaviour by being given <UNK> of virtual reality in which they <UNK> their male fantasies all well and good and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the alien menace which begins to appear there but did they have to drag it out for quite <UNK> <UNK> alien intruder alien boring more like br br finally they make it to g <UNK> and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her affections until only good old max is left the ending in truly optimistic rubbish film vein hints at a sequel as if also making an appearance in this movie is a character i'll <UNK> the <UNK> he's supposed to be an <UNK> but apparently that fact was lost on the make up crew who provided him with <UNK> features at any opportunity but don't worry he's just there to make up the body count numbers at the end br br williams and <UNK> to be truthful do very little in the film they only just barely stay awake let alone act and as i mentioned earlier jeff gets an early trip to the <UNK> so his <UNK> isn't allowed to <UNK> much of the film max tries his best as do a couple of the other cast members but the movie is just <UNK> atrocious to be honest br br the one and only half way imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship <UNK> convention they are all named after musicians holly <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the film is bland and uninspired br br made in 1992 i had thought on initial viewing it was one of those 80's straight to video jobs looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90's it seems br br it's best avoided even as a beer n <UNK> movie this film is a stinker but at least you can fast forward it i suppose
<START> watching that lady in <UNK> i was wondering what betty <UNK> was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for marlene <UNK> to do someone over at 20th century fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another <UNK> f <UNK> should have known better br br betty plays a 19th century italian <UNK> whose <UNK> has been <UNK> by a <UNK> of hungarian <UNK> <UNK> by douglas fairbanks jr her ghostly <UNK> whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree sees no small resemblance in doug now and another <UNK> some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when <UNK> failed br br besides that the current betty has just been married to <UNK> romero and the invasion has come at a most <UNK> moment before things have been <UNK> that's going to give anyone a bad attitude i guarantee br br fresh wholesome all american betty is not the actress to do seductive and mysterious marlene <UNK> might have put this over but with betty it falls <UNK> than <UNK> presidential candidate she and fairbanks have no chemistry at all though doug is as charming as ever and someone i can watch in anything br br <UNK> <UNK> and leo robin wrote the score for this film and this is the moment got an oscar nomination for best song that lady in <UNK> one chance for oscar glory fell to buttons and <UNK> br br ernest lubitsch died <UNK> during the film and otto preminger finished that lady in <UNK> i can't believe lubitsch had <UNK> in mind for the lead here neither will you if you see that lady in <UNK>

<START> spoilers ahead but does it really matter have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions could this be it why did an ancient civilization bury <UNK> all over the world why is this question never answered why was the opening text crawl incoherent why would a nun she sure seemed nice hand over 20 <UNK> to a madman has there always been a gold mine in downtown <UNK> why does one of the gold <UNK> <UNK> exit in the front yard of an <UNK> why does tara <UNK> character suddenly show up at christian <UNK> apartment for sex or did i just answer my own question why would even a non <UNK> bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a <UNK> why would modern computers still display green pre <UNK> era <UNK> <UNK> of objects complete with little <UNK> and must all movie explosive <UNK> have digital displays why doesn't anything in this movie make any sense
<START> terrible acting by potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever and as for the feminist <UNK> it's laughable i saw this garbage when it was first released and though i found it tedious beyond belief i'm glad i did go to see it that's because i now have an immediate answer to the question <UNK> the worst film you've ever seen ' plus i have the comfort of knowing that every film i see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson but i have to admit i was impressed with the way potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts <UNK> <UNK> from around the world as is revealed in the closing credits br br i only very recently saw orlando and i can see how potter <UNK> the wrong lessons from making that film all it took was a bunch of <UNK> costumes a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public so why shouldn't she think she could get away with the self indulgent <UNK> that is the tango lesson
<START> a man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife died of an accident his new wife has just been released from an institution and is also very rich all of the sudden she starts hearing noises and seeing <UNK> all over the place is she going crazy again or is the first wife coming back from the dead br br you've probably guessed the ending so i won't spell it out i saw this many times on saturday afternoon tv as a kid back then i liked it but i was young seeing it now i realize how bad it is it's horribly acted badly written very dull even at an hour and has a huge cast of five people one being the director still it does have some good things about it br br the music is kinda creepy and the setting itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric there also are a few scary moments i jumped a little when she saw the first skull and a somewhat effective ending all in all it's definitely not a good movie but not a total disaster either it does have a small cult following i give it a 2 br br also try to avoid the elite dvd drive in edition of it it's paired with attack of the giant <UNK> it's in terrible shape with jumps and <UNK> all over it didn't even look this bad on tv
<START> this is a great movie some will disagree with me but if you know anything about the bible you know it is i think everyone should see it i agree a new updated version like be nice but the message is still right on if you can see this movie is not a scare the hell of you movie it is truthful with the bible i think the u n will play a major role in the world government to come the last days are <UNK> up with the bible look at what has happened with the chip for dogs and cats that now has come to light to protect on children from being kidnapped it's the size of a grain of rice this i feel is the <UNK> runner of the mark of the beast spoken of in the bible without the mark you can't sell or buy with this chip that small in the future there is no telling how much info can be put on it
<START> i have personally seen many disney movies in my lifetime though absolutely none of them match up in any way to <UNK> and <UNK> although i personally wouldn't have crossed live action with animation it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters the movie <UNK> three <UNK> from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country i would have to say that the casting was brilliant angela <UNK> made a perfect miss price while david <UNK> made a great desperate entertainer love interest endings always surprise me and this was no exception it was neither happy nor sad though i do not know if this was intentional the dialog wasn't great but considering it was designed to be a kid's movie that is alright overall i would give the performance nine out of ten the dialog six out of ten the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten
<START> i'm still trying to decide if this is indeed the worst film i have ever seen a very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many <UNK> who <UNK> this film the <UNK> to <UNK> ratio of the interviews is about ten thousand to one at the end the <UNK> seem to be saying we want you to think but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they <UNK> as fact br br if you feel that you are open minded and wish to expand your consciousness please be open minded enough to read some actual books about quantum theory <UNK> universe <UNK> <UNK> a slim volume not a challenge the <UNK> code by <UNK> <UNK> if you can't bring yourself to read a book please don't complain to reviewers about being open minded br br to <UNK> this film is just unbelievably bad br br you know what's a really good film which questions the nature of reality <UNK> floor directed by <UNK> <UNK> with craig <UNK> gretchen mol vincent <UNK> smart sexy thought provoking
<START> this film is just another <UNK> among many <UNK> on the so called <UNK> of <UNK> please note that <UNK> <UNK> an actor bill <UNK> is nothing more than a <UNK> against the <UNK> of <UNK> we might want to ask are questions like what does <UNK> <UNK> do for a living how does he make his money does he make his living off his <UNK> <UNK> organization how does the internal <UNK> justify this as a <UNK> <UNK> church or organization br br everyone knows that christmas is <UNK> but it <UNK> one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be <UNK> and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families friends or extended families everyone is not <UNK> everyone does not spend time with their families friends or extended families but holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity yes america does have more than its share of problems but with <UNK> americans have and always make it through great difficulties and even in times of <UNK> america has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world that happens when americans pull together and <UNK> rather than to separate and <UNK> yes there are problems with <UNK> and <UNK> but it will take americans to bring back the small <UNK> along with the <UNK> to <UNK> care for people living in our individual <UNK> yes <UNK> has brought us its share of problems but it will take americans to bring production back to america americans and the u s government need to learn how to stay on a budget no matter how large or small it may be and we must stop our <UNK> on credit our over <UNK> on credit will make and keep us poor from the cradle to the grave it is important to buy but if we buy less we will rely less on credit and if we are able to save even a small amount of money we will have money for a rainy day not to say that as americans we will gain an equal share of wealth wealth is not guaranteed and has never been guaranteed but <UNK> teaches us that only a small <UNK> of americans hold most of america's wealth there is a good <UNK> that you or i can reach the level of the upper middle class and who knows what can happen from there be positive work hard and at the very least you and i will be able to reach at least some if not all of our dreams in life nothing is guaranteed but we always have that something to reach for and if you or i don't have dreams we might as well be dead in america there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams as individuals we are a part of the pack but we always can become the leader of the pack br br it has always been my experience that <UNK> and religion do offer nothing more than additional <UNK> but i pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs values and perspectives but as far as the <UNK> expressed within this film i do not have any faith in such beliefs values and perspectives i rank this film with a 1 out of 10 but in all honesty and truth this film deserves a zero this film has no integrity and i cannot recommend it
<START> <UNK> despite its <UNK> of tony wins in an incredibly weak year on broadway has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals however that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on screen unfortunately what <UNK> to the screen is basically a <UNK> faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact first the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor there are lots of songs perhaps too many but few of them are especially memorable the closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and one night only the much acclaimed and i am telling you that i am not going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of <UNK> jennifer hudson the film is slick and technically well produced but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any <UNK> there is some interest in the opening moments watching jamie <UNK> <UNK> like manager manipulate his acts to the top but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain despite his having been right from a business stand point for a good majority of the film <UNK> <UNK> is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rose as the third member of the <UNK> trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film eddie murphy <UNK> himself well as a singer obviously based on james brown but the role is not especially <UNK> and ultimately has little impact foxx would seem ideal casting but he seems oddly <UNK> and bored the film's biggest selling point is surely former american idol contestant oscar winner jennifer hudson in the central role of <UNK> white the <UNK> singer who gets <UNK> from the group and makes a <UNK> closing act return for me <UNK> has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie the film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham <UNK> takes her side but i have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion from the start <UNK> <UNK> herself for the most part like an obnoxious <UNK> self centered <UNK> who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much <UNK> interest in the group of which she is a part when she is <UNK> from the group for her <UNK> and bad attitude the charges are more than well <UNK> but the stage show film seem to think <UNK> should be cut <UNK> slack simply because she has a great voice even though the film tries to <UNK> some of <UNK> harder edges to make her more likable the charges still stand her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an <UNK> mother struggling to raise her daughter using the <UNK> that much like the talent card <UNK> immediately makes any behavior <UNK> indeed the only big effort the film makes to show <UNK> <UNK> is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she <UNK> at her daughter in the <UNK> office insists that the girl has no father and then refuse to look for <UNK> <UNK> to support them since singing is all she knows in the hands of a <UNK> actress the gaps could perhaps have been <UNK> with technique and charisma unfortunately hudson is not that actress she sings well but the dialog driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments <UNK> signature moment the aforementioned and i am telling you number is well sung by hudson but emotionally flat in the acting department <UNK> is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her <UNK> but hudson comes off as a <UNK> performer <UNK> out a hot number all in all not quite the emotional highlight one expects the latter portion of the film is basically a predictable <UNK> of events that <UNK> foxx into <UNK> earlier position and allow her to <UNK> back in and lord it over everyone <UNK> criminal <UNK> in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers but the film's seeming <UNK> that he has it coming because he helped <UNK> in the disco era is rather ridiculous not to mention pretentious and condescending particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a <UNK> the end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit <UNK> of emotion energy or anything that can be described as dynamic
<START> okay i absolutely love ben stiller although i am <UNK> about jennifer aniston i do not think this girl can act in the least every movie or sitcom i've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting it sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script this movie only had one good thing about it and that's that ben stiller was in it this plot is so used and abused it's ridiculous how many movies have this same type of plot can we say forces of nature not only is the plot so old but the outcome is so predictable it's boring i knew everything that was going to happen before it did it was a bore but watching stiller is always a delight
<START> a couple move into their dream home unaware that it and its <UNK> have been built over land <UNK> used as a cemetery the film is said to have been based on a true story although how much of it is supposed to be true is not <UNK> the plot is hardly unique see spielberg's <UNK> 1982 within a short time they experience various supernatural <UNK> these range from the disturbing mysterious shadows the serious illness of the daughter to the frankly ridiculous <UNK> continually <UNK> and garage doors going out of control there is little depth to the story once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery we do not learn anything more the plot does not seem to develop the characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable nor is the atmosphere particularly special the film could be disturbing to some viewers there is no sense of <UNK> or any kind of positive message from it
<START> the only thing i knew about this film prior to seeing it was <UNK> the robot my <UNK> was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci fi flicks that the 1950's was noted for how wrong i was big studio big budget and big production values make this a strong <UNK> at least visually for the best sci fi film coming out of the era i qualify with the word visually because war of the worlds is a lot darker and scarier than forbidden planet and probably fits the mold better as a <UNK> into alien territory br br what impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography followed by the <UNK> and scope of detail involved in dr <UNK> walter <UNK> home and laboratory but that was only the <UNK> to the <UNK> on the cake the <UNK> underground that served as the <UNK> <UNK> it appeared that <UNK> technology was even more advanced than say that of star wars which made me consider audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with <UNK> or in 1986 with aliens watching it on a large screen tv in my living room offered me the same effect and i'm fairly <UNK> to <UNK> br br it's not too much of a stretch to imagine forbidden planet as a direct <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> tv series gene <UNK> himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in <UNK> <UNK> i had to do a double take when the men of united planets <UNK> <UNK> v headed for a <UNK> room while the <UNK> presented to <UNK> that created an <UNK> to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the st series br br where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of <UNK> from the <UNK> that <UNK> himself was using his <UNK> mind to defend <UNK> iv was certainly a unique concept for 1956 when every other sci fi flick of the time was dealing with martians or other grotesque space creatures the film worked it's subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that <UNK> was the <UNK> of <UNK> iv some time before commander adams leslie <UNK> explained it br br you know looking at the <UNK> the year <UNK> isn't that far off this movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets i think though that they'll have to come up with a <UNK> looking version of <UNK>
<START> possible spoiler br br <UNK> to cabin by the <UNK> is a useless movie the acting was not good and the plot wasn't even remotely interesting br br <UNK> by the <UNK> is a good tv movie the sequel was not judd nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this it seemed as if he wasn't even interested in doing the sequel his acting was good but it could have been better i really don't want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion they're not even worth mentioning but i'll do it the character of alison isn't even hardly shown in the first part of the film all of a sudden she's the center of attention next to stanley <UNK> the role didn't make sense and it should have been thought out a little better <UNK> <UNK> was absolutely terrible her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else anybody else the director mike was a confusing character he seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didn't seem like his death was necessary the acting for this role was good nothing great but better than <UNK> br br the plot was real lousy if you think about it stanley who is presumed dead makes his way onto the set of <UNK> by the <UNK> the movie based on his script he stumbles upon the director and in a short time the director is dead and stanley is running the show yeah out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him there's some killings not a whole lot and the one's that are shown are ridiculous one of the actresses on the set gets <UNK> while filming a scene another character gets <UNK> up by a <UNK> and one gets <UNK> up in a plant before drowning these writers must have been hard up for excitement br br i just have to say that i was not impressed with the filming of the movie the way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast also the new cabin by the lake was poorly created we aren't shown it but only in a few scenes and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more but it didn't work in this one br br there were too many characters in this sequel all of them except for a few had no reason to be there the acting of what little is showed was really bad and they just didn't have a purpose in this movie br br all in all <UNK> to cabin by the <UNK> is a sequel picking up from where the first left off <UNK> by the <UNK> i can take but this was just not impressive judd nelson should have avoided this one and so should you it's nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second not to mention that the writing was horrible put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep br br so we see that stanley defies death and is still alive and well by the way he talks it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright br br did the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one they were all done in a tank never never reveal the secrets of filming br br
<START> i can't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did i guess it's all part of the <UNK> down of america personally like david spade said i liked this show better when it went by its original title seinfeld what bothers me the most about this show aside from the obvious base sense of humor and general <UNK> is the pretentious way the episodes are titled truly great shows are still funny after many repeated viewings like the one where rob gets accidentally <UNK> on the dick van dyke show or the one where lucy and <UNK> work at the candy factory in other words it's an honor <UNK> upon great programs by the viewers that the writers and producers of friends would have the <UNK> <UNK> to actually title the episodes themselves in such a fashion before anyone's even had a chance to even see it a second time speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers but also of the <UNK> minds of their viewers br br you read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a hallmark card like <UNK> full of <UNK> card sentiment the true meaning of friendship i want to be a friend i want to live in manhattan wake up these people are supposed to be working in coffee <UNK> and looking for work as actors but they somehow manage to live in <UNK> mo apartments get real all i have to say to those amongst us that want to move to manhattan and live the <UNK> new york life with your <UNK> and <UNK> good luck with all of that that new york doesn't exist for anyone making less than a serious six figure <UNK> but good luck with all of that anyway now shut up and pass the <UNK>
<START> i am not going to lie despite looking interesting i watched the notorious bettie page because i had heard and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film that gretchen mol got naked in it i have never been a fan of mol but i cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes yes that may be perverted but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be br br the film chronicles bettie <UNK> mol life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the south and onto her new life in new york she wants to be an actress but she has to pay bills too after taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach page slowly becomes a <UNK> sensation and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin up photographs br br i feel the <UNK> of the film just over ninety minutes is both a curse and <UNK> for it on one hand the film never <UNK> its welcome you get to know page within a few short minutes and then it gets right into her <UNK> career and does not look back but it <UNK> the film as well because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on she just kind of jumps around between <UNK> shoots and the <UNK> that they create before jumping right into the major <UNK> investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film you just sit there and attempt to <UNK> it all and more just comes right at you it feels like the filmmakers wanted to <UNK> too much material in too short a film it begs for longer sequences and begs more for even longer explanations it does not feel rushed it just does not feel all there br br another bit of a <UNK> although a bit more of a curiosity is the use of colour throughout the film the majority is in black and white but frequently <UNK> and sequences of colour do emerge but while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white it gets confusing and becomes more of a tedious <UNK> than anything else as the film goes on br br while it may <UNK> a bit with the actions the film stays dead on with its themes page who i know little to nothing about is played off <UNK> and her world is exactly the same save for a few shady characters during her teenage years everyone she encounters is an innocent and everything she does has an innocence to it i never thought i would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and <UNK> but here it truly is something to marvel at all at once it is beautiful and innocent even the most sexually perverted moments in the film albeit tame compared to today's standards have an innocent and <UNK> feeling to them there is just something about the way <UNK> nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different <UNK> than nude bodies in other films it just feels so natural and so wondrous that if there were any reason to watch the film it would be to see the spectacular depictions of <UNK> body as she plays bettie page br br the other reason is mol herself as page she <UNK> that 1950's southern belle everyone knows or can at least imagine despite her profession she is still a normal person and still looks at herself as being religious mol plays her exactly to the right amount of <UNK> <UNK> needed to make this character feel <UNK> from the 1950's she plays her with such matter of <UNK> that you would be hard set not to think that mol was actually bettie page herself br br unfortunately the supporting cast have very little moments to shine and are totally overshadowed by <UNK> wonderful performance none of them do anything particularly pleasing and none of them really have that same strength in their role as mol does this is not really the fault of the actors but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with many of them are totally recognizable such as oscar <UNK> david <UNK> in a role a little too close to one of his better performances sarah <UNK> recent golden globe <UNK> for studio 60 on the sunset strip and character actor <UNK> taylor but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay none of these characters are really developed and they really just stand as character cut outs who mol runs <UNK> around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance br br really this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity and for gretchen <UNK> excellent performance of bettie page everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story this film would have been a much better <UNK> film as it stands it is just a vehicle for mol to really rise into the <UNK> of popularity as an actress br br 7 10
<START> i'll say this to begin with why oh why can't wb do what these short film directors do sandy is obviously an amazing director and deserves some credit from wb and <UNK> but i guess they're kinda put on edge when a man with a 12 000 budget can make a super hero fan <UNK> the world's finest is one of the best short films i've ever seen trailer or not br br i think choosing a <UNK> mike <UNK> to play superman was a genius choice let's face it people superman is no super model he may be handsome but a <UNK> stud he is not and i don't know what that guy a few comments above me was on but superman is actually pretty <UNK> have you ever actually read a superman comic i guess that fact alone just floors me it seems like such an obvious choice to get someone with some actual muscle mass to play a super hero rather than a pretty face same thing for batman <UNK> is in incredible shape and an excellent batman i don't know guys if given a bigger budget and his own movie i think <UNK> and <UNK> would be neck and neck bottom line this is one of only a <UNK> few of super hero movies with actors that actually look the part br br the acting is pretty nice as well i don't know what every one is talking about <UNK> isn't that bad he's damn convincing as superman and <UNK> well he is batman i mean come on people this movie had a 12 000 dollar budget what were you expecting everyone else is great too except two face seems a tad <UNK> than usual but hey we only have tommy lee jones as a reference oh lois is pretty hot too br br the <UNK> are <UNK> sweet too i mean seeing superman lift the car up man how cool is that versus the tank scene in grayson i may have to put this one above that since mike actually looks like he's flying and with ease the flying sequences left something to be desired but once again with a bigger budget oh and he even used a <UNK> it was probably a model but it looked damned convincing br br all in all this <UNK> only downfall was a lack of a serious budget and wb refuses to admit that <UNK> is a credible director and needs to be apart of some kind a project but no they'll like most of the marvel projects just keep getting these hack directors who show almost no regard for the fans and what they care about and keep <UNK> out these <UNK> movies thank god superman returns was a hit or that seriously would've been the end of it world's finest is excellent and in my book counts as a superhero movie
<START> at first glance i expected this film to be crappy because i thought the plot would be so <UNK> feminist but i was wrong as you maybe have read in earlier published comments i agree in that the feminist part in this film does not bother i never had the idea that the main character was <UNK> her position as a woman it's like <UNK> is presented as somebody with a spine this in contrast to her classmates so i was surprised by the story in fact i thought it was quite good except for the predictable end maybe it would've been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist so that the viewer is somewhat more surprised br br in addition i'd like to say that rodriguez earned her respect by the way she put away her character i can't really explain why but especially in the love scenes she convinced me it just looked real i think br br i gave it a 7 out of 10 merely because of the dull last half hour
<START> <UNK> <UNK> the one year war is almost at an end a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by <UNK> a <UNK> task force their target a new gundam being built exclusively for <UNK> supposedly built for <UNK> ray from the original gundam saga inside when little boy al <UNK> a fan of <UNK> ms encounters a <UNK> after battle breaks out in the colony he befriends <UNK> ms pilot <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the two become good friends al is treated as an <UNK> member of the <UNK> team through the show <UNK> acts as a father figure to al whose real father is always working and seems to be taken with <UNK> pilot christina <UNK> but eventually they must meet in battle al soon learns that war is not child's play and <UNK> must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission br br for only 6 episodes gundam <UNK> is a well done show the mobile suits are extremely well designed and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters if you liked <UNK> then check this one out or if you are new to the gundam world this is a good show to start with if you look to a show for drama and character development this is the one for you it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle i would rate it more of a drama than action br br mobile suit gundam <UNK> war in the pocket br br sometimes you have to lose to win
<START> i was required to watch the movie for my work so i didn't pay for it on the contrary i got paid but i still found the movie to suck far more than average the jokes were lame the two lead actresses well to use the first wives club division of women's ages in hollywood they are no longer in their hot chick age but more in their district attorney age what <UNK> me most about the movie was the main plot line which pretty much completely <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> do america in which the boys are all <UNK> up about some dude offering them money to do his wife not realizing they're expected to <UNK> her all in all a bland piece of crap
<START> there may something <UNK> right in seeing <UNK> suffer suffer they do in this dreary truly dreadful film but they cause the audience to <UNK> pain of the non dental variety too if you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids <UNK> kids sick kids lots of long long meaningful <UNK> a deadpan wife and a concerned husband it's all here for you boring overlong it stands out as one of those examples that scream out why is there a saving grace yes there is there is a short scene from <UNK> with some pretty good singing save your money or if it's on tv or cable save your time you can always read a book or make an <UNK>
<START> i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november 2005 with my boyfriend we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving it was very well directed with strong imagery the visual effects were amazing especially for a short it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard this <UNK> towards the gothic feel i would love to see this as a full feature film carrie
<START> the radar men from the moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950's serials the special effects are pretty cheap the <UNK> <UNK> are obviously world war ii <UNK> <UNK> with painted <UNK> over them and the like the acting is only so so it does inspire the imagination of children to whom i believe this was directed to by today's standards it's boring cheap and bad there's also a <UNK> amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters
<START> of course <UNK> is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer but i think michael is really pushing the irony <UNK> with this new title feet of flames br br one really can't resist <UNK> <UNK> foot <UNK> to the <UNK> and clearly <UNK> <UNK> br br i might add that much like that cheering london crowd per review below i too am enthusiastic about this being his last live performance br br <UNK> that it may be his last live performance <UNK> is <UNK> on by an enthusiastic london crowd perry <UNK> all movie guide
<START> this is probably one of the worst films i have ever seen the events in it are completely random and make little or no sense the fact that there is a sequel is so sickening i may come down with a case of cabin fever i'm so sorry i describe it as bug being <UNK> to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together e g kevin the <UNK> loving karate kid is just <UNK> weird on its own then there's the cop who is slightly weird and perverted then the drug addict then there's the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on kevin the karate kid its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film there is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love eli roth even that did not make me like this film hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am <UNK> to use it will have to do <UNK> cabin fever 2
<START> wow i hated this movie the subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic but the script if there even was a script is a mess this is less a movie than a random slide show that goes nowhere i'd say it goes nowhere fast except that it's actually the longest <UNK> minutes you'll ever sit through as i've mentioned the lead actor is good so is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as his sometimes harsh but ultimately loving and accepting mother the film makers have a lot to answer for here because this is a mess a real shame because i really wanted to like this movie but it's basically out takes from a movie that never got made skip this one it wasn't even worth the 6 i <UNK> out for pay per view
<START> i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runs in his case his skin hair <UNK> etc could always get more movie work after he'd been reduced to a <UNK> all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to <UNK> radiation i think and so begins to act like an ice cream <UNK> on a hot day not only is this a <UNK> but apparently he has to kill humans and <UNK> their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is that br br the astronaut <UNK> off into the night from the <UNK> <UNK> which has no security whatsoever <UNK> parts of himself as he goes apparently he <UNK> just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space br br thus begins the part of the movie that's pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a <UNK> counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates look alike <UNK> scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couple <UNK> them <UNK> for stealing some <UNK> then there's a short scene where he <UNK> his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young <UNK> and chases his girlfriend around you'd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but no we're treated to about ten minutes of the woman <UNK> into a corner <UNK> and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think was director's girlfriend anyone br br the end of the movie is even <UNK> than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and then nothing that's it that's the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel
<START> well i hate hollywood but love cinema so i have to watch these <UNK> movies in theaters and i was hoping vanilla sky would be good i was hoping that they would either keep the original open your eyes exactly the same or they would make it their own well it happened to be a little bit of both and it sucked br br it started out good i love <UNK> i wish there was more of that but by the end we are listening to good <UNK> by the beach boys talk about a wide range of suck between they had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others but why oh why did they have to <UNK> <UNK> during the climax it was more annoying than confusing or blatant especially when it has nothing to do with the plot at least put some meaning behind the songs kid a primary whatever br br he also did a bang up job with the club scene that was cool otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance as if audiences would get the movie the ones that would get it read subtitles and the rest won't its as simple as that the motivations got all screwed up i didn't comprehend the diaz motivations hadn't they done the chicken soup night before and some of the others and i hate kurt russell stay overboard tom cruise can't act especially in these types of movie i e eyes wide shut and the elevator i get it anyways they tried <UNK> the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy <UNK> and it would have helped if <UNK> hadn't screwed it up br br 2 10 major disappointment
<START> am i the only one who saw the connection between the discussion of <UNK> 'the myth of <UNK> and <UNK> life in <UNK> version a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a giant <UNK> that he must roll up a hill unfortunately every time he reaches the top the <UNK> slips and ends up back at the bottom for him to start there may have been a <UNK> <UNK> at his eyes i'm not sure right now in the movie mary spends her life struggling to get her life together unfortunately every time she <UNK> any <UNK> she falls and loses everything case in point would be the party she throws where she gets <UNK> <UNK> her <UNK> lover and is practically attacked by <UNK> <UNK> in case you question this theory note how this scene ends with her attempting to climb a flight of stars while books fall from nowhere <UNK> her progress until ultimately she passes out the next morning when she <UNK> she is still on the stairs never having reached the top
<START> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is feeling bored with his routine life limited to hard work and stay at home with his wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> daughter one night while traveling home by train he sees the beautiful face of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the balcony of a dance school and a couple of days later he decides to visit the school and secretly take ballroom dance lessons every <UNK> night however he becomes ashamed to tell his family his secret meanwhile <UNK> feels the changes in the behavior of her happier husband and hires a private eye to investigate whether <UNK> is having an affair br br i have just finished watching shall we <UNK> and i really loved it what a lovely and delightful movie the story is amazingly good with drama comedy and romance the cast is excellent and i was particularly impressed with the cold beauty and <UNK> of the wife of the director <UNK> <UNK> and professional ballet dancer <UNK> <UNK> on last september <UNK> i saw the american remake of shall we <UNK> for the first time and i found it a delightful entertainment but now i can say that it is another unnecessary remake and i recommend this original film instead my vote is ten br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> dance with me
<START> i really enjoyed this movie the script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding it is a down to earth movie with characters one cares about it brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards
<START> this movie was a <UNK> confusing at first i usually like gina phillips but this one i have to say was a bad choice just like her doing the movie ring around the <UNK> that one also not one her good movies <UNK> <UNK> was way better anyway faye <UNK> was good she totally <UNK> me out and at the end that was crazy it was about jennifer <UNK> phillips who comes to her twin sisters funeral she stays at a house that her sister owns and her grandmother <UNK> lives at with an aunt named emma mary ellen <UNK> is kinda <UNK> her relations to stay alive and as long as she wants to live she can't die even if jennifer tries to kill her which she tries <UNK> have a weird part in it when the relations go to sleep the <UNK> eat there organs so they can't go to sleep but they do basically it all crazy and mary ellen will never die and her relations will be buried but not dead b c they have to suffer forever so mary ellen can stay alive yeah i hope this helps if it doesn't sorry love ya
<START> <UNK> couple move to a cabin on a mountain after the loss of their daughter discovering that there may be ghosts haunting the place restless spirits of past <UNK> who committed suicide julie <UNK> <UNK> christian blames husband allen greg thompson for the horrible death of their daughter due to leaving the door <UNK> and the marriage has <UNK> because of it julie remains in a zombie state <UNK> next to no emotion remote and <UNK> only <UNK> a nearby abandoned prison finding a startling image of a <UNK> girl <UNK> to the bars of a cell though allen doesn't see anything out of the ordinary julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something isn't quite right a local <UNK> jim payne scott <UNK> a rather distant fellow who <UNK> a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the <UNK> occurring to the <UNK> meanwhile the neighbors who sold the <UNK> the cabin find themselves victims as well alcoholic mr <UNK> abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his cabin attempting to unravel the mystery about the place br br plenty of ghosts moving about in the background in this somber supernatural tale with practically every character miserable <UNK> christian remains so vacuous and lost it's incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight the acting as is often mentioned remains frustrating because none of the characters exactly are easy to <UNK> on to i guess it's supposed to be this way under their circumstances but the trouble i had was never being able to properly embrace the <UNK> due to their constant state of <UNK> <UNK> comes off as cold and detached as i figure a mother would tend to be when you lose a child in such a way but the icy nature left me <UNK> inside to embrace her which i just never could i think the right performers even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil can grab the hearts of their viewers if a humanity reaches out to us in this movie's case the leads are unable to do so for whatever reason it could've been me i don't know i wanted to care for them but nothing in the characters <UNK> on my heart strings anyway as the film continues allen slowly <UNK> certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she won't lose her little girl again jim the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the <UNK> <UNK> the area he must kill the <UNK> becomes a vital threat the ghosts remain a central part of the movie their presence particularly <UNK> mother established throughout off in the distance the finale reveals all of them as allen must find help for his wife while trying to <UNK> <UNK> mission i had a hard time getting into this one due to my <UNK> with the leads and their characters
<START> may 2004 wonderland is fairly new in the uk brilliant film of a brutal true story if you know la from the early 80's you will appreciate how well it is captured the use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original <UNK> the experience and bringing the viewer very close to actually being there the use of a disjointed <UNK> <UNK> style time line allows exploration of the <UNK> concerning what really happened while the direction and performances of the cast command attention especially val kilmer as john holmes an oscar for sure if i were <UNK> them out
<START> no cinematic achievements here however that's not even the important question how does it fare in its <UNK> to be a competent date movie and star vehicle br br the formula requires the cute female lead a la ryan or aniston check there's a built in tv audience br br add thick headed <UNK> men usually including the problem ex boyfriend fiancée check br br <UNK> a plot that <UNK> the <UNK> of the stars so far so good br br what is the male lead to consist of he has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience and the gay flight <UNK> instantly <UNK> but he cannot be so hunky as to <UNK> to the male audience and he can't <UNK> the star roll cameras br br the problem is messing thinks she's still in a sitcom she has only one presentation as the wide eyed <UNK> that she's made a career out of a capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene where things promptly <UNK> into the soap <UNK> br br you can't help feeling good for <UNK> you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this he's gotten all the respect of a lifetime <UNK> <UNK> this time he <UNK> one out to the warning track and no one can figure out what to do as he <UNK> takes home plate
<START> there's no <UNK> of bad dialogue in david and <UNK>  i was quite a hand with a <UNK> the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy full marks to dennis <UNK> for delivering that one with a straight face go and sit with the <UNK> and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan whatever you say he even tries the old my kingdom doesn't understand me routine on desperate housewife <UNK> at one point so it's probably a tribute to henry king's direction that the film isn't at all bad despite the <UNK> much of the first third provide maybe it's the <UNK> <UNK> nature of the plot  a married man kills a femme <UNK> husband and gets away with it  but king brings out the growing moral and <UNK> <UNK> in phillip <UNK> script rather than <UNK> the sin and <UNK> <UNK> this is the conflicted david on the downhill <UNK> abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands and the film doesn't back away from the awkward <UNK> questions about why a loving <UNK> would choose to <UNK> vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual <UNK> of the law where the <UNK> of husbands result in the punishment of their wives br br unlike king david which <UNK> the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting <UNK> david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder <UNK> and a frankly <UNK> overlong close up when visiting the site of <UNK> and <UNK> death gregory <UNK> performance grows in stature as david <UNK> susan <UNK> is pure hollywood pro raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet why be <UNK> when you've got a voice that makes the very heavens <UNK> and <UNK> moore's <UNK> such an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that you can't exactly blame david for putting him in <UNK> way but despite threatening to soft <UNK> the film doesn't allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s 50s biblical epics br br <UNK> new dvd is a good transfer including an incredibly hokey <UNK> behind the scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film's sole battle scene
<START> i searched for this movie for years apparently it ain't available here in the states so bought me a copy off ebay br br four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several <UNK> what they find is an ex vietnam vet gone crazy he kills some of his victims using a <UNK> with long metal finger nails a la freddy krueger as soon as the night falls one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend she gets killed after one of the group finds her body they all hide in their <UNK> waiting for daylight once the sun comes up all of them try and make it out but fall victim one by one br br seven bodies not a lot of gore but a couple of good murders especially the <UNK> the guys get killed in somewhat <UNK> ways blown up in car shot to death knife through head br br overall <UNK> trap is a nice slasher film from the late 80's nothing new just well acted fast paced and some pretty ladies 10 out of 10
<START> hello this is my first review for any movie i have seen i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally the most disgusting movie i have ever seen i feel like the movie was <UNK> made which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it i felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw which i can agree saw as well is also very graphic but i did like the movie saw br br the scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen the scene lasted almost forever well actually it was probably around 5 min but still i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good this director uwe boll and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one one final note haha for all the people who enjoy watching animals <UNK> to death letting <UNK> with women and children as well and a five minute scene of someone getting there head <UNK> in with a hammer then you will enjoy this movie if not and you like horror go with a higher budget film like saw for example i cant believe people actually make movies like this anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart this is just my opinion on the movie
<START> this film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies it is virtually flawless the writing acting production design humor and pathos are all wonderful even the music from dean martin to la <UNK> is captivating and delightful br br every character is <UNK> delightful and memorable from the leads played by cher and nicolas cage to the many supporting roles olympia dukakis vincent <UNK> john <UNK> danny aiello even grandpa with his dog pack each of these performers plus norman <UNK> as director performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work for several of the actors this was an early major exposure in film so the casting is also exceptional and we have many current acting <UNK> whose careers were altered by their <UNK> in this film br br i've seen this film several times all the way through which can sometimes <UNK> the impact of a film <UNK> more <UNK> i realized some years ago that whenever i channel <UNK> my way into a scene from this film any scene the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted there are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the cher and nicolas cage characters where cage tells his tale of <UNK> vincent <UNK> discovered with his <UNK> at the opera amidst the <UNK> generated by his gold mine <UNK> business olympia dukakis <UNK> john <UNK> for <UNK> with his student in the classic line about <UNK> with co workers don't sh t where you eat danny aiello at his dying mother's <UNK> nicolas cage taking cher as the rapture of an <UNK> <UNK> in the background br br there are of course many great romantic comedies among them sabrina both versions but especially the audrey hepburn <UNK> bogart william <UNK> original when harry met sally the apartment br br none quite equals moonstruck
<START> really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statements br br a perfect example is when the filmmaker claims <UNK> or paul of <UNK> the writer of the book of <UNK> he <UNK> has no idea jesus is or was a human being this <UNK> is either <UNK> false as he <UNK> others of presenting or he is ignorant of what the bible says br br first we can examine his misleading claim about <UNK> 8 4 which he shows a quote if jesus was on earth he would not be a priest hence right here he sets up the ignorant and <UNK> viewer to accept his false premise why he does what most so called bible believing people he <UNK> of doing the same that is taking things out of context br br <UNK> one of <UNK> 8 is 1 now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the <UNK> in the heavens the context above is clearly speaking of a jesus who was on earth and <UNK> into heaven after his alleged <UNK> br br it has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context <UNK> here he offers a foundation that paul was not aware of a human jesus but only one in heaven br br follow br br lets see if the filmmaker is being honest <UNK> 7 14 for it is evident that our lord <UNK> out of <UNK> of which tribe <UNK> <UNK> nothing concerning <UNK> br br <UNK> didn't the filmmaker just quote from the writer of <UNK> trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a human jesus it's likely anyways paul didn't write <UNK> but i will not go into that here but the film maker <UNK> paul did and that is the premise of the point given here br br it is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas he does but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on once he <UNK> in these tactics in my strong opinion he loses credibility as the religion he picks out and the film is no longer a documentary but a personal opinion and a bias of the film maker nothing more nothing less
<START> streisand fans only familiar with her work from the funny girl film <UNK> need to see this show to see what a brilliant performer streisand was before she achieved her goal of becoming a movie star there had never been a female singer quite like her ever before and there never would be again sorry celine only in your dreams but never again would streisand sing with the <UNK> energy and above all the enthusiasm and vulnerability with which she performs here by the time she gets to that central park concert only 2 or 3 years later she'd been filming funny girl in hollywood and her performing style has become less spontaneous and more reserved more <UNK> and let's face it more angry there's a wall between her and the audience live performing was never what she really enjoyed she did it because she knew it was her ticket to hollywood and once she no longer had to do it she's done it as little as possible and oh that legendary stage fright provides such a good excuse br br her <UNK> here and on her earlier judy garland show appearance are incredible streisand could truly make an old song sound new again and <UNK> such as richard <UNK> and harold <UNK> loved her for it but by the 1970s streisand was trying to be a rock singer her albums <UNK> to the younger audiences with over <UNK> <UNK> of songs that were <UNK> of her effort or her voice br br in the '80s she came back with that brilliant broadway album but went on and on about what a struggle it was to get it done how they told her not to do it etc oh please when has anyone told streisand what to do she could have been doing good stuff like that all along bringing audiences up to her level instead of <UNK> to what she thought the young public wanted the back to broadway sequel wasn't nearly as good as streisand seems to feel it necessary to improve on other <UNK> work if he were alive at the time would richard <UNK> have even recognized his own some enchanted evening <UNK> notorious for taking singers to task for playing around with his <UNK> would undoubtedly have been after streisand to sing what he'd written she also blows michael crawford off the cd in their <UNK> of music of the night apparently reminding him just whose cd this is why does she insist on taking songs that are <UNK> and singing them by herself and songs that aren't <UNK> and singing them as <UNK> with someone else who she then goes on to <UNK> br br supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her don't let them do to you what they did to me advice streisand wasted no time in <UNK> despite her <UNK> to the contrary surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway just imagine she told the cbs <UNK> how her first tv special would be done no guests just her br br but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference br br ps i watched this again last night 12 <UNK> after not having seen it for many years it was even better than i remembered the 1st act begins with i'm late and includes make believe and how does the wine taste and <UNK> homage to childhood i'm five it <UNK> as streisand appears with full and i mean full orchestra to sing people she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really <UNK> compare it to some of her later auto pilot versions the 2nd act after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which hasn't changed much over the years is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> br br the 3rd act is the <UNK> call it streisand the orchestra and the audience although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing this may have been the <UNK> part for her but if so to her credit it doesn't show she tears through lover come back to me and the <UNK> when the sun comes out though i can't remember in which order the poignant why did i choose you one of my all time favorite streisand performances and offers a <UNK> of funny girl songs including of course don't rain on my parade and my favorite song from the score the music that makes me dance explaining that <UNK> <UNK> sang a song like that in <UNK> and it made her the <UNK> of broadway streisand then sings my man and it's almost a dress rehearsal <UNK> for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film the main difference being that the black <UNK> here is <UNK> her film <UNK> had long <UNK> and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face but the vocal here is more <UNK> and charged than her later film vocal her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with <UNK> <UNK> who of course never sang the song in such an all out manner as streisand does here or in the film see the great <UNK> for a glimpse of <UNK> more understated version the show ends with streisand singing happy days are here again over the credits br br when it was over i said to the friend i was watching it with she has never ever done anything better br br and she was twenty three years old
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> satire has some laughs and some <UNK> violence i wouldn't say blood <UNK> but there is insult and injury max <UNK> john <UNK> is a character actor that has a quirky <UNK> presence on screen but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after there is always a <UNK> nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks well the best thing to do is get rid of the competition max becomes obsessed with such thoughts the rewarding career is just a swing push and shot away other cast members <UNK> <UNK> molly parker jennifer <UNK> frank <UNK> and cameos by eric roberts and sandra oh well that's show business or is it
<START> i saw this recently on a cable channel the movie is great it's one of the few musicals i have seen that doesn't shy away from the light and dark it portrays some of the <UNK> of the age along with a lot of the <UNK> some of the set piece dance sequences so much is going on i didn't know where to look next one day i shall go and see this on the big screen just so that i see what's happening but what really lifts this to another level is oliver <UNK> performance as bill sykes not only is a thoroughly mean and menacing man but there is something else some inner demons he gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner he was capable of anything it was almost as if the sykes character was on the edge of madness just awaiting the trigger i have seen the robert <UNK> bill sykes from the 1948 movie and i thought he was <UNK> a bad egg but oliver <UNK> performance <UNK> me in my own living room
<START> with stunning cinematography and a thread of <UNK> absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it characters are drawn <UNK> and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless but these are <UNK> of the movie but conscious choices the film works isn't trying to work as history but rather is a <UNK> of 1940s war movies br br i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it 9 10
<START> the thing about my folks is a wonderful film about relationships first and foremost an adult son and his father but also that son with his wife his sisters and his mother paul reiser has written a semi <UNK> movie about his relationship with his father the movie is funny poignant and thought provoking it led me to re <UNK> my own relationship with both my now deceased father and my adult son peter falk is excellent as paul's father the role could not have been better cast i hope that both mr falk and mr reiser are recognized in next year's movie awards for their efforts falk for his performance and reiser for his script
<START> worst movie with the best reviews given it i've ever seen over the top dialog acting and direction more slasher flick than thriller with all the great reviews this movie got i'm appalled that it turned out so silly shame on you martin scorsese
<START> i saw brother's shadow at the <UNK> film festival and loved it judd <UNK> and scott cohen are great as father and son the film follows scott cohen from <UNK> in <UNK> back to his family in brooklyn he shows up there because his brother has died and he <UNK> on a journey to slowly <UNK> his estranged relationships with his brother's wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives also the imagery of the <UNK> business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait
<START> when watching a bug's life for the first time in a long while i couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's happy feet as far as the main storyline goes they are very similar an <UNK> doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special it just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal <UNK> conclusion a lot of people disagree with me when i say that i really like <UNK> <UNK> effort sure it doesn't manage to capture the <UNK> of toy story nor is the animation out of this world however the story is top notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with with plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot i could watch this one just as much as the <UNK> other classics br br there is a lot about finding strength from within to <UNK> all odds here between our lead flick needing to keep his self <UNK> up to save his colony the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just <UNK> <UNK> freaks everyone <UNK> into a better bug by the end of the story even the villain hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons he is not doing it to be mean but instead understands the fact that the ants <UNK> him 100 to 1 he needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth it is very much a circle of life but not one that can't <UNK> with the ages br br when thinking about the animation it is actually quite good compared to <UNK> the rival film of the time this is much more realistic and less <UNK> the water is rendered nicely as is the <UNK> you don't have to look much further than the <UNK> eyes to see how much detail went into the production the <UNK> and <UNK> despite the smooth exterior shows the realism all the bugs are finely crafted too the flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures <UNK> to save the ants are never <UNK> on whether for a small role or a more expanded one it is also in the city that we see the <UNK> on the <UNK> while <UNK> island is nice it is just the <UNK> bug city contains plenty of garbage <UNK> as buildings and <UNK> it is a great showing of humor and <UNK> to see what the animators used for everything from the ice cube <UNK> as circus stands the animal <UNK> box as circus <UNK> with full <UNK> guide on the <UNK> crazy <UNK> of boxes to create a times square of <UNK> and <UNK> everything is done right br br as far as much of the humor you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices no one could do a male <UNK> better than dennis <UNK> with his <UNK> wit i dare you to think of someone better our leads are great too with dave <UNK> as flick and julia louis <UNK> as princess <UNK> as well as the always fantastic kevin spacey as hopper spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie but also takes center stage in the <UNK> during the credits yes a bug's life was the <UNK> of animated <UNK> from pixar a tradition that has continued on with many tongue in cheek bug jokes laced throughout you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast full of those guy actors it is people like richard kind brad <UNK> and the late joe <UNK> as <UNK> the worm who bring the biggest laughs br br overall it may be the <UNK> story brought to screen by pixar one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience there are <UNK> moments sad times and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun complete with a couple of my favorite pixar characters <UNK> and roll there isn't too much bad that i can think of saying about it
<START> apparently the <UNK> man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self <UNK> as a way of <UNK> with his abusive childhood i use the word <UNK> because without listening to a director andy <UNK> commentary which i didn't have available to me or reading up on the film prior to watching viewers won't have a clue what it is about br br <UNK> and fans of extreme movies may be <UNK> into watching the <UNK> man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real life footage but unless they're also fond of pretentious headache inducing experimental art house cinema they'll find this one a real chore to sit through br br <UNK> minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by <UNK> <UNK> sound terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue this mind numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity if you've still got all your <UNK> you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead i watched the whole thing but am well aware that i'm completely <UNK>
<START> this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a <UNK> director to get himself noticed hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile <UNK> or any other issue for that matter br br the main character's <UNK> from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene being an over dragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from a clockwork orange is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic values there are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his her goal at least in my opinion br br to wrap it up shockingly brutal revolting and not worth your time see a clockwork orange or le <UNK> instead
<START> i was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library cary grant in a comedy set in the services director stanley <UNK> so far what's not to like it's the sort of film that has me wondering two things when did all involved including some well known names realize they had a turkey on their hands and what's the worst thing about it among a number of <UNK> aspects still <UNK> the first but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline ahead of the <UNK> sometimes pretentious script the uncertain tone the lack of consistent and well developed characterization and the lack of <UNK> between the characters you have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under <UNK> quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough cary grant tries to portray his usual charming and <UNK> persona but at times seems uneasy and <UNK> in his delivery i have to say however that i was <UNK> when the initial <UNK> his character will be paired with the <UNK> vulgar <UNK> <UNK> go away with the appearance of <UNK> parker what's to like about the film for me <UNK> the beauty of parker who also acts with restraint and a grace kelly like dignity generally speaking the film is nice to look at the naval characters are very smart in their uniforms however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black fu <UNK> <UNK> they don in their luxury hotel <UNK> even grant can't look elegant in his back to the credit side ray <UNK> does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre <UNK> heroes <UNK> <UNK> speak without an assumed german accent
<START> so let me start off by saying that i saw this movie as part of a bargain i was really bored one fine 1997 day and so i <UNK> over to the movie rental store i asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in stock was without <UNK> he walked me over to lucky stiff he told me that he'd <UNK> the 1 rental <UNK> he said it would be wrong to charge more if i promised to watch the whole movie so watch it i did for free br br this movie is terrible god awful even i don't need to go into plot details read the other reviews the jokes make no sense the acting was terrible i know it was supposed to be a comedy but the stupidity of the main character was <UNK> you might try to watch it as something to laugh at but it's so bad that it isn't even funny in that way avoid
<START> the title above is used to introduce the film gen to its audience gen is about a young doctor <UNK> <UNK> with an ill mother the film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job while she drives we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area as soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital she sees the death body of a patient this is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days br br two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide in fact they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions all their communication with outside world is cut off too there is no way out in those few days there will be more nasty murders now everybody suspects from each other br br in my opinion the idea is brilliant it could have been very scary indeed there are positive sides of the movie of course i really like the beginning of the movie especially when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital <UNK> are okay some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though i think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie what i am saying is it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening the director needed to explain it altogether which i think didn't work well also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital lastly i would like to say a few things about the director i am sure he will improve this is his first attempt i have recently found out that he is only 21 years old that made me feel more positive about him and his future films i am not going to rate this film out of though
<START> everything a musical comedy should be gene kelly as joe brady doesn't miss a step and frank sinatra as clarence <UNK> doesn't miss a note scenes with them together are very good showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot sinatra's i fall in love too easily is an indication of his then and future best kelly's mexican hat dance with a young mexican girl is delightful kelly certainly earned his nomination as best actor and there is a <UNK> of truly funny lines like you think the navy takes <UNK> you think anybody sings a sailor to sleep and we got in a little trouble we picked up a little kid a thoroughly enjoyable movie just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently <UNK> world war ii
<START> baseketball is indeed a really funny movie david <UNK> manages to make us all laugh our heads off again in a really silly but many times smart comedy br br the 2 creators of south park the main actors in this film play very good surprisingly good actually but this is the first time i see them as actors the movie <UNK> reminded me of south park one of my <UNK> shows br br it's a really good and funny film so don't miss it br br vote 7 5 out of 10
<START> why did the <UNK> of mary and <UNK> have to be so <UNK> divorced women with indifferent daughters and why very little reference to the original show and characters the daughter characters were silly and uninteresting why can't there ever be daughters who like their mother's on tv it makes sense that mary would leave <UNK> and <UNK> would return to nyc but why couldn't <UNK> or sue ann <UNK> be guest stars it just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters it was good to see mary and <UNK> together of course but it could have been better much better well there has been a mary tyler moore show reunion a dick van dyke show reunion hopefully mary will do better next time if she <UNK> her old mary richards <UNK> grounds again
<START> <UNK> bush is a 30 minute cartoon show comprised of 2 15 minutes episodes shown on comedy central it takes place in a fictional cartoonish washington d c and centers around the satirical childish <UNK> of george w bush <UNK> rice donald <UNK> and dick <UNK> other politicians are also <UNK> in the same manner and act as minor characters br br the pilot of little bush much to this <UNK> expectations proved to be a rather shallow and <UNK> production which barely delivers on its featured promise a satirical look at the current presidential administration while one must admit that premise of the show does have some merit even though it would be hard to imagine a show based almost completely of the <UNK> of a single political persona would survive to continue to produce episodes after his term of office <UNK> execution that can only be described as sloppy at best and downright awful at worst has marred what little potential the show had br br <UNK> bush which may be technically classified as satire tends to disregard its actual use of the particular tool of comedy in order to <UNK> its targets in exceptionally vulgar but not particularly original entertaining or funny ways the show's consistently weak writing often consists of little more than recording bush <UNK> jokes heard elsewhere ad <UNK> and placing them all in a single 30 minute block of television as such most of the jokes that presented by the writers were shameless clichés some of which that been in public <UNK> for more than 6 years already comparing the vice president to darth vader for example may have been funny in the first 300 times one has heard it on the daily show <UNK> report <UNK> conan o'brien leno monologue any late night talk show ever but it is not funny here as if that were not enough the show's plots seem to exist simply as a means to advance the same old tiresome bush jokes that the writers have made the center of the program br br in the show's defense when the writers dare to write in a truly original joke which seems to be a <UNK> it is often somewhat humorous if the show were to expand its depth somewhat and place its characters into new situations exotic situations rather than the same old mistakes and <UNK> <UNK> by the bush administration therefore not having to rely on the same old bush jokes over and over again the show might be considered somewhat tolerable and possibly even innovative br br ultimately it is difficult to <UNK> which <UNK> causes the <UNK> bush series the most damage its clear lack of originality and weak writing quality or its painfully narrow minded ambitions it is reasonable to expect that <UNK> bush will be able to maintain a small base of left wing fans that is if they are able to endure the exceptionally poor writing so long as the program continues to lampoon the bush administration thoroughly even so the majority of viewers will soon recognize the program for what it really is a weak and <UNK> vulgar attempt at satire and tune out in search of something more intellectually <UNK> the price is right perhaps
<START> time <UNK> are the devil's <UNK> for <UNK> minds they're fun to consider in a <UNK> if ' sort of way film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including <UNK> trek first <UNK> the <UNK> to the <UNK> trilogy <UNK> and ted's excellent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the stargate <UNK> homage <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you <UNK> was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time br br in the case of terry <UNK> excellent film <UNK> <UNK> it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re think our conception of the film repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind br br some seeing the film for the first time will regard cole played by bruce willis as a <UNK> most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the <UNK> wrenching of <UNK> visited upon him by time travel br br unlike other time travel stories <UNK> <UNK> is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by <UNK> events in the past cole tells his psychiatrist <UNK> madeleine <UNK> that time cannot be changed but a phone call he makes from the airport is <UNK> by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 in his own personal time line br br even this could be <UNK> as an event that had to happen in a single time line universe in order to ensure that the time line is not altered cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised if that's the case time is like a fluid it always finds its own level or path <UNK> of the <UNK> forces working on it it <UNK> the mind to <UNK> on this sort of thing too much br br if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time as we see on board the plane at the end of the film then that means the future can be changed by <UNK> past events or does it the film has probably led to plenty of drunken <UNK> at bars <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> br br bonus material on the dvd makes for very interesting viewing gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget which is no particular surprise after the <UNK> <UNK> and in light of his later attempt to film <UNK> <UNK> i would rate the <UNK> <UNK> documentary as one of the more interesting i've seen it certainly is no <UNK> and accurately <UNK> the difficulties and occasional conflict <UNK> between the creative people involved <UNK> description of the film as his <UNK> release on account of the film being written by writers other than himself and therefore not really <UNK> <UNK> doesn't do the film itself justice br br brad <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> is curiously engaging although his character is not especially sympathetic watch for his slightly wall eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum it's disturbing and distracting br br probably a coincidence the louis armstrong song <UNK> a wonderful <UNK> was used at the end of both <UNK> <UNK> and the final episode of the tv series of 'the <UNK> guide to the <UNK> both the film and the tv series also featured british actor simon jones br br <UNK> <UNK> is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental <UNK> of a game of chess may entertain it's not a mindless recreation that's for sure
<START> i grew up with scooby kinda the re runs of where are you i hate <UNK> love daphne and feel its not complete with out the whole gang but this is sad scooby doo is mystery solving comedy not bad totally <UNK> <UNK> anime i like whats new they had to give danger prone daphne a <UNK> sometime and try to lose the sex drug jokes of many a generation but this get a clue is flat out crap and should not have the scooby name attached they even tried to do some lame punk thing with the theme song now i'm gonna go watch my dvd of scooby doo where are you to wash the filth of this new series off my eyes
<START> wow i just saw this on t v as one of the scary movies they show around halloween was this rated g there wasn't really anything to make this movie scary or worth watching also other people say this is a spoof but i don't think so for a spoof you need something called humor this low budget crap fest didn't have a shred of humor and it didn't make much sense either you basically have a goofy looking monster man in rubber suit coming out of <UNK> killing people i guess since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster so i guess that's good enough br br the military tries <UNK> to kill the monster which isn't much larger than a man they have very bad aim then the military <UNK> wow did this movie make the u s military look pathetic or what the monster while hard to kill doesn't do much besides <UNK> around and <UNK> oh and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and <UNK> it was a slightly interesting yet a total alien ripoff br br what was the deal with the scientist playing the <UNK> to attract the monster it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality also why did the monster carry around the main <UNK> guy for so long why didn't the monster go into the closet when it had a chance why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless
<START> in the rapid economic development of 1990's in china there is a <UNK> of traditional chinese culture partially due to the rise of <UNK> accompanied by the increase in wealth and more importantly due to the sense of spiritual <UNK> after the collapse of the old <UNK> ideology in the post cultural revolutionary era br br however the <UNK> of chinese traditional culture namely the <UNK> was not without disasters because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without <UNK> the bad part and the <UNK> against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example br br moreover not only the part that should be <UNK> were inherited the good part that was supposed to be inherited such as the traditional opera and its technique such as changing face was ignored in the <UNK> and facing <UNK> br br the director used this film to criticize the problem of re <UNK> tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie
<START> the idea of in the name of the people is good a murderer doesn't want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter and you could expect of the actors especially scott <UNK> to do some good acting unfortunately they don't in the name of the people turns out to be the regular friday night <UNK> the flashbacks with the girl that was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict what the actors will say if you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch dean man walking
<START> guy walking around without motive i will never get those two hours of my life back the guy kept on assuming identities and cheating on his pregnant wife what was i thinking how did this win a price anywhere i understood he loved his father but other than that the movie was completely senseless to me what was the purpose of walking so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason how did this <UNK> his life why did we have to see the dying old lady on her underwear why br br i though it would be deep or about something more interesting i do not recommend the movie even to leave on while sleeping
<START> though i did not begin to read the classics in literature until i was <UNK> it's never too late jane eyre is a favorite for many reasons mainly because there isn't a part of the book i liked less only parts i enjoyed more the 1983 tv mini series with zelah clarke and timothy dalton was everything i hoped it would be i saw it as a full length movie in 2006 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was very good but i absolutely loved <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on another <UNK> movie i saw recently i was disappointed in the production direction and dialogue it was only faithful to the <UNK> and arrogance of hollywood artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of <UNK> using the title after such license is fraud leave it to the brits to get this one right among others you won't be able to <UNK> the book without <UNK> the movie with it's proper context and spirit well done bbc
<START> long on action and stunt work but so short on character <UNK> and development that it failed to hold our interest not always easy to figure out which side a character is on and who's doing what to whom
<START> why else would he do this to me br br not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movies or even decent movies i saw lois and clark i am aware of just how good dean cain is br br obviously this is gonna be a <UNK> flick and each <UNK> flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head i will not call these spoilers as you can't really spoil this movie any more than it already is br br to begin with why is that a fake helicopter i mean why br br how come that one scientist is from chicago and that other scientist is from la and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried how hard would it have been to get either an american actor or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people aren't american br br why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives us a slug line we get <UNK> day and then mess hall day later on and then that's it who cares about the <UNK> to be honest who cared about it even when they mentioned it but i guess that's beside the point br br does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens the answer is no br br that dragon sure can walk down that hall over and over and over and over br br who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history it was straight out of scooby doo oh the <UNK> dead now say wanna get dinner sure but not at some chinese place with dragon in the name ah ha ha ha ha ha ha haha ha i used to be superman <UNK> ha ha ha ha br br fade to black br br my god it made me cringe it was so stupid br br but never fear even though the whole building <UNK> and no one was left alive for some reason there's a second <UNK> <UNK> lab that survived pretty well so they can make a sequel <UNK> for us all br br
<START> this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is absolutely no storyline the gags are only for <UNK> and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching in the whole movie <UNK> oh my god what a funny name ha ha doesn't ask himself once how he came from a plane to middle earth there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny e g <UNK> is called <UNK> sam is called <UNK> and so on i didn't even smile once during the whole movie the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative if you laugh when someone's coat is trapped in the door this happens about 5 times then this movie is perhaps for you another funny scene they try to guess the code word for a closed door don't ask why don't ever ask why in this movie and the code word is ha ha dung so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie for everybody else go to youtube and watch lord of the <UNK> it's a lot lot more fun
<START> director writer <UNK> <UNK> worked seven years to complete this two hour film about the crime underground in <UNK> <UNK> and perhaps that is one of the reasons the <UNK> film seems episodic and in need of editing or maybe this is the technique of a director who shows a fine sense of film noir storytelling br br two brothers <UNK> the elder <UNK> <UNK> and victor the younger juan <UNK> miranda have moved to <UNK> from their home in <UNK> after their parents' death and <UNK> works to support <UNK> education on <UNK> <UNK> birthday <UNK> takes the virgin out to the <UNK> where he encourages victor to lose his virginity with one of the <UNK> stripper prostitutes in a tender scene victor must face his <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> is out on the club floor <UNK> the <UNK> with his potential for hire br br <UNK> goes to work for the <UNK> as a bodyguard henchman and makes good money to support <UNK> <UNK> but victor has eyes for one of the dancers at the club named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and begins to woo her dropping out of school <UNK> <UNK> angry disappointment <UNK> just happens to be the squeeze of the club <UNK> leader don <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is <UNK> boss <UNK> is the <UNK> that holds this tale together as she is the <UNK> of victor <UNK> and don <UNK> and the consequences of this bizarre <UNK> a <UNK> has deadly results through a means of re telling the story through the eyes of victor <UNK> and <UNK> we grow to understand the <UNK> and the cracks in each character that allow for the downfall that results br br sound like a <UNK> pulp fiction well it is and it is filmed in a brutally colorful dark manner that includes a lot of frontal nudity both female and male and provocative sexual encounters but in the end the sensual aspect of the director's vision is what drives this film playing on the <UNK> <UNK> psyche against the hardcore professional sex worker with success the cast is fairly strong especially <UNK> <UNK> in the demanding role of <UNK> there are enough twists and turns and <UNK> of incidents you think you understood the first viewing but that change dramatically in impact when told through the eyes of a different character <UNK> on two hours some <UNK> editing would have helped the impact of the film in spanish with english subtitles recommended for those who like the edgy film noir style and the art of south american cinema grady <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie in the middle of the night when i was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch it's one of those films where you stop to see what it is just for a moment but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off no matter how bad it is one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's well just plain bad it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both great middle of the night fare if only for the fabulous <UNK> drag don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that <UNK> lowe is so obviously male because logic does not apply
<START> tara reid as an intellectual christian slater usually great as a dollar store <UNK> and stephen <UNK> as well it's stephen <UNK> for christ sake i personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort you guys are on <UNK> an idea just my humble <UNK> opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices a movie about the most brilliant <UNK> <UNK> in history <UNK> one <UNK> to cure all <UNK> ever known to man and get this <UNK> the <UNK> they have to be played by jessica simpson and paris hilton i knew you guys would love that seriously though you owe me 7 50
<START> in this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to timon and pumbaa in the film when they are not shown which is a lot this film even goes back to before <UNK> and <UNK> just after the birth of <UNK> br br quite true to the first film lion king 1 2 or lion king 3 in other places is a funny entertaining exciting and surprising film or sequel if that's what you want to call it a <UNK> of surprises and hilarity <UNK> for you br br while timon and pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema with a remote control timon and pumbaa have an argument of what point of the lion king they are going to start watching as timon wants to go to the part when he and pumbaa come in and pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning they have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story which is what <UNK> it starts with <UNK> first home br br for anyone with a good sense of humour who liked the first films of just about any age enjoy lion king 1 2
<START> shallow shallow script stilted acting the shadows of boom <UNK> lingering over the actors' heads in scenes worth watching because kate <UNK> plays the most selfish mother in tv movie history and it's all before ben affleck got his teeth <UNK>
<START> br br it's a generic coming of age story think the member of the wedding summer of <UNK> a summer place even little women and there are moments where <UNK> might have <UNK> the <UNK> music not used slow motion or played down the golden lit <UNK> of the setting otherwise it's done with rare emotional perfect pitch <UNK> forced every line has feeling and the pacing is just right even the below a list casting helps bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material in particular <UNK> is excellent her line <UNK> are fresh and original and her body language is just right for a <UNK> <UNK> 14 year old on the eve of <UNK> <UNK> is also very fine even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck br br one senses that the film's makers were aware of its <UNK> commercial <UNK> no big stars no big car crashes no special effects and <UNK> decided to make the best possible movie box office be damned it's intimate and honest and it sticks to the <UNK> if you find yourself <UNK> up at the end you don't have to feel you've been <UNK>
<START> terry <UNK> stunning feature length adaptation of chris <UNK> short film la <UNK> is full of mind <UNK> surprises yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast <UNK> flair for the <UNK> works with the script by david and janet peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor james cole willis at his most steve mcqueen like better than mcqueen even a time traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong <UNK> while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals willis the <UNK> oscar nominated brad pitt and <UNK> <UNK> as a well meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers even paul <UNK> tango style score is haunting this one's a don't miss
<START> dark comedy <UNK> humor how does one make a comedy out of murder it can be <UNK> business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people so the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work so pierce brosnan the <UNK> answer to <UNK> is now cast as a chain smoking sex addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis he meets a struggling businessman greg kinnear and after a rocky beginning he learns that he needs a friend but <UNK> happily married to hope davis and brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't have love home and a life add character actor philip baker hall as the hit man's manager and we're off to the races brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti hero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart the very human businessman hope davis adds a <UNK> as <UNK> very conventional wife who is fascinated with this <UNK> who <UNK> into their lives the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it you should leave the theater feeling at least partly good if you're able to suspend being <UNK> at killing people
<START> <UNK> heston wore one james <UNK> wore one but mark <UNK> <UNK> not to don the traditional <UNK> cloth i hope no one casts him as tarzan linda harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 planet movies but <UNK> warren barely shows <UNK> her hair is always in the way tim burton could have <UNK> up this <UNK> saga given the adults in the audience something to look at even the <UNK> helena bonham carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain she's cute but all the the love stuff is <UNK> to anxious looks a little <UNK> kiss at the end as in artificial intelligence which <UNK> inter species sex between robots humans but never delivers planet of the apes hints at inter species romance between the humans the apes but only hints lisa marie is the only ape that <UNK> to be sexy this movie has three great actors tim roth ms carter paul <UNK> chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes they are fun to watch <UNK> make up a certain oscar costumes sets music make this the hit summer movie of 2001
<START> enjoyable movie although i think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it it is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why <UNK> is such a <UNK> then when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isn't much detail perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something br br anyway it is still a good movie that i'd watch again 7 10 br br

<START> nothing to say but wow has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field well this happens about 25 times in this movie clearly the <UNK> favorite scare <UNK> in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute after about 30 minutes of <UNK> trash we are <UNK> with a flashback of the <UNK> history in which we see some of his previous victims if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest her <UNK> go all the way to her neck it was flat out disgusting most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we <UNK> and watched over and over laughing hysterically br br definitely rent this movie if you have ever been <UNK> up on in an open field br br signed the answer
<START> i recently saw this movie in my international business class i was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary not to say i don't love documentary i've just hard bad luck with movies in that class imagine my surprise when this movie that's actually a movie came up br br this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to <UNK> to get anywhere the culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh because yes it is funny br br well that's about it cheers
<START> obviously has some talent attached maria <UNK> is always great but this is just a dreary <UNK> of time portraying every character as someone to be <UNK> and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an <UNK> story well i hope they got it out of their systems unfortunately for the audience there is no insight no sensitivity no context and really no humanity which would all be fine except it has no humor no horror no context and nothing <UNK> to say about the story it's trying to tell bad things happen you sit and watch it you don't care so what 99 of the time the words <UNK> on a true <UNK> <UNK> an unintentional warning to the audience it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the <UNK> nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work i hope they had a great time making this movie it stinks on ice
<START> the greatest sin in life is being dull and this movie is <UNK> boring its funny its left out of his a life in film documentary he goes from a long piece on stardust memories and then fast <UNK> to <UNK> this little piece of <UNK> <UNK> just isn't worth the effort
<START> too bad a couple of comments before me don't know the facts of this case it is based on actual events a highly <UNK> disappearance and murder case taking place in the <UNK> de philadelphia <UNK> region from <UNK> through 2000 i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would <UNK> the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local <UNK> and philadelphia <UNK> news stories throughout the time period of course i immediately pointed out that the actress who i really like in cold case who played <UNK> looked nothing like her anne marie was actually <UNK> i have to admit though that mark <UNK> really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as <UNK> and the behavior that <UNK> <UNK> throughout this period details of the case were right on no <UNK> of dramatic effect even down to the carpet gun furniture and <UNK> in conclusion i also wanted to add that i have met tom <UNK> many times at various functions a good man despite being a politician and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this <UNK> crime guys like <UNK> are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars
<START> they played this on the july 4th twilight zone marathon and this is hands down the worst twilight zone episode i've ever seen it's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone even though twilight zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being <UNK> predictable this one was completely out of place compare this to legendary episodes like a stop at <UNK> or midnight sun and you realize there is no comparison br br buster keaton did what he could with such terrible material and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would <UNK> to the level of this episode even though he seemed to be giving it some effort he must have needed the money there's no other explanation
<START> this is one of the most overlooked gems hollywood has ever produced a young wwii british fighter ace whose plane is about to crash has radio contact with a young american woman who <UNK> the brave pilot knowing that within minutes he will be dead for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the <UNK> and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven when a <UNK> is sent to ask the pilot to <UNK> him to heaven the man refuses and demands to have his day in court to argue his case the man <UNK> that his situation had changed during the final moments of his <UNK> life that he had fallen in love and <UNK> had become a different person one who deserved a chance to live on br br the heavenly court is a cinematic delight the <UNK> of the jury of peers is a definite highlight the story as fantastic as it seems is an engaging one and will keep you <UNK> for the nearly 2 hours play time the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a <UNK> treatment for most viewers this film is in my personal all time favorite top 10 it has my highest recommendation
<START> a scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of <UNK> cancer so he thinks why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark well who wouldn't it's a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that's killing everybody is constantly being called paul also william <UNK> cast as a <UNK> kick ass <UNK> kinda hero lacks credibility on the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark paul bites another one to death as a matter of fact i find bad b movies quite amusing but for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say <UNK> bucks less then it might have been fun
<START> this film is an entertaining fun and quality film the film very cleverly follows the <UNK> if the book and tries to stick to the exact lines the actors are all suitable and you would expect them to be the part they use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film the graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film there is no such thing as a yellow spotted lizard for example the camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book all of his group are mentioned a lot in the book but are not in the film overall a great film for a rainy afternoon
<START> when i am watching a film i am aware that it is just a movie ' but nonetheless i do like to allow myself to become <UNK> as much as possible under the circumstances i think this is what makes us cry scream laugh or otherwise react emotionally as audience members even though deep down we know it is just a movie ' what i don't want is for the movie to remind me it is just a movie so that i am unable to slip into the aforementioned <UNK> regardless of the quality of the film this film's director chose to frequently use multi angle camera shots simultaneously on the screen maybe it is just me but i find this to be terribly distracting and downright irritating they might as well run a continuous <UNK> across the bottom of the screen reading attention this is just a movie do not allow yourself to become too interested or <UNK> if i want picture in <UNK> i'll <UNK> it from my tv remote but never during a movie i want to enjoy
<START> for most younger viewers out there they probably have no idea who buster keaton was so because of this they probably won't feel nearly as sad when watching this film as i did i happen to be a silent comedy freak having see just about every keaton film still in existence my being a huge fan made this film very painful from start to finish this is because during his silent days keaton was a very vibrant and creative comedian he was amazing in his <UNK> and his films were almost never dull however in a move that movie historians still are <UNK> by at the end of the silent era keaton gave up his independence and became a stock mgm actor instead of being a great creative force mgm now saw keaton solely as an actor and they wrote scripts for him that had no respect for what made him great at first these films with mgm were not that bad such as the cameraman but with <UNK> the studio really blew it putting him in several films with jimmy <UNK> <UNK> humor was based on his gift for <UNK> and was <UNK> keaton in contrast was quiet and based on action two more unlike and <UNK> actors would have been hard to find as a result of this deadly combination keaton made some truly dreadful films br br now this isn't to say that speak easily is a terrible film no instead it's just more of a time <UNK> and an amazingly unfunny one at that in fact if you go into the movie assuming it's a comedy it will probably make the film harder to enjoy instead it's sort of like a drama with a few comedic elements it is not a film that will produce belly laughs especially for keaton fans br br the film begins in an odd setting keaton is cast as a college professor whose entire life is teaching he knows nothing of the world and has his nose stuck in his books in a bizarre move keaton's servant tricks him into believing keaton has received <UNK> 000 from a dead relative hoping that this would <UNK> keaton to get out and enjoy life this is amazingly contrived but somehow it manages to work not terribly well but it works br br keaton immediately leaves school and goes on a journey to new york to have some fun on the way there he meets up with an incredibly <UNK> theater <UNK> because he knows nothing of the world he doesn't seem to realize they stink and because he thinks he's rich keaton decides to take them all to new york to perform on broadway however just before the show opens his friends find out that keaton is not rich so they decide not to tell keaton and try to keep him away from process <UNK> that want to close the show they assume that if the show is a hit then they can pay off the <UNK> and everyone will be happy however they forget that the show itself stinks what are they to do and will keaton get the nice girl get <UNK> by a gold <UNK> thelma todd or be flat broke and alone if you care see the film br br as for keaton he has few stunts in the film though there are some dandy ones near the end instead keaton just kind of walks through the part in a very subdued manner there's really little to love about this film or hate it's just blah when it should have been a heck of a lot better
<START> really it's a dreadful cheat of a film its 70 minute running time is very well padded with stock footage the rest are non <UNK> <UNK> and drab interiors scenes the plot exposition is very poorly rendered they are all just <UNK> scenes sort of strung together there is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is <UNK> by the intensity of the actors please don't ask br br the plot concerns a rocket <UNK> a million degree heat <UNK> earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth it's a real time menace that must be <UNK> if a <UNK> built h bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much <UNK> by then br br what saves this film somewhat uniquely is the stock footage i've never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film this is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft i managed to see there's a brief <UNK> by a pilot flying in alternate shots an f <UNK> <UNK> and an f <UNK> first to <UNK> <UNK> is the royal canadian air force in <UNK> hunters and f <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or canadian built <UNK> <UNK> and even a pair of <UNK> 100 <UNK> br br then for some reason there are b <UNK> b <UNK> and even <UNK> are seen taking off more padding br br these canadian <UNK> are moving at <UNK> miles an hour i don't think so since one of them appears to be a ww2 era <UNK> meteor the rest f 80s the <UNK> press the attack and one turns into a late f <UNK> with a flight of early straight wing f <UNK> attacking in <UNK> br br there's a strange <UNK> <UNK> version of the f 80 that doesn't seem to be the t 33 training type but some sort of <UNK> all weather <UNK> <UNK> with radar in the nose these are <UNK> in a <UNK> br br an <UNK> deck aircraft <UNK> is seen from about 500 <UNK> it <UNK> f <UNK> <UNK> f <UNK> <UNK> a 5 <UNK> and a 3 <UNK> the air force <UNK> f <UNK> and f <UNK> and more f <UNK> then you've ever seen in your life as well as f 100 super <UNK> and f <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the f <UNK> press their attack with <UNK> much padding the f <UNK> <UNK> their rockets in their <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> mo the f <UNK> fire an f <UNK> lets loose a <UNK> even some f 80s f <UNK> with mid wing rocket <UNK> let loose there is a very strange shot of a late model f <UNK> prototype with a straight wing early model f 85 above it in a turn obviously a <UNK> republic <UNK> advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the f <UNK> <UNK> how it <UNK> into here is <UNK> guess br br there is other great stock footage of <UNK> in the old days when the capital of canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of new york city's times square during one of the civil defense <UNK> in the early 50s br br i think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the pacific seems to be in the background the use of a <UNK> <UNK> is somewhat mind <UNK> and there is a nice <UNK> 3 to be seen also canada must have been cheap and it is rather <UNK> used a lot in the background br br as far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who ellen parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture and she most definitely is flipping someone off could it be r as in robert <UNK> the director who dies before this film was released her career as this was her last credit br br its like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift
<START> i personally thought the movie was pretty good very good acting by <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> the killer fame i really can't say much about the story but there were parts that confused me a little too much and overall i thought the movie was just too lengthy other than that however the movie contained superb acting great fighting and a lot of the locations were beautifully shot great effects and a lot of sword play another solid effort by <UNK> <UNK> in my opinion well i really can't say anymore about the movie but if you're only <UNK> on asian cinema is <UNK> tiger hidden dragon or house of flying <UNK> i would suggest you trying to rent it but if you're a die hard asian cinema fan i would say this has to be in your collection very good japanese film
<START> it occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films i'd like to argue that instead of <UNK> challenging controversial movies the censors should consider <UNK> films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your iq and your sanity if they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be <UNK> ace this film is awful with a capital <UNK> it is the worst film burt reynolds ever starred in quite a feat for for a man with <UNK> run ii cop and a half and rent a cop on his <UNK> br br the <UNK> thin story introduces us to successful stock car <UNK> <UNK> ace reynolds a man who loves fast cars and fast women he gets stuck in a <UNK> contract with crooked <UNK> clyde <UNK> ned beatty the contract requires him to do some <UNK> <UNK> work for a new chain of fast food <UNK> such as dressing up as a giant chicken thrown into the mix are <UNK> jim <UNK> <UNK> dim witted pal and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> anderson a bimbo with a brain <UNK> smaller than a <UNK> who is <UNK> by ace br br hal <UNK> the director of this low grade garbage was <UNK> a <UNK> and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases races some of these films were ok like hooper and stunts <UNK> but with <UNK> ace he reaches a career <UNK> the characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them anderson especially is <UNK> with such a dumb role that it makes you <UNK> your teeth with despair the humour is weak and <UNK> throughout and the stunts and race sequences are <UNK> even the out takes during the closing credits which can be found in all the reynolds <UNK> <UNK> are generally unfunny which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn't much fun to make <UNK> ace is a stinker of considerable <UNK>
<START> this film has got several key flaws the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of <UNK> as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life this means that the film cannot <UNK> it's audience instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it in short it really is very very very very very very very bad do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman
<START> <UNK> <UNK> story <UNK> has been filmed again and released to home video in the us via faith films br br the original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him greatly expanded and set in america though clearly filmed in russia the houses clothing and <UNK> are all wrong despite the english signs this is an odd film that doesn't really work part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods america but clearly isn't there are also some weird intentionally <UNK> moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later i'm not sure why they did that even after watching the making of piece on the dvd the other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera or if they are the voices don't even remotely match the lip <UNK> i don't know if its faith films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the west revealed in the making of piece br br the film isn't very good as i've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball <UNK> despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film as film to <UNK> faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god br br given the choice i'd give it a pass even at a bargain bin price my advice would be to find the 1960's version of the tale called <UNK> which will bring both some <UNK> and some understanding about a belief in god
<START> this movie is very important because suggested me this consideration sometimes you can wish to be sick sometimes you can wish to have a syndrome sometimes for example you can wish have <UNK> syndrome that way you'd not remember this boring movie and above all you'd not remember adam <UNK> sandler sometimes simply you can wish have rented another movie br br my vote 3 out of 10 my suggestion if you are neither a fan of boring romantic comedies or adam sandler it's a joke don't exist adam <UNK> fan i want to hope it save yourself someone to save drew barrymore perhaps
<START> there is only one use for a film such as <UNK> it reminds you just how bad bad can be we often see films which we describe as pretty awful or not much good but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't good they are no way as <UNK> bad as <UNK> this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds <UNK> <UNK> the dvd bargain bin at our local <UNK> to <UNK> an <UNK> i e to give me a present it could have been a <UNK> find but it wasn't this is so utterly clichéd so badly written so poorly directed so badly acted that i'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years god it's awful i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in but carried on because sometimes sometimes bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable this isn't one of them it is simply bad i stopped watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin
<START> this has the logical <UNK> of <UNK> filled with <UNK> and the overall <UNK> is just as disgusting br br will be used in the <UNK> circle of hell at recreation time just plain torture br br i would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through <UNK> blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again ever horrible horrible horrible br br you know the good thing about swiss cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese here it's only holes and the excitement factor well that turns watching paint dry into an <UNK> rush and an olympic speed sport br br my brain hurts from trying to work out who <UNK> this drivel did they think about the premise i sincerely hope not otherwise there is no redemption the only <UNK> is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes made for tv should not be a <UNK> for sure let the horses <UNK> run loose across the living rooms our audience are idiots br br i was hooked just to know how it could get any worse this is not a good sign folks br br hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it br br i should be ashamed for watching it br br i am ashamed i'm off for a long shower
<START> i am a major fan of the horror genre i love horror slasher gore flicks of all kinds some of my favorites are the really good bad horror flicks but this movies has nothing to warrant it's viewing i'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that's wrong with it br br the script is horrid the acting is horrid the fx are not even worth discussing the set is an absolute joke the sad thing is i think there may be some real potential in a couple of the actors but this vehicle left them nothing to work with br br suffice it to say i saw it for free feel i was robbed the time you'd waste watching this would be better spent <UNK> your cat
<START> i read one other review that expressed the view that platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people being killed taking drugs and talking trash br br i don't agree with that because the film actually had more to it but it a way i can see what this person is trying to say this had no real plot which is a point i agree with br br it is self indulgent stone at his best he really wanted to show not only how war leads to death but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive unfortunately the film seems to over <UNK> this aspect and the grand finale is just way too <UNK> grand standing oscar hunting let's create an enduring image for my liking br br the problem i have with stone and other film makers of his <UNK> is that they fail to understand this simply concept depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is does not prove or even reflect on whether it was an <UNK> or <UNK> war we have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with iraq in case you're missing the point let me put it to you <UNK> if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers would you think it was an <UNK> war if that fact alone doesn't convince you that it was an <UNK> war then why should depictions of the horrors of vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance br br personally i do not support america's decision to go to war in vietnam but i certainly don't <UNK> to the this war is wrong because people died and suffered theory i don't think that motivations are always wrong by <UNK> just because war in itself is terrible br br this says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big twist was a bit stupid however this is not stones first oddball departure wall street was a magnificent film up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful wrong turn <UNK> is probably one of the few films stone did that actually ended very well br br but it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around and this is why i gave it such a low mark it was virtually story less and ultimately boring unless you fell for the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> for this review a list of good points and bad points i'll start with the bad br br bad points the casting choices especially burt reynolds as boss <UNK> the acting of said badly chosen cast the storyline the idea of setting the film in the modern day the direction the editing the soundtrack and above all the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that wasn't that great to start with despite it's popularity br br good points jessica simpson in a red bikini that's it br br one might make an <UNK> here in the scene where jessica simpson as daisy duke <UNK> her way up to michael <UNK> as <UNK> and asks the question <UNK> where's boss <UNK> and <UNK> in his <UNK> judgment tells her where they are she might just as well have asked <UNK> is this a good movie the red bikini would have <UNK> his judgment into saying yes even though in his right mind he would have said no not really as good as she looked in the bikini she could have been stark naked and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film making stay out of hazzard
<START> descent yeah boy i haven't seen anything this powerful and <UNK> since bruno <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 2003 by the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent <UNK> about the topic of female <UNK> the descent 2005 directed by our <UNK> pack friend neil marshall who also happens to be a major talent his own right but getting back to this descent the <UNK> 17 rated uh oh effort on which the lovely ms dawson takes a <UNK> credit <UNK> and directed by <UNK> <UNK> strong chance that's not a real name as good as it is in moments it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed as a producer you really have to <UNK> up that script of course in the premise alone you have the promise of rising conflict but there still lies the task <UNK> of <UNK> rising conflict br br at times this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and well i guess i'll let the others who've already commented here speak to the <UNK> of it namely that which occurs in the second act but find me a second act that isn't boring there's also this catch 22 that goes along with these quasi independent films like descent in which rosario happens to be <UNK> herself to and <UNK> her fame identity to get a script into production that would under usual circumstances not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film's leading role rosario dawson is gorgeous and apparently you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long but oh wow wee how fast the time just slips away <UNK> ain't no <UNK> no more that's part of the confusion about the screenplay is she a graduate student a <UNK> no graduate students don't really have these type of <UNK> with football players do they again if you are rosario dawson executive producer that's the one of many many aspects to the professional film process you'll have to think about as you <UNK> on this wonderful new role in your film career and if you don't have the answer to why you're movie isn't convincing let me tell you there is a <UNK> and a <UNK> of <UNK> well <UNK> <UNK> aged talents <UNK> to get involved in the business who might have nailed that lead character down all the while looking just as darn good as you know who but unfortunately without ms dawson no honey no money i have to say the camera department did an outstanding job however because this film is really well shot i e lit in all its dreary dreamy darkness the nightclub scenes look wonderful one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time the shooting framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch br br descent is good not great however i have a feeling thanks to netflix this movie will find a life of its own i hope this group continues making films if you're into experimental american film making cinematographic imagery of <UNK> well formed college <UNK> or male model drop outs in their early <UNK> or if you're an <UNK> just plain angry at the <UNK> aggressive young men that <UNK> less than half of your american university rosario <UNK> descent might be your flavor of <UNK>
<START> in ten words or less to describe this film barbara stanwyck is too appealing and it is great the film is wonderful except for the perhaps tacked on ending but i love happy endings anyway barbara stanwyck however as the <UNK> blonde gold <UNK> is amazing she knows what she wants and goes after it this film is sexy and excellent
<START> the film is based on a genuine 1950s novel br br journalist colin <UNK> wrote a set of three london novels absolute <UNK> city of <UNK> and mr love and justice i have read all three the first two are excellent the last perhaps an experiment that did not come off but <UNK> work is highly acclaimed and rightly so this musical is the <UNK> ultimate nightmare to see the <UNK> of one's mind being turned into a <UNK> badly acted <UNK> one dimensional <UNK> of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s london and does nothing of the sort br br thank goodness colin <UNK> wasn't alive to witness it
<START> i saw this a couple of nights back not expecting too much and <UNK> it didn't deliver anything too exciting the plot set up of a crew of vampire hunters v san for vampire <UNK> going around in their spaceship <UNK> killing space <UNK> and <UNK> people is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite ace unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film leaving something behind that though <UNK> watchable is quite laughably bad i don't expect anything too special from these films that pop up on the sci fi channel and at least this wasn't one of their creature features with an atrocious cgi beast <UNK> about but it was still pretty bad mostly due to the writing and acting but with a sterling contribution to the overall badness made by the horrible music when the film <UNK> just for a typical science fiction sounding weird noises approach to the soundtrack it did ok but all too often hilariously bad soft rock <UNK> and pitched scenes into silliness i would have <UNK> the general cheesy acting and writing more were it not for the choice of music which was a serious <UNK> turning things from cheesy to <UNK> comical of the acting dominic <UNK> was ok but bland as the <UNK> hero whilst <UNK> <UNK> was pretty irritating as the tough girl of the <UNK> <UNK> team and aaron pearl played another member who wasn't well written or interesting enough to make an impression though she didn't seem that good at the acting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> did well through having a less irritating character than the others and the fact that she is seriously nice to look at the only serious name in the cast is michael <UNK> and he is underused though he does nicely pretty amusing in a manner one suspects was intentional he seems to have fun and earn his paycheck and his role is entertaining the effects are ok on the whole they are at least of the standards of the average science fiction tv show and there are also a few scenes of blood splatter and a bit of fun gore as well things move along nicely and i almost feel harsh rating this film badly but then i remember <UNK> into laughter at regular <UNK> and <UNK> that unless the film is an intentional comedy which i don't think it is then it simply doesn't succeed too much is lame <UNK> unconvincing its an ok effort i guess but it didn't appeal to me only give it a go if you really dig sci fi trash or <UNK> chuckles i'd say
<START> best of the zorro serials and one of my favorite serials period this is a period serial set right after the birth of mexico the new nation is counting on the gold produced by this one town to keep the republic <UNK> however a gold god don del <UNK> is stirring up the indians and stealing the gold for himself its zorro and his band of men to the rescue reed hadley is a winning zorro and he cuts a dashing figure as he gets into a nice selection of <UNK> most all of which were <UNK> by the later zorro serials as well as other serials as well the story moves and its nicely not clear who the real bad guy is there is a reason that i've seen this the most of any serial i've seen its simply a great action adventure film the only thing i can compare it to is the mark of zorro with <UNK> power or one of the other <UNK> of the period its super and highly recommended
<START> and i do mean it if not literally after all i have not seen every movie ever created at least obviously among the ones the many i know br br 5 3 the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly for example the piece of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> korean <UNK> called <UNK> can be truly bad but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6 this movie very much worth watching is a disgrace br br true i give it a 10 in protest the movie is not perfect its true rating should be an 8 or a 9 it has some acting flaws <UNK> especially the script wanders around sometimes however what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times the czech jan <UNK> directing two of the greatest actors of all time the beloved larger than life zero mostel and the sublime <UNK> <UNK> in an acting poetic moral tour de force a pair made in heaven it's true that this movie little flaws apart does not <UNK> to the average audiences but those interested in watching an excellent while again not beyond criticism movie of the <UNK> director who gave us the shop on the main street the best movie ever about holocaust should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that american beauty is better than the angel <UNK> br br it isn't
<START> i didn't even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing blade <UNK> i was messing around on the <UNK> board when i saw some user mention how the wes craven series is a lot better then the <UNK> that's blade so i did my quick research checked the scores on imdb <UNK> for dracula <UNK> and somewhere along the search i found out that this is a sequel to dracula 2000 i also noticed that within the wes craven dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big <UNK> to the scores i was seeing br br now let's take a quick personal <UNK> here i remember seeing dracula 2000 and i remember not liking it at all and then seeing the scores of dracula <UNK> just <UNK> my expectations even more but then again i'm the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself any movie so that i can form my own opinion br br a couple of things i went in knowing when i started watching this movie was that it's low budget so because of that i'm going to have to ignore a lot of the v fx and just figure it's going to <UNK> by story acting i was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie jason london roy <UNK> jason scott lee br br oh <UNK> this movie was cheesy but cheesy can be entertaining at least i found it pretty <UNK> laughable the bad audio <UNK> from the re recording of dialogue in a few scenes the stupidity of the characters in this movie sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things luke even had a book on it but did it prevent them from wanting to <UNK> get <UNK> nope this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a <UNK> on br br i also must've <UNK> at some point because i'm not sure how <UNK> got clothes on his body especially since he's big wild and angry i figure if i was in that situation i wouldn't want to be the one dressing him br br so the movie ends like any middle movie of a <UNK> it doesn't instead it's a <UNK> <UNK> where i now get to wait for the 3rd installment <UNK> oh the entertainment value of cheesy movies
<START> i have one word to <UNK> this movie wow i saw darius goes west at the <UNK> film festival people in the theater were <UNK> this movie shows the <UNK> that darius <UNK> with muscular <UNK> the movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie i was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy some people in this world are less <UNK> then us and sometimes we should give them a had and help them to the very end i would give them ten stars they gave darius a had when they weren't asked to they <UNK> do it for the money they did it for a friend in need darius the world should know darius went west
<START> an excellent period murder melodrama with fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive <UNK> type in a role that reportedly olivia <UNK> turned down that's fine because fontaine is wonderful scripted by charles bennett who had written for hitchcock in the thirties and also later penned the excellent script for the classic british horror film night of the demon the opening scene where <UNK> visits a sinister fortune <UNK> played by the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of james whale fame is a tour de force and the film maintains interest throughout the numerous sinister <UNK> i hope to see this film on dvd someday but despair of that ever happening because it seems to be an <UNK> obscure film fortunately i got to see it on <UNK> some seven or eight years ago but have not seen since catch it if you can
<START> <UNK> that martin <UNK> king's inspirational spirit <UNK> not just in american civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere danish <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this belief to a 1969 danish middle school more specifically it works its way into the <UNK> of a young boy named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> against his <UNK> rigid and <UNK> abusive <UNK> <UNK> bent <UNK> adapted from a true story the performances are executed with certain <UNK> and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving a battle of <UNK> between a 13 year old and a demented <UNK> gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood <UNK> despite keeping it <UNK> cynical in the same vein as a dead <UNK> society more than a <UNK> it <UNK> a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off <UNK> as a young boy becoming a young man manages to raise the film into a rousing family film with its nose right on the money
<START> sergio martino has impressed me recently with his giallo classics 'the strange vice of mrs <UNK> and the <UNK> titled <UNK> vice is a locked room and only i have the <UNK> but even so i wasn't expecting too much from this film the case of the <UNK> tail doesn't get mentioned as much as the aforementioned titles when it comes to classic giallo discussion but i don't know why because this is at least as good as those two <UNK> <UNK> may be the <UNK> of giallo but with the five films that he made sergio martino surely isn't too far behind in some ways he even surpasses the master all of <UNK> films were released prior to the jewel in <UNK> crown the magnificent <UNK> <UNK> so back in the early seventies martino was the king the plot here follows the idea of murder for profit and follows the insurance <UNK> of a wealthy man his wife <UNK> 1 million and it isn't long before there's people out for her blood when she turns up dead shortly thereafter an insurance investigator and a <UNK> attractive young journalist follow up the case br br the case of the <UNK> tail may not benefit from the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> but it does have two of <UNK> <UNK> on board most famous is george hilton who worked with <UNK> on the strange vice of mrs <UNK> and all the colors of the dark along with a number of other <UNK> hilton has a great screen presence and every time i see him in an italian thriller it becomes obvious why he is repeatedly cast the beautiful anita <UNK> who will be remembered from your vice is a locked room stars alongside hilton and excellently provides the classic giallo female lead sergio martino does a good job in the director's chair once again with several beautiful scenes the best of which taking place in a room <UNK> with green lighting the score by bruno <UNK> <UNK> excellently sets the mood but it is the script that once again is the driving force behind <UNK> success <UNK> <UNK> the writer for <UNK> other four giallo has put together a script that is thrilling while staying away from the common giallo <UNK> of not making sense thus <UNK> this film from the rest of the illogical genre the case of the <UNK> tail is a quality giallo film and yet another success for the great sergio martino if you like giallo you'll love this
<START> elizabeth ward <UNK> who will probably only be remembered as one of bill <UNK> bimbo <UNK> they have <UNK> for that now is probably the weakest element of this show it really continues the tired formula of the <UNK> series the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met but there is some conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence br br then you have the character of nick wolf basically your typical <UNK> 90's hero with the typical sexual tension storyline seriously why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex this was a joint canadian french production so half the series takes place in <UNK> imitating new york and the other half is in paris just like <UNK> did
<START> lauren bacall and charles boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film br br there is a good story here about the <UNK> trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war unfortunately this part of the story is not <UNK> instead we deal with a supposedly <UNK> boyer by the way bacall is as british as <UNK> <UNK> br br the real acting kudos goes to veteran oscar winner <UNK> <UNK> as was the case with her memorable <UNK> in the 1943 oscar winner for whom the bell <UNK> <UNK> again plays a spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double crossing counter spy for the pro franco group she is quite a vicious character here especially when she throws a 14 year old child out the window she believed that boyer had given the child important material to hide
<START> this movie is just plain dumb br br from the casting of ralph <UNK> as mike hammer to the <UNK> climax the film is an exercise in wooden predictability br br mike hammer is one of detective <UNK> true <UNK> unlike <UNK> and spade who put pieces together to solve the mystery hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth this film turns hammer into a <UNK> by surrounding him with bad guys who are well too dumb to get away with anything one is so poorly drawn that he <UNK> to a popcorn attack br br other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book <UNK> dance at the <UNK> for instance or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back and the continuity breaks are shameful <UNK> <UNK> is running down the <UNK> of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot the worst break however <UNK> the popcorn attack the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy br br to be fair there were some interesting camera angles and lighting and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10
<START> how can you take her hard living <UNK> violent bounty hunter story serious with that accent it's absurd apart from that the visual style of the <UNK> is nauseating and <UNK> the plot is a shallow boring confused gangster movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing the film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in <UNK> flashback mostly out of sequence seemingly just to keep you nice and confused the film ever shows you things that don't really happen and then later says that didn't really happen this happened see the apparent killing of the fake <UNK> <UNK> what have we seen the first wrong sequence of events for then br br terrible choice in casting a convoluted messy plot and a headache inducing directorial style 1 5
<START> i cannot stop saying how much i loved this movie this movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies i have ever seen the movie follows the exploits of a rap group <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with hats it goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group after it's tragic break up following the group is documentary maker nina <UNK> br br the movie is on a <UNK> budget but it does not seem to matter this is a very well made well produced film and the performances by all of these actors and actresses are excellent the main strength of this movie is the writing there are so many brilliant lines and <UNK> on rap in this movie it is unreal br br spoiler br br there are <UNK> on actual <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> vanilla <UNK> ice cold tone <UNK> <UNK> taste and songs <UNK> juice grab your dick etc rusty <UNK> has made an excellent film in the movie he plays <UNK> ice cold the movie does not quit it is funny from the beginning to the end br br the movie works so well because it becomes outlandish on occasion but it strikes that line where it is funny without going too far out there listening to the three leads try to talk some kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie like tone <UNK> telling a record producer <UNK> you take the bus you get <UNK> and the producer <UNK> <UNK> deep ' br br the group portraying n w h has some sort of natural chemistry to them they work so well together and they manage to pull this movie of to where there is not a week moment in the film what really makes this movie so good is how true to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is many rap groups had problems with violence with censors and like <UNK> the group only became popular when the establishment began to make a big deal out of the controversial lyrics br br i like this movie because it is offensive there is something here to offend everyone in a good natured way the movie has a <UNK> on a good number of people too outside of rap the funniest being of spike lee where they came up with this dialogue i cannot imagine the movie has line after line that will have you rolling on the floor as i said before the writing is just excellent br br i am not surprised that this movie met such limited release it is an intelligent controversial and even thought provoking film this is too much for mainstream despite the fact it is hilarious and nearly flawless in it's production there are no major stars but a lot of familiar faces including marc lawrence who plays tone <UNK> watch this movie at the very least you will definitely have an opinion of it
<START> let me start by saying that i totally agree with the basic <UNK> of the film that there probably was no historical jesus and christianity is a <UNK> with that said this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that <UNK> it makes good arguments the gap between <UNK> <UNK> life and the writing of the <UNK> filled only by the <UNK> of paul who doesn't indicate a historical jesus and then utterly fails to convincingly argue them it makes broad statements without presenting the evidence the statements are based on and it <UNK> ignores counter arguments presented by christian <UNK> the intellectual <UNK> emotional manipulation and lack of serious argument are obvious and stunning the only christians we hear from in the film are the head of the <UNK> old school who comes off like a reasonable rational person attempting to deal with a <UNK> with a chip on his shoulder and various christians encountered apparently at random in a parking lot i'm sorry but revealing that average christians don't know much about their religion isn't exactly <UNK> evidence of <UNK> <UNK> you may as well claim that jay leno has <UNK> the existence of michael dukakis on his jay walking segment the interviews with experts can be interesting but the film is filled with too much of let's be honest the filmmaker just being <UNK> within the first five minutes the film has already <UNK> jerry <UNK> with charles <UNK> and the writers of the left behind series with the branch <UNK> and by the end the film becomes so self centered that there's no rational argument left just an angry former christian <UNK> out at the people and places he blames for his messed up childhood <UNK> maybe that movie could've been interesting but it's misplaced in a documentary about the <UNK> of jesus and it's so self <UNK> as to <UNK> any sympathy this is a michael moore film without the humor or the film making <UNK> combined with a richard <UNK> book without the wit or the intellectual <UNK> skip it
<START> come <UNK> appears to <UNK> a lot of opinions among the <UNK> to this forum granted it's a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that promise into an <UNK> view at a young man's soul the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended it is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that in the end will leave mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things don't go according to what he hoped the relationship would be br br if you haven't seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading br br <UNK> <UNK> the director of the film has told his story from <UNK> viewpoint most viewers appear to be <UNK> by the different times within the film but there are hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect the story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film this is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life together br br first of all cedric the handsome young local <UNK> mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him mathieu feels the attraction for cedric too we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells <UNK> family how he feels school is not for him on the other hand mathieu who wants to be an architect finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch as mathieu reading from the guide book wants <UNK> attention br br when mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career she also points out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true mathieu appears to have learned his lesson the hard way he goes on to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own life we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul br br the ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is a moment in the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him <UNK> glasses and looking <UNK> to pierre the young man who <UNK> the bar that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house appears to be hard to imagine yet we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre the last scene at the beach when pierre and mathieu are seen <UNK> in the sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearby br br <UNK> <UNK> makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level mathieu has suffered a lot first with the <UNK> of his parents then with his depressed mother and with losing cedric <UNK> <UNK> who has been seen on other important french films is equally good as the shallow cedric br br while come <UNK> will <UNK> opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care <UNK> <UNK> gives to the story
<START> dick <UNK> and ian la <UNK> have a solid hit rate as far as their tv work is concerned however their film work has been much more <UNK> <UNK> the bank job was fine the previous year's across the universe decidedly weak for instance br br still crazy fortunately is a solid success it has a great story excellent performances a lot of humour fabulous music and above everything else real heart br br i <UNK> moments and this film has one of them just when everything is going <UNK> shaped at the festival reunion performance br br hugely enjoyable
<START> le grand voyage is a gentle miracle of a film a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer director <UNK> <UNK> who allows the natural scenery of this <UNK> <UNK> story and the sophisticated acting of the stars nicolas <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to carry the emotional impact of the film <UNK> vision is very <UNK> enhanced by the cinematography of <UNK> <UNK> a sensitive mixture of <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and tightly photographed <UNK> between characters and the musical score by <UNK> <UNK> who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film <UNK> br br <UNK> nicolas <UNK> lives with his muslim family in southern france a young student with a western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his <UNK> his elderly father <UNK> <UNK> has decided his time has come to make his <UNK> to <UNK> and being unable to drive <UNK> the reluctant <UNK> to <UNK> his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious <UNK> the two set out in a fragile <UNK> to travel through france into italy and on through <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and turkey to <UNK> <UNK> along the trip <UNK> <UNK> with his father to visit some of the interesting sights but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and <UNK> is <UNK> left to struggle with his father's demands on their <UNK> they encounter an old woman <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by <UNK> a turkish man <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who promises to guide the father son duo but instead brings about a <UNK> by getting <UNK> drunk in a bar and disappearing and countless border <UNK> guards and <UNK> agents who <UNK> their progress for various reasons tensions between father and son <UNK> <UNK> cannot understand the importance of this <UNK> so <UNK> with trials and <UNK> and the father cannot comprehend <UNK> <UNK> to the father's religious beliefs and needs at last they reach <UNK> where they are surrounded by <UNK> of <UNK> from all around the world and the sensation of <UNK> significance is overwhelming to <UNK> the manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning it has taken a religious <UNK> to <UNK> the gap between youth and old age between son and father and between <UNK> and acceptance of religious values br br the visual impact of this film is extraordinary all the more so because it feels as though the camera just <UNK> to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects nicolas <UNK> is a superb actor be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'the <UNK> <UNK> and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film another fine film from the film movement this is a tender story brilliantly told highly recommended br br grady <UNK>
<START> this film is easily one of the worst ones i have ever seen and i don't mean that in a good way we wanted to see a crappy horror thriller so we picked the one that seemed to be the <UNK> in the store for once the film was everything we'd expected and more or should i say less br br the actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera the so called special effects are created by putting red see through plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats and the script don't even get me started on the script and just when you thought it couldn't get any worse it turns out that the first part of the film was oscar material compared to the ending br br take it from me this film is hilarious if you're into crappy horror films but if you want a good film keep on looking this is not for you
<START> what can you possibly say about a show of this <UNK> the sopranos has literally <UNK> television as we know it it has broken all rules and set new standards for television excellence everything is flawless the writing directing and for me most of all the acting watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are not real the acting tricks you into thinking there is a real tony soprano or any character this show is also very versatile some people don't watch the show because it's violent it's not all about the violence it's about business family and many deeper things that all depend on what you as a fan see for me i don't like when people refer to the show a show about the mafia for me it's a show about family a family who through generations happen to be apart of the mob overall this is a masterpiece of a show this is what television should be right here complex characters from stunning acting magnificent story lines from brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together a show that <UNK> excellence and <UNK> to be different
<START> the story idea behind the lost missile isn't bad at all but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the <UNK> of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub par level br br the film begins with a missile heading towards the earth in a panic because it's about to strike the earth the <UNK> manage to <UNK> the object this isn't necessarily good however as this seemingly <UNK> craft has a <UNK> trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low <UNK> over the planet in other words with each pass it makes a <UNK> of death follows one that could potentially kill us all so it's up to the good scientists of the us led by a very young and hardly recognizable robert <UNK> to <UNK> and plan to save us and especially save new york that is in its immediate flight path unfortunately they aren't able to save <UNK> i've never been there so i can't say whether or not this is a big loss but thanks to good old american know how they are able to eventually destroy this <UNK> of destruction br br so as you can see the story idea isn't bad and rather original but so many old clips of fighter planes and guys <UNK> radar <UNK> gets a bit old and it seemed like padding overall a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like all others see it at your own risk
<START> i <UNK> this short on a dvd of best new zealand shorts all great but the french doors was amazing it starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen just as you relax into the hum drum of home <UNK> the most <UNK> thing happens br br <UNK> i wanted to stop watching but i was glued br br the films <UNK> into the primal fear of the dark and with little if not any special effects it chills you right to the bone a simple yet brilliant concept opened up all those memories of when i was young and <UNK> up the most <UNK> but spooky situations br br the film makers visual style are bang on and the lead character takes you convincingly through the story it is a quality short that i haven't seen in quite some time br br the french doors has all the <UNK> of a great feature alas it finishes after ten minutes or so never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more br br loved it and well done and thanks for the ride these new <UNK> are really turning out the talent br br a new fan
<START> this 2004 oscar <UNK> is a very short b w film in spanish a young woman goes into a <UNK> gets a coffee and notices a couple of musicians standing <UNK> with their <UNK> all the <UNK> are <UNK> like <UNK> one guy however is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at 7 35 in the morning there is one surprising moment after another until the end which is quite well surprising the people the place everything looks quite ordinary and like the musical piece <UNK> the thing keeps building until the climax with its structure theme movement and wit it is an 8 minute masterpiece
<START> 5 minutes into this movie i was <UNK> shaking and <UNK> in pain and not in the good way the story is about a <UNK> of idiotic children making prank phone calls to a psycho which is always a good idea turns out <UNK> don't like prank phone calls because in 2 minutes time he's at their door killing poor williams mom and dad well skip ahead 15 years and guess what still prank phone calling people yep you would of thought that a horrible murder would of <UNK> them from doing that ever again but no so after about two hours later and way too many scream <UNK> i realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a severe urge to take my own life this piece of crap isn't even worth laughing at the shoddy production the acting or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> career i love crappy horror movies but this is the most unsatisfying piece i've ever seen just don't
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> give an outstanding performance in this movie along with <UNK> although it is at first thought to be only about love it really goes down deeper than that the beauty of nature captures this movie placing among one of the best i have ever seen the horse scenes are absolutely fantastic any horse lovers out there will love this movie br br
<START> <UNK> <UNK> play adapted by <UNK> <UNK> with help from <UNK> becomes a curious project to come out of gritty warner bros paul lukas <UNK> his broadway role and winning the best actor oscar plays an anti nazi german underground leader fighting the <UNK> dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding <UNK> in the states via the mexico border they settle in washington with the wife's wealthy mother and brother though a <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> is immediately suspicious of the <UNK> and spends an awful lot of time down at the german <UNK> playing poker it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus and when we realize what the heart of the material is the wise honest direct <UNK> teaching the clueless head in the sand americans how the world has suddenly changed it seems a little <UNK> the viewer is quite literally put in the <UNK> place being <UNK> to lukas has several speeches in the third act which undoubtedly won him the academy award yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit enter and exit as his <UNK> bette davis <UNK> like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage but the role doesn't allow her much color their children all with <UNK> accents are alternately humorous and annoying and <UNK> fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put upon wife and the disgruntled <UNK> she brings to the part seems entirely wrong the intent here was to <UNK> <UNK> show us just because a wwii era man may be german that doesn't make him a nazi <UNK> we get that in the first few minutes the rest of this <UNK> <UNK> movie is made up of exposition <UNK> confrontation and ultimately compassion it should be a <UNK> mix but instead it's rather dry eyed and <UNK> from
<START> a stale <UNK> in the army saga which half <UNK> attempts to be both surreal the foreign subtitles and vulgar the <UNK> gags but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor none of them followed very successfully barbara bach the bond girl from the spy who loved me has only two or three brief scenes what a waste 1 2
<START> oliver hardy <UNK> with a <UNK> and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see <UNK> new wife and baby the problem is they don't exist ollie apparently made them up so it's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family br br this isn't a particularly unique story idea as i've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot the best of these was bobby <UNK> don't kid me it is much better than one too many probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick now i am not against physical comedy but in some slapstick films people starting shooting guns wildly kick and <UNK> each other etc with little <UNK> sadly at the end of one too many that's exactly what they do none of it makes sense and it was as if they'd just run out of story ideas br br overall not exactly a <UNK> in entertainment there's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself
<START> almost too well done john carpenter's vampires was entertaining a solid piece of popcorn entertainment with a budget small enough not to be <UNK> by special effects and obviously aiming on the from <UNK> till dawn audience vampires los <UNK> tries the same starting with a rock star jon bon <UNK> playing one of the main characters but does that almost too well i haven't seen jon bon <UNK> in any other movie so i am not able to compare his acting in vampires los <UNK> to his other roles but i was really <UNK> of his good performance after the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing <UNK> my life or something but kill vampires showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done this means a lot because a part of the audience also me was probably thinking just because he's a <UNK> of course bon <UNK> is not james woods but to be honest it could have been much worse and in my opinion bon <UNK> did a very good performance the <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> is not the leather dressed killer machine of a vampire leader we met in part 1 or in similar way in ghosts of mars <UNK> plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy moving as <UNK> as a cat attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin light almost transparent very erotic cloth and even the <UNK> effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made it really takes some beating but the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action <UNK> into a sensitive <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> you can almost see the director's temptation to create a movie with a very personal note and different to the original this is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point the audience celebrating the fun bloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure fun bloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed make no mistake vampires los <UNK> is a fun bloodbath but it's just not all the time this kind of movie just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the <UNK> tries to seduce <UNK> in the ruins the bar massacre is what you expect from american popcorn entertainment the <UNK> <UNK> in the ruins scene is almost european like cinema the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between <UNK> and the <UNK> but refuses answers at the same time because it would had slow down the action showed the audience a <UNK> with a human past a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just <UNK> anybody and that's the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not and also is the from <UNK> till dawn audience really going to like this i'm not sure about that nevertheless tommy lee wallace did really a great job vampires los <UNK> is surprisingly good but i also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie wallace is sometimes almost too creative too <UNK> like he's keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience in my opinion <UNK> talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time vampires los <UNK> is almost too well done i give it 7 of 10
<START> oh my goodness this was a real big mess that just couldn't help itself jeffrey jon <UNK> is a <UNK> year old man still living with his mum diane keaton and not planning on going anywhere until his mother meets a rich businessman named <UNK> jeff daniels who she may be getting married to br br it would have been an ok movie if <UNK> didn't play his jeffrey so annoying from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse in the end we are supposed to like him but there was no reason to as he hadn't changed from the selfish <UNK> that he was at the beginning of the movie br br keaton doesn't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after <UNK> because i said so not to mention the shocking chemistry between <UNK> and keaton and where supposed to believe that their mother and son the only saving grace is jeff daniels and anna <UNK> although they don't look very interested either apart from a few little smiles this film really doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at if your in the mood for a recent diane keaton flick watch mad money or <UNK> which are a lot better than this abysmal effort
<START> i only wish that return of the jedi have been directed by somebody else i mean there is far too much ewoks scenes completely unnecessary besides this time our heroes look like different people princess leia no longer fights with solo luke looks boring darth vader is not as evil as before and <UNK> just dies br br but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it br br some spoilers 1 <UNK> the <UNK> 2 the <UNK> <UNK> attack sequence 3 the emperor now that's evil 4 the <UNK> chase at the <UNK> forest 5 the last battle 6 the dark side seduction scene 7 the return of <UNK> to the good side of the force 8 and the last celebration br br some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes if some scenes would have been cut and another director was hired this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 but still is extraordinary 9 out of 10
<START> this is a well made informative film in the vein of <UNK> <UNK> the problem is <UNK> already did this piece and managed to bring l paul <UNK> in to tell his side of the story more <UNK> is the fact that the director of the film charles <UNK> a former think tank <UNK> was a war <UNK> until the <UNK> went south what did he think would happen br br the invasion of <UNK> went really well too until it was messed up by those <UNK> nazis and that is what this film feels like an <UNK> for <UNK> rather than a <UNK> of the act of war itself br br <UNK> seems to suggest that the war could have been run better as if any war can be better
<START> when you are in a gloomy or depressed mood go watch this film it shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting and it is very <UNK> in particular from a feminist and a <UNK> perspective br br when you know both the turkish language and either the danish or the german language go watch the film in any case half of the dialog is danish in the original <UNK> to german in the translated version the other half turkish subtitled in danish or german respectively when i watched it in <UNK> germany the reaction of the turkish speaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the turkish dialog which <UNK> mostly escaped me being only <UNK> rendered in the subtitles still the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the turkish br br <UNK> the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and <UNK> on first sight there is lots of <UNK> movement fast as lightning making it a quick an <UNK> film in particular even though this is a kung fu movie watch out for the running scenes beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions but there are quite a few very slow emotionally intense scenes too and above all the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age still there is some movement in the characters to closely watch the villain omar whose part and acting i liked very much br br the contrast of speed and <UNK> nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity shown at once in the same characters at the same time
<START> robin williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos but comes off a bit shrill donald <UNK> is too one note as his father in law jeff bridges is excellent though as the <UNK> and holly palance and pamela reed are marvelous carrying the film through most of its rough spots it fills time nicely but is little more than that
<START> unfortunately <UNK> came out about the same time as the <UNK> explosion which really put a <UNK> on when to bring it out or even if they should bring it out i'm glad they did i first watched <UNK> at a drive in movie which really enhanced the viewing a lot br br while i had heard of <UNK> thompson and tom <UNK> i had never heard of the others in the movie so it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting and acting real good of course kate <UNK> was excellent too br br i especially liked the scenes where those kids were being shown how to act as a team the scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for the actual launch of a <UNK> is of course old news to us however this one was different br br all in all this is one of my most <UNK> films <UNK> maybe but it was fantastic for a space nut like me after probably renting it for 30 40 times i finally found it available in a certain store and bought it now if it only comes out on dvd i will probably have it forever this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me
<START> with this movie being the only dirty harry movie which clint eastwood not only stars but produces and directs as well you know it's got to be good although some say that the <UNK> is the best out of the series i completely disagree in my opinion apart from the original dirty harry sudden impact and <UNK> force are the only two worthy of being in the series although the <UNK> is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do this film captures all the excitement that makes a clint eastwood film good and it's got the quotes that make a dirty harry film good in <UNK> harry it's well do ya punk in <UNK> force a man's got to know his limitations and in this it's go ahead make my day also in this film it's nice to see a change of scenery as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old san <UNK> streets in the other films in the series with great acting by clint eastwood and co star sandra locke and good directing by clint this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever
<START> being a fan of andy <UNK> art for a while now and <UNK> some of his books i had some expectations of what i would see what i got was something completely satisfying and quite a bit more than i expected being an artist myself i work in clay finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is <UNK> and it is something andy goldsworthy has <UNK> following him over the course of a year the director captures the spontaneous energy skill and devotion to the artists connection with nature with <UNK> inspiring flair the music set to the film is <UNK> and <UNK> if you are an artist in need of inspiration or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience then see this movie i for one am glad to know that andy is somewhere out there creating dancing wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful
<START> i like a lot of the actors actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a <UNK> the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby <UNK> in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la <UNK> and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to <UNK> rock music the soundtrack will feature bands like <UNK> n w a public enemy <UNK> etc the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i <UNK> you nbc will do it see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
<START> this movie was absolute torture first of all it's a <UNK> 4 hours long true the <UNK> war may have had several points that were captured and fought for but every single one of those battles need not have been shown so maybe this is a documentary not a commercial film as advertised sure didn't seem like it as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws the battle sequences were so poorly executed i am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in border each battle was the exact same as the previous it was so predictable this might be a spoiler the whole army <UNK> <UNK> five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each they also use the same <UNK> every time one of the lead actors is shot someone yells for a <UNK> the actor says no don't get a <UNK> that will take 6 men from the <UNK> and then an actor dies that exact same thing happens over and over and over again oh and the songs are so bad and so long the cast of the movie is too big for its own good despite such a long movie none of the characters were well developed the actresses had the most <UNK> roles they all are dressed and portrayed to be the same two of them were <UNK> <UNK> it was so comical they moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their <UNK> together br br the list just goes on and on i know i'm still forgetting something anyways i think i have <UNK> the film enough that you get the picture
<START> i know that you've already entered this in film festivals or at least i think you have i may just be making that up but i think this should get best animated short film in every one bravo i can't wait for the full film i realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations but hear it now and accept it as the truth kudos my friend okay now i'm just trying to get ten lines of text though i still mean it and here comes yet another shoe and i cannot stop here yet this is extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing better to do in fact i'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another <UNK> jason steele marathon i do have a lot of those br br r
<START> the only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line <UNK> by an agent attempting to <UNK> the man eating tomatoes by dressing in a <UNK> costume can somebody please pass the <UNK> i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a <UNK> it works better than an <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> five years after the original <UNK> another inferior horror sequel is penned by george a romero and stephen king <UNK> 2 this time there are only three stories instead of five none of the three stories is really original or distinguished either the first story is a horror <UNK> formulaic story about a wooden indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners the effects are really neat in this story but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough george kennedy and dorothy <UNK> play the elderly store owners the second story the raft is a stephen king story it's about four teenagers that <UNK> spend the day on a wooden <UNK> in the middle of an isolated lake soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a <UNK> blob does each of them in for no apparent reason however instead of being suspenseful the kids are <UNK> with bad dialog and dopey headed behavior <UNK> us from really caring about what happens next there is also some unintentional humor in this segment the third and final story is the <UNK> <UNK> which is actually a <UNK> re adapted for <UNK> 2 the original story by lucille <UNK> was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film then it was adapted for a famous twilight zone episode featuring <UNK> stevens the <UNK> <UNK> works the best out of these three offerings but it's not without its problems either lois <UNK> plays a cheating <UNK> who ends up running over a <UNK> <UNK> or so she thinks however we don't know whether to sympathize with her or <UNK> her as in many average stories of this type the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns the wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place tom <UNK> appears as the creep in this installment the good thing is there haven't been any more sequels 1 2 of 4 stars
<START> sure it had some of the <UNK> of a good film the storyline is good if a bit bland and the acting was good enough though i didn't understand why olivia <UNK> had such a <UNK> australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the us my biggest problem however was with the wardrobe i know as rule the average american is considered a <UNK> <UNK> by any self <UNK> european but this was beyond that <UNK> colour <UNK> were positively ghastly and that <UNK> sack like sad excuse for a coat she wore throughout the film made me break out in <UNK> i suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible how many school teachers walk around in <UNK> but simple doesn't mean an absolute lack of taste a word to the wise
<START> this is one of those movies that i've seen so many times that i can quote most of it some of the lines in this movie are just <UNK> i particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the <UNK> br br i don't know how many times i have seen this sequence but it's funny every time from the moment arthur gets to <UNK> <UNK> place to the bit with the <UNK> you pretty much laugh the whole time i remember watching the out takes regarding the bit with the <UNK> it went down just like i'd imagined it'd be like they were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it br br the late sir john gielgud was a wonderful addition to this his demeanor his one liners and the way he handled arthur were all equally hilarious it's always a funny moment when he <UNK> him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little i laugh every time i listen to the i'm going to have a bath and the lines that follow
<START> the summer of 1979 when this flick was a <UNK> on that new movie medium called hbo was gas line summer iranian hostage crisis summer a change of mood was about to end low budget loner on a mission car films although <UNK> the <UNK> kept need for speed flicks going as live action <UNK> cartoons for a few more years <UNK> summer is as quirky as any earlier movie like <UNK> point or dirty mary crazy larry if lighter <UNK> than most just <UNK> high school <UNK> genius kenneth <UNK> <UNK> to vegas in pursuit of the car <UNK> ring that ripped off his shop class masterpiece a super <UNK> right hand drive <UNK> in the spiritual <UNK> of the i 15 desert see fear loathing in las vegas he gets into a <UNK> van yes this was the tail end of the van <UNK> too tricked out as a mobile <UNK> driven by sassy aspiring hooker vanessa <UNK> on her way to sin city to make her well whatever it is ambitious <UNK> make vanessa get it shy innocent kenneth is in way over his head in vegas with only his all american resolve his new friend to help him although the hard edged young call girl is predictably less world wise than she first seems why in the i am woman age vanessa invested her talents money future in the world's oldest but least <UNK> profession over say college or even <UNK> can be explained by young men who'd like to think that all women at least consider the <UNK> of that career path remember the target audience right <UNK> is a good choice for the <UNK> kenneth the car doesn't even belong to him personally but to his school who won't be <UNK> from his goal by violence money or even love until he finds out why the car was really stolen <UNK> acts with style energy but vanessa is too incredible for any but the most <UNK> <UNK> machine to buy into the bad guys are made surprisingly human especially by the always fine <UNK> james but there's not much action this isn't the kind of movie that can be carried by dialog plot twists or heavy themes you could always reach up turn the tv <UNK> plug in your <UNK> <UNK> the similar but <UNK> chris mitchum vehicle <UNK> which appeared at about the same time featured <UNK> acting but more skin speed mayhem the best features of each film might have produced a <UNK> movie worth remembering thus the <UNK> am was left to rule the box office muscle car <UNK> another forgotten car movie brought back from the dead by speed <UNK> fine weekend series lost drive in
<START> <UNK> <UNK> made his last animated short an <UNK> of <UNK> which caused him trouble in his native <UNK> the elements are few the <UNK> simple and his trademark <UNK> almost absent here allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable a man in his room <UNK> to <UNK> and to take care of his only plant but suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself the man refuses and he's <UNK> by the ominous <UNK> hand in these days where the impression of reality factor seems to be <UNK> from most animations that try to replace the real world it is refreshing to watch a film which makes its technique part of the enjoyment
<START> a light hearted comedy nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing anything you don't like be it a stack of bills a bad memory or even <UNK> can disappear at your wish they approached this movie very well and with an enjoyable starring duo there were only a few things i didn't like about nothing and they weren't even part of the main movie br br first the post credits scene and yes there is one good for a chuckle but what were they trying to accomplish with that i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing instead we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion and wasn't really necessary nor was it funny after the turtle <UNK> out of frame br br second the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd and like others have already said this it <UNK> a horror movie that never came oh well poor marketing i guess br br if you see this at your movie rental store take a look because nothing is a great movie to watch if you have a big screen though you might want to wear shades
<START> <UNK> <UNK> leo fulci takes a change of pace by making a trashy barely coherent sword and <UNK> fantasy movie instead of his usual trashy barely coherent horror br br a <UNK> orlando bloom type called <UNK> from some society vaguely resembling ancient <UNK> travels across the ocean to <UNK> territory on some vaguely defined quest to battle evil where he joins up with a animal loving hunter to battle the wolf man and mutant <UNK> of a <UNK> topless evil <UNK> <UNK> ensues the <UNK> is <UNK> the local <UNK> and wants the magic bow for herself she sends various <UNK> each <UNK> than the last after our heroes who win through in the end striking a blow for <UNK> <UNK> everywhere this movie contains a steady stream of wtf elements and moments br br for some reason the entire movie is shot in soft focus and the picture is further <UNK> by the constant presence of <UNK> on screen this may have been an attempt to create atmosphere or to hide how fake everything looks either way it failed there is no atmosphere unless it is one of <UNK> and mild <UNK> and there is no hiding how lame everything looks the wolf man <UNK> look like a poor man's <UNK> for some reason the director fell in love with shots of them <UNK> through the air in slow motion six million dollar man style toward our heroes when they attack there are probably about a dozen of these shots throughout the movie and it gets <UNK> every time the other <UNK> of the topless <UNK> other than the generic leather clad humans are some <UNK> white mutants who appear to be covered in <UNK> needless to say they are slow and <UNK> and when they speak sound like gay hispanic <UNK> <UNK> the fights are stilted and unconvincing and the special effects are <UNK> oh yeah the music is cheap <UNK> stuff that the makers of doctor who would have been embarrassed to have used br br <UNK> our <UNK> hero is bland and forgettable he also looks a complete <UNK> especially with his <UNK> revealing leather outfit and big hair and is clearly a moron sure he's a dynamite shot with his magical bow but he only takes about three or four <UNK> with him in his mission to battle this entire continent of evil needless to say he runs out of <UNK> within a few minutes and has to be saved by more traditional sword and <UNK> hero <UNK> when he meets <UNK> he <UNK> himself as the <UNK> loner type claiming he has no friends but no sooner can you say <UNK> <UNK> subtext they are <UNK> buddies <UNK> the misty hills together <UNK> promises to take <UNK> with him in return for bow related <UNK> <UNK> asks where he is going wherever my legs take me is his <UNK> good enough for <UNK> <UNK> is also animal lover and outrageous <UNK> he <UNK> his great love of and <UNK> toward animals <UNK> the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be <UNK> mean he says he would never hunt and kill an animal to feed himself but he will steal meat off other people who have hunted down animals he is also not above randomly killing innocent <UNK> by for no good reason not long after they meet he is testing out <UNK> bow and the movie cuts to some random <UNK> <UNK> his own business walking along and <UNK> shoots him dead there is no indication this poor soul did anything to deserve this and even <UNK> who supposedly <UNK> from a more moral and <UNK> society doesn't even raise an <UNK> br br the films <UNK> is quite unusual for the entire movie she is completely naked except from a g string and a golden mask that <UNK> her entire head it's like fulci included her to make the movies obligatory t a <UNK> but decided she was bit too much of a <UNK> at the last minute she spends a lot of time seemingly being <UNK> by her pet snakes and dreaming about being shot by a <UNK> bow wielding man who is dressed like <UNK> wow such symbolism later on in the movie she <UNK> out when she can't beat <UNK> and <UNK> and promises to make herself the sex slave of some ancient warrior dude if he kills them for her hardly the world's most scary villain and not really a step forward for women's rights i think he <UNK> the <UNK> creatures on our heroes and <UNK> <UNK> in a situation where there is no no one else around but <UNK> to fool was he really worthy <UNK> your self respect for <UNK> br br there are quite a few other wtf moments most of them come toward the end of the movie <UNK> <UNK> out i forget why possibly his <UNK> <UNK> got <UNK> but realizes the error of his ways and returns to aid <UNK> in fighting the forces of evil all of a sudden for no reason his bow can suddenly fire out multiple target seeking <UNK> of energy the <UNK> can also shoot through solid rock when necessary needless to say his makes short work of the <UNK> of bad guys who have captured <UNK> br br the climax is also rather nonsensical <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> remaining forces using the <UNK> targeted laser attack <UNK> he then is able to shoot <UNK> from a <UNK> away using its shoot through rock capacity she starts dying her mask is ripped of revealing a hideous muppet head she <UNK> around screaming and turns into a dog and wanders off with another dog <UNK> smiles roll credits br br strangely enough as far as these dodgy low budget sword and <UNK> movies this one is reasonably <UNK> and focused any one who has seen <UNK> of the lost kingdom can tell you how nonsensical and meandering these movies can truly be
<START> if you a <UNK> don't waste your time otherwise hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure i loved the stewart granger deborah kerr version i've seen it dozens of times but this film is every bit as good only different i won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film also it is a pleasure to see alison <UNK> again i'm a huge indiana jones fan patrick <UNK> is good as <UNK> and the supporting cast is superb i find the quality of the supporting cast one of the <UNK> of a hallmark production and this film was no exception the cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect if you are looking for entertainment you won't be disappointed
<START> <UNK> or <UNK> as george <UNK> stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq <UNK> kids to succeed technology the <UNK> <UNK> or worrying if they'll be next to end up on the streets br br but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the <UNK> you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what it's like to be homeless that is <UNK> <UNK> lesson br br mel brooks who directs who stars as <UNK> plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival <UNK> <UNK> to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the <UNK> if <UNK> succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the <UNK> on where <UNK> is thrown on the street with a <UNK> on his leg to <UNK> his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk he's given the <UNK> <UNK> by a <UNK> after it's written on his <UNK> where <UNK> meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly <UNK> ann warren an ex dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and <UNK> teddy wilson who are already used to the streets they're survivors <UNK> isn't he's not used to reaching mutual <UNK> like he once did when being rich where it's fight or flight kill or be killed br br while the love connection between molly and <UNK> wasn't necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel <UNK> <UNK> films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing <UNK> young frankenstein or <UNK> for the matter to show what it's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like <UNK> money br br or maybe this film will inspire you to help others
<START> words can hardly describe it so i'll be brief the thief of bagdad was my favorite movie as a child and it has never <UNK> to <UNK> or <UNK> me i loved this film from the first moment i saw it when i was a boy of six who had started reading the <UNK> nights i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of <UNK> battle with the giant spider and being instantly <UNK> br br rarely has so much beauty magic and wonder been captured on film <UNK> and john justin are superb as the dashing <UNK> conrad <UNK> is <UNK> delightful as the wicked villain <UNK> and rex <UNK> is a joy to watch as the <UNK> genie georges <UNK> photography is some of the best use of technicolor one of the three credited directors is michael powell a filmmaker who has been rightfully <UNK> by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films including a matter of life and death aka <UNK> to heaven and the red shoes he is one of the true masters of the camera right up there with david lean <UNK> kurosawa and orson welles br br as with all great works of art the beauty of the thief of bagdad lies in the detail every frame has its own magical charm the story never <UNK> and the characters and their actions are always involving here is a film that will never grow old
<START> 1 2 out of while i am not concerned with the fact that this is an english dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned it should be noted as it seems to <UNK> in many <UNK> native hearts however this was a movie as a child that i was a <UNK> admirer of keeping in mind now that it was made for children i rate it on a relative basis the story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow <UNK> and <UNK> back <UNK> forth for control with weapons such as <UNK> and other <UNK> as <UNK> hands and free time equal winter break lessons if i had children this definitely is a film i would try and get them interested in as the snow <UNK> <UNK> me when i was young and i think even children today would agree albeit with pixar and all the computer animation maybe i am out of date and just don't realize it in addition the movie's message is wonderfully <UNK> and a positive one at that for children and adults alike
<START> first of all i am a huge fan of madeleine <UNK> and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books a <UNK> in time this movie however ruined that excitement for me i am sorry but meg was described in the book as having <UNK> <UNK> and glasses and as being considered very <UNK> in the movie she has straight hair and no glasses and is the <UNK> type with a deep voice this is not how madeleine <UNK> <UNK> meg to be at all in fact meg was based on <UNK> character and depicted the way she felt when she was young this is just one major example how the book and movie are different so i would say if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine <UNK> and her <UNK> in time series i would suggest skipping this movie
<START> direction must be the problem here i recently heard john <UNK> speaking of working a skit for <UNK> towers he was supposed to attack his car with a branch the first branch was too flimsy and not funny the second branch was too stiff to be funny the third was just flimsy enough to be funny this sort of attention to detail is missing from corky <UNK> no matter how embarrassingly unfunny a comic bit was it wasn't fixed and wasn't left on the cutting room floor the one value i can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie which somehow escaped into distribution without being <UNK> br br i've <UNK> dozens of other reviews here the number of reviews <UNK> this absolute waste of time <UNK> my suspicion that some people are getting paid to promote titles i can't <UNK> how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than a 4 max i mean come on 5 is average i can't imagine anyone even those making money off of this rating it even as much as average br br this makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time and hey i actually like the three stooges and can even tolerate ed wood
<START> these <UNK> write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish br br i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror if i owned a video store i'd put it in the boring section this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your <UNK> br br this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary well i drive to work and back and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats almost every day and trust me it's not scary it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving even the little kid does it too round and round he goes and he never stops what's so scary about watching a little kid riding a <UNK> for an hour i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so too br br the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at <UNK> then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason that's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish
<START> i rate this 10 out of 10 why br br it offers insight into something i barely understand the surfers surf because it's all they want to do nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing nor is it a temporary thing it's a lifetime for these guys buried in the movie is a great history of surfing i have never <UNK> but i love surfing movies and have seen many none taught me what this movie did the movie was very well edited it <UNK> well the interviews were outstanding it's interesting from start to finish br br in summary it's about as good as a documentary as i have seen so i have to rate in terms of that so 10 10
<START> with few exceptions most of george bernard <UNK> plays have virtually disappeared from the theater these days too arch too talky appears to be the general verdict this bbc version of one of <UNK> funniest plays doesn't <UNK> that verdict it is certainly arch and talky but it is also wonderful and because of the quality of british theater it is perfectly cast with actors whom with the exception of helena bonham carter most of us have probably never heard of carter is splendid as the <UNK> girl who <UNK> the professional chocolate soldier <UNK> <UNK> and later falls in love with him one might <UNK> with the especially ridiculous interpretation of <UNK> patrick <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> officer who led the charge into the <UNK> lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong <UNK> for its machine guns however the role invites over acting and <UNK> was obviously told to over act the other players are letter perfect carter as the self <UNK> <UNK> aristocrat and <UNK> as the swiss soldier of fortune are at the <UNK> center of course and they are wonderful yes arms and the man comes across as a filmed play but you're unlikely ever to see a shaw film that doesn't <UNK> its origin the plots are generally clever however shaw is all about the dialog the action is minimal even in st joan and the sets are <UNK> enjoy this for what it is
<START> wow what a <UNK> the 30's is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine especially during the early <UNK> phase there were movies which are painfully static and dull like dracula with <UNK> lugosi and there were those that just don't give it a rest sometimes in a good way and other times not this is one of the films that don't stop for a minute and that is both a wonder and a pity lloyd bacon who also directed <UNK> street must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema for he filled this picture with it there <UNK> be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking it's completely crazy i was thinking the movie deserved a 5 or a 6 tops because the pacing was very poor since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn't know what was happening and what to think the characters seemed to just running to and <UNK> places talking about things which didn't interest me and probably no one else i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in <UNK> street ruby keeler and <UNK> street was a movie whose ending was the best part of it and you know what it happened the same thing with <UNK> parade the ending is absolutely incredible it has become hands down the most impressive musical i have ever seen the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are believe me something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth the numbers are flawless there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache
<START> ghosts that still walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesn't let go until the end especially when you see it as a child seeing the film as an adult you have to admit it isn't really all that scary but the story is very fascinating and contains <UNK> of great mysterious scenes especially the ones with the creepy mummy br br one of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new <UNK> the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother's secret is pretty frightening br br okay the acting in the film isn't all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring but overall ghosts that still walk is fun too bad only a few people saw this film this film really deserves better i just wanna say mr <UNK> you've done a good job and for all you hollywood producers out there if you want to remake a movie remake this one
<START> tom is listening to one of those old time radio <UNK> something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on tv however they didn't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment from comedies to music to scary stories from the radio br br tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the phantom he's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying such as hair standing on end icy chills race down her spine her heart beats in her throat etc jerry meanwhile is watching tom and laughing his butt off at his <UNK> cat antics br br we then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this <UNK> cartoon in which jerry <UNK> tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure if the cat asks for trouble that's one thing but when he's <UNK> own business and jerry is physically and in this case mentally <UNK> him i have a hard time rooting for the little guy br br these early t m efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed sometimes that one minute makes a difference it did here as this actually dragged for awhile it could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long that's usual for tom and <UNK> usually they are much faster paced
<START> as said before the visual effects are stunning they're breathtaking i personally use <UNK> and graphics like that are not easy at all but that's all this movie is not only is the plot confusing but the overall conflict is not clear for example in the first scene <UNK> and <UNK> are trying to run away from who knows what the conflict seems to be between man and nature here later when they enter the room of the <UNK> pit <UNK> explains that one step out of place and you're dead here there's a more precise conflict between the <UNK> man and nature as the movie progresses it's clear that a conflict exists between man and nature but suddenly a conflict exists between man and man when <UNK> out of nowhere murders <UNK> <UNK> immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a sick man he betrays us not only is this depressing but we don't care because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed it's not a story about someone through struggle <UNK> stronger it's depressing and has not point because there's no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does in my opinion the movie is severely underdeveloped in all aspects however the graphics are stunning but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy there's no truth no struggle and a bad surprise ending in conclusion an underdeveloped movie without a point but the graphics are good
<START> a lot of people hated this movie but that i blame on two facts 1 they want it to be too much like the first couple of american pie movies and 2 they are trying to take it too seriously br br this one i found was the best one out of all six and i absolutely love dwight the plot is predictable i'll say that but then what teen comedy isn't road trip dirty deeds etc etc they are all incredibly predictable but still <UNK> funny i say this is worth watching i love it i find it hilarious just don't watch it while comparing it to the first ones because it's nothing alike br br after watching naked mile and this one it became obvious that all the american pie movies were about and only about the <UNK> which is fine by me br br watch enjoy love <UNK>
<START> i would not consider myself as one of leonard <UNK> greatest fans he does however feature as an important poet musician in my literary musical <UNK> by far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear <UNK> <UNK> on his own life and career warming and humble br br unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert didn't <UNK> the nuances of <UNK> musical literary manner nick cave <UNK> <UNK> beth <UNK> were the exceptions even though leonard highly values <UNK> <UNK> interpretations of his songs br br what particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who leonard cohen is and how these musicians connect to him a lot is said in this respect but the viewer is not drawn into the person leonard cohen this failing is especially evident with the interviews with <UNK> and the edge they view leonard as a special icon but can't translate their exact value of leonard cohen the collaboration with <UNK> is a farce the entire live <UNK> looks like a rushed job and just as in the whole film only leonard cohen remains his part and can tell about his own part br br the entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school <UNK> project the use of effects such as echo slow motion or <UNK> images are ill placed some of the camera work is dismal part of the score hardly recalls any <UNK> i may have expected at times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film perhaps a reference to his once use of <UNK> br br some unintentional humor at some point leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre initially he can't recall the <UNK> name until eventually he says it was punk the <UNK> really picked up on his music the next scene in the film is a live cover of 'i can't <UNK> br br and i can't forget i can't forget i can't forget but i don't remember who
<START> if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to <UNK> into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that <UNK> into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england other days other times <UNK> into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with alfred <UNK> joan <UNK> polly walker <UNK> lawrence jim <UNK> miranda richardson and michael <UNK> in the major roles under the brush stroke direction of mike <UNK> these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a <UNK> subtle <UNK> eye reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too an artistic <UNK> on the importance of caring about those around us
<START> br br a friend of mine enjoys watching the worst films he can possibly find and i have a good laugh watching them with him br br i have told him if he puts this one on again i will be forced to give him a good kicking br br he knows i am serious br br
<START> i'm grateful for one thing and one thing only that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent <UNK> this programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed victoria beckham has become with <UNK> herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and <UNK> f <UNK> <UNK> br br a few years ago i used to really like <UNK> and <UNK> i still very much admire david's talent but i have no respect for him anymore how can you respect someone who has his wife's hand shoved up his <UNK> working him like a puppet br br it was clear the hand of victoria was all over <UNK> <UNK> departure from <UNK> united and now the same thing has happened at real <UNK> i hope beckham can live with the fact that although he may be <UNK> <UNK> of pounds he's sold his soul for the american buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from division one in england no <UNK> america but at baseball and basketball you rule football you don't br br anyway i <UNK> it's been years since i've seen such an over the top entirely false performance from <UNK> this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the rebecca <UNK> <UNK> when instead of throwing all the <UNK> p at david he deserved she desperately <UNK> onto his arm trying to save the million pound money <UNK> her marriage has become br br this whole <UNK> stunt was pathetic why can't she just go over there quietly support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down when did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to america should be <UNK> by this huge fan fare br br incidentally i saw the david beckham documentary last night at least he has <UNK> a <UNK> of grace and <UNK> two things his wife could do with learning br br one more thing victoria you complain about constantly being <UNK> by the <UNK> little hint stop <UNK> them off about your <UNK> you stupid woman br br good luck america
<START> as other reviewers have noted this is an <UNK> neglected depression era film directed by frank <UNK> two oscars and written by jo <UNK> leave her to heaven the <UNK> <UNK> etc it is a tough minded well structured and realized move about <UNK> of a new york city <UNK> they're <UNK> <UNK> and women forced into prostitution but they're a community of people both good and bad with <UNK> as complex as any <UNK> br br perhaps primary among this movie's many admirable qualities is the contrast between spencer <UNK> character bill and loretta <UNK> <UNK> he tough talking physically aggressive and evidently <UNK> but bill is not the character who gives this film its <UNK> sense of survival while he <UNK> <UNK> actually hangs tough if that term can be applied to a character so <UNK> her devotion to him is obvious and complete when she becomes pregnant she says she will raise it herself if he wants to leave or i'll even give up the kid if you'll only be happy such is the dignity of loretta <UNK> performance at age 20 as a quite simple character that she seems neither weak or <UNK> but rather a woman who <UNK> happiness when she finds it and wants nothing more
<START> this movie earned every one of the ten votes i gave it thank you guys for making a movie worth watching you showed the world you can still write direct produce and star in a black movie without the negative stereotypes the poetry was awesome as well hats off to the <UNK> and musicians br br i watched it last night as i fell in love with my darling all over again i will be adding it to my movie collection today and <UNK> it to my friends and family br br please continue to produce quality don't worry about the <UNK> br br thank you again and best wishes and <UNK> to you
<START> this was one of the most boring horror movies that i have ever seen a college kid has an <UNK> of nightmares involving <UNK> spirits at <UNK> trying to deliver a mix of nightmare on elm street and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video this movie is <UNK> full of bad acting and an <UNK> slow moving story although being such a bad and often laughable movie dig those <UNK> and the terrible dialog it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of mystery science theater 3000 don't be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the silver <UNK> award by the academy of <UNK> fiction <UNK> and horror or that <UNK> contributes to the soundtrack or that tony basil has a part in the film it is a giant disaster though one with a small cult following see the other imdb comments for this film
<START> lost probably the best t v series ever made the storyline is clever and when all your questions are answered watching one episode 100 more are raised if lost can carry on it's magnificent ways and not get too carried away then it will be <UNK> the best show ever the survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island a dangerous new world that poses unique <UNK> of its own after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting and <UNK> your answer every season so far has always been full of surprises your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what's gonna happen next each time very unexpected <UNK> happen and the story goes on wonderfully so far the series just sucks you in it's chilling and very <UNK> everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story lost is simply unbelievable amazing highly entertaining top notch t v at it's best how ever you want to put it br br lost <UNK> all other show's by a <UNK> and if your hating or <UNK> lost you don't know how to watch t v or watch drama lost simply doesn't disappoint you would think a series carrying on for so long can't keep getting better but it does it just <UNK> on flowing it's unlike anything you would ever think off every thing happens for a reason and that is truly shown in the series eventually you will reach a point were all the clues and everything that's happened or being done adds up you will feel and realise how the characters have changed and how and why everything is going on br br the 10 minutes of excitement you see something you didn't see coming something major has happened to character or on the island there's hope somewhere you see a major twist that can or will change everything you hear your <UNK> <UNK> you wonder what's gonna happen next your heart beating the 30 minutes of brilliance you see a flawless scenes tension building you hear wonderful music by michael <UNK> you see great flash backs impressive acting you see <UNK> chilling atmosphere which then <UNK> converted back into tension br br everyone has there show that they are addicted too that they can't get enough of that they admire every minute and can't wait for the next episode that they talk about 24 7 too me and many others it's this series lost once you start watching you won't get enough the creators did a flawless job lost is completely unique and original you won't see anything like it the clever idea of flashbacks and <UNK> and something major and different in every season sucks your thoughts would they ever make a series like lost something so interesting and something you will always remember it simply has stunned the world when it hit t v a new generation of dramatic sci fi a instant classic before it reached out to the viewers br br i'm sure you all heard of lost and it's 5 star reviews and your annoying friend that won't stop telling you about it so what's stopping you from watching br br every episode leads to something new and it just doesn't stop getting better and better you get more interested as it goes along you learn things that are on the island that you wouldn't even think off the characters start to become very likable and if your the critic type you would love to see lost in further detail things like how the relationship between characters develop and how they learn the ways to under look and take on challenges from the island all together it's a great drama and a flawless series i guess we just all hope that lost will not have a downfall in the episodes to come and go to far so if you don't watch lost read the comment from the top again and you should change your mind seeing is believing so until you start watching you will never know i strongly recommend this masterpiece of series lost start watching you have not seen nothing until you watch lost
<START> well i watched this last night and the one thing that didn't make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward there was no beating around the bush that this kid was the anti christ however the movie was just poorly written for example they never explained how they made the dentist incident an accident or at the end how the cop just miraculously ended up at the house in time to save the kid without the police even being called yet the death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all the kid they chose to play the anti christ was boring and they really could've picked a better kid just don't waste your time watching this
<START> this seemed an odd combination of <UNK> and i with a room with a view sometimes it worked other times it did not tragedy that they changed the name for the us release though keep the <UNK> flying is much better than the nothing title a merry war acting was okay script was okay overall it was a mediocre film
<START> this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie i've ever seen and that's saying a lot considering i've seen such <UNK> like demon of paradise <UNK> lane and bloody murder which is a close second however i love bad horror movies and as you can tell from my <UNK> this one really sticks out at times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick as for this film the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a <UNK> booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film the acting is nonexistent and most of the camera shot are of women's areas shrink wrapped in <UNK> the policeman was the most stone faced <UNK> actor i've ever seen the best worst part of this movie however has to be the murder weapon a giant safety pin what were they thinking who's the killer a disgruntled <UNK> employee i'd have to give this movie an overall zero but <UNK> if i didn't have a blast watching it
<START> i saw this movie the day it came out last year hilarious i thought well now it's on video and i saw it again i love this movie the things they do are sometimes dumb but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time the special effects are okay but the witty dialog will have you rolling i'm the kind of person that'll say i'm inspired by this movie so if you like dramas and other stuff avoid but for all others enjoy the acting is superb hank <UNK> is hands down the best he's neither a <UNK> nor a fruit followed by ben stiller uh don't correct me it <UNK> me and then william h macy delivering his best performance <UNK> <UNK> everybody has praised everyone from macy to <UNK> but i think <UNK> mitchell was pretty good as invisible boy two problems the most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between stiller and claire <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> hearing some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way but they're a blast <UNK> and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene <UNK> all it's hilarity is gone but <UNK> they switch and you're ready for more i swear after seeing this you will be tired from the explosive climax which i think was pretty cool the camera is pretty cool also moving at a furious pace with the actors also tom waits delivers an outstanding performance he has this kinda cool bad hero <UNK> to him and like someone else said the best parts are when the characters show some <UNK> to them captain amazing is pretty funny especially his speech to <UNK> about his perfect plan i was rolling and rush is pretty cool as <UNK> one <UNK> the funniest comedian ever eddie izzard is almost wasted but his heart is in the right place so all in all a wonderful movie i give it twenty stars and hope that someday everyone will see the brilliance in the film's best parody the six million dollar man one laughing right now as i think about it 20 10
<START> tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary <UNK> films at two hours it was quite long for a <UNK> silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a greatest hits performance with bits of mary the innocent mary the little devil mary the little mother mary the <UNK> mary the romantic heroine etc characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's <UNK> child for <UNK> and at one point our little mary is thought the <UNK> mother in question if the academy awards had been around in <UNK> no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been <UNK>
<START> enjoyed catching this film on very late late late tv and it kept my interest through out the entire picture this wonderful creepy yet mysterious looking english home with evil looking <UNK> and <UNK> furniture and rooms that make you wonder just why anyone would want to rent this home or even own it there are four 4 tales concerning this house and each resident of the home meets with all kinds of problems you will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the home and also the sweet singing of birds but don't let that fool you there is horror all over the place peter cushing black jack <UNK> gives a great performance as one of the person's living in the home and even christopher lee curse of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his little daughter chloe <UNK> jane reid make a wonderful exciting story together his daughter for some reason loves to read witchcraft books if you love creepy horrible and mysterious films with lots of surprises this is the film for you
<START> zombie nation 2004 r br br hey i was bored i looked in my <UNK> little box to find a movie to watch zombie nation hey i love zombie movies says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film i could've used that advice br br zombie nation is just like <UNK> 2 in that it's completely <UNK> it has little if anything depending on your point of view to do with zombies and takes place all within one city this film revolves around a crooked cop who acts as badly as possible he has to be trying to suck this much while he <UNK> women for trivial <UNK> and then kills them <UNK> he's a serial killer cop not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong serial killers enjoy killing they live for it and they get down and personal with it this guy knocks out the women and <UNK> them with some poison he doesn't even have sex with the corpse or <UNK> it talk about boring eventually one of the <UNK> five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy they were all buried or tossed into the ocean but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing the women then act very poorly and take their revenge oh <UNK> br br this film was crap in every category crap acting crap writing <UNK> sets and <UNK> make up effects the women don't look zombie like unless you count really dark make up around the eyes to be the de <UNK> definition of what makes a zombie they can all talk behave think and act perfectly human the gore is weak compared to even many pg 13 films and the nudity is beyond brief you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence then the exact same breasts later go figure guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in you can see the <UNK> and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set up and even unless you are blind you can see the director failing steer clear it's a waste of time br br 1 10
<START> just saw this at the 2003 <UNK> international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal takes place in toronto where these two losers live in this run down house in the middle of a <UNK> system david <UNK> pin cube cypher and andrew miller cube are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away the acting dialogue and writing are very good and the whole film looks great for such a low budget flick director writer vincenzo natali was in <UNK> at this screening and he seemed so intelligent and down to earth this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame
<START> i have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i don't know how i sat through an hour of it i must have been in a coma that night i saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago i couldn't even remember the name but i knew that penelope ann miller starred in it it must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today <UNK> vomit <UNK>
<START> i laughed a lot while watching this it's an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of <UNK> the characters are simple but their simplicity adds to the humor <UNK> the dialog is funny and often unexpected and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully there's max who has apparently led a horrible life and there's edward who isn't sure what life he wants to lead my favorite character was tom <UNK> insane boss tom has a short role but a memorable one highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor and you can find it online now which is a bonus i am a fan of all of <UNK> cartoons and can't wait to see what he comes out with next
<START> another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the us government and the armed forces especially the army for every disaster since the great <UNK> anyone who has ever served time in the us military can see how bogus this film is uniforms equipment sets and mannerisms are all wrong and of course all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots blatant propaganda with no attempt at <UNK> most of the theories presented have been <UNK> over the past few years uses every <UNK> <UNK> and urban legend from the <UNK> all are presented as <UNK> the truth is no one knows for sure why some <UNK> vets are sick and others are healthy as horses ps this is not new war is not fun and i know wwii korean and <UNK> <UNK> vets with some pretty serious <UNK> too and the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them <UNK> movies like this will not solve the problem
<START> we expected something great when we went to see this bomb it is basically a broadway play put on film the music is plain terrible there isn't one memorable song in the movie heard any hits from this movie you won't because there aren't any some of the musical numbers go on so long that i got up to go to the <UNK> and get some pop corn and it was still going when i got back if they were good songs well but they suck the pace is slow terrible character development the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song it was almost impossible to stand this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die hard broadway <UNK> this is without a doubt the most over rated movie i've seen in my entire life a complete <UNK> of time and money there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover who wasn't on screen enough and whose character wasn't developed enough rent the video and you'll agree this movie was an expensive over produced polished dog do
<START> so american pie <UNK> house is the <UNK> american pie movie in the series although it really has nothing to do with the original three american pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and eugene levy is in it can't that guy get better <UNK> br br there is very little to compliment this movie on there aren't any funny jokes the acting is painful to watch especially the girl with the southern accent which sounds more like a <UNK> <UNK> of a british woman pretending to be a <UNK> by using the word <UNK> this movie makes me feel like such an idiot why didn't i apply to a college where nobody goes to class but everybody gets good <UNK> girls consistently take their clothes off in public everybody has <UNK> <UNK> sex without the burden of babies and <UNK> and you can <UNK> all over a girl's family photos without her <UNK> really this series has <UNK> itself to the standards of <UNK> porn maybe for the next one they'll finally break down and hire ron jeremy as the lead i'm sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character <UNK> 3rd uncle once removed or something like that
<START> the worst movie i have seen since <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there is no story no humor no nothing the action sequences seem more like a series of <UNK> akshay kumar thumbs up <UNK> <UNK> together heavily influenced from the matrix and kung fu <UNK> but very poorly executed br br i did not go a lot of expectations but watching this movie is an <UNK> experience which makes you wonder what were these guys thinking br br the only thing you might remember after watching it is an <UNK> kareena in a bikini br br the reason why i did not give a rating of <UNK> is that every time i think i have seen the worst bollywood proves me wrong
<START> if i wanted to <UNK> i'd call a nurse br br haven't you had enough more than enough br br you got me a <UNK> <UNK> br br if i begin to die please remove the cowboy hat from my head that is not the way i wish to be remembered br br some of the wonderfully humorous and often insightful <UNK> from this charming and often insightful film dudley moore is charming lovable and rich sir john gielgud is <UNK> charming and loving and poor the two have a non father father and son relationship which <UNK> the man whom arthur is to become will he follow his heart and soul or just his wealth over twenty five years i've returned to this movie with glee and amusement and joy it is a movie to return to time and time again and remember what is important in life as short as it is br br judge miller
<START> from the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to <UNK> the very smart and powerful <UNK> <UNK> and how flat it landed you'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting robin dunne as <UNK> then in the second scene you meet the two best things in this movie amy adams and <UNK> rogers as kathryn and her mother that is if you can get past the fact that kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film then the movie goes on you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago and you notice sebastian has already met an <UNK> in the past here called <UNK> and a <UNK> here called <UNK> how original is that for a prequel then it turns into a low budget <UNK> <UNK> type of film with lots and lots of oh my twists as i mentioned robin dunne was a very bad choice not that he is a bad actor he's good he just doesn't have the charisma ryan did amy adams who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time once again delivers but with all the talent in the world there is no way one could save this trash as a whole this movie feels like a <UNK> hills <UNK> episode the score has been stolen from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> yes they used the score from <UNK> couldn't they at least leave that one alone you'll want to pass this one if you want more cruel intentions watch stephen <UNK> dangerous <UNK>
<START> forest <UNK> performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck historical fiction does not justify changing history the absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by james <UNK> to create a fictional <UNK> for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is <UNK> <UNK> that white people can't just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role making up a fake historical actor and <UNK> this fiction with exposing <UNK> to the world is irresponsible lazy and stupid not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal and has opened the door for movies like the one they're planning to make with <UNK> <UNK> as a heroic <UNK> <UNK> who never existed the logic of the world does not apply in this film where some scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator it doesn't apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid <UNK> irresponsible white boy for that matter everybody is <UNK> up to sleep with this <UNK> irresponsible arrogant white boy he even has gillian anderson <UNK> her <UNK> chops br br let me <UNK> i do not like james <UNK> i'm not sure what it is about him but i thought his mr <UNK> in <UNK> was creepy and <UNK> i think that <UNK> washington would never look twice at him so i can't believe that the wife of a powerful dangerous man like <UNK> would risk and lose her life for him i don't believe him as a doctor and i just don't see the appeal his character seems to have far more arrogance than would make sense and trying to make him look like a <UNK> in shooting the cow was just there's that word again absurd think about it you are watching all of these characters bend themselves into <UNK> in order to <UNK> this unbelievable main character and there never was such a guy br br gillian anderson looks incredible and sounds more british than most brits <UNK> gives a great <UNK> <UNK> performance and <UNK> with his incomprehensible pre oscar speeches just how much he was acting it's a shame the film around him had no reason to exist
<START> the first time i saw this i didn't laugh too much at the time i was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time i had the same reaction when i viewed it a second time a few months ago and this time it was because <UNK> <UNK> suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of <UNK> the movie a bit this scene made some of the things oscar said and did to felix later in the movie seem needlessly cruel and their personality <UNK> weren't as amusing as they could have been had i not already known the story i would have been worried that some of <UNK> antics to felix might push him over the edge as it was it didn't make me laugh or smile like the television show with jack <UNK> and tony randall did still all in all a pretty good movie and it <UNK> one of the greatest sitcoms on television 7 out of 10
<START> the beauty of this film is <UNK> in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love the exceptional performances the steady execution and the quite innovative script the film tells the story of an indian woman <UNK> who lives in canada with her husband <UNK> and little kid <UNK> all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to india when they get into the village <UNK> is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture <UNK> family ruled by his cruel highly cynical and <UNK> father <UNK> lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are <UNK> and helpless <UNK> starts <UNK> <UNK> to return home but he is soon killed by his father's enemies when she wants to leave <UNK> refuses to let her take <UNK> back to india here starts the intense struggle which can be called <UNK> vs <UNK> br br india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas so it may be even correct the portrayal is in my view fair and not one sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world the locations are amazing the music is wonderful and <UNK> <UNK> direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing one thing that must be noted is the very ear pleasing background score by <UNK> <UNK> it is beautiful the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film portrayed realistically throughout the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch its dialogues are superb and intelligently written and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points a great deal of positive moments manage to <UNK> the tension br br the film's biggest strength is the performances <UNK> kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as <UNK> her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and <UNK> emotion is simply incredible she displays so much intensity <UNK> anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son her <UNK> while facing off <UNK> <UNK> which are like <UNK> <UNK> show us how the <UNK> of women can become a <UNK> when it comes to her child after <UNK> this is her most powerful performance one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> as <UNK> he manages to be hateful as <UNK> yet admirable as the actor who plays him <UNK> displays cruelty <UNK> and even humanity with total conviction he is outstanding another great performance comes <UNK> from <UNK> most underrated actress <UNK> naval who <UNK> her character to perfection <UNK> kapoor is just adequate and <UNK> khan provides great comic relief anyway do watch <UNK> it could have been better but it is definitely a must watch
<START> <UNK> motivation in backing down was not explored in the aftermath of <UNK> the <UNK> had decided to go for <UNK> <UNK> this is referred to in the film part of this was to use women in the war effort which germany had not previously done to any great extent an ss massacre of women would have faced <UNK> with a public relations disaster of massive <UNK> his <UNK> was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible on the basis that the jewish men could always be rounded up later i understand the majority survived the war br br his other problem was that the <UNK> berlin had never been very <UNK> behind the nazi cause and had to be handled <UNK> again a massacre of women could have cost the nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city br br it was interesting that the majority of ss uniforms showed <UNK> which <UNK> that the men wearing them were not of german <UNK> but were from german origins in other countries such as <UNK> or <UNK>
<START> john <UNK> wise blood was a more horrifying <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> book than i could have imagined from the utterly terrible acting performances and don't you oh that was done on purpose you just don't get it me to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of <UNK> files this film was revolting i viewed it with no ill will at the outset and in fact expected a pleasant experience but the <UNK> of the southern characters from the ridiculously <UNK> southern <UNK> to the <UNK> comedic way their faith was portrayed was <UNK> right down to it's end which was completely devoid of any character sentiment it failed in every place that <UNK> book <UNK> and <UNK> the actors portraying the southern policemen may as well have been eating <UNK> hot dogs from nyc street stands and <UNK> godfather the one redeeming acting performance was ned <UNK> lively and dead on representation of hoover <UNK> a religious con artist who hears <UNK> preaching the church of christ without christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities <UNK> powerful book is most well known for it's creepy religious <UNK> that <UNK> the seemingly lifeless <UNK> of faith mr <UNK> film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions as they are understood by me and most of her fans if i may be so bold as to say so while i acknowledge that i can't know exactly what the author wished to convey i have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan if i viewed wise blood the way mr huston apparently did i would have thrown it in the trash for <UNK> sake and mine i forgive you john huston the forgetting that will take some time
<START> laughed a lot because it is so incredibly bad sorry folks but definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen i know it is low budget but anyway the actors behave like playing in a soap the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time i have seen such odd pictures was at a trash <UNK> at some youth video festival ten years ago i really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished but at least one good thing the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay and the score was really worth listening to the dvd cover promised a lot but that is by far the best this film has to offer
<START> i missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on abc website during the summer of 2007 i am absolutely crazy about the show i think the entire cast is excellent it's one of my favorite show ever i just checked the abc program <UNK> for this fall and did not see it on the schedule that is really sad i hope they will bring it back maybe they are waiting until bridget <UNK> has her baby or is it only my <UNK> thinking br br i read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks similar to mine i certainly hope that abc will <UNK> its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up
<START> this film is the worst film i have ever seen the story line is weak i couldn't even follow it the acting is high <UNK> the sound track is irritating the attempts at humor are not the editing is horrible the credits are even slow i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film don't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting
<START> many critics have felt offended that r w fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist <UNK> and the nazis in this movie in a human like manner <UNK> of other fassbinder films however will realize that <UNK> <UNK> 1981 belongs to <UNK> women movies like the marriage of maria <UNK> 1979 and lola 1981 fassbinder was convinced that stories can be told much better with women than with men because according to fassbinder while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society women are capable of thinking in a <UNK> manner <UNK> however means that there is not only a <UNK> and its <UNK> like usually in our black and white world but a <UNK> where the <UNK> <UNK> moreover <UNK> means that because of the third instance of <UNK> the absolute opposition of the difference between <UNK> and <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> speaking starting from a <UNK> point of view and portraying the fascist state the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the <UNK> do and between <UNK> and victims there is thus a <UNK> relation so that every <UNK> is also victim and every victim is also <UNK> fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme that <UNK> classical logic in his play the city the garbage and the death 1975 which was filmed by daniel <UNK> under the title shadow of angels 1976 br br therefore approaching an a <UNK> controversial topic like nazi germany in a <UNK> manner the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial especially for people who cannot or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive light switch <UNK> but needs the third instance of <UNK> as controlling instance of its opposite members <UNK> and <UNK> the mutual relationship between <UNK> and victims has to <UNK> since it is simply not true that the <UNK> are the bad ones and the victims the good ones in a <UNK> viewpoint the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness they are <UNK> related in a world view based on classical logic a relation between good and bad cannot even been established and in an <UNK> based on this <UNK> system of logic the bad conscience of the survivors of nazi germany feeling <UNK> enough responsible for the deeds of their <UNK> <UNK> the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a <UNK> in the form a new <UNK> based on this relationship as well from <UNK> <UNK> viewpoint it follows that neither <UNK> <UNK> nor lola nor maria <UNK> can be condemned for their <UNK> of the <UNK> system for their private purposes because they don't <UNK> them they just use them in the opposite since victims must repeat the actions of the <UNK> as the <UNK> must repeat the actions of the victims because good and bad are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two <UNK> logic their <UNK> are <UNK> by the <UNK> structure of a logic that describes our world that is not black and white at all much better than a black and white logic
<START> i gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned from the domestic violence to sexuality and many of the <UNK> <UNK> outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction br br it's bleak depressing and hopeless while i don't mind a less than <UNK> ending i'm really very tired of the humans suck cliché that's central to every movie i know you can't get a liberal arts degree today without <UNK> to the alter of self hatred as a member of the human race but <UNK> <UNK> as a writer director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil right now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die just go out find a lake and swim <UNK> your arms are tired this way you won't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive it's silly not thoughtful and boring
<START> ok so chuck norris somehow found a way to get this sequel produced i have one question why who read this script and said <UNK> great original this movie is <UNK> crap that i wouldn't <UNK> my toilet <UNK> with of course it is another story following in the tradition of <UNK> invasion usa walker texas ranger <UNK> force and so on in which chuck norris of course is the one man who can same america from some bad guys he doesn't even need a gun most times it's stupid patriotic <UNK> that <UNK> the mind big surprise that the only one who will direct these norris film's is <UNK> son eric eric norris has primarily worked on all his father's films and tv shows doesn't this strike anyone as a sign that he has no directing talent <UNK> he's directing the same people as before in the same stories as before only difference is the characters' names if this is supposed to make me patriotic and cheer for the usa than our country is in much worse shape than i ever imagined hopefully this will be the nail in chuck <UNK> acting coffin
<START> to sat how awful the shield is you'd have to write pages and pages so suffice it to say that it is a <UNK> to bad directing br br when directors go awry should have been the title of this production indeed directors are supposed to <UNK> their work with a sense of visual style and story telling that <UNK> the story forward br br how is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a style how is it <UNK> the story forward of course there's also the editing by random numbers nonsense apparently it's become hip to just cut randomly br br i guess it's too much work to do good editing br br well that made it too much work for most people to watch the shield which <UNK> as one of the most over hyped and <UNK> shows of all time
<START> white chicks hold on why couldn't they have dressed as black chicks oh yeah they wouldn't look different at all can anyone give me one wayans movie where they haven't dressed up as ladies don't be a menace doesn't count jack white and michael <UNK> ghost wrote that the other norton trio members acted as directors br br in white chicks there's never really any jokes it's just the wayans acting like girls for 2 hours there's no <UNK> no <UNK> and no laughs there is a lot of i think i'm gonna play some time crisis 3 at least for me there was 5 times to be exact br br somebody has to tell <UNK> <UNK> damon marlon shawn <UNK> the only talented one kim <UNK> george w and <UNK> bin wayans to stop making movies its only hurting the o zone <UNK> br br verdict 1 2 out of
<START> this film might have weak production values but that is also what makes it so good the special effects are gross out and well done my favorite part of the movie had to be <UNK> played by <UNK> brady she is super hot and also has a good nude scene robert <UNK> as the leader of the gang is hilarious as are the other members this film is actually trying to make a point by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad 4 10 fair comedy gross out film
<START> if you've ever seen this movie you'd know that it if you haven't and want to see a classic bad movie i suggest you see this movie because it ranks right down with the worst so if you're really bored go rent it if you want to know what it's like here's my little summary adam sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some ms universe models and five other people adam doesn't like how one passenger is getting all the babes and he tries to take over with the <UNK> jokes but wait it only gets worse you'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is
<START> just don't bother i thought i would see a movie with great <UNK> and action br br but it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start in the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed towards the end the it gets better but not really great i think the director took this movie just too serious in such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action i nearly <UNK> off in the middle main part of it rating 3 10 br br <UNK>
<START> it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to <UNK> and to think about the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the <UNK> candidate the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this a plot to kill the president of the united states michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete <UNK> who <UNK> the operation only to find out later that he has been framed <UNK> sutherland co stars as a sort of rival by the name of david <UNK> and eva longoria as jill <UNK> who is a rookie agent going under the <UNK> of agent <UNK> and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah <UNK> one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president it also concerns a mole <UNK> in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction
<START> i have no idea what the producers of the shield were trying to do but the result speaks for itself the shield is practically unwatchable br br supposedly the performances on the shield are great br br in reality the show is so badly put together that you can't even really see the performances for instance the editing cuts away from reaction shots before they've had their full impact br br i don't know what intellectual <UNK> there is for that but it <UNK> the show of all emotional impact br br i'll give the shield one point for ambition in its subject matter but that's pretty much all i can give it br br it's a shame to see a number of talented performer waste their gift on something so strangely badly filmed
<START> don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out and no matter how good or bad it is people love it br br i saw this movie with my two kids 5 7 they like pretty much anything animated like most people who rated this film the theater was almost full and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast to tell the truth i was bored silly it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny there were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh but just didn't work my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie but not on this one my daughter fell asleep half way through also the kids thought the character animation looked weird i haven't heard that from them since seeing the polar express which gave my daughter nightmares br br trust me i'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything but quality is quality and like so many animated movies they throw out there it has very little
<START> this anime is a must see for fans of <UNK> it's an earlier work of <UNK> <UNK> but his <UNK> dramatic style is quite in place also those who didn't like <UNK> might find this release to bit slightly more <UNK> <UNK> is rather unique to sci fi anime in that it's actually based on real science in fact the show has several little science lesson <UNK> explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at <UNK> near that of light the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the <UNK> traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably be warned this show is heavy on the <UNK> at times it also has a couple of the most wholly <UNK> breast shots that i have ever seen i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo <UNK> scenes because the series is otherwise very good but viewers with a low <UNK> tolerance might want to stay away from this one on an interesting note <UNK> as always managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes however they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway the ending is a bit silly but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldn't help but love it <UNK> is in my opinion one of the finest pieces of anime around
<START> to die for 1989 was just another d t v feature that made an appearance on cable ad <UNK> during the early nineties the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie <UNK> jones appeared in other than that there's no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks <UNK> as a horror film a tired vampire <UNK> for love and <UNK> the back streets of l a looking for it will he succeed or will <UNK> just strike out again like he has for the last century br br this movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed they're so bad they make this one look like a classic i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lighting br br not recommended by me because i didn't like it br br <UNK> said
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies ever made bad acting bad special effects bad plot bad everything in the last 15 minutes a cat suited cyborg is introduced which <UNK> everything <UNK> <UNK> must have needed to make a house <UNK> because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on hollywood <UNK> to pay the bill i just don t know how you can go from clockwork orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning i could have done better special effects in my <UNK> there's no continuity the editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad acting do they have to smoke to be bad the gun either shoots blue flames or bullets make up your mind the bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing <UNK> is it called <UNK> <UNK> wake it has nothing to do with the movie
<START> it was the night he came home warned the posters for john carpenter's career making horror classic set in a small american town halloween <UNK> around serial killer michael <UNK> attempts to track down his sister laurie <UNK> and in the process <UNK> all her friends in rather brutal ways leaving poor laurie to fight against the seemingly <UNK> michael this plot out line inspired countless horror knock offs throughout the 80s 90s and continues to do so today as well as a poorly received 2007 remake the difference between them and this is quite simply that halloween is the best br br made on a very modest tight budget halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and <UNK> the sub genre of sexually <UNK> teens getting stalked by a knife axe chainsaw wielding psycho
<START> hello everyone this is my first time <UNK> and i just love the movie no child of mine and i could watch it over and over well i taped it a long time ago like a few years ago and i dropped it and broke it and i haven't seen it in a few years could any one please tell me when it will come on again i would really appreciate it alot you can email me if you want to cause that is my favorite movie of all including empty cradle to and if anyone knows when that comes on to please let me know i would really appreciate it alot br br
<START> <UNK> jr 's drama about the first african american navy master diver gooding jr who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict <UNK> <UNK> the screenplay is not bad a bit extreme at times but the direction and acting is first rate and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do i liked deniro in the lead although its not on par with his masterful works taxi driver godfather and all the others it is as good as his other good performances such as in king of comedy or angel heart deniro is always convincing and believable here very good performance gooding jr is not bad definitely one of his better performances imdb rating 6 6 my rating 9 10
<START> i like a movie that has at least a <UNK> of a story this doesn't occur in this movie it's a series of vignettes with no <UNK> br br there are scenes of a person collecting <UNK> <UNK> a woman with a blond wig never <UNK> her sun glasses this woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why she disappears completely after about 30 minutes there is another <UNK> woman who endlessly <UNK> a man's apartment there are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is vastly <UNK> i used to like the song the dialogue is mostly concerned with food <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i assume most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed br br there is no passion in this movie because there is no story this is <UNK> a romance it is no such thing i just wonder why i didn't hit the fast forward i kept waiting for something significant to happen  it doesn't maybe that's the only <UNK> to this movie scenes <UNK> so rapidly that it tricked you into assuming that there was going to be a revelation to all the nonsense
<START> dr <UNK> begins at the turn of last century <UNK> the dawn of modern medical <UNK> to be exact dr <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> is in the early stages of his <UNK> of living <UNK> experiments dr <UNK> manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which <UNK> he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life it's now <UNK> years <UNK> dean <UNK> micheal <UNK> is round the <UNK> house for dinner as dean <UNK> dr <UNK> eat they talk about <UNK> experiments which dean <UNK> has always been opposed to dr <UNK> shows dean <UNK> his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife sheila sylvia lee baker who died in an unfortunate <UNK> can <UNK> talk to him christy <UNK> provides <UNK> voice apparently dr <UNK> also show's dean <UNK> a skinned chicken running around in a cage explains that with the process he has developed he will bring sheila back to life the dean has some sort of <UNK> apparently dies meanwhile sisters wendy <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> leslie <UNK> catherine davis cox plus their brother alex john <UNK> their cousin <UNK> victor <UNK> travis are driving along near <UNK> house when they crash they seek shelter assistance arrive upon <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> invites the four stranded <UNK> to stay for the night later on dr <UNK> is visited by two grave robbers <UNK> logan <UNK> ruby <UNK> ann <UNK> who deliver a male body when <UNK> actually needs female parts for sheila dr <UNK> being the genius that he is decides not to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful <UNK> available starts to <UNK> the bits <UNK> pieces he needs to complete sheila br br written directed by richard clark i was pleasantly surprised by dr <UNK> i'll state right now that it ain't brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was i actually quite liked it it moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during it's middle as things settle down the script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when dr <UNK> is trying to <UNK> <UNK> she tries to gain the attention of his deaf <UNK> <UNK> simpson catherine <UNK> by kicking out <UNK> keeping <UNK> behind <UNK> back who is seemingly oblivious to what's happening with a touch of gore but i'd say dr <UNK> is more of a comedy than horror in conception feel throughout there are some tacky <UNK> sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh dr <UNK> to wendy would you like to see my <UNK> as an example i also thought the scene when mrs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reports her missing daughter's to the <UNK> detective <UNK> william <UNK> was a pretty amusing sequence going round in <UNK> talking about why he isn't looking for them even though he has only just been told why the cell doesn't have a prisoner in it that if he didn't find the cousin not to worry about it none of it's flat laugh out loud but i must admit i found myself smiling on occasion found the film as whole to be quietly amusing there isn't a lot of on screen gore a few severed limbs <UNK> decapitated head some medical <UNK> those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way i liked the characters in dr <UNK> too which was surprise in itself the acting isn't brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it lots of exaggerated facial movements some serious overacting means it's never dull oh the three birds in dr <UNK> are fit if you know what i mean technically the film is ok as well once again it ain't going to win any oscars but i have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting it doesn't always work the clothes are at odds with each other at times the girls look like their from victorian england while the guys look like their from a western the house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room stick a few <UNK> in there it comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really isn't a bad looking film at all considering could have done without the comedy music though overall i ended up enjoying dr <UNK> much more than i thought i would although that in itself isn't a recommendation it's certainly is not the best comedy horror film ever made it certainly is not the worst either a watchable enough piece of harmless fun
<START> i wish i'd known more about this movie when i rented it i'd put it in my <UNK> on the basis of heather graham and her strong <UNK> as an actress imho while parts of the movie were charming much of the movie felt contrived undeveloped or otherwise just boring or predictable not to mention the <UNK> factor of so many people thinking the <UNK> were a couple i don't care how big a part of the story line that is it still felt a bit um gross and charlie for a <UNK> she certainly doesn't seem to be very <UNK> to <UNK> from other <UNK> <UNK> what was it about her besides her <UNK> and some common interests that made gray fall for her the story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth high points molly shannon although i do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion the <UNK> in drag and the dance sequences if sam gray were such great dancers i wish we'd seen more of that as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie could have been better
<START> when i was a little girl and my dad owned a video store this was among my favorite movies i hadn't heard much about it since then nor did i really remember anything about it it having been forgotten in the wake of don <UNK> other probably better films i managed to track it down a few weeks ago however and was pleasantly surprised again set in new orleans in the 1930s the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable there are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough but they generally don't detract from the storyline which leaves you smiling and maybe even a little misty eyed if you are a lover of animals the characters are believable maybe even a little too grown up for younger <UNK> as well two <UNK> up and for those of you who haven't seen it in a while definitely worth a re watch
<START> having never heard of this film until i saw the rental dvd i as a bit <UNK> there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that can't do anything film a bad script and in some cases don't seem to care br br well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release it is good the story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry i was pleasantly surprised at how good a job justin timberlake does here too with such a major role ok he's not oscar material yet but he'll learn with each role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here dylan mcdermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie br br ultimately just give it a go you won't be disappointed you won't be bored in fact i think you'll be more than happy with the end result
<START> bette midler is again divine <UNK> humorous in love with <UNK> capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power punch than ever all in all singing new <UNK> power singing the good old <UNK> ones such as the rose stay with me and yes even wind beneath my wings the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been <UNK> since this is the next best thing to it i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide eyed <UNK> and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries
<START> i <UNK> this movie yesterday through an internet site the quality was kinda good i was watching the movie with high expectations though i knew it was a flop especially as the film has superstar amitabh bachchan playing the role of a villain i though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles but unfortunately mr bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete <UNK> <UNK> magic <UNK> trial to re <UNK> the past <UNK> <UNK> sholay the old one is a <UNK> in indian cinema with an all star cast cult dialogue stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too a good actor like ajay <UNK> talents are wasted and his performance was average <UNK> raj a newcomer doesn't know what acting is <UNK> <UNK> proved she is one of the worst actresses we have i don't know how she is still in <UNK> crew <UNK> <UNK> seen in a song with no excitement and passion <UNK> tried his best and <UNK> <UNK> work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie it was a total carnage of the original sholay
<START> the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film and even that was disappointing compared to some other films my <UNK> br br to me this is the worst kind of film one that assumes it's a work of art because it has all the <UNK> of film as art yes it's beautifully photographed but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly <UNK> itself tango is a <UNK> it's hot it has drama it's <UNK> precisely what this film is not
<START> soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be i found the film to have some of the <UNK> cynical humour like that in paul <UNK> starship troopers the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic book atmosphere br br one particular trivia bit stands out for me todd has the names of several space war <UNK> <UNK> onto his chest and one of these battles is <UNK> gate for the oblivious ones out there <UNK> gate is mentioned in roy <UNK> <UNK> last lines in blade runner to imagine that todd could have fought alongside <UNK> troops like roy is mind <UNK> to say the least maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgic br br i'll give this one 3 out of 5
<START> pretty good film from preminger <UNK> at times as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the <UNK> of the modern city and how they live in this sense it is visually and <UNK> satisfying as its hero a good cop with a bad temper gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head br br dana andrews plays the lead as if it were hamlet and has never been better the story may be pure melodrama but andrews gives it weight and almost raises it to the level of tragedy as his girl gene tierney is attractive but <UNK> gary <UNK> makes for a very interesting villain with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to <UNK> <UNK> his smiling <UNK> seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open as opposed to the tightly wound and <UNK> cop who is pursuing him br br there are no major surprises in this film which seems <UNK> for all concerned for director preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his laura stars andrews and tierney who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made the supporting cast <UNK> karl malden <UNK> brand are understandably more optimistic as they were all on their way up preminger as <UNK> an <UNK> as ever lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing for the cat and mouse game between the two <UNK> seems larger and more <UNK> than any mere movie could contain much less resolve br br
<START> fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid redundant pulp horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down <UNK> are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal <UNK> directed by a disappointing tobe hooper and <UNK> <UNK> blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to <UNK> tremendously the <UNK> crocodile supposedly is 90 years old over 30 <UNK> long and it kills for fun during the film he <UNK> himself by <UNK> a bunch of utterly stupid <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark <UNK> area the only beautiful aspect about this film is the <UNK> location even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this the <UNK> and nature looks marvelous every other aspect is simply disastrous there's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable the dialogues are downright painful to listen to you won't believe some of the lines these actors have to say i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake they're not that stupid early in the film one of the characters refers to jaws as being a <UNK> <UNK> but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than spielberg's great white shark the visual effects in <UNK> <UNK> are amateurish and the <UNK> fail to impress i won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary in flicks like this the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs <UNK> <UNK> while running away from the beast you guessed right blood surf is a very bad film so bad it becomes fun again but <UNK> for a whole other reason than james <UNK> intended
<START> several young iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a world cup <UNK> match between iran and <UNK> when they're caught they're penned in an area where the match remains within <UNK> but out of sight the prisoners <UNK> to be let go but rules are rules br br given the <UNK> of its director <UNK> <UNK> it was <UNK> to discover that <UNK> is a comedy and a frequently hilarious one in <UNK> the mirror <UNK> presents two versions of iranian <UNK> and leaves the audience to wonder which one is real in <UNK> the circle several iranian women step outside the system their <UNK> are different but they all end up in the same tragic place br br however thinking now about <UNK> it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous as the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their <UNK> struggle to answer the only possible outcome is comedy br br what makes <UNK> most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as <UNK> attacking the system they are simply soccer fans and <UNK> and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their <UNK> grasp
<START> <UNK> kazan one of the best theater directors this country ever had showed he was equally at home with movies with panic in the streets mr kazan gives us an early version of what would come later with perhaps his master piece on the <UNK> although both movies share only the water setting for they are different visions about different subjects br br mr kazan shot on location in new orleans the adaptation by daniel <UNK> of the <UNK> and edward <UNK> stories that are the basis of the film is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist <UNK> to see when visiting the big easy one of the big <UNK> of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by joseph macdonald that shows new orleans at its best also the music by alfred newman and the song by <UNK> holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch br br this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like <UNK> than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country br br one thing comes clear in the movie jack palance making his screen debut <UNK> the screen every time one sees him he was so intense at the same time this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner who unknown to him is stricken with a fatal disease <UNK> <UNK> this man <UNK> his <UNK> face and running his hands through the dying man's <UNK> hair with abandon notable also was the fact that mr palance and mr mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real br br the film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the reed family at the beginning of the film we see a family man painting furniture with his young son later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his <UNK> something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis richard widmark playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people barbara <UNK> <UNK> as the wife sounds as though she's a suburban woman from <UNK> br br the film is enjoyable thanks to mr <UNK> direction and the excellent cast working in the movie
<START> the story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the <UNK> daughter is not for all tastes but it's still very intriguing it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand amongst the scenery we've come to know so well through other films from this region br br this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary <UNK> and i've been a fan of hers ever since the cast also contains bruno lawrence who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film smash palace <UNK> cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter <UNK> br br <UNK> acted with <UNK> shattering performances from all of its leads i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america but believe you me the <UNK> version is not to be missed
<START> i loved the idea of this film from the moment i first saw a trailer for it einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly playful slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film the added spice of matthau as einstein made it even better br br the story is pure fantasy but a delightful one an auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who happens to be <UNK> niece with the help of four fairy <UNK> of physics ed <UNK> on a quest to win <UNK> heart throw a jealous fiancé who <UNK> the worst of experimental psychology and <UNK> into the mix and you have pure fun br br the film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and <UNK> performances walter matthau play einstein as a mischievous <UNK> <UNK> with a slide rule tim robbins is wonderfully endearing as ed and meg ryan plays a step above her normal <UNK> com level stephen <UNK> is a joy as the <UNK> and <UNK> fiancé who lacks a single romantic bone in his body br br the film fell below most <UNK> but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings it features first rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world
<START> this film is really vile it plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s 80s and puts it into a school context i'm not saying that urban crime wasn't a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren't aren't problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the <UNK> violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it's not a case of social issues but a white upper middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime <UNK> of his local high <UNK> and of course he knows how to play the system does that sound familiar yes this turd is pure violent exploitation a really nasty piece of work it's disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment this belongs in the same category as trash like <UNK> death wish 2 5 and so on and so on the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this
<START> rob schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements <UNK> and performances of not humans this time he is the animal marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked so marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man but on his way to the crime scene he crashes with his car and gets really damaged he doesn't remember what happens and at the next ordinary day his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts of course we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his <UNK> are useless she is played by <UNK> <UNK> there are no negative characters the negative character is destiny if i could use this metaphor marvin should find out how to become a normal human being again by the way his animal instincts helps him in some situations <UNK> performance is a so so the movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies called mindless fun as i have written above so watch it for the monkey style rob schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that schneider appears in he is a great comedian but this is not his best movie
<START> i didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless br br it is original although reminded me a little of two other french films <UNK> and city of lost children mostly for the <UNK> but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters br br set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off this film seemingly goes further than many a multi <UNK> blockbuster br br always interesting with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> well to the <UNK> and very good characterisation making some only too believable br br scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing
<START> the majority of stephen king's short stories are little gems with original ideas that don't take a long time to develop basically lean and mean he sets them up quickly in a <UNK> number of pages you read 'em and you're finished before you know you've begun they're like the equivalent of a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> they taste really good and you know there's not much <UNK> value in them re from a literary standpoint they don't say much about the universal human condition but you're still gonna <UNK> 'em down just don't be a pig and go for the extra super sized portion and fill up on too much grease too much grease is a metaphor for the <UNK> in king's novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on enough with the pop cultural observations or clever <UNK> <UNK> get on with the story already he has <UNK> four books of short story <UNK> i've read them all from <UNK> to the latest <UNK> eventual and they all display an <UNK> of getting to the point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his <UNK> sized novels br br but his short stories never <UNK> their welcome which brings us to the tv adaptations of nightmares and <UNK> br br how in the hell did they the <UNK> producers get a green light to turn stories that usually <UNK> 15 pages into 50 minute episodes i'll tell you how two words stephen king stories with his name on them probably didn't come cheap and one hour shows <UNK> more advertising than half hour ones so what should have been an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes is turned into double that length and double the commercial time <UNK> <UNK> br br i'm not going to waste time <UNK> the plots of these stories this review <UNK> you have already read the stories and or seen the show what follows is merely my gut reactions to what <UNK> presented of the four <UNK> so far here's my ten <UNK> <UNK> from first to worst br br <UNK> not a classic by any means but hey how could anyone argue with keeping william hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog and the tongue in cheek reference and destruction of the killer <UNK> doll from trilogy of terror proved to me the producers and the writer of the <UNK> who is richard <UNK> son the writer of <UNK> knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly yet at the same time fun it took longer to get to <UNK> apartment than it should have but i think it <UNK> it's objective 8 10 br br <UNK> last case liked this one primarily because of william h <UNK> performance i think the writer <UNK> should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye <UNK> beginning because he was the actual reality of the story and anyone familiar with the king short story probably half if not more of the audience knew the <UNK> set up was due to get interrupted by the writer's reality so let's get on with it already and cut out the cute and clever hard boiled <UNK> private dick banter already once the writer <UNK> family tragedy began to reveal though i thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer me at least feel sympathy for the real life <UNK> attempt to escape his <UNK> by <UNK> his fictional <UNK> exciting life 6 10 br br the end of the whole mess uh this title is how i felt about this episode when it was over after twenty minutes i was ready to scream at the tv ok we get it already the younger brother is a mega <UNK> genius <UNK> <UNK> we know from ron <UNK> talking to the camera time is running out for me not fast enough i thought that the young <UNK> kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity we know this because he's already built an airplane but almost died because he couldn't steer it out of the path of a tree and he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more <UNK> <UNK> so much time was wasted on establishing the uber genius of henry thomas when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery the end of the world through <UNK> idiocy how much do we get to see of the world ending a cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what she's <UNK> on and brief radio <UNK> <UNK> the day of judgement is at hand oh and the brother's parents <UNK> and singing old songs my point is if your story is really about the end of the whole mess world i wanna see the mess as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns talk about ending with a <UNK> indeed 2 10 br br <UNK> end this episode just <UNK> me off totally i could have lived with the taking forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel playing slap and <UNK> having lunch and getting a taxi that was half the episode right there if once they finally crossed over into <UNK> end the episode delivered the chills but it failed <UNK> not only wasn't it scary it was practically laughable <UNK> look a kitty wait it turns oh my god look at it's scary eye uh huh they could have gone a long way towards filming the <UNK> end sequence at night instead of in daylight too things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows but i guess the budget wasn't high enough to shoot at night on the fake london sets they slapped together for this one on the page this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they shouldn't and the terrible things that might <UNK> just around a corner there the only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting those were truly horrifying 1 10 br br overall series average so far 4 10
<START> comparison with american <UNK> is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic speaking of <UNK> there was an episode of cheers where norm and cliff <UNK> on who can find the most <UNK> in a movie they would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong there were sly reference such as <UNK> <UNK> paradise to put up a parking <UNK> the filmmakers hoped to <UNK> some smiles from us but basically made me <UNK> br br the characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially <UNK> for teenagers almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie very little of what the characters said were believable combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail although there were two exceptions <UNK> williams <UNK> things up as the future flower child and despite what another reviewer said rick <UNK> was quite good showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full <UNK> in his eventual appearance in n y p d blues
<START> if the crew behind zombie chronicles ever read this here's some advice guys br br 1 in a twist ending type movie it's not a good idea to insert close ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits that tends to spoil the twists <UNK> br br 2 i know you produced this on a <UNK> and to be fair you worked <UNK> with your budget but please hire people who can actually act or at least walk talk and gesture at the same time joe <UNK> i'm looking at you br br 3 if you're going to set a part of your movie in the past only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time br br 4 twist endings are supposed to be a surprise sure we don't want twists that make no sense but <UNK> the reveal as soon as you introduce a character that's not a great idea br br kudos to the guys for trying but in all honesty i'd rather they hadn't br br only for zombie <UNK>
<START> <UNK> laurel <UNK> becomes a live in babysitter for young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cole who has recently lost her mother but <UNK> misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house late at night where she also meets her friends br br this starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery then falls apart the story is thin and there is tons of padding to make the film 85 minutes long the acting is terrible across the board with cole easily being the worst badly directed with some of the worst editing i've ever seen in a motion picture scenes and sound are just cut off with no rhyme or reason also the film has terrible and obvious post production sound br br as for blood and violence forget it there's very little and what there is looks incredibly fake i've never seen such fake looking blood looks like <UNK> boring pointless a rightfully forgotten drive in movie you can skip this one
<START> i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing the small town sheriff <UNK> br br this happens a lot in chicago his deputy asks br br well no not really the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween <UNK> of orson welles' war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion and conclude they need to get in on the action what follows are a bunch of <UNK> involving the <UNK> <UNK> attempts to <UNK> the town of big bean <UNK> everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes except for the <UNK> daughter and her friend a kid in a duck suit br br the martians themselves are comical and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on it's a fun family movie
<START> before sunrise has many remarkable things going on almost too many to fit into one review like this but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most <UNK> character studies of the nineties maybe even in all of contemporary cinema to be <UNK> not about love per say so much as it's about a human connection how does one fall in love at first sight no one does at least that's deep down the <UNK> that <UNK> wants to show with his film and yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed <UNK> and with a <UNK> of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time <UNK> here gives us the story of celine and jessie a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna and on the way there start to talking about things at first <UNK> then personal jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather jessie <UNK> celine to go along with him on a night out on the <UNK> in vienna until his plane the next morning br br before sunrise gives jessie and celine in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance and in a sense is about the act of having conversations of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another here it's often about relationships and <UNK> as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat <UNK> or seemingly so and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities we hear <UNK> of desires for other loves or what weren't really loves of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul i loved the bit about the <UNK> in the church and sometimes laced with cynicism or <UNK> jessie may be more responsible for that last part but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives br br meanwhile it's always great to see ethan hawke and julie <UNK> in these roles where they're not <UNK> annoying in that 90s generation x mode but are the kinds of people where if not in the central <UNK> of the film which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere the <UNK> is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter only here <UNK> is expressed in the central characters either between each other where sweet <UNK> are actually acceptable i have to tell you a secret jessie says and then <UNK> in for a kiss ho ho or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way i loved the scene with the poet where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his <UNK> or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share but really are seeing them do it first hand all the while hawke and <UNK> <UNK> the roles interestingly we can see how <UNK> are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the future br br featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness however self contained as it may lead into something more who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone if only for less than 24 hours and be that much more attached than a married couple this is perhaps <UNK> <UNK> but there's more to it than just that it's a very dense film and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly one scene especially which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking <UNK> the <UNK> in front of each other <UNK> their <UNK> might go to the other's friend a
<START> here's an <UNK> a modern day film about a serial killer that has no fight scenes nobody seen dying no car chases and no loud noises and it takes place in russia there are only two short action scenes but they are horrific br br the rest of the story is detective work and how much red tape the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders this is a very somber movie and somber best describes the personality of the hero stephen rea as well yet the story is not depressing and it's very interesting all the way through br br rea is outstanding as the determined <UNK> looked detective jeffrey <UNK> is downright scary as the killer donald <UNK> russian accent is suspect but he plays the only character in this film that has some warmth br br once again the story is <UNK> with liberal <UNK> here and there with not one but two references to bias against gays the total <UNK> of <UNK> psychology police and government officials being <UNK> crude <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br otherwise it's an intelligent and <UNK> low key crime film this is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well known but is well liked by the people who have seen it since it's based on a true life account of this killer it's all the more chilling don't pass this by just because you haven't anything about it
<START> even without speaking a word billy <UNK> is wonderful as a zombie carrie ann moss as mom even better zombie girlfriends br br my father <UNK> to eat me i never tried to eat timmy br br and i thought dawn of the dead was good it's kinda like airplane meets <UNK> night of the living dead <UNK> by <UNK> br br and don't forget my head coffin br br and fido in an <UNK> shirt is just way cool br br and yes the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on br br <UNK> it to say it all really works
<START> a noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped the first was <UNK> <UNK> award for children of a lesser god in 1986 and the next ten years were to see another best actress award holly hunter for the piano in 1994 and no fewer than five best actor awards dustin hoffman in 1988 for rain man daniel day lewis in 1989 for my left foot al pacino in 1992 for <UNK> of a woman tom hanks in 1994 for forrest <UNK> and geoffrey rush in 1996 for shine for portrayals of the disabled <UNK> who played a deaf woman is herself deaf but all the others are able <UNK> br br this phenomenon <UNK> some <UNK> comment at the time with <UNK> being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting when jodie foster failed to win best actress for <UNK> in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a <UNK> against this sort of portrayal my view however is that the majority of these awards were well deserved i thought the 1992 award should have gone to either clint eastwood or robert downey rather than pacino but apart from that the only one with which i <UNK> would have been <UNK> and that was because i preferred <UNK> <UNK> performance in the madness of king george in that film of course <UNK> played a character who was mentally ill br br my left foot was based upon the autobiography of the irish writer and painter christy brown brown was born in 1931 one of the thirteen children of a working class <UNK> family he was born with cerebral <UNK> and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well he was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body his left foot hence the title he learned to write and draw by holding a piece of <UNK> between his <UNK> and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet br br life in working class <UNK> in the thirties and forties could be hard and the city jim sheridan himself a <UNK> shows us here is in many ways a grim grey <UNK> place very different from our normal idea of the <UNK> <UNK> sheridan and day lewis were later to <UNK> on another film with an irish theme in the name of the father against this however must be set the <UNK> and spirit of its people especially the brown family much of <UNK> success was due to the support he received from his parents who refused to allow him to be <UNK> and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior and from his siblings we see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially made <UNK> and how they helped their <UNK> father to build christy a room of his own in their back yard br br the film could easily have <UNK> into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart warming triumph over <UNK> movie that it does not is due to a number of factors <UNK> the magnificent acting in the course of his career day lewis has given a number of fine performances but this together with the recent there will be blood is his best he is never less than 100 convincing as christie his tortured jerky movements and strained attempts at speech <UNK> us that we really are watching a disabled person even though intellectually we are well aware that day lewis is able <UNK> the other performances which stand out are from <UNK> shaw as his mentor dr <UNK> cole from hugh <UNK> as the young christy and from brenda <UNK> as <UNK> mother which won her the best supporting actress award br br the other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to <UNK> its main character christy brown had a difficult life but he could also be difficult to live with and the film gives us a <UNK> and all portrait he was a heavy <UNK> given to foul language and prone to <UNK> of rage he could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him and the film shows us all these aspects of his character of course it also shows us the positive aspects his courage his determination and his wicked sense of humour day <UNK> acting is not just physically convincing in that it <UNK> us to believe in his character's <UNK> but also emotionally and intellectually convincing in that it brings out all these different <UNK> of <UNK> character his oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of robin williams and kenneth branagh but it was well deserved 8 10
<START> i think cliff robertson certainly was one of our finest actors he has a half dozen classics to his credit he does fine here as the heavy but the direction is so bad and the pacing so tiresome it never gets off the mark the story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself still he <UNK> well and carries things along the death <UNK> is <UNK> first of all if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another it would eat up about a third of the movie add to that <UNK> character sitting up in bed in the blue light looking confused that might add another <UNK> i agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent though insignificant film the biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that when all is said and done leaves incredible questions i'm not putting in spoilers but when it ends don't think too much i can come up with ten what <UNK> without raising a sweat it would have been better if it had remained a ghost story
<START> ok so this is coming a few weeks late but it is here mostly this is because of statements of various negative <UNK> starting with the technology when star trek <UNK> ran special effect technology was <UNK> low <UNK> and more than that the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups in the 35 years <UNK> <UNK> premiered the crew of star trek have become experts at economy br br ultimately they have decided quite rightly in my mind to abandon the look of <UNK> and reverse <UNK> <UNK> et all so what if they decided not to make the <UNK> out of gold <UNK> or made the phase <UNK> look closer to the ones from star trek ii as for the <UNK> being picked about first contact with the <UNK> empire it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and <UNK> that earth only met the <UNK> in <UNK> nothing was firmly established br br enterprise gives us the most promising <UNK> of exploration that we've seen in a while this is what voyager could have been no series can <UNK> without a few <UNK> but be thankful that star trek has so few so quit gripping and enjoy
