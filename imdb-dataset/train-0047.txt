<START> mary lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957 br br well the movie mainly takes place in 1986 the movie falls into the 80's trap of weird stupid special effects including some weird demented looking <UNK> horse br br anyway mary <UNK> spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body whether or not she succeeds you'll have to watch to find out br br anyway the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters this also isn't really a sequel the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school it has the <UNK> horror flick fall backs gore pointless nudity knocks against the catholic church basic stuff boring movie br br the acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10 you can waste your time doing something else
<START> may seem like an <UNK> but it is not br br what is so hard to comprehend is why didn't they make more musical shorts like this wasn't the beauty of it totally apparent to everybody involved i guess not so many shorts were made for commercial reasons only and with some luck there may be some artistic value in there this is one exception the only one where it seems they were the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate the music as art why didn't anybody ever think to shoot lester or charlie parker on a live date crazy man br br a pity there were no sequels if you've seen anything of similar quality please share it
<START> i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of <UNK> it was a <UNK> fantasy of how the military should be the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin <UNK> character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers br br i kept thinking hey there's a reason why boot camp is tough it's supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit there's no room for cocky attitudes and men who won't follow orders i was rooting for <UNK> to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit br br br br
<START> ok not bad movie making if it were from an original script but it is not br br which part of in this story there are no women except for <UNK> and <UNK> introduction by <UNK> did the producers directors and writers not understand i mean it is pretty plain english i understood it at age 10 the beauty of <UNK> is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds the colonial africa the <UNK> desert and <UNK> a hidden and isolated kingdom that should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with but <UNK> they have to throw romance into it pathetic suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book give it up until a peter jackson wannabe comes along and does it right you may as well keep re reading the <UNK> btw there is a sequel book actually a pre <UNK> called <UNK> wife it gives background to the story of <UNK> it is a bit creepy but good
<START> i rank this the best of the zorro <UNK> the exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screen play there is an excellent supporting cast and mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter reed hadley does a fine job as don diego and his alter ego zorro last but certainly not least is the great directing team of <UNK> and english
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen acting was terrible both for the kids and the adults most to all characters showed no little or not enough emotion the lighting was terrible and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot in the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed there's 4 shots the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat <UNK> and molly in the evening swimming the rest of the kids in the daytime when it's supposed to in the evening at the river bank and the doctor <UNK> and <UNK> at night but not in the evening getting off their boat the best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff <UNK> although there's a slip of character when the pulse <UNK> whatever that thing is when people die it <UNK> shows <UNK> has died he still moves while it can still be heard <UNK> and while the nurse extra <UNK> his pulse <UNK> then it shows the pulse again and then he finally dies i guess it's not going to be perfect since it's an independent movie but it still could be better not worth watching honestly even for kids might as well watch something good like the lion king or toy story if you're going to see anything you'll remember
<START> i'm not at all <UNK> about horror movies and i'm willing to watch pretty much any of them that doesn't mean that i'm willing to re watch many of them or that i won't have criticism for them this movie is creepy and is very well done in fact i think this movie would make an excellent double bill with session 9 br br i should <UNK> before i get to my comments that i watched this alone i started watching it before going to bed and got about 15 minutes in before i realized that it was too effective so i saved the rest of it for the morning even while watching it in broad daylight it was still creepy however i can't <UNK> for how effective it would be when watching in a larger group br br after the death of their daughter a couple move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death let me make note of this death this is one of the rare movies that doesn't shy away from the death of a child this is much more important as it both sets the tone as well as explains much of the acting that <UNK> the movie br br the couple is not doing well the wife has <UNK> herself from the relationship and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back while some of the comments have complained about their acting one <UNK> that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife and that's legitimate he's trying to give her more direction it's a role that men sometimes take on br br there are a variety of scares in the film and most are fairly non violent though grotesque in some ways the story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film and takes an odd turn near the end while the turn is not absurd it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been <UNK> br br moody atmospheric and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video
<START> ever since i remember i have loved <UNK> and flying i am now in college with a private <UNK> license and looking to become a commercial i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me this was it my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid i had the theme <UNK> as i grew up and i can still re <UNK> it today it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the dvd's soon it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless i cannot get enough of this show
<START> if my expectations weren't <UNK> they were certainly met nancy drew works both as a mystery and a comedy it pays homage to the books it was based on and spoofs them at the same time the movie starts with a close up on a book shelf and an animated credit sequence resembling <UNK> from the books it then begins <UNK> the books immediately writer director andrew <UNK> seems to realize the idea of a teenage girl regularly breaking up crime rings in a small town is ridiculous so he doesn't treat the idea <UNK> he <UNK> fun at nancy <UNK> ability to do anything such as ace every class in school know which baked treat is perfect for <UNK> any enemy to her side make a bird house with twelve flying <UNK> and even perform an <UNK> <UNK> at a party <UNK> always be in perfect style if she were living in the wholesome 1950's instead of present day l a and she carries around a sleuth <UNK> complete with <UNK> dust <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> glass preposterous of course but i seem to remember the hardy <UNK> access at any given moment to <UNK> equipment being a little too convenient as well and if the <UNK> <UNK> private eye is a little younger than her literary counterpart it's just more comedic exaggeration on the movie's part br br the mystery of the movie is handled more seriously nancy and her lawyer father move from their small town to los angeles where nancy <UNK> into a cold case involving the murder of a hollywood movie star who lived in her new house decades ago nancy <UNK> for clues in some pretty practical ways such as surfing <UNK> like <UNK> and this one and watching old <UNK> of the <UNK> movies when she does something more out of the ordinary you have to admire the girl's <UNK> emma roberts an undeniably cute kid plays the <UNK> sized amateur sleuth beautifully she makes the too perfect girl completely lovable if not completely realistic <UNK> <UNK> is also great as the too perfect girl's father carson drew he's an ideal father figure without being <UNK> perfect and he shows reasonable concern for his daughter as she gets into danger less likable is max <UNK> take on ned <UNK> <UNK> boyfriend i much preferred george <UNK> jr 's portrayal in the 1970's tv series starring pamela sue martin as nancy drew in which ned was a <UNK> awkward kid with a little crush on nancy the character of corky josh <UNK> a twelve year old with a crush on nancy is much less annoying than max <UNK> ned amy <UNK> and kay <UNK> seem appropriately cast as <UNK> gal pals <UNK> and george but they only make brief cameos at the beginning of the film br br speaking of cameos chris <UNK> snl eddie <UNK> <UNK> 13 and bruce willis all make surprise guest appearances which just proves you never can guess which movie bruce willis will pop up in next br br the movie does fail to live up to some potential it's mentioned early on that the <UNK> new house is heavily <UNK> trapped but nancy and her father are done with <UNK> over <UNK> traps a few minutes after that also nancy describes the cold case she's about to investigate as a murder taking place at an <UNK> party which should <UNK> plenty of potential murderers but she only encounter a handful of suspects and while there's some moments of real suspense during <UNK> adventures the solution to the case comes out of nowhere and in the end all possible plot threads are tied up too conveniently and who cares who done it ralph <UNK> score adds to the movie's suspense but the contemporary <UNK> songs woven into the soundtrack are lame still i really enjoyed this film and while the movie is aimed primarily at <UNK> girls people of any age and gender can enjoy it
<START> all good movies inspire some direct to video <UNK> flick i was afraid that gladiator wasn't really that good a film because i hadn't seen any movie that had anything remotely resembling anything roman on the new releases shelf for months then i spotted full <UNK> latest offering <UNK> i'm a fan of full <UNK> <UNK> series and blood dolls but had never seen one of their non killer puppet films anyway br br <UNK> chronicles what happens to a group of <UNK> in the mountains of the <UNK> one of the <UNK> james finds a cave with old gladiator <UNK> and feels <UNK> to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it on he becomes possessed and as the demonic gladiator <UNK> is <UNK> to kill his friends to revive the corpse who is the real <UNK> br br granted like many full moon films this has little or no budget at times the editing and direction was so amateurish i'd swear i was watching the blair witch project the attempts at <UNK> off of limbs and heads reminds me of a monty python skit the weapons although apparently real look really plastic y it literally looks like this was filmed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder on a weekend granted there's nothing wrong with such film making just don't rent this expecting a technical masterpiece it looks like there were attempts at research for the script too because even though <UNK> really doesn't act much like a gladiator until the end at least he speaks latin br br all <UNK> aside i actually enjoyed this film not as much as a killer puppet film perhaps but full moon still delivers the only thing that disappointed me was there was no full moon <UNK> at the end
<START> but sadly due to rights issues that almost certainly will never happen <UNK> of joe <UNK> commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet but they don't quite capture his <UNK> <UNK> delivery which was a real hoot nowadays joe bob real name john bloom is confined to doing the <UNK> features of such classics as i spit on your grave featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time and jason x one of the most <UNK> friday the 13th sequels of all time the series was never the same once it left paramount all i could think when they canceled it was damn where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping blonde jokes and horror trivia every saturday night does this mean i have to get a life now sadly it does but <UNK> always be a place in my horror hungry heart for <UNK> long live the drive in
<START> much underrated camp movie on the level of <UNK> woman etc <UNK> stills resemble <UNK> <UNK> sometimes subtle dialog and hidden <UNK> touches found throughout
<START> 1st watched 12 26 2008 <UNK> eugene levy corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers but this one by charles <UNK> nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts the story is about a couple of down and out traveling americans played by richard lewis and sean young who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the <UNK> return upon trying to return it they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the <UNK> <UNK> that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money they freak out and instead of <UNK> the police and telling them the truth they make out like <UNK> from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a <UNK> <UNK> gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story the other cast members include character actors john candy james belushi <UNK> shepherd george hamilton and others after the police find out about the death they start questioning the main characters and of course they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi shepherd couple this isn't a horrible movie it just isn't that good there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile try it maybe you'll like it probably you won't
<START> tim <UNK> is the praised author of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a novel that was put on the screen twice <UNK> and 'the <UNK> one of the dutch writer's more recent works is <UNK> <UNK> a psychological thriller about two totally different men <UNK> and <UNK> who meet at a youth camp and surprising enough become friends for dear life <UNK> is a quiet somewhat dull person who spends his time studying and writing <UNK> books <UNK> on the other hand is a charismatic <UNK> <UNK> a heavy drinking criminal whose <UNK> concern is to get a woman into his bedroom from the moment they meet <UNK> has a strong influence on <UNK> while the latter <UNK> him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like <UNK> ultimately <UNK> is even dragged by <UNK> into illegal practices himself which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country br br after having read the book last year i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it in my opinion the book suffers especially from the complex structure while <UNK> presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an <UNK> relationship between two people the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented <UNK> so that two <UNK> scenes are seldom in the same episode because of this the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her another complaint was the fact that the main characters <UNK> and <UNK> are a little stereotypical <UNK> is <UNK> dull intellectual while <UNK> is his exact opposite in real life such one dimensional people rarely exist in books and films they always seem to be there taking away a lot of credibility br br despite all this the film was a pleasant surprise being much better than the book the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography humour and acting <UNK> van <UNK> <UNK> is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting which is in my opinion the highest an actor can achieve the <UNK> of the film however are the same as the <UNK> mainly because the characters are one dimensional they are so predictable that it becomes annoying guess who wrote the script indeed <UNK> himself it is obvious that this talented director that's what the movie makes clear anyway is <UNK> by a <UNK> screenplay perhaps <UNK> should just have chosen a better book br br 7 10
<START> i gave it a 10 since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been <UNK> not to the reason i'm <UNK> you is to add a personal observation on <UNK> work br br i've seen homicidal and the <UNK> the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white a few times and the house on haunted hill many times br br even i am not old enough to have seen them when castle was up to his <UNK> tricks thus i can appreciate them for their own merit and while most pass him off as second rate <UNK> hammy etc i believe they do him a <UNK> br br the end sequence of homicidal is genuinely shocking and works today and the premise of the <UNK> while silly was highly original br br but the house on haunted hill was a triumph having used that frank lloyd wright house as its exterior the great vincent price and a solid cast plus a good score and production values when i first saw it at a packed late night showing in the late sixties it produced an audience reaction i'd not seen before and have not seen since br br it was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement if you've not seen the film stop reading now and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall br br with no <UNK> of what is coming the camera slowly pulls back forcing the audience to switch their <UNK> to i'm saying no more my spoiler <UNK> above only covers this movie br br the point is i believe this <UNK> was deliberate not accidental and when it happened the whole audience screamed including most of the men it took the audience about ten minutes to calm down br br now that is superior film making a flamboyant <UNK> he might have been but house and the other two films i've mentioned were good movies castle may not have been a hitchcock but he was no ed wood either br br it's easy to concentrate on someone's quirks and forget to examine their talent so i hope this documentary acknowledged that i look forward to seeing it
<START> zero day leads you to think even re think why two boys young men would do what they did commit mutual suicide via <UNK> their classmates it captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to <UNK> from common <UNK> in order to define their own mutual world via coupled destruction br br it is not a perfect movie but given what money time the filmmaker and actors had it is a remarkable product in terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide murderers it is better than <UNK> in terms of being a film that gets under our <UNK> skin it is a far far better film than almost anything you are likely to see br br flawed but honest with a terrible honesty
<START> presenting lily mars may have provided judy garland with one of the easier roles she had while at mgm because lily mars is definitely a character she could identify with a young girl with talent enough for ten she knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater no matter how much producer van <UNK> from her home town <UNK> her br br i really liked judy in this one as the girl determined to make it in the theater because it is judy garland with the talent of judy garland you in the audience know she has the right stuff even if it takes van <UNK> nearly the whole movie to be convinced br br both judy and <UNK> <UNK> from the same small town <UNK> dad was the town doctor who delivered her and <UNK> while he may have moved away and become a big producer on broadway their respective <UNK> fay <UNK> and spring <UNK> have kept in touch that's her <UNK> but <UNK> constantly <UNK> with <UNK> kids but never anyone quite like lily mars br br no real big song hits came out of presenting lily mars for garland though she sings all her numbers the best in the film is a revival of that <UNK> era <UNK> every little movement has a meaning all its own judy sings it with connie <UNK> playing the cleaning lady in a broadway theater where <UNK> show is being produced <UNK> was a star back in the days of the <UNK> girls and she and judy deliver the song in grand style with connie it's the best scene in the film as <UNK> encourages judy to keep at it composer karl <UNK> had died a long time ago but <UNK> otto <UNK> was still alive and i'm <UNK> he liked what he heard br br european musical star <UNK> <UNK> is in presenting lily mars as the show's star who's at first <UNK> then angry and finally understanding of garland and <UNK> she did a couple of films with mgm and then went back to europe for more work on the continent i'm <UNK> mgm didn't quite know what to do with her and her thick hungarian accent though louis b <UNK> never met a soprano he didn't like br br van <UNK> does well as the patient producer who puts up with a lot from garland and <UNK> <UNK> was just coming off his oscar for johnny eager the previous year and he and garland wouldn't appear to be an ideal screen team but they're not bad together br br presenting lily mars is a fine showcase for the talents of judy garland and she didn't have to share the screen in another <UNK> film with mickey rooney
<START> br br <UNK> of a virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it <UNK> <UNK> whatever meaning he wishes to its inexplicable <UNK> of sex and violence if this was an intentional characteristic of the film it would be a work of <UNK> brilliance but of course it isn't br br without getting too much into plot summary let's take a quick walking tour of the events at a secluded cabin an orgy is in progress which includes topless wrestling and <UNK> p ing a <UNK> of <UNK> joins the orgy in progress but they have <UNK> been followed by a monster i like to call the <UNK> ninja this monster <UNK> to <UNK> orgy participants one by one except the proverbial virgin if you don't count <UNK> sex who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate with desire that she <UNK> with someone's severed hand br br finally she has her guts pulled out and then there's a scene which seems to imply that she's pregnant with a baby <UNK> ninja got all that if you're going to rent this movie it's best if you don't speak japanese and don't have any subtitles in a season populated by boring hollywood flicks putting this in your vcr might be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy it will certainly be something different
<START> there were some scary scenes which i've always liked more than straight out gore but otherwise this movie was rather weak there were too many questions left unanswered and when they tried to explain anything in the movie it was still rather unclear after watching this movie i still seemed lost in a lot of ways it sort of reminded me of silent hill a few years back that movie was also unsatisfying but still better than this because it did try to work and the story did actually make sense this one not so much br br the acting for the most part in the abandoned was decent but the movie dragged on an on and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion like i said above there were some creepy scenes but otherwise this movie was a mess sorry i can't recommend it
<START> <UNK> is excellent in the way that <UNK> list was excellent a great watch for children and adults of all <UNK> big <UNK> can be seen as <UNK> towards <UNK> symbols in the same way that h r <UNK> n stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking your kids will love this movie i enjoyed it very much as a child my father showed me this movie as a child he enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated <UNK> were <UNK> symbols although at the time i had no clue about what those were the movie is comedy and adventure the storyline is wacky and cheerful i and you shall enjoy this together
<START> why this was an insipid uninspired and embarrassing film the embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made it <UNK> <UNK> why did they let these people do such a <UNK> movie there br br when this movie was originally to be released it was more of a romantic comedy and no <UNK> anything that all got changed along with <UNK> courtesy of disney why they did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character seeing matthew <UNK> make fun of his own movies was not fun either <UNK>
<START> at the beginning of the film you might double check the dvd cover and re read the synopsis a couple of times but no <UNK> it's not <UNK> of a geisha that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year <UNK> a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery he <UNK> the two lovers before doing some <UNK> <UNK> ritual suicide through <UNK> cut to present day when the american <UNK> in japan <UNK> a <UNK> family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago from then <UNK> this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional let's start with the good aspects namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all time favorite british horror <UNK> well together with <UNK> <UNK> linda hayden and ingrid pitt the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent <UNK> beyond <UNK> and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by <UNK> into the bodies of the new <UNK> and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff the spirit of the <UNK> <UNK> woman particularly enjoys <UNK> into <UNK> ravishing <UNK> and <UNK> her into a <UNK> <UNK> in this possessed state she even <UNK> the american <UNK> outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests so strictly spoken it's not really evil that <UNK> in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long dead hands obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the light blue and transparent <UNK> remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later <UNK> in <UNK> the house where evil <UNK> is probably the least scary ghost movie ever throughout most of the running time you'll be wondering whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films motel hell and from beyond the grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over the top like motel hell maybe but then again everyone in the cast continues to speak his her lines with a straight and sincere face so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed the house where evil <UNK> is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over sized <UNK> or are they <UNK> in the daughter's bedroom how totally random and irrelevant was that if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the <UNK> br br trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demon mask that was also a <UNK> piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic <UNK>
<START> well it was funny in spots this film is a 4 or maybe a 3 its a film that sits on the video shelf and <UNK> dust rent this one after you seen everything else beats boredom but not by that much my wife like like this film better then i do maybe its not that bad
<START> i saw the movie last night and i really wanted to like it my expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since i heard it was being made some days i'd see something spectacular and some days i'd be disappointed br br yet being the kind of fan i am i had high hopes for this movie but in the end i was sorely disappointed br br while i love the richard <UNK> movies i didn't like their sometimes campy nature or the changes they made to <UNK> character and his powers br br singer however chose to take the worst elements of the <UNK> movies and put them in his version br br while his lex luthor is slightly darker he's still nothing more than a <UNK> a <UNK> and a common criminal he's no more intelligent than when gene hackman played him kevin spacey does his best to play luthor well but ultimately he falls victim to shoddy writing and <UNK> dialog br br his henchmen are more two dimensional than even comic book henchmen most of them literally have no dialog in the movie br br spoilers ahead kitty <UNK> is almost exactly the same character as ms <UNK> she seems to be as evil and cold as lex luthor but she proves to be just an <UNK> who <UNK> after seeing superman in trouble and quite predictably betrays luthor br br the biggest disappointment in the movie was frank <UNK> as perry white i wasn't a huge fan of the over the top perry white in the <UNK> movies but at least he had a soul he was after all said and done a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story <UNK> perry white is nothing but a corporate <UNK> he wants everyone to concentrate on the superman related stories because they sell papers even though every other paper is doing the same thing he doesn't care about the real stories the real mysteries like the black out and what lex luthor is up to now that he's out of prison br br the worst thing about <UNK> is that he's dull some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an <UNK> that lets you know that still waters run deep frank <UNK> is <UNK> br br brandon <UNK> is not a bad actor he's ok but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie not the actor's fault his movements are clearly meant to look <UNK> like even the slightest movement of his fingers effects the way he flies but it still looks choreographed and artificial br br lois lane while badly written was surprisingly well acted by kate <UNK> unfortunately again for a <UNK> prize winning journalist and writer she is about as <UNK> as any teenage on <UNK> creek br br james <UNK> was my favorite actor in the whole movie mostly because he looks more like superman than even <UNK> without any <UNK> he manages to figure out lois <UNK> message flies a plane to the location gets on board <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> lois and her son br br the only moving moment in the movie is when they are all trapped <UNK> as it is <UNK> with water and the ship is sinking you see them slowly going being immersed in the water you know <UNK> going to come by at the last moment to rescue them but still you can't help but feel sorry for them br br as i said before the plot is very <UNK> unlike singer has said this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world as soon as he returns the world <UNK> him back with open arms lois is the only one who's not happy to see him back even luthor is happy to have superman back because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel br br superman is shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe a big green piece of <UNK> is stolen from a museum lex luthor is out of prison he now has knowledge about <UNK> powers and weaknesses and yet he's still not able to connect the <UNK> enough to know luthor would be using <UNK> against him br br according to the movie the only thing superman is good for is <UNK> really really heavy things the action sequences are all incredibly predictable
<START> i am surprised at <UNK> low rating of this movie with all due respect its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills a bigger budget and more gore br br the first <UNK> by people is that this is a horror film it is not nor does the film <UNK> you into believing it is one it is a psychological thriller it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie reel <UNK> review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie all the other negative reviews doesn't make much sense it's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change very rare these days is something bad and not worth it br br i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense martha was <UNK> herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning the evidence is all in the <UNK> and the fact that at first viewing we sympathize with this cold blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film's direction and writing br br i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the <UNK> range on originality alone i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale aka smart people since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy's nightmare br br kudos to the acting as well for such a low budget film you are amazed that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the great direction writing and acting please don't be fooled by the rating by imdb this movie is worth it i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice
<START> <UNK> was with the sound it sounded like it was all dubbed br br otherwise bad plot bad accents bad even <UNK> and we live in scotland acting bad <UNK> bad sex scenes bad <UNK> br br still we watched it until the end in disbelief how could such a good roll call of actors perform so badly will they ever get a decent job again br br bad bad bad by the way we gave it 3 because we at least were <UNK> to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot etc br br and to the older reviewer i totally agree it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s how did it get made in 2004 br br ok ok there were some ok bits they had a nice house in <UNK> <UNK> had a nice boat jennifer looked nice in a little outfit but how come the sister got all the men
<START> i wondered why john wood was not playing dr <UNK> until i watched the film bad plot bad science bad acting and overall a bad film please don't watch this film rent the original war games if you are feeling nostalgic br br i didn't like the <UNK> of the plot to beat the terrorist threat idea either in the first film w o p r was built because russia had <UNK> of <UNK> pointed at the u s a in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat politics aside one of the good thing about the first film was the <UNK> that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the <UNK> of war in the end no such insight is offered in this film
<START> i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out and to this day still do a simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an <UNK> literally straight out of <UNK> <UNK> it has actors that were more recognizable back in the day this shouldn't keep the viewer from giving it a <UNK> wayne crawford stars as the main character jake speed sure it might bite from certain elements of <UNK> the stone and indiana jones but this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the <UNK> i am surprised not too many people know about it it must have been overshadowed by other movies in the theaters back in <UNK> i watched it back then on cable tv it might be hard to find since it's out of print on both vhs and dvd i managed to get a dvd from ebay at less than 8 bucks cool flick
<START> nick and kelly are ready to be married but travis kelly's dog leads nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for kelly richard <UNK> and susan <UNK> play nick and kelly and make a good couple nick loves to drink smoke and play pool with the <UNK> for fun but nick suddenly <UNK> from this type of fun sex is the one thing that he loves because he wants a child we find out that an alien race is dying and needs to <UNK> with women from earth to save their population it becomes a battle of survival between humans and aliens with the dog population also being involved a fine film
<START> the <UNK> lake monster is easily one of the most awful amateurish film i've ever seen <UNK> right up there with <UNK> the hands of fate in terms of poor acting useless direction and <UNK> level production values in this movie a silly looking <UNK> stop motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in <UNK> <UNK> and begins <UNK> on the local <UNK> in the thrilling climax the creature described by one local as a giant alligator with <UNK> drags it's <UNK> bulk over the ground to chase its would be lunch before a <UNK> <UNK> it a couple of times it dies from boredom every character in this <UNK> is a complete moron one pointless subplot shows a <UNK> go into a <UNK> store to purchase a 4 75 <UNK> of <UNK> instead of simply buying the bottle the idiot shoots the <UNK> and another <UNK> shoots at a cop gets chased towards the lake all so that he can eaten by the monster unfortunate close ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of <UNK> there's a fake magician struggling with a phony british accent to make him seem more <UNK> two overly bumbling redneck boat <UNK> some cheesy pre historic cave art done in <UNK> and annoying <UNK> <UNK> background <UNK> in one painful scene the fake magician and his dopey wife girlfriend <UNK> manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by <UNK> on how may stars they can see in the night sky even though it is clearly day time still even on constant fast forward this <UNK> hurts and hurts bad <UNK> says call the <UNK> 'cause this cow pie really stinks <UNK>
<START> i rented this back in the 80's and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie only that it is the worst movie i have ever seen this isn't one of those it was so bad it was funny this isn't one of those it was so gory it leaves you with a bad feeling movies it wasn't even one of those what the heck was that movies i can't recall the performance of the actors but it was poorly shot the story was disjointed and it had no <UNK> style when it was over i was angry that i had wasted the time br br i've seen plenty of movies i didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures styles and or story telling but it was clear that those movies had some of those <UNK> the <UNK> has none br br i actually <UNK> not making a comment on this piece for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity but i am compelled to warn anyone who <UNK> film to skip this movie
<START> besides all of the technical mistakes br br how about a female flight attendant who's able to kill all by herself 4 out of the 7 terrorists including ex marines 2 of whom without even using a gun then she lands the plane perfectly we're not talking about <UNK> weaver or linda hamilton we're talking about a regular frightened yet very well composed flight attendant d how about the leader in charge of the assault rescue squad having a full proof according to the logic of the script plan of sleep <UNK> everyone and having someone from his team fly the plane only he decides at the <UNK> of the moment to change plans and instead lead an attack on the terrorists guns blazing not knowing where the terrorists are or how many and not <UNK> a position of advantage so that his whole team gets easily wiped out yeah that's using the old <UNK> only later to decide to use the sleep gas anyway and it turns out useless for all <UNK> purposes br br bad as this movie was though i couldn't stop myself from watching and wondering what next d i can't help but imagine all the excellent unemployed script writers thinking to themselves it's not fair lol d
<START> i saw the movie recently during the boston film festival the movie was very entertaining and is something that i believe the world and black america is ready to see it has comedy drama the soundtrack is great it is an all around good film the characters were well developed and the movie had a wide variety of prominent actors such as wood harris remember the <UNK> paid in full brian j white <UNK> 3 mr 3000 and the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pirates of the <UNK> the movie <UNK> many relevant topics in todays society in a short period of time and does so with class and grace this is not only a story about life in the hospital however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discovering who they are or who they are going to be
<START> or <UNK> at sea yet another ridiculously overrated old film with <UNK> quite talky too <UNK> basically plays the same character as in the <UNK> films always in control of a situation never nervous no matter how dangerous a situation calls women slim and <UNK> and other such nonsense is the only real male i e <UNK> male in the movie the only other <UNK> male male being the head of <UNK> but he is only a fat <UNK> male male and naturally every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction the character clichés are all here <UNK> is supposed to be the same type of <UNK> about to <UNK> as in casablanca and naturally he often refuses money or other <UNK> when being offered them but how does that fit in with the tough <UNK> in him it doesn't so he can't be a <UNK> <UNK> wanted it both ways a character who is both the cool lone <UNK> and yet a well meaning <UNK> i don't think so bacall does her non <UNK> cool babe routine for the first time and there are plenty of overrated not all too interesting so called sexual innuendo <UNK> between her and <UNK> these dialogues sound silly by today's standards just purse your lips and <UNK> a load of crap she was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day her <UNK> face with its sharp features is nowhere even close to <UNK> the kind of feminine beauty of a de <UNK> the <UNK> of a myrna loy let alone the <UNK> of an irene dunne bacall was more suited for playing vampires not femme <UNK> in real life she is very much like her face a hollywood bitch there is a scene in which bacall breaks into tears very <UNK> for her character there are two or three bad musical numbers but my fast forward button was ready br br if you're interested in reading my <UNK> of bogart bacall huston and other hollywood personalities contact me by e mail
<START> i saw this movie in 1979 i was 17 or 18 when it was released the theater was perhaps 1 4 full when the movie started ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theater the movie was really weird and had no plot or reason to its script and people <UNK> their money back we decided to stay for the entire movie why endure such torture here's why we wanted to be true movie critics to have a standard to base all other movies on it is hard to justify saying you have seen the best movie a 10 they always come up with something better but it is easy to be able to base all other movies off of the worst movie ever made and this is it a 1 at best there may be other movies out there that truly qualify as a 1 but i have yet to see them i now base all movies i see on a scale based on this worst i am a true movie critic he he
<START> a difficult film to <UNK> i was never giving it <UNK> concentration consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters what their roles were nor could i take the <UNK> seriously as film characters when their lines scenes were all in the style of one of his shows not acted out br br this is nothing more than a <UNK> episode of a discovery tv show with a largely insignificant sub plot going on which just seemed to get in the way however as any irwin show is always worth a watch this film is well worth a look too but not on christmas day talking of which i've better things to do too than be on here br br a high 4 10
<START> <UNK> is just another teen movie that's not really worth watching dave <UNK> <UNK> sam jason <UNK> and jeff michael c <UNK> are about to graduate from <UNK> university with <UNK> in lying cheating and scheming the three roommates have proudly <UNK> their way through the last four years of college and now during final <UNK> these big men on campus are about to be <UNK> by the most unlikely dude in school the plot is very stupid and there's no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while <UNK> is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre the comedy in <UNK> is either hit or miss but there's no real true funny or original moment in the movie its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny though for every joke that works there's at least eight more that don't the screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy even if they do they probably won't remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy jason <UNK> plays the freaky ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has <UNK> pretty low <UNK> king and <UNK> <UNK> are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film this is directed by <UNK> <UNK> and this is his first film so you can't blame him too much the funniest character was probably laura <UNK> though she's not in the movie very much the film is very short at only <UNK> minutes long however that may be too long for some people who don't really like this type of humor <UNK> isn't the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average when compared to other films in the genre there's a lot better out there such as not another teen movie american pie and its sequels scary movie 1 2 etc so unless you have seen most of them and you're looking for something new then <UNK> might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else rating 4 3 10 a below average teen comedy that's worth skipping
<START> honestly i find this film almost too depressing for my own good it is very depressing until pretty much the very end there is no way i can justify passing judgement to any character who did things i didn't like well except for the disgusting character played by <UNK> forrest but it's still so frustrating to see people behaving this way putting up walls around themselves when just a word or so could break the ice and promote healing br br a horrible tragedy strikes a montana family they believe they've lost one son but it turns out they've lost 2 the key is if they just communicate and face their grief together they won't end up losing their second son <UNK> br br but they just can't something is <UNK> this family from sharing their <UNK> some family <UNK> into silence and <UNK> while certain others point fingers of blame and then go ahead and cheat on their poor pregnant wife by <UNK> the pretty girlfriend of the deceased that andy character truly is a snake the only member of the family that isn't threatening arnold in some way is his grandpa <UNK> <UNK> grandpa seems to be able to speak to the boy without <UNK> or even kid <UNK> he seems to know what the child is thinking about even though arnold isn't saying much these days it is truly a <UNK> for the poor kid to have that one someone he can turn to no one else seems to grasp the fact that arnold might be in shock in denial or that his way of <UNK> may not be the same style or at the same speed as they would expect it's so easy to judge and to be angry and to feel someone is made of stone just because they don't <UNK> in a way we believe they ought br br the story is very quiet and <UNK> you're not going to get some <UNK> fed narration or some hollywood feel good resolution i was very concerned by the fact that this child was so <UNK> with guilt that he felt it necessary to <UNK> several hundred miles to apologize to that <UNK> <UNK> wife for something he should not blame himself for arnold may have accidentally killed his brother but nobody is responsible for the end of that marriage which apparently was a lousy one anyway except for the two people in the marriage it's only dumb luck arnold didn't get into the car with a <UNK> or a murderer br br robert duvall and glenn close are <UNK> effective as the parents who somehow cannot find it in themselves to communicate with their son to find out what arnold is going through jason <UNK> whom i've not seen anywhere else except for a childhood favorite called <UNK> and a creepy ghost story called the lady in white did an incredible job as arnold a great performance from a child actor br br aside from being somewhat slow at times the stone boy is an excellent and very depressing movie
<START> we all create our own reality or do we that is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the <UNK> nature of reality <UNK> eastern and <UNK> <UNK> with the visual <UNK> of m c <UNK> this fascinating <UNK> manages to take on the rather cerebral question of who are we and what is our place in the universe ' and turn it into a captivating and fun filled 100 minutes the film centers on bart a writer struggling with his screenplay the sea that thinks ' as he sits at his computer the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer writing the screenplay before long he is stuck in a <UNK> <UNK> in which everything he writes becomes reality director <UNK> de <UNK> approaches his subject with an <UNK> sense of humor and <UNK> the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and <UNK> of our perception ultimately de <UNK> film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses note after you've seen the movie check out the film's entertaining web site dutch with english subtitles eric moore
<START> while <UNK> the internet for previous sale <UNK> i ran across these comments why are they all so serious it's just a movie and it's not pornographic i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it i've shown it to many of my friends they all loved it too i feel <UNK> to own this original 1932 <UNK> black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known after reading the other comments i agree that the film is <UNK> big deal i only wish it was longer it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals for sale at least so i wonder how much it's worth
<START> <UNK> a space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp the film starts slowly the usual mix of idiots and high <UNK> mixed together into a dodgy soup but when the going gets tough the tough get themselves <UNK> out and it's not an un believable change in the characters as you can believe that there's some responsibility in their young minds br br the only flaw in the film is that kate <UNK> is extremely annoying as the i'm right and you're all wrong <UNK> i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 vote
<START> the <UNK> of <UNK> wings in the atlantic can <UNK> a <UNK> in the pacific according to this theory somehow related to the chaos theory i'm not sure exactly how every action no matter how small or insignificant will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters most of them in paris whose actions will affect each <UNK> lives the six degrees of <UNK> theory can be applied as well each story is a <UNK> of the jewel that is this film the acting is finely tuned and nuanced audrey <UNK> is <UNK> the stories <UNK> <UNK> the humor is just right and the viewer leaves the theatre <UNK> in <UNK>
<START> at least i was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since i was barely able to sit through it in all honesty my guess is the cover to the dvd case cost more than the entire movie and saying that it is the same director as the boogeyman when a new version of that just came out nice touch guys it was misleading enough to rope me in the only thing that frustrated me more than the <UNK> acting of the <UNK> was his <UNK> usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it the film looks like it was shot by a d <UNK> student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes sometimes less is more buddy through out i would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained all this makes a bad movie but when the ending doesn't even come close to pulling it together well that makes it an exceptionally bad movie without a doubt this is the worst movie i have ever seen and that includes my <UNK> french final video for senior year of high school but hey maybe i'm a bit biased i mean i did get to play an extra p s i don't even think this deserves a star not even a half none for you
<START> if you want mindless action hot chicks and a post apocalyptic view of seattle then this is the show for you br br the concept of dark angel isn't anything new in fact there's controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book but i spend the entire hour watching it every <UNK> from start to finish br br jessica alba is smoking and <UNK> friends original cindy <UNK> are just as hot br br the fight scenes are getting better but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better the <UNK> sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the <UNK> wrote it br br in my opinion dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for but if you're looking for hard hitting award winning drama go watch the west wing or something
<START> in <UNK> of brazil the father of the twelve years old illiterate maria <UNK> <UNK> sells his daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to be employed as a <UNK> and have a better life however the girl is <UNK> to the farmer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> her and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience then she is sent to a <UNK> in a gold field in <UNK> and explored his owner the despicable <UNK> antonio <UNK> when maria escapes to <UNK> de <UNK> expecting a better life she is explored by the <UNK> vera <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> do <UNK> exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in brazil through the fate of the girl maria last year i saw <UNK> 4 ever that tells an identical story in the former soviet union therefore this problem does exist in third world countries director and writer <UNK> <UNK> presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes it is the debut of the promising <UNK> <UNK> who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival most of the prostitutes are amateurs and it is impossible to recognize the famous <UNK> <UNK> so different she is after many plastic <UNK> the bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic my vote is ten br br title brazil <UNK> do <UNK> angels of the sun
<START> no didn't think so well in that case all you have to do is stay far far away from do you wanna know a secret as it's just the <UNK> pointless post scream slasher with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever the plot is extremely ridiculous the characters are <UNK> dumb the gore factor is <UNK> and the whole thing is just plain boring as you can <UNK> from the title already this film is mainly inspired by i still know what you did last summer as the events take place in a similar setting and the killer's motivations are equally stupid why anyone would want to steal ideas from junk like <UNK> is a complete mystery to me anyway at least that film could depend on the precious rack of jennifer love <UNK> whereas the girls in this junk are apart from brainless also terribly unattractive one year after the still <UNK> murder of her boyfriend beth morgan her new <UNK> lover and four other simple minded college students go to florida to spend their spring break holiday in a fancy beach house the killer hasn't made a move all year but now he follows the <UNK> to florida and starts <UNK> them whilst leaving behind the titular message as some sort of business card you really don't need to be a horror expert in order to quickly figure out which face hides behind the <UNK> ridiculous mask and the <UNK> attempts to put you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing since the plot is so thin most of the film is purely irrelevant padding including the sub plots regarding the incompetent <UNK> police force and the <UNK> fbi inspector who seems to have a personal score to settle the murder inexplicably happen off screen don't you hate it when that happens there isn't even any gratuitous t a to enjoy and you better don't get me started on the quality of the dialogs suffering through crap like this only makes you realize that the delightful spirit of the 80's slashers is gone for good
<START> please do not let the cover of this movie fool you and if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at this isn't it usually i will go for stupid if it's funny but this stupid was so stupid it almost or possibly did make me stupid br br the film quality is better than a <UNK> but not by much and it's quite possible the music was created by <UNK> the <UNK> 2 key on a <UNK> keyboard these problems should never really be a <UNK> from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing <UNK> cast and you have a real <UNK> br br the story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in texas for the weekend he also <UNK> the <UNK> to his lady crush in his office on the way there they meet a female in distress who is then invited to come along by the other girls br br the stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's <UNK> are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house br br from there you the audience and the morons um actors try to figure out what's going on and they soon begin to <UNK> one another overall i think i have made it sound better than it is the main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped the plot contrived the acting bad and the motivations clueless once more this could be <UNK> it it was the least bit funny but alas it is not br br the twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway please don't let this review stop you from seeing the <UNK> <UNK> of this movie <UNK> my nose just grew eight <UNK>
<START> i found this movie quite by accident but am happy that i did kenneth branagh's performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson <UNK> star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life she made it so believable if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women <UNK> themselves up for roles <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did trust me it is worth the lost sleep
<START> in our household like everyone else who has commented on this movie my brothers 7 4 years old at the time and i 10 would watch this movie over and over again we all loved star wars but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure we all loved the <UNK> and would sing at the top of our <UNK> with him during his song there are some slow moments the time spent with king <UNK> <UNK> in his court and we generally got bored after the <UNK> song the reason that i sound effect is because i <UNK> you but we loved the journey to rescue <UNK> and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of king <UNK> <UNK> floating there <UNK> the entire horizon laughing <UNK> at the end i still to this day sing <UNK> for me <UNK> of gay paris around my friends i'm 33 now who just look at me as if i've lost my mind however when i'm singing it i'm 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of star wars
<START> ronald colman plays a famous broadway actor who has begun to lose his mind and sense of identity after years of playing a wide range of parts he can't remember who he exactly is who are his roles and who is the self and much more serious he begins to see and hear his play even in regular everyday life so since he's currently playing in othello he begins to act jealous and suspicious just like the title character ultimately it leads him to the depths of insanity and murder br br i saw this film years ago and liked it i just saw it again and loved it now perhaps some of my enthusiasm is because i have always liked ronald colman and this is a great triumph for him and for which he earned the best actor oscar and looking at the competition that year gregory peck for <UNK> <UNK> john garfield for body and soul william powell for life with father and michael redgrave for mourning becomes <UNK> i think colman was a very good choice as he stretched from his usual comfort zone and did a much more demanding role br br now i noticed that one reviewer hated this film because they hated shakespeare and this took up about half their review talking about their dislike for him however this film isn't really about shakespeare and it doesn't matter at all if you dislike shakespeare i am no huge fan of shakespeare but <UNK> at the small portions of the play that colman re <UNK> though as i said this is not a really movie about shakespeare instead it's a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind and mixing his stage role with reality it could have been any play though othello was an excellent choice because of the murder scene which gets acted out for real later in the film br br overall a very clever film due to a lovely script with some overtones of film noir fortunately the acting was terrific also as colman had excellent support from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> winters and <UNK> o'brien who was particularly good he played his part just right and considering the great george <UNK> was directing it's no wonder it's a wonderful film from start to finish
<START> it really is that bad of a movie my buddy rented it because he well is an idiot but then again i must be an idiot too because i watched the whole damn thing the actors were on par with high school drama <UNK> who think that are going places the only place they will be going is back to waiting tables at <UNK> all i could think of while i was watching this gem was how it actually got made i mean some screenwriter actually thought that this premise was fresh original and <UNK> then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to <UNK> some cash over with the naive <UNK> that he was going to make a return on it actors were cast locations were <UNK> make up artists were hired computer animators fresh out of al collins graphic design school were brought in and this turd started to take form br br there obviously were a ton of things that i hated about this move but the one thing the drove me the <UNK> was the <UNK> of music every single minute of this flick was scored there was not a single break in music and at times it was mixed higher than the dialogue not that it made you miss some vital plot point or anything br br after it was over we decided to watch <UNK> river it was like driving a 1980 <UNK> <UNK> rabbit then switching to a <UNK> <UNK> you couldn't get two more opposite movies in terms of quality
<START> a very enjoyable film that features characters who do bad things and who let emotions like anger and a desire for vengeance bubble over the cast is very good there's plenty of action and stewart gets the girl and his revenge with a twist in the end i've seen this film several times and always watch when it's on <UNK> or cable highly recommended
<START> when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the low rating was absolutely correct br br i am a big fan of the wayans brothers i loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks little man however had very few laughs and the jokes were stale br br obviously the joke will <UNK> around marlon wayans who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison he and his partner tracy morgan steal a diamond meant for a gangster things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and <UNK> washington in order to get the diamond back the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples <UNK> of course he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond br br the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live like molly shannon and rob schneider as well from in living colour all these talents however cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny br br the special effects to make marlon wayans to look like a midget was ok i mean it was not 100 believable but it was ok nothing great i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses br br wait for it on cable or television it really is not worth any amount of money
<START> this is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used in making this joke i personally don't care one way or another about jessica simpson and her talent or whatever so many people find fascinating about her just as a movie this is something that wouldn't even get a passing grade in film school the script is a mess the acting is atrocious and the fact luke wilson co writer of bottle rocket did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking he did old school for crying out loud this doesn't even belong in the same state as my old school dvd please for whatever reason do not watch this i see there is a comment that this is so bad it's good but that frankly is too kind when will we stop seeing singers that obviously can't act keep trying to i hope ends soon the worst part is that there are actually some decent actors penelope ann miller rachel leigh cook luke wilson who are part of this dump as far as the plot well it is almost non existent and so poorly done and written yes i know it's another rehash i very much doubt anyone will remember anything about this please whatever you do don't waste your time but if you do feel sorry for the actual actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb jessica simpson you're pretty but stick to singing although i'm not much a fan of that either and whoever did this film i wouldn't put this on your resume 1 10 because you can't give a zero
<START> there's never a dull moment in this movie wonderful visuals good actors and a classical story of the fight of good and evil mostly very funny sometimes even scary a true classic a movie everybody should see
<START> first nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ghost trains as a child second the main actress <UNK> christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future third this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors <UNK> all those cameron <UNK> eva <UNK> and how ever the names of these <UNK> <UNK> lights are mrs christian is not a light but a sun br br however dark remains is also of considerable <UNK> importance they idea that photographs shows creatures of the <UNK> reign between reality and imagination that are not visible with <UNK> own eyes is not new but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality by which reality turns into a sign but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the real reality can being a sign the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects i e the sign behaves like an object now in our usual world of perception it is common that objects change signs f ex if someone grows a bird his photograph will show him with beard not without as it did before but the opposite the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man this is very simply expressed the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison in this movie this is new and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and <UNK> effects and features that are already well known mostly since the silent time
<START> if you want to see a mystery don't watch this though there are elements straight out of <UNK> leonard territory this comes closer to an episode of <UNK> since the filmmaker focuses on character development i e long boring talks between stupid un involving characters some people can make fascinating movies without real action see <UNK> but not this one avoid it especially if you like the actors involved in this one
<START> it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie since so many people loved it i found it foul and vulgar i haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill the humor is <UNK> and crude i am not a politically correct person and even i found the gay jokes not only not funny but downright offensive i'm not gay the main character in the movie is not even a likable person just pathetic when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see
<START> what made the original killer tomatoes fun was it was made by people with no budget who were just being wacky for a couple of days br br this was something with a budget but it just wasn't as much fun john <UNK> of adams family fame is actually making an effort here to be comedic but he is supported by lame actors cheap special effects and unfunny gags br br the plot dr <UNK> <UNK> escapes from a french prison and decides he is going to put a <UNK> on the throne of france the hero his french girlfriend and the <UNK> like fuzzy <UNK> decide they are going to stop him br br forgettable direct to video nonsense
<START> what <UNK> of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars answer too many this movie isn't like that it is a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both likable and unlikable br br downside br br not enough character development some plot lines left <UNK> in the wind br br upside br br forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives br br well acted by scott cohen judd <UNK> susan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and elliot <UNK> br br contains some good lighthearted humor
<START> first some background i am english and have lived in london all my life i have been to many games at 'the <UNK> and most other london club grounds i am familiar with the type of person who gets into <UNK> and i know just how they act and how they speak have to say this is a bad bad movie i can tell you that green street is one of the most unrealistic movies i have ever seen i spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment i felt i should write a mini review because i felt i needed to point out a few things br br a people just don't talk like that in london in real life the filmmakers took the whole <UNK> thing too far and made it sound stupid unfortunately <UNK> types do exist but those you see in green street are more like parodies b the actor who plays pete <UNK> charlie <UNK> unfortunately sounded about as <UNK> or <UNK> as <UNK> bin laden he's from up north in <UNK> and i'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him how are we supposed to take him seriously why they didn't just get someone from east london to play that part is beyond me i could have done 'a bang up <UNK> myself <UNK> c mr <UNK> i mean how can i be expected to take seriously <UNK> wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty <UNK> he'd be dead simple as that honestly as a brit it was hard to watch this film i'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the uk it may do a little better in the states because the americans just wont know or care how inaccurate it is br br please my american and foreign friends don't believe a word of this nonsense yes these <UNK> do exist but it's all extremely underground and <UNK> <UNK> and on a vastly smaller scale the movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in london usually they try to film these things in <UNK> <UNK> or something and expect us all not to notice
<START> a must see movie for anyone who ever went to camp or wanted to this film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about it is funny it is compassionate it makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits begin to role if you have not seen this movie what are you doing get off you butt and run the video store have a great summer
<START> wealthy widower anthony <UNK> as alan cunningham is a <UNK> lover and british lord he brings sexy red haired women to his castle where he <UNK> and murders them black <UNK> stripper erika <UNK> as <UNK> gets away <UNK> mr <UNK> is haunted by wife evelyn who died in <UNK> as therapy he decides to marry again after meeting pretty blonde <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> by the end of the movie they will have had to dig a few more graves the night evelyn came out of the grave is great title at least br br la <UNK> che evelyn <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1971 <UNK> <UNK> anthony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> erika <UNK>
<START> i used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made it had much the charm of get smart while it admittedly had its faults it was rather enjoyable br br naturally i was very interested in seeing the film version that was before i saw it <UNK> i wished it had never been made br br besides being miscast all around who on earth though <UNK> was even close to the role it just didn't make the grade br br the effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing i liked about the movie seeing a live action version of the <UNK> in action what was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting br br the original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude it was fun the motion picture became murky and took itself far too seriously if it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a cartoon on film it might have been enjoyable br br as it exists it doesn't deserve to be considered part of the gadget legacy
<START> one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and <UNK> happened to be on i watched way too much of it it is indeed hilarious and horrifying really think about it this way if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to <UNK> it in as terrible a fashion as this how long exactly would you last not as long as this movie it's a must see obviously
<START> the title should have been the walker the guy <UNK> 90 of the movie walking he doesn't know what he wants or what he is go through life stealing peoples identity for nothing he gets no benefit no money nothing pretending to be another person br br no body was able to understand why he was pretending to be somebody else br br the only thing that was clear in this movie is that he love his father and was a good son but the rest was crap br br may be director is a <UNK> that would like to be somebody else but what he really should do is to get a real job because after his movie i don't think he has a chance to make as a movie producer
<START> this film along with <UNK> <UNK> are my favorite <UNK> directed films and i enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred louise brooks such as <UNK> box it's probably because both are very similar to the neo <UNK> films that the italians <UNK> in the 1940s and 50s this style film called for using non actors just typical folks in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films br br in this case the film is about french and german coal <UNK> so appropriately the people in the roles seem like <UNK> not actors the central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the franco german border instead of one big mine it is divided at the border and german workers are not welcome in the french mine despite there being greater <UNK> in germany this language differences illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene and wwi <UNK> to create a huge <UNK> between the <UNK> resulting in a we vs they mentality later an explosion causes a huge collapse in the french and the germans refuse to sit back and do nothing <UNK> their own lives they prove that there is true <UNK> between <UNK> and men in general br br the film is a strong criticism of <UNK> and tried in vain to get the german audiences to see the <UNK> of war and hatred it was a <UNK> moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images i have ever seen considering history though the film's impact was minimal at best it's a real shame as like this one <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and all quiet on the western front <UNK> had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively <UNK> public opinion so from a historical point of view it's an amazing and sad <UNK> that is well worth seeing
<START> this must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men how can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story <UNK> not such a difficult task first of all a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> non of any <UNK> is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch this one lacks all these things too much light the spots oh my god why in the name of christ <UNK> was that about br br every time dracula came about he was <UNK> by light in the script to keep him weak for the record just weak there was only one scene that made it almost worth watching near the ending of the movie <UNK> <UNK> with dracula and his new conquest i really enjoyed the first one the <UNK> twist was <UNK> original but this one's just not good not in any way hopefully the third one will cary the vampire signature i like so much in other classics like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dracula or even interview with the vampire
<START> soldier blue is a movie with <UNK> <UNK> to be some sort of profound statement on man's <UNK> to man on the white man's exploitation of and brutality towards <UNK> peoples a biting <UNK> and <UNK> commentary on the horrors of vietnam well sorry but it fails miserably to be any of those things what soldier blue actually is is <UNK> trite badly made <UNK> rubbish br br another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies what it is basically is a lame clichéd poorly acted odd couple romance <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and falling in love ah bless <UNK> by two sickening <UNK> which wouldn't have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick br br there is no excuse for the repulsive <UNK> gore <UNK> climax in which cute little native american children are <UNK> shot <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in loving and graphic close up and large <UNK> native american women are <UNK> raped and strung up no excuse that is except box office the massacre itself whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention is very badly staged and shot a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint <UNK> on them <UNK> with a few special effects sequences of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> incidentally which <UNK> real <UNK> in their filming now that's what i call exploitation br br forget all the <UNK> you've heard including the ludicrous <UNK> that begin and end the movie about this being a protest an <UNK> of american brutality towards the native peoples this film doesn't give a stuff about the plight of the <UNK> had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters would have led us to get to know and to care about the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who get slaughtered at the climax instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of <UNK> and <UNK> lousy actors both in this at least with plenty of blood guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious br br which is a terrible shame because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre about all of the real life <UNK> the us and britain and all so called <UNK> nations have <UNK> in over the centuries iraq this just isn't that movie
<START> billy crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face or perhaps just one they call it comedy i say it's a waste of my time
<START> this low budget erotic thriller that has some good points but a lot more bad one the plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife being a soft core film that <UNK> her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects as plots go for this type of genre not to bad the script is okay and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 am watching this not to notice too many plot holes but everything else in the film seems cheap the lead actors aren't that bad but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad one girl seems like she is drunk and or high the cinematography is badly lit with everything looking grainy and ugly the sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying the worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching it the sex the reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in red shoe diary situations the sex scenes aren't hot they're sleazy shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it the woman also look like they are <UNK> from a porn shoot i'm not trying to be rude or mean here but they all have that breast <UNK> and a burned out <UNK> look even the title <UNK> obsession sounds like a hardcore flick not that i don't have anything against porn in fact i love it but i want my soft core and my hard core separate what ever happened to actresses like shannon <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shannon <UNK> and kim dawson women that could act and who would totally <UNK> you and what happened to b erotic thrillers like body chemistry <UNK> and even stripped to kill sure none of these where masterpieces but at least they felt like movies plus they were pushing the <UNK> going beyond hollywood's relatively <UNK> stance on sex sexual <UNK> and <UNK> now they just make hard core films without the hard core sex
<START> spoilers when undercover brooklyn north <UNK> eddie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was to meet his drug <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> larry <UNK> in the <UNK> section of brooklyn in a buy and bust operation with <UNK> being the one who gets <UNK> that things went <UNK> with both <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ending up getting shot and killed by each other during the deadly shootout an innocent <UNK> six year old james bone jr <UNK> <UNK> was also killed in the cross fire br br with new york city <UNK> to host the 1996 <UNK> presidential convention that summer that last thing that the city's flamboyant mayor <UNK> al pacino wanted was a possible riot over young james bones tragic death by a possible in was later determined that it was a bullet from <UNK> gun that killed young james member of the new york city police department br br what was far more shocking then even <UNK> death is that his killer <UNK> <UNK> was given <UNK> by the well respected ny state judge walter stern martin <UNK> when he should have been put behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with a <UNK> of cocaine in the <UNK> of his car it soon became evident that the person who got judge stern his job for a 50 000 00 payoff was non other the brooklyn political boss frank <UNK> danny aiello it's <UNK> who's involved with mayor <UNK> in a land deal involving the new york subway system that would bring him and his real estate friends <UNK> of millions of dollars over the next two years it would also <UNK> connect mayor <UNK> in the bone killing by connecting him to judge stern who made it possible for <UNK> be be free who's a mutual friend of both him and his <UNK> or <UNK> frank <UNK> br br to keep all this from blowing up the late <UNK> <UNK> is framed by working undercover without the authority from his superiors in the bone shooting in fact those framing <UNK> go as far and hiding some 40 000 00 in cash in his <UNK> summer home making it look like he was being paid off by <UNK> uncle mafia boss paul <UNK> anthony <UNK> for letting his nephew deal drugs with him getting a piece of the action which may well explain him as well as <UNK> getting shot by <UNK> <UNK> on his paying <UNK> off br br as things turn out it's mayor <UNK> deputy in city hall kevin <UNK> john cusack who ends up messing everything up for his boss by being too honest in finding who was responsible in covering up <UNK> criminal record that allowed him to be out on the streets the facts that kevin <UNK> lead straight to frank <UNK> a major political <UNK> of mayor <UNK> who as it turned out was connected by the hip to <UNK> mafia <UNK> uncle paul br br a bit over plotted city hall does show how big city corruption can <UNK> up as well as down to everyone in city government without them like mayor <UNK> even knowing about it mayor <UNK> biggest sin was that he was friends with brooklyn boss <UNK> who was putting people into jobs like judge stern who were subjected to being <UNK> from <UNK> real boss <UNK> paul <UNK> br br spoilers it only took a deadly shootout in <UNK> to set everything into motion not by only <UNK> besides <UNK> <UNK> and james bone being killed but why he was allowed to be out on the street in order to bring the very popular new york city mayor down mayor <UNK> was looking forward to much bigger things like <UNK> or even president in his future political <UNK> as it turned out his top deputy kevin <UNK> in not looking the other way was responsible for his demise as well as that of the <UNK> good friend frank <UNK> and the person whom he helped put on the <UNK> as a state judge judge stern who's decision in letting <UNK> <UNK> off made this whole disaster which resulted in at least a half dozen murders and one suicide possible
<START> i didn't even bother finishing the movie because i was so bored i thought i was going to pass out i was watching it in the movie theaters and me and my friends just got tired so we got up and left to another movie if i ever have to sit through 2 min of that movie again i think i'm going to shoot myself and i do know the whole entire movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and i wasn't surprised at all i mean who didn't know she was going to do the right thing and let him be happy i mean for real you would have to be a complete idiot not to know that i know i didn't miss anything and if somebody <UNK> me to see that movie i would say over my dead body
<START> in a word this film was boring it lacked life and spark a big problem is with the two leads jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever he was boring and she was annoying br br the visuals were interesting but they didn't enhance the scenes if anything the visuals tended to <UNK> the audience from what was happening on screen none of the action sequences felt real and hence the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger br br the film had potential but it needed a better script better acting and a better director i kept thinking during the film you know this movie would've worked if harrison ford was sky captain karen allen was polly and steven spielberg was the director br br ignore the critical <UNK> for this film the critics i think are <UNK> the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels
<START> i bought this movie and after i watched it i decided that i did not care for it the acting was bad was the principal a robot he had no personality and his facial expression didn't change through the whole movie at times the voices didn't match up people talking and their lips didn't even move
<START> spoiler alert personally i don't understand why pete did not help to save williams life i mean that would be great to know why william was motivated or forced i think secret service members are every day people and there is a <UNK> the writer was a member of the secret service now he's motivations are clear well known but as a rental this film will not satisfy you cause the old but used twists the average acting these are just things in this film only for keep you wait the end clark johnson as the director of s w a t did a far better work like this time and i still wondering how the producers for example michael douglas left this film to theaters
<START> i've now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back <UNK> film isn't just poor its dire it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made br br i regret watching this film br br <UNK> <UNK> its a race issue apparently white people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors mate i think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel br br please stop making crap films
<START> a friend of mine recommended this movie <UNK> my vocal and <UNK> similarities with des <UNK> the movie's main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more i'm not very sure whether or not that's <UNK> portrayal br br this is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a <UNK> similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love stories br br in general i'm a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core <UNK> and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most <UNK> guy but there's something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
<START> this is the first review i've wrote for imdb so bare with me but i caught this flick on hbo and was sure glad i watched it richard gere is great in this film as the passionate agent detective who <UNK> the rules to get the job done i think the story is great and there's never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex <UNK> are pretty shocking but if you've ever seen a crime film like <UNK> you'll be able to stomach the scenes just fine br br so all in all if you're looking for a good detective suspense movie ignore the low rating this movie got on imdb and definitely watch it
<START> i can't say this is the worst film of all time but only because there are still some movies i haven't seen yet this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time the director suffers from the same issues he had with there will be blood though he wasn't quite as bad in that film the whole movie it feels like you're watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities it's like he sits in his little director's chair and thinks how would a great filmmaker handle this scene he just doesn't have it in him i don't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker there were certainly some <UNK> of greatness that could have been polished but nothing was brought to <UNK> the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history one by one as we see the characters singing and i <UNK> in my seat i kept saying please please just don't have the guy on the brink of death singing too sure enough massive failure
<START> i've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time this one however takes the cake more comedy than horror full moon high puts the c in cheese fest the star quality in this movie is not bad just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill adam arkin plays tony an all american high school football player of the 50's who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in <UNK> the most annoying part of the movie was the <UNK> player he drove everyone <UNK> ed <UNK> plays his ultra conservative father who met his end of his own bullet <UNK> father alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game after all these years tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack and then he'll get the chance to catch in his state more laugh than blood shed this movie is just a start in the 80's teen wolf was an improvement from this 1 out of 5 stars
<START> this movie was excellent a bit scary but excellent at that for those of you that have heard of <UNK> and know the story it gives you a idea of what and why these kids did what they did in the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff but you never realize just how bad it is and this movie makes you realize it's seriously that good it also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone that's for sure i read a book on the <UNK> massacre and it made me think this movie makes me worry and scares me to death on the downside it's like a how to kill someone guide for serial killers i recently received a threat and i blew it off thinking nothing of it but after this movie i think you should take everything seriously some people are crazy and you never truly know which they are so take it seriously and don't under <UNK> someone
<START> feeding the masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard earned dollars suggestion keep your hard earned dollars and let's just say that good old <UNK> took one for the team on this one guess what the plots about zombies taking over this time though for the sake of originality this film takes place in <UNK> island and to be honest i'm not sure i've ever seen a zombie flick based in <UNK> island a tv station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal <UNK> so that any remaining citizens won't think that there's any problem in the world that is those that never look or go outside anyway i will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film there is actually somewhat of a story to this but i'm not bothering with that because after a while you'll either not care or have fallen asleep at any rate this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the seen it all before stuff that gets <UNK> out before the camera trust me you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this 3 out of 10
<START> this was a real guilt pleasure i saw the trailer and all the advertising so i figured <UNK> not check out this <UNK> movie ' and as they used to say on t v 'i can't believe i watched the whole thing ' quinn and harris were believable <UNK> boys and although the accents were sort of over the top and difficult to <UNK> at times i found the dialogue believable as well the film touched upon the <UNK> relationship of <UNK> <UNK> and showed how deep down they were simply two guys who grew up close together and shared a passion for music coming at it though with different sets of issues and personal needs you find yourself wishing they'd <UNK> in the cab to snl for an <UNK> reunion that would have knocked the world's <UNK> off but you also gain a greater appreciation for why they didn't
<START> not only does this movie have a poor plot bad direction and terrible acting its opens up a whole new meaning to racism br br in this film white chicks are the <UNK> white boys are the <UNK> be gangsters and successful yes again white <UNK> are revolting toilet <UNK> br br i just wonder what would happen if i made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script only i made it about <UNK> he dude its good to finally see <UNK> stopped dating those black chicks br br nobody seems to notice it but watch this film again and you'll vomit at how they have portrayed the new zealand white boys all of a sudden its white folks who are the main cause of gang <UNK> and <UNK> out for a quick bang only <UNK> girls have a heart there's no such thing as a non <UNK> white girl br br it <UNK> me that they couldn't make this film without giving the <UNK> community in new zealand a repulsive profile if you think i'm <UNK> go watch this film and see what you make of the white boys just because <UNK> choose to call us white boys in actual life doesn't mean its funny if i said hey black boy i'll loose my teeth br br don't see this movie don't waste your money don't be racist
<START> i am an avid fan of violent exploitation cinema who would never attack a film for being violent or disturbing i consider cannibal holocaust a masterpiece and will always defend controversial films like day of the woman or last house on the left as genuine classics anyone who <UNK> through my other user comments will notice that i am actually very pro violence gore when it comes to films however i do think that there should be at least some point to the violence this piece of crap doesn't have any point whatsoever the first film in the notorious guinea pig series the devil's experiment 1985 is widely controversial but as opposed to many other controversial films this stinker has nothing at all to be recommended for i must say that before seeing any of the <UNK> pig films i already had a feeling that i would hate this one knowing what it was about due to its status as one of the most controversial films around however i decided i had to see it i am very glad i didn't waste any money on this pile of crap and i sure wish i hadn't wasted my time with it either br br this <UNK> story i don't even want to call it a <UNK> it doesn't have one three <UNK> torture a woman to death for some excruciating 40 minutes that's it there is no artistic value no <UNK> story no suspense nothing simply the disbelief that a film that shows nothing except for a woman being tortured for no reason enjoys an enormous cult following it is disturbing i give it that of course it is disturbing to watch a torture video for 40 minutes what is more disturbing however is the fact that many people actually seem to regard this pile of garbage as some kind of masterpiece i really cannot figure why the fact that the gore effects look realistic cannot be the reason i hope the girl who plays the victim isn't a very good actor and <UNK> very calm to all the torture that makes the film look less realistic which is in this single case a good thing this is a film that is sickening not for its gore but for its <UNK> its existence for the sole purpose of showing 40 minutes of torture br br i strongly <UNK> any form of censorship since this is 100 fake and nobody got hurt during its production it is legitimate to make such a film however i cannot think of a single reason why anyone would like this other than the morbid desire to watch suffering and the enjoyment of torture this film's sequel flowers of flesh and blood gained <UNK> when actor charlie sheen <UNK> it for an actual snuff film and informed the fbi <UNK> the film turned out to be fake overall the devil's experiment is a fake torture snuff film that seems to have the sole purpose of looking as close to a real snuff film as possible br br the devil's experiment is one of the worst films i have ever had the misfortune of sitting through don't torture yourself by giving this piece of crap a try for its controversial status do yourself a favor and avoid it zero stars out of 10 i wish there was a negative scale in order to appropriately rate this pile of crap
<START> having seen three other versions of the same film i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest primarily due to scott's rather dull and <UNK> performance his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film <UNK> <UNK> portrayed the role infinitely better when scrooge was at his <UNK> you don't get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he <UNK> his <UNK> he is similarly unconvincing i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the <UNK> <UNK> version even the musical version and frankly the muppets take on this are better executed very disappointing
<START> i saw the the bourne ultimatum last summer with a friend and wow i had already seen the first two films and i liked them but ultimatum i loved br br matt damon plays jason bourne a <UNK> suffering cia agent on the run trying to discover who he is br br like i already said i loved this movie from start to finish no plot holes slow scenes everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films but in all senses it was much better br br best stunts car chases actors and effects i've seen in an action movie all summer surprisingly due to spider man 3 pirates etc but i it wasn't just action in this film jason doesn't just kill and run he has a soul and the audience feels for him so drama is included but that doesn't slow it down br br of all the <UNK> that came out last summer this was the best
<START> october sky is a highly <UNK> movie and <UNK> easy to see why the story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs especially jake <UNK> and chris cooper the hero finally gets what he wants and <UNK> a true story frankly i think the <UNK> achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story <UNK> we <UNK> see any special narrative or cinematography the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters we feel <UNK> desire to earn his <UNK> recognition and create his own future and his <UNK> wins our respect <UNK> <UNK> reminds me of a later 2001 japanese production of mini series <UNK> boy <UNK> which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison when october sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny <UNK> <UNK> offers a more <UNK> description that could sometimes <UNK> an <UNK> criticism of modern society starring the outstanding actor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> focuses on three men as ordinary as can be a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut a <UNK> advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his <UNK> complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother like what homer feels in his family and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea the <UNK> social consciousness <UNK> its definition of success on its <UNK> and steps further to force them <UNK> their dreams by claiming them <UNK> <UNK> to compensate for his lost ideal <UNK> <UNK> works in the tour <UNK> because <UNK> called <UNK> <UNK> when his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him he finally finds strength from his <UNK> words who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed <UNK> i <UNK> regret it <UNK> his father told <UNK> <UNK> least i tried <UNK> it is his <UNK> confession that encourages him to <UNK> his job and apply for <UNK> despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair <UNK> effort finally fails and he goes back to the travel agency but his <UNK> courage <UNK> his friends and everyone loves him more just before the end of the series <UNK> is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about <UNK> after the tour is over we see him <UNK> against a tree unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the <UNK> board that says <UNK> wanted for 2004 <UNK> <UNK> looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs just like a kid looking at his ticket to <UNK> <UNK> may never get what he wants but he <UNK> his destiny and <UNK> does it <UNK> this series is so heart gripping not because the hero <UNK> any heroic deeds but his <UNK> and <UNK> urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy unlike <UNK> or other sarcastic <UNK> this show <UNK> us and teaches us something homer and <UNK> both have the dream and they do what they can despite other <UNK> opinions i recommend other imdb users to see the japanese tv series if you are a nine to <UNK> you will feel more touched i feel sorry that imdb <UNK> have its data maybe you can ask somebody from japan to help you
<START> as a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period it's almost a must see and rates a 9 as a variety show i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard captain midnight <UNK> who plays the colonel in charge of the event what surprised me was the stunning performance of doris day outside of <UNK> <UNK> i've never seen her put over a song better than she does here randolph scott is memorable as well even if he doesn't see much screen time it's been a while since i saw the movie but i was almost sure <UNK> bogart put in an appearance with so many familiar faces it's hard to keep track if it ever turns up on a tv station near you be sure to catch the doris day sequence if nothing else br br
<START> i saw this on tv the other <UNK> or rather i <UNK> over to another channel every so often to watch <UNK> when i couldn't stand watching it any longer it was bad really really bad not so bad it's good just flat out bad how did it get <UNK> who thought this was a good idea an actor friend of mine <UNK> and was told he wasn't good enough to play a bad guy but i think what they meant was save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of i bet the rest of the cast had been given the option to be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake american <UNK> the shooting was <UNK> the action was awkward and stilted the dialog was inane by far the saddest thing was ship in real life the <UNK> ferry is a <UNK> boat and on film it doesn't <UNK> up well instead of trying very <UNK> to make it look like a new <UNK> liner with bits of <UNK> wrapped around <UNK> <UNK> i kid you not they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the <UNK> dumb dumb dumb don't watch this movie not even as a joke
<START> citizen x tells the story of the butcher of <UNK> <UNK> for a <UNK> and perverse russian serial killer who claimed <UNK> lives from 1978 <UNK> the film focuses on the <UNK> detective rea who <UNK> pursued the killer against all odds in the face of an <UNK> <UNK> in self serving and convenient denial an hbo product for t v the film offers a solid cast good performances <UNK> the audience much of the grisly details but plays out like a <UNK> sans the <UNK> of similar hollywood fare an even and straight forward <UNK> of a serious and <UNK> little known story more interesting than jack the <UNK> b
<START> fever pitch isn't a bad film it's a terrible film br br is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so <UNK> and <UNK> by the <UNK> that hollywood <UNK> out that they'll praise to the <UNK> even a mediocre film with barely any laughs that's the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy and i use that term loosely because there's nothing funny in this film is getting good reviews br br i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> would even for an instant think their script was funny br br the brilliant nick <UNK> usually <UNK> well to film he adapted fever pitch for a british film starring colin <UNK> and ruth <UNK> in 1997 peter <UNK> found <UNK> voice for about a boy 2002 and when high <UNK> was <UNK> for a movie in 2000 writers d v <UNK> steve pink john cusack and scott <UNK> didn't go wrong because they kept the essence of <UNK> wit and humor they made one of the best films of that year br br so why does the american version of fever pitch go so painfully awry the british version wasn't a masterpiece but it was charming funny unexpected and gave us two characters we could like respect and understand br br but <UNK> and <UNK> have <UNK> everything funny in <UNK> work in <UNK> the story they've butchered it <UNK> all that was good and unique about <UNK> work and replacing it with conventional drivel br br they've transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy never once <UNK> from the wretched formula lindsey drew barrymore has three girlfriends each of whom has a distinct function one's overweight the <UNK> cynical and ambitious and the <UNK> a romantic want to guess how many male friends ben jimmy fallon has br br what made high <UNK> such fun was not only a good leading man and lady but engaging supporting characters in this fever pitch the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny they're so insignificant they're not even <UNK> the only reason they're in the film is because the formula demands it poor <UNK> <UNK> winds up as one <UNK> pals in a <UNK> role the lovely <UNK> must have been wishing lloyd <UNK> would <UNK> in and take her away come to think of it cusack would've made an excellent ben of course cusack is too smart to <UNK> himself to such an utterly tedious script br br there isn't a single <UNK> moment in this film that seems original or <UNK> every plot turn is predictable every lame joke <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> labor for laughs the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow you wonder if these <UNK> realized they were writing a comedy you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch it's almost as if <UNK> and <UNK> penned this with some screen writing <UNK> formula <UNK> on the wall when they got to a certain page they looked up at the formula and said ok the guru says this has to happen now and <UNK> br br directors bobby and peter <UNK> don't help the film any they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters they hand over the v o narration not to the protagonist but to another guy who sits behind ben at <UNK> park thanks to some extremely clunky writing we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial <UNK> br br barrymore does cute and adorable better than most she's as good at it as goldie hawn in her <UNK> but even her <UNK> can't save this extraordinarily awful film she tries hard to <UNK> some energy and humor out of this story about 30 minutes into the film lindsey tells ben you're funny the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script for <UNK> ben never says anything even remotely funny fallon is neither witty nor funny when he does comedy he overacts br br fallon was never any good on saturday night live he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices the only reason weekend update worked occasionally was because <UNK> <UNK> tina <UNK> knows a thing or two about comedy br br actors who think they're funny and behave that way rarely if ever are actually funny that's true of fallon he thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle his <UNK> unsure of himself <UNK> didn't work on the small screen it's <UNK> on the big screen br br unfortunately for fallon his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments if you thought his comedy was bad wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff two scenes in particular the first in a park the second in front of ben's school are painful to watch the scenes require an actor with a <UNK> of dramatic ability but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work his range of emotions doesn't even run the gamut from a to b br br ben has no personality or depth often he comes across as an <UNK> and not a lovable one at that it <UNK> the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him compare <UNK> performance to <UNK> in the british version and you'll understand how terribly flat unfunny and forced <UNK> ben is and how wrong he is for this role watching fallon in fever pitch makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of <UNK> <UNK> br br just as high <UNK> did an <UNK> fever pitch could've worked brilliantly it just needed better writers more competent directors and most definitely a stronger funnier smarter leading man do yourself a huge favor avoid this rotten film rent the 1997 british version and read <UNK> book instead
<START> the van is a simple <UNK> picture made especially for the drive in that goes out of it's way to make you feel comfortable providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends danny <UNK> has a small yet <UNK> role as the manager of a car wash and almost steals the show all the leads are well acted the characters complex and the directing quite competent for this type of picture a crown international release
<START> the movie has the longest most tortured and <UNK> ending of any movie i've seen in a long time unfortunately it starts right after the opening credits january jones gives such a wooden performance i was surprised she didn't go up in flames when she got near the <UNK> in the film i don't really remember her from the other films she's done a <UNK> i have to believe i never criticize an actors performance because in film there are too many things which can affect it but in this case it is so bad that it actually stands out from the atrocious script granted she's given lines and situations meryl streep would have trouble with but i swear at times <UNK> reading from a cue card off set at other times i thought she might actually be learning disabled or slow in some way for real the plot dialog and pacing are as bad as you'll ever see but there is still no excuse for this performance nor for the director that let it be <UNK> i feel sorry for the other actors cruel intentions 10 little indians breakfast club shoved into a rotten <UNK> then <UNK> by a grade school writer director take that back this has studio <UNK> <UNK> all over it
<START> seriously crappy movie br br first off the movie starts with a cop and his partner <UNK> outside of a warehouse furniture store the bad cop takes a girl which they had pulled over into the <UNK> attic while the <UNK> cop sits outside and <UNK> what could be happening up there the bad cop eventually returns with a heavy <UNK> bag and the <UNK> cop doesn't think there are any problems but he still wonders what was in the bag so he asks gets a <UNK> response and then he thinks everything is ok for now br br the bad cop repeats this process and even once with a <UNK> scene made it slightly better but eventually people start to catch on which took awhile considering how f ing obvious it was one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies like ya do now the bad cop eventually kills this magically <UNK> bitch and then he gets rid of the <UNK> <UNK> body br br since she had the <UNK> <UNK> magic put on her she comes back with lots of eye shadow on which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie also the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eye shadow monsters some of the girls meet up with a dude who is apparently a <UNK> <UNK> and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently but when the girls see other people such as the one girls husband he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out but others don't even notice massive plot hole br br so to wrap it up the eye shadow monsters kill the bad cop who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene it was as though they were trying to <UNK> us for a sequel like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping
<START> i really have problems rating this movie it is directed brilliantly there is obviously a lot of money in it gere and danes are intense although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and <UNK> up editing and cinematography are excellent on the other hand it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes and yes one cannot help but wonder how many <UNK> will such a movie inspire br br in purely artistic terms it is a 9 but i really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie
<START> this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see i was talked into it and dragged into the theater but boy am i glad for that i thought it was going to be just another love story but it turns out to be <UNK> much more than that <UNK> an intellectual flick one of those movies you have to pay attention to
<START> shower is an story about loyalty about the <UNK> advance of modern world in the <UNK> of rather traditional and more human ways of life a man forced to choose between his successful career in business his big city life his wife and his retarded young brother the eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do the modern china versus the ancient one the public <UNK> with its <UNK> its <UNK> fights versus the shopping <UNK> and the <UNK> lots of old men and women that are no longer needed china one country two systems as <UNK> <UNK> said though one of them is killing the other br br tender moving full of funny moments and of bitter sweet ones the sensitive ones will cry and laugh equally the actors are enormous especially the one who performs the role of the retarded boy and <UNK> zhang makes a good job easy simple letting the story just flow by itself br br my rate 8 10
<START> i won't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment i just want to add it because all the comments were so positive i felt like i just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled let alone intellectually <UNK> by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic <UNK> some scenes seemed promising playing with visual <UNK> but couldn't hold up the rest i felt like i was stoned for the first time again having semi philosophical conversations with fellow <UNK> br br what a <UNK> attempt to raise dutch cinema to new heights i'd rather watch jesus is <UNK> <UNK> without all the <UNK> and with straight forward humor also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves br br <UNK> de <UNK> is not jean luc godard or <UNK> and <UNK> never will be
<START> the movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group in their <UNK> the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called <UNK> whom sister goes after because she believes he is the big time who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life though he could be accused of killing her he really kills only her spirit and will to live after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an <UNK> the story isn't about the street life or the italian mobster who tries to buy <UNK> off then threatens him it's about how love can overcome even the worst <UNK> in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be discovered back then
<START> i lived in tokyo for 7 months knowing the reality of long train <UNK> bike rides from the train station soup stands and other typical scenes depicted so well certainly added to my own appreciation for this film which i really really liked there are aspects of japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors but you don't have to speak japanese to enjoy this movie director <UNK> tricks were subtle for the most part i found his <UNK> the character called <UNK> <UNK> with a soft <UNK> making her sublime a tiny bit contrived but most of the directors tricks were so gentle that i was fully pulled in and just <UNK> with his characters or cried or laughed <UNK> wonderful a
<START> i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the <UNK> of this kind of relationships incest and <UNK> in the romanian society br br so to begin with the second aspect to make it short it wasn't visible at all br br as for the first as i said it had much more potential i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension much more tension and the potential tension didn't get through br br i think the soundtrack could've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme <UNK> was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments yeah i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack br br the actors i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8 10 not enough <UNK> in the key moments br br a total of 7 10 mostly for the story
<START> what is most striking about this semi musical set in 1920s berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing it's top of the line from first national in these <UNK> the story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of <UNK> other two films sunny sally where working girl is <UNK> by rich boy with family <UNK> complications and final <UNK> all the four musical numbers are <UNK> at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical <UNK> miller sings parts of i think of baby and <UNK> because of you there are also don't ever be blue and though you're not the first one br br miller here is very engaging and delightful quite reminiscent of irene dunne in manner and delivery sad she does not dance as that is her <UNK> sally remains her finest film with this <UNK> as second and the rather poor sunny a vastly inferior runner up her life was <UNK> cut short by a <UNK> <UNK> before the days when <UNK> and <UNK> made such <UNK> <UNK> it's worth visiting these films though to see <UNK> top star of the <UNK>
<START> this movie documents a <UNK> experience for a group of young men and the experience of watching it is in itself <UNK> for the viewer few movies even <UNK> to this level of <UNK> and i can think of no other movie documentary or drama that achieves it there is no other movie in which i have both laughed so much and cried so much yes it is about <UNK> and accessible travel on those issues alone it is a worthwhile venture but it is more it is about friendship it is about life itself about living every day that you're alive and it's a great fun adventurous narrative this is why god created the cinema see this movie
<START> words cannot begin to describe how <UNK> terrible this movie is i wish it were so bad it's good but it's not it's just dull lifeless and boring it's so bad i couldn't even laugh at it br br in response to other posters anne marie <UNK> is not the highlight of the movie the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly who as a true statement on vanity cast himself as the male lead they both look like <UNK> sister and brother br br the gal <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> the complete opposite of anne marie attractive this girl is tall and <UNK> and can act although you can tell she's holding back br br all the actors seem to be holding back especially the supporting male mark i've seen less wood in a rain forest but he's still better than kelly why would kelly keep his actors from acting is he really that bad a director everyone else has summed the story up perfectly there isn't one kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime i know how he felt stepping in the poo it's how i felt after watching his movie br br yes i tried to get my money back from the rental store this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director and if you search them out you'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks
<START> is it possible to give a movie no stars i suppose not however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and you'll get my drift director and photographer timothy hines didn't have much of a budget compared to spielberg's <UNK> effort with the same material <UNK> to be the most expensive movie ever made but that need not be an <UNK> <UNK> i've seen some wonderful work done on a <UNK> <UNK> soldier and saints is a recent example with hard work integrity and above all talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of <UNK> <UNK> and at <UNK> of what was spent by <UNK> on its war of the worlds unfortunately hines failed in all these <UNK> even if he had had spielberg's budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have <UNK> just as badly as this <UNK> animal he's <UNK> on us br br primarily hines seems unable to tell a story thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound but he shows little <UNK> for <UNK> a narrative with what he records a guy walks down a country lane a lot he talks badly <UNK> received english to some other guy then he walks down the same lane only shot from the back this time to show he's returning clever eh walking and talking for nearly an hour that's all that happens ok i'll grant that one extended <UNK> from the main character's house to the impact site on <UNK> common to show that it's a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful a first year film student could <UNK> a more <UNK> and more <UNK> establishing sequence than this btw but half a dozen times back and forth back and forth et <UNK> et <UNK> with some <UNK> <UNK> in between remarkable the only explanation for this <UNK> of <UNK> other than total artistic <UNK> is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of <UNK> amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a feature length film finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking or <UNK> later we get <UNK> and <UNK> for <UNK> br br thankfully much of the dialogue is lifted straight from h g <UNK> text else we'd have no idea what is going on but is it not the whole point of cinema to <UNK> a text to realize what words alone can't convey if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel why bother why not do a radio play orson welles made himself a household name doing just that however hines thinks he's a filmmaker so he's content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning br br secondly hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie but he has no idea how to use them now i for one have no <UNK> sweet tooth for eye candy i believe good science fiction cinema doesn't need dazzling technical effects some really potent sci <UNK> have <UNK> on virtually none at all but the war of the worlds as film requires a certain <UNK> effort wells tells a story that <UNK> on things can be seen and heard and even <UNK> the effects don't need to be complex they can even be crude e g fighting machines on <UNK> <UNK> over <UNK> streets as seen in the george pal byron <UNK> 1953 version but they must be handled well unfortunately <UNK> effects are both crude and incompetent  <UNK> fighting machines higher than a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> around making a noise like a <UNK> stick <UNK> on <UNK>  martian <UNK> even though <UNK> by four times the gravity of their native world <UNK> and <UNK> about without <UNK> effort  <UNK> totally <UNK> of flesh and muscle <UNK> and scream the same damn horse and <UNK> <UNK> its way across the <UNK> a dozen times <UNK> left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice  and on ad <UNK> crude technique is forgivable so you have a cg fire effect that's less than convincing fine we can work around that just don't use it too often and only show glimpses of it that <UNK> woman sequence looks more like a crushed <UNK> throw it away it's not necessary you say your martian <UNK> looks like a toy on a string if you must use it go ahead but please don't show it twice but no hines won't listen we get the worst looking stuff used again and again gotta get those <UNK> minutes somehow boy br br next we have acting or more precisely too much acting whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on <UNK> everybody in this film is acting his little heart out evidently hines thinks he's getting a bargain more fleeing in terror over there you <UNK> behind that tree let's have a real <UNK> fit this take you call that <UNK> in agony nonsense my grandmother can <UNK> better nevertheless the cast as a whole and <UNK> stink they aren't even good amateurs but this <UNK> prove fatal many a good movie has been made with <UNK> acting that's what directors are for and <UNK> which brings up another <UNK> who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory if america's <UNK> were as <UNK> at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next <UNK> would be all fingers and no <UNK> in spite of the near three hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie not sequences but single frames creating a <UNK> jerky effect that's nauseating to watch maybe hines intention was to <UNK> the effect of a hand <UNK> <UNK> camera of the <UNK> if he was i can say he doesn't know how to do it
<START> i was in second grade 12 years ago i remember it clearly we were learning about space all little kids want to go to space right well after i saw this i was so scared to death that i would <UNK> get <UNK> into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind i had no idea that this was a movie i thought it was some news program or something i guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program <UNK> of the worlds ' so recently i get this movie again to watch realizing my favorite actor <UNK> phoenix was in it then known as <UNK> phoenix i can tell you i was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting i mean when andy is in space she moves in slow motion did you ever notice that i don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow br br the best part is when andy is knocked unconscious by the <UNK> tank and begins to <UNK> backwards as the security doors close little max is trying to pull her in suddenly we get a major close up on <UNK> face as he shouts in slow motion <UNK> <UNK> i had no idea
<START> this is a very bad movie i laughed once or twice and the storyline sucks there is maybe one funny joke it is stupid and it is boring through the whole short movie i was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end br br no one acts human and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous rob schneider acting like an animal isn't something i would pay to see it looked funny but the bottom line don't waste you're precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie br br i was wondering when it was going to end even though it is a short movie in the beginning we thought it would get better but it gets worse stupid all the way to the end i walked out of the theater and i would remember that movie as extremely bad forever br br the writer and co producer of this film is a simpsons tv writer but this is nothing like the simpsons this movie sucks
<START> <UNK> gas a murderer <UNK> a red <UNK> suit and hood wielding a white whip and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid <UNK> <UNK> by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing <UNK> of <UNK> and fish the <UNK> at scotland yard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his superior sir john <UNK> <UNK> certainly have their hands full with this case it all seems to center around student ann <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who when she turns 21 is to <UNK> a great deal of wealth the girls who are targeted share a room with ann but the reason for their murders remains a mystery <UNK> finest must figure out the staff of the girls' <UNK> all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the <UNK> are falling prey to the killer in the red monk <UNK> disguise talented enough to precisely <UNK> the <UNK> of those attacked with the whip two prisoners are <UNK> by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a <UNK> exchange for his creation it's a clever scheme where a driver <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> meets the <UNK> who hide in a barrel who are <UNK> by a corrupt prison guard taken <UNK> to the secret room of the mastermind he gives them orders on who to kill and how <UNK> this operation is a top <UNK> for <UNK> and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening under suspicion are girls' <UNK> <UNK> her author brother a <UNK> incredibly nervous chemistry teacher a <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> some are red herrings until they are <UNK> of throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered the ending features multiple twists br br out of the <UNK> films i've seen the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer a convoluted plot <UNK> lots of surprises and potential suspects <UNK> <UNK> between adults and the college girls at the <UNK> i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular <UNK> film with the villain <UNK> secret <UNK> with an alligator pit which isn't used the fake bible water pistol when opened fires the gas into the face of <UNK> victims the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which has <UNK> that cause <UNK> to <UNK> the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat and the <UNK> holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming many might consider sir john a <UNK> due to his bumbling <UNK> behavior and how he often <UNK> <UNK> abilities to get at the truth perhaps <UNK> fun at know it all british <UNK> who harm a case more than solve it i felt he was used as comedy relief particularly with his attempts at <UNK> suspects and potential victims often <UNK> what are told to him <UNK> using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator instead follows the clues facts often avoiding sir john as much as possible capable direction by the reliable alfred <UNK> who keeps the pace <UNK> at a nice speed and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the <UNK> are suspect any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls' <UNK> i'd say this may be one of the best if not the best examples of the <UNK> genre for it keeps you guessing always one more ace up it's <UNK> the revelations <UNK> at the very end are quite eye opening and you even get a literal <UNK> of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off
<START> i watched fido on some movie channel and i have to say that i've become an instant fan the film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s you know the wholesome decade when they <UNK> to elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it people were so naive back then that it's frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here br br kudos to this canadian production the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast including carrie anne moss billy connolly henry <UNK> and the kid br br it's a shame this film wasn't a bigger hit it deserved more recognition it's much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team oh well it's an instant classic nonetheless
<START> <UNK> luis <UNK> ends up in prison for car <UNK> and there he's given the plan for the perfect heist from a <UNK> in prison so he has to get out of jail fast he tells his girlfriend <UNK> patricia <UNK> to find a man who will do his time in prison for some money but no one wants to do the time for <UNK> crime and yet everybody seems to know a guy who will do that soon bad boxer <UNK> <UNK> sam <UNK> <UNK> out the details of this so called perfect job br br first of all i think this movie was very funny and from my point of view i would recommend it to everyone this movie is remake of italian comedy i <UNK> <UNK> i didn't watch the italian original so i cannot judge or compare those two movies but welcome to <UNK> is great comedy for itself about four people trying to rob the money from the vault in one house everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast really excellent movie for these actors sam <UNK> william h macy great <UNK> washington michael <UNK> great luis <UNK> patricia <UNK> jennifer <UNK> and finally george clooney gave their share in this project br br maybe to say that this movie is only comedy isn't fair this is more then that because of one difference all of thieves in this movie have very small wishes when they are asked what will they do with their money it is mostly <UNK> their future in very humble way this fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals and not only them but also cop <UNK> who is presented like <UNK> one so here directors russo presents us fact that criminals and cop are the same actually all in <UNK> are and not only in <UNK> cause all people chase money on legal or illegal way i don't like all movies were audience eventually likes and cheers for thieves but this one is exception you have to love them all <UNK> with his little baby and wife in jail <UNK> with his pants <UNK> with his line your mother's a whore and all others they are just like characters in my favorite comic alan ford they all trying to make some money but simply they are out of luck but they all did one good deed they gave money to <UNK> so he can get his wife out of prison they are all heroes in my eyes cause lots of honest people wouldn't do that
<START> this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care 90 of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever i laughed so much my <UNK> began to <UNK> the bit where the old men when to capture robert duvall was ludicrous on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of <UNK> sequences and pointless closeups on the main character this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead <UNK> the viewer with incoherent scenes seeing as this was based on a <UNK> by john <UNK> i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the <UNK> or 'the <UNK>
<START> i appreciated the photography the <UNK> the colours and often unlike one comment the lighting what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline i found it often disjointed badly edited and at times difficult to follow my version was <UNK> minutes imdb shows one at <UNK> possibly the cuts and subtitles didn't help i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood <UNK> but this left me disappointed miss <UNK> was <UNK> and the performances were all fine i just wanted a little more dialogue if anyone would like to see another film that has some <UNK> with this one try <UNK> <UNK> kate <UNK>
<START> <UNK> noir quality in this <UNK> and intense pulp film is seemingly perfectly fit together shot by shot edit by edit the film unfolds itself around a disturbed boxer discovering his own purpose or lack thereof the other comments around perhaps indicate a lack of pulp interest but i personally think this is a superbly put together cinematic piece
<START> this film was an interesting take by hollywood on the novel by of the same name by pearl s buck while some today might think it is <UNK> with racial stereotypes for the time the very idea of chinese protagonists was <UNK> in and of itself i found that the white actors playing chinese was not as bad as i expected that it wasn't the asian equivalent of <UNK> back then there were not really any asian actors in america not even george <UNK> was acting and rainer did a good job with her part it wasn't the greatest performance i have ever seen but for old school pre method acting it was nice the <UNK> scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects br br i wonder that the timing of the release during the great depression sort of turns this film into an allegory especially the political <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and how them seem to be left behind by all of it br br the film had some parallels to the john ford style but i think the eastern influence affected it as well if this had been an western family the <UNK> would have won at the end <UNK> the farmer for his pride lust and <UNK> however here he learns his lesson then wins
<START> five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before it is <UNK> room it is the firm and it is the <UNK> <UNK> and there are no new elements here except for the all to clear bill gates allegory <UNK> are always good stuff for movie making but why does it have to be so extreme <UNK> room is a good movie because it for a while at least seems realistic in <UNK> everything is wrong how realistic is it for example that your boss pay an <UNK> to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you i'd give it 1 but the soundtrack is ok so 2 10
<START> of the three remakes of this plot i like them all i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re watchable in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each of course the main stars in this one are great but the supporting actors are also superb i particularly like william tracy as <UNK> he was such a scene <UNK> that i have searched to find other movies he is in he appeared in many but most are not available as the other comments i also say buy this one
<START> i'm a big fan of italian films from the seventies and i wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful barbara <UNK> among my favourite actresses of all time so i did go into this film with some hopes however it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting as the title suggests the film focuses on a <UNK> in this case one that steals <UNK> and <UNK> stuff that's basically all the plot that this movie has the film does have a real <UNK> <UNK> to it and the idea of it all being very <UNK> gets across well it sometimes seems like directors <UNK> <UNK> and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well seeing barbara <UNK> on screen is always a pleasure and that is the case here too she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film overall the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer
<START> john <UNK> a wonderful comic actor is a new york latino able to get inside a <UNK> of characters both male and female to show the bizarre <UNK> of an ethnic group trying to cope in an alien culture he is not however italian he doesn't look think or behave italian especially <UNK> or <UNK> immigrant groups who live in <UNK> or <UNK> brooklyn every scene in which he <UNK> with his <UNK> rings false as though he'd <UNK> in from a college production of west side story while the other guys were doing a low rent mean streets that's only one problem with this ill conceived mean spirited flick spike blew this one big time btw <UNK> means country <UNK> blues and other music for uplifting <UNK> or possibly <UNK> ask <UNK> crystal who <UNK> the club br br
<START> this film may seem dated today but remember that it was made in 1974 before saturday night live before howard stern back when george <UNK> was just getting beyond the hippie <UNK> <UNK> and into heavy <UNK> humor this film is the <UNK> of them all enjoy it for its historical significance as well as for its strong entertainment value
<START> i'm not sure why spike lee made this train wreck of a movie and <UNK> poor <UNK> wonder into <UNK> pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess i also <UNK> the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal <UNK> of professional blacks the abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes play as if some college kid wrote this i especially <UNK> the ludicrous scene where the two leads are <UNK> <UNK> for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up snipes the overacting of the leads makes one feel as if spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about the final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a <UNK> hammer to <UNK> a point in this movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the f word in casual conversation i am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker i think his union with <UNK> in <UNK> was a wise move he should stick to making documentaries like the four little colored girls shock movies do not an oscar make
<START> this is a badly made poor remake of <UNK> classic <UNK> the story is based on <UNK> <UNK> book of the same name and it is a <UNK> of the original well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not <UNK> creativity the acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a <UNK> <UNK> father's choice of words in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story again the scene where <UNK> saif <UNK> <UNK> is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters is quite jarring to the senses and could have been easily avoided similarly the sex scene between saif and <UNK> is quite <UNK> the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience when a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it's spirit the work falls apart the song <UNK> <UNK> is quite ok another silver <UNK> in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father this is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit on these counts this movie deserves 3 stars the song and dance by <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and it is a put on the song is <UNK> but i remember having heard it somewhere before and if <UNK> not mistaken the tune appears to have been <UNK> br br well agreed the times have changed from then to now but then this movie is not even <UNK> of the modern times br br this is what happens when the modern bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with <UNK> the <UNK> and grabbing the <UNK> <UNK> entertainment market such movies end up neither <UNK> to india nor to any other part of the world
<START> while the original first blood had its far fetched moments it was at least exciting in parts in rambo first blood part ii the emphasis is <UNK> very much onto comic book action <UNK> is totally rejected logic nose <UNK> stallone becomes so <UNK> that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission just like any other wish <UNK> <UNK> of that time e g invasion usa <UNK> red <UNK> rambo first blood part ii <UNK> out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too <UNK> to fear for if you can tell from the word go that rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers what is left to get excited about br br imprisoned after the events of the first movie john j rambo <UNK> stallone is offered a <UNK> if he will join a <UNK> operation in the far east the year is 1985 and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any american <UNK> still trapped in the <UNK> of vietnam rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor colonel <UNK> richard crenna but the assignment is actually the <UNK> of a government outfit <UNK> by marshall <UNK> charles <UNK> <UNK> job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any american <UNK>  if it doesn't he is to <UNK> with a <UNK> if it does he is to get <UNK> evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date <UNK> him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge the beautiful and <UNK> co <UNK> julia <UNK> sure enough rambo discovers that there are <UNK> in the camp but he <UNK> his orders by <UNK> one of <UNK> when he reaches the <UNK> point the rescue <UNK> <UNK> him on the orders of <UNK> who it seems doesn't really want to find any <UNK> because of the political and military <UNK> rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the <UNK> and get his revenge on the <UNK> <UNK> br br the few good points of the film come from jack <UNK> polished photography jerry <UNK> <UNK> score and the sheer <UNK> of the stunt team in performing various action antics beyond these <UNK> <UNK> the film is a failure the actors are reduced to macho <UNK> the plot rings false the action sequences are soulless and <UNK> the dialogue is <UNK> even the violence becomes numbingly predictable at the time of its release america was under the <UNK> of ronald reagan a man with simplistic and near hysterical anti communist sentiments for this reason contemporary audiences <UNK> up this <UNK> bashing shooting fest as if it was the greatest movie of all time <UNK> it into an <UNK> box office success thankfully times have changed  nowadays we can look upon it as a simple minded action flick with a <UNK> high body count <UNK> dumb politics and a ludicrous hero
<START> <UNK> director ang lee whose previous films include <UNK> and <UNK> and 'the ice <UNK> turned to the american civil war for his latest feature based on a novel by daniel <UNK> it follows the exploits of a group of southern <UNK> known as <UNK> as they fight their northern <UNK> the <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> br br as one might expect there is plenty of visceral action but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it many of whom were fighting against their former <UNK> and even family jake <UNK> <UNK> maguire is such a man or rather boy as he is only <UNK> when the war reaches <UNK> he is the son of a german immigrant but instead of following his <UNK> and becoming a <UNK> he joins his <UNK> friend jack bull <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and rides with the <UNK> despite a lack of acceptance because of his <UNK> and an <UNK> to participate in the murder of <UNK> union men he remains loyal to the cause so does his friend daniel holt jeffrey wright a black slave freed by another <UNK> and so fighting for the south br br lee handles the subject with <UNK> never <UNK> the deep <UNK> that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war long periods of boredom and waiting <UNK> with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting the action is <UNK> and admirably <UNK> <UNK> that both sides committed a great number of atrocities br br the performances are superb with maguire and wright both courageous and <UNK> up and coming irish actor jonathan rhys meyers is particularly chilling as a cold blooded killer while <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> suave and arrogant lee never <UNK> from the reality of war but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it the growth of friendship the <UNK> of courage and on a wider scale the <UNK> of <UNK> peoples ride with the devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience
<START> well the previews looked funny and i usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because well you never know here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults i was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what s h t spells essentially what happens here is a total <UNK> of dr <UNK> classic it adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money if that was a subplot then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and the cat plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie
<START> this crap is like watching paint dry i'm so disappointed because i was so eager to see it br br there simply is no meaning to this film if it were never made no one would notice or care it's hyped up because of all the big names in it but if <UNK> were in nobody would give this film any love br br seriously i was at the point where half way through the film i would look at vanessa redgrave and think hurry up and die already this is like the joy luck club without any of the <UNK> joy it's the <UNK> 13 nothing but a big named cast of mother daughter movies and completely anti climatic oh until it's finally over br br i'm sure they'll all be nominated for oscars br br 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk
<START> i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable the plot was weak to say the least i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up i wonder if any of them will include this on their <UNK> at least i didn't pay to rent it the best part of the film is definitely dani <UNK> but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants
<START> dressed to kill has been more or less forgotten in critical circles in the past 20 years but it is a true american classic a film which is much more than just a glossy thriller br br i sincerely hope the dvd release will give more people the chance to hear about it and see it
<START> this wasn't really a very good movie there were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film but i think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience this movie was produced by magic johnson isn't that enough to inspire us all to check out this film a film produced by a former <UNK> star doesn't come along every day you know beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting <UNK> by an axe wielding psycho every cliché <UNK> out for us to <UNK> over teen sex and it was all produced by magic johnson i can't say enough about this movie teen drug use college <UNK> and it was all produced by magic johnson <UNK>
<START> audiences today will probably watch a film like ossessione and not really consider how <UNK> it was during the time when it came out the structure of the film really <UNK> from <UNK> happy hollywood <UNK> well as other major theatrical elements it relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light films of this <UNK> neo <UNK> <UNK> made to reflect the darkness felt during post world war ii times ossessione <UNK> some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war including adultery conspiracy murder <UNK> etc aside from the one <UNK> shot and certain musical <UNK> moments the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty shot on location uses natural lighting and most likely non popular actors all of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film <UNK> the following theme negative <UNK> <UNK> will haunt those who deliberately act <UNK> br br the two <UNK> and <UNK> polar <UNK> yet both carry the mentality we're bored and we want to be entertained gino is a drifter a lone <UNK> who <UNK> life and its constant <UNK> giovanna is a bored house wife <UNK> in the <UNK> of marital <UNK> she doesn't want to leave her home and husband but would rather remain where she is because it's <UNK> <UNK> lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle giovanna <UNK> the only difference is that she's too afraid to live it <UNK> why she falls in love with gino he represents everything she wants but doesn't have the courage to get she wants to live in a world free from the <UNK> of living with her <UNK> <UNK> is the perfect ticket into that world the affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40's feeling somewhat uneasy i mean films prior to the neo <UNK> age never showed such <UNK> behavior on screen before to say the least it was probably a bit <UNK> br br in <UNK> with the theme the neo <UNK> style helps show the negative <UNK> of <UNK> behavior <UNK> put <UNK> behavior as shown in the film leads to depressing and ultimately <UNK> lives when gino and giovanna <UNK> with each other to eliminate <UNK> husband <UNK> comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done they return to their home the atmosphere is dark and biting as can be expected from the neo <UNK> style they are not happy they're actually more depressed they thought that by <UNK> <UNK> husband that they'd live happier lives but they were <UNK> the film ends with <UNK> <UNK> being in <UNK> <UNK> of her husband's death i think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons here's why br br there's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen and if so to what extent i think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being <UNK> but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have as the subtext of ossessione asks is adultery and murder evil i think the film eagerly responds yes the <UNK> behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are ironically though towards the end of the film when they seem to be <UNK> of their depression and are seen <UNK> in each other's arms inside the car the author of the film shows that their happiness is in fact a <UNK> the car crashes off the cliff and into the river killing giovanna the police arrest gino i think it was the author's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their <UNK> behavior in the end <UNK> will come back to haunt them i agree i think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly <UNK> wanting instant <UNK> and not willing to endure through hard times this was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that gino and giovanna experience in their relationship he can't handle the pressure of living in <UNK> husband shadow so he leaves giovanna and sleeps with another girl such is typical of the <UNK> <UNK> personality br br all in all the film seemed very <UNK> for its time the audience however was prepared to see such a film because of the <UNK> the war brought those pre war happy go lucky films were no longer being believed movie going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters they wanted to see characters whose lives were <UNK> in so called <UNK> because it was a reflection of their own life problems ossessione then acts as a great <UNK> for where the future of film was heading that is a lot of the <UNK> pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo <UNK> film movement
<START> if you want scream or anything like the big studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother this well written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our <UNK> of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not <UNK> on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit beast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the <UNK> and the film never <UNK> though in fact the less you see of the creature the better <UNK> successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as <UNK> and as a discussion forum while still keeping us <UNK> out
<START> this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression story writing is what movie making is about br br incredible visual effects very good acting especially from <UNK> everything is perfect except the story is just poor and so everything fails br br picture this if you had the power to be invisible what would you do well our mad scientist here played by kevin bacon could think of no other thing to do but <UNK> and rape women this is all his supposedly genius mind could think of does he try to gain extra power no he doesn't even bother research a way to get back to being visible the guy is basically a sex crazed maniac br br add to that the lab atmosphere you have all these young guys throwing around jokes like they were in a bar if it wasn't for all the white <UNK> and equipment you would think this is a bad imitation of cheers very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but <UNK> for the hollow man's wolf br br even as a thriller the movie falls way short because most of the thrilling scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical <UNK> by the actors that are just screaming this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me br br if you read the actual book while the scientist <UNK> goes after women there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character in the movie <UNK> is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded <UNK> to rub his body in women and get off on it just sad
<START> a very straight nice old lady desperate for money to save her house and <UNK> grows pot in her house <UNK> it with a few old <UNK> friends and then sells it that's the story for this low key comedy <UNK> the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor the <UNK> brings for much of the film it works the humor isn't of the laugh out loud variety but it does keep you entertained for an hour and a half so i guess it serves its purpose br br there are funny moments and brenda <UNK> is fun to watch in the lead role but the ending really ruined a cute movie with <UNK> bad messages that only the ultra <UNK> of the film world would like to see happen br br like most people i would prefer a happy ending too but it should not all warm and fuzzy for those who blatantly break the law also in here are the typical 1 children out of <UNK> but that poses no problem and is deemed okay 2 <UNK> portrayed as morally weak people and 3 even a medical doctor who gets stoned too br br hello and reviewers here blast hollywood this is exhibit a how a <UNK> society has <UNK> the standards in the uk and europe in general hey people at least have a trace of morality instead of nothing but a timothy <UNK> if it feels good do it message
<START> police story is one of jackie chan's classic films that helped shape the hong kong cinema it is a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan from the beginning it is obvious that jackie chan's stunt team literally <UNK> their live to make this film both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative even today no movie has <UNK> police story in dangerous stunts many people were <UNK> in police story including jackie chan the fighting is not as <UNK> exceptional as the stunts but the fighting in this movie helped change and define jackie chan's use of props throughout the film chan uses odd object to stop <UNK> and is constantly throwing <UNK> through thick glass the action feels real because the <UNK> are giving the movie all they have to give and jackie chan's <UNK> is outstanding br br the rest of the aspects of the film are not without flaws but they will not disappoint any action fan chan not only plays a believable risk taking cop but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into <UNK> desperation the plot is powerful but a modern viewer may find it tedious at times while the comedy will provide a good number of laughs it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action however for the time period it was made in the driving aspects of the plot are entertaining there a good number of interesting and well played characters <UNK> throughout the film as well br br overall police story is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made and even in hollywood the influences of this one film are not to be ignored
<START> when i saw the dentist i thought it was very cool but this movie is not for everyone especially people who do not like gory scenes as the dentist has lots of gory scenes that's why it has it's <UNK> rating it's about a beverly hills dentist dr alan feinstone who finds his wife brooke cheating on him with the <UNK> it's best to go to your dentist before you watch this but if you don't like going to the dentist already then it's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life the dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that i've ever seen who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist spoiler pull out all his cheating wife's teeth and cut out her tongue with no <UNK> overall awesome flick but not for everyone
<START> earth is a must see for children and adults my son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears we can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth there are some animals in danger to disappear exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet br br this documentary offers many exceptional pictures that i have never seen before then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music the director did a great job here that gets high respect nothing can stop me and my family to give earth the highest rate i hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel
<START> this musical is decidedly mixed and none of the elements really fit together but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable the plot contains some of the elements of <UNK> novel but none of its virtues though he co wrote the script the songs though charming have nothing to do with this particular film and are unusually <UNK> <UNK> into the plot even by pre <UNK> standards burns and allen do their usual <UNK> quite competently but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty iq points br br there are a few high points <UNK> <UNK> does good work when he remembers that this is a <UNK> and stops <UNK> like a silent actor and there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by <UNK> though most of the film feels like the production of one of the hollywood <UNK> he later <UNK>
<START> there is nothing unique in either the tv series nor the movie which is a prequel to the tv show that isn't found everywhere else in life and entertainment both before david <UNK> disgusting style of story telling and after br br from the moment the body of a poor misguided girl washed up on the beach and being introduced to some of the most mind numbing shady <UNK> character of the twin peaks br br to the mind numbing almost <UNK> disgusting way the movie seems to <UNK> tell of the destruction of a human life through some random psychedelic <UNK> in the movie twin peak fire come walk with me br br i watched it all just to make sure i wasn't missing anything i didn't it's is simply one mans obvious sexual fetish extended over long series <UNK> by a ridiculous overly pornographic movie save your self the agony the suspense and watch anything else that at least has the ability to tell a story rather then seduce you into some kind mental porn movie br br i have heard a lot of reviews <UNK> and <UNK> about how great david lynch because of his ability to define misery and and tragedy and making it into some kind of a wonderful thing this is not life imitating art as much as it is some sick twisted version of art doing its best to inspire complete mindless life br br do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage
<START> any film that deals with <UNK> in a positive manner is a film that should still be seen by current audiences as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of <UNK> br br aside from that the film is really an old fashioned love story boy meets girl boys loses girl boy gets girl back br br the weakest role goes to the late kent smith as lt general <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a close second my question would be how did he ever get to be a 3 star general the character is such a <UNK> in the presence of his wife and military <UNK> it's a wonder they show him any respect at all br br <UNK> southern accent is a little overdone and some scenes have a few holes but overall i enjoy the film every time i see it br br red buttons is great i always love seeing comedians in dramatic roles as in <UNK> case often a comedian can better portray the tragedy of a person than a more traditional dramatic actor
<START> house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling <UNK> and gets caught at the game br br have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way sit on the edge of your chair as <UNK> are being tricked and victims turn into <UNK> you're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie br br this is both a quality and a <UNK> of the script as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of <UNK> but all this is largely <UNK> by the excellent psychological development br br this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling
<START> i think that this film was one of kurt <UNK> good movies kurt <UNK> is my favorite actor so i think that he is a good actor in any role he plays but this movie had a lot of action in it and i know that it should have more then a 5 6 out of 10 on the <UNK> but many people did not like this movie oh well i thought it was good so i think that every one should see this movie if you see this movie and like it i think that you should see back draft also with kurt <UNK> i give soldier 1 2 out of
<START> cartoon network seems to be desperate for ratings beginning with the <UNK> of samurai jack the network seemed <UNK> on <UNK> all the shows that made it so popular such as the <UNK> girls <UNK> lab <UNK> z etc when the ratings started to <UNK> <UNK> began putting up some pretty mediocre shows though total drama island action and <UNK> stand out because of their clever writing and audience pleasing gimmicks there are plenty of other shows that either terrible remakes george of the jungle or rip offs of other shows such as the marvelous <UNK> of <UNK> where the title character acts just like <UNK> and then there's johnny test which is something of a replacement for <UNK> laboratory though it's much more of a sheer rip off than anything br br the show's characters are clearly derived from <UNK> lab only this time the focus is on johnny a blonde or fiery haired character who <UNK> his twin sisters susan and mary who just happen to look just like <UNK> from the orange hair to the glasses the impossible technology there is even a rival genius named <UNK> <UNK> boy or eugene who appears to be sitting in for <UNK> then there's <UNK> <UNK> best friend and talking dog one of <UNK> i mean susan and <UNK> early experiments br br <UNK> laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television with its simple but effective art style lovable main character and episodes that don't seem to be a long drag johnny test is a lot different the art style here isn't nearly as eye pleasing in fact it looks absolutely awful the characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive like how most of the <UNK> episodes consist johnny and <UNK> quest for havoc on the neighborhood girl sissy whom johnny secretly likes or the <UNK> obsession over a boy next door seeing these two geniuses <UNK> at the sight of <UNK> and the fact that johnny appears to be someone you would never want to associate with there is no real connection between the viewer and characters br br one thing the series heavily exploits in its name is that johnny is susan and <UNK> guinea pig for their experiments these range from turning johnny fat ugly monstrous and even into a woman the twins then help johnny in whatever scheme he's planning in return for his services whenever there's an episode involving this kind of win win deal it usually comes <UNK> at the seems and those that doesn't come completely off the <UNK> never ends <UNK> br br the writing <UNK> from mediocre to horrid however the <UNK> episode constantly repeats it's <UNK> with a <UNK> there's a difference you know which is a line that should never be repeated especially when the episode seems to promote child <UNK> with johnny becoming a famous star with money and <UNK> just by becoming fat br br let's talk about how the show doesn't completely rip off <UNK> lab the show <UNK> in a lot of characters from two men in black named mr black and mr white a military general who seems to need all his problems solved through johnny and his sisters and lots of super villains though even here the show again steals ideas for other sources like a mr freeze teenage clone an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over man like the evil talking cat from <UNK> girls a bumbling maniac mastermind a trio of evil <UNK> <UNK> and even a mole man which is probably the most cliché villain in the media br br to top it all off alongside its ugly animation and unlikeable characters the voice acting is either passable like the voices for mr black and mr white to just plain ear splitting johnny <UNK> and just about every villain in the show the theme song seems to be the only catchy thing to this show but then it was <UNK> just a few episodes with a band that just ruined it br br so in the end johnny test is not a good cartoon its horrible references and jokes about teen culture will <UNK> little children's interest in the show while its bright <UNK> ripped off characters and dragging episodes will ruin the experience for teens it's just another one of those crappy shows that cartoon network is over promoting to trick people to watching it like mtv toward rap if you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour you'd better stick to <UNK> because johnny test is more of a test of patience than anything else
<START> i found this to be a so so romance drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it it's not a hallmark hall of fame type family film with sleeping before marriage considered normal behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro i would have expected a lot <UNK> movie at least language wise br br the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult that's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but to be honest the film isn't that memorable br br it's still a fairly mild nice tale that i would be happy to recommend
<START> the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly <UNK> moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team br br this is a good three stooges short it funny and its cast includes christine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gino <UNK> fred <UNK> sam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> theodore <UNK> <UNK> brent judy malcolm <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> flowers the stooges performed very well in this short i recommend this one
<START> i don't have words to describe how good this movie is only a genius like amrita <UNK> could have written such a real depiction of the days of <UNK> the movie kept haunting me for many days br br <UNK> did the role of her life in this movie she put life in the role of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> did no less in his role as <UNK> it is hard to imagine anyone other than these two doing the role of <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> costumes looked so natural on <UNK> and <UNK> looked like a natural <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> did fabulous job <UNK> <UNK> did good work as <UNK> br br some of the scenes you just can't get out of your mind when <UNK> meets <UNK> for the first time it brings tears to your eyes the climax is just killer i was expecting a tragic ending but thankfully the ending was wonderful br br this movie is in the same category as <UNK> <UNK> e <UNK> <UNK> etc not to be missed
<START> now i recently had the viewing pleasure to watch the hilarious comedy bachelor party one of my new favorite comedies laughed until it just hurt type of movies so i naturally wanted to see the sequel hoping it would have the same laughs but instead bachelor party 2 the last temptation is made by the american pie generation where it's tasteless and <UNK> the hole purpose of the first film yeah the first film has nudity but it doesn't show in every single scene also the plot is exactly the same from the first it's not always a complaint with me but this could have been a little more original the only thing is that i'm glad that at least no old actors from the original appear in this movie because it would have been cheesy or really silly looking br br ron and melinda are engaged after only 2 months of dating everyone is against it melinda has a rich family but they're pretty happy with ron and <UNK> brother todd is scared that ron will take his job so they go out on a weekend to miami for a bachelor party and todd is going to make sure that he'll trap ron into a picture that will make melinda change her mind about the marriage br br bachelor party 2 the last temptation has a couple laughs here and there but over all fails to deliver what the first film accomplished these guys <UNK> friends were more obnoxious than likable except for seth he was kinda funny the only likable characters other than seth is ron and melinda everyone else just more or less gets on your nerves you wanna watch this film just watch girls gone wild it's the same thing only it doesn't try to pretend that it's a film stick to the original bachelor party that's the movie that's going to get you in tears of laughter br br 3 10
<START> i couldn't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons robin williams and toni <UNK> the film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on robin williams plays gabriel <UNK> a storytelling night time <UNK> who is going through personal issues his lover moves out and gabriel is having what seems to be a case of <UNK> block one day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14 year old boy named pete <UNK> <UNK> culkin pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents he lives with his adopted mother and social worker donna <UNK> toni collette gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with pete but things seem strange when gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that pete <UNK> may not even exist i won't go into detail because i don't want to spoil the film but i will tell you this it is quite predictable fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from robin williams and toni collette who i thought was the film's key character collette is without question one of the most talented and <UNK> actresses her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and i hope to see her win an oscar hell i think she might pull off getting a best supporting actress nod for this one if the script were a little better the film starts off as a psychological thriller but a predictable one at that if your curious to know the film's ending and twists then see the film otherwise i would rent another predictable thriller called hide and seek
<START> will they ever make movies without nudity and sex this came on at 3 00 on sunday afternoon and i couldn't believe what they showed thank god my son was outside or i would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft medium porn do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show the acting was good and i enjoyed the suspense but gee there was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie randy travis was really good in his role if the writers directors and producers would just quit putting on so much <UNK> for sex scenes what has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction where can i complain
<START> with that line starts one silly boring british sci fi film the great <UNK> from the movie devil doll builds a <UNK> machine only to have his funding cut off by <UNK> a <UNK> man who has a thing for bow ties and men with large eye <UNK> when his experiment fails the good doctor learns that <UNK> the man who controls all of the <UNK> in the world will be staying in london for a few days he attempts to project himself into the house of <UNK> with the help of his <UNK> lab assistant sheila needless to say something goes wrong and he winds up looking like a rat the rest of the movie is devoted to the good orange haired doctor walking around london shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a <UNK> on his face there are some more killings some modest paper work and finally the doctor <UNK> to where ever rat faced doctors go thankfully no one decided to make a sequel
<START> this is a frank <UNK> masterpiece of amusing lyrics competent themes and solid construction by those who adapted damon <UNK> material to the <UNK> book what is surprising about the film is how <UNK> the musical numbers flow from the storyline <UNK> <UNK> did the book with <UNK> from <UNK> michael <UNK> was the choreographer and the outstanding art direction was contributed by joseph wright the storyline can be told in two sentences nathan detroit played by frank sinatra needs cash to <UNK> his permanent floating crap game to <UNK> big julie a chicago mob boss he <UNK> odds player sky masterson well presented by marlon brando that he cannot get a salvation army girl to go to <UNK> with him masterson wins the bet saves the mission falls in love with the girl gets the <UNK> and <UNK> at the crap game to attend a service and tells everybody the lady was <UNK> to his charms a complete lie of course he ends up with the lady and detroit marries hi long suffering fiancée vivian <UNK> others in the cast include <UNK> <UNK> johnny silver robert keith b s <UNK> as big julie the mobster <UNK> leonard <UNK> <UNK> mary alan <UNK> kathryn <UNK> as the salvation army leader <UNK> ann <UNK> and jean simmons as the tepid salvation army girl sarah brown the famous musical numbers in this award winning broadway smash include <UNK> for <UNK> guys and dolls luck be a lady i'll know a person could develop a cold and the oldest established <UNK> floating crap game in new york joseph l <UNK> of <UNK> and letter to three wives fame directed the proceedings and the flow of the work is very interestingly and successfully kept moving he is equally <UNK> at getting fine dialogue acting and directing such huge numbers as luck be lady the varied and challenging <UNK> section the <UNK> a woman in love section created for the film that <UNK> it the presenting of the title song guys and dolls and pet me <UNK> set in the club where <UNK> works the acting is very uneven simmons seems wrong for the part at times brando gets by with the singing and is very good much of the time on instinct charm and <UNK> even in the comedy scenes sinatra tries hard but is wrong for the role for several reasons as nathan detroit <UNK> is a bit too theatrical in selling her numbers which she of course sings <UNK> leonard <UNK> <UNK> keith and <UNK> do what is asked and more at all points the stylized opening and closing are made to work well all in all this film is a triumph for <UNK> <UNK> and subtle lyrics for director <UNK> as <UNK> and for the genre of musicals itself so <UNK> justified in this instance delightful and very different
<START> obviously written for the stage lightweight but worthwhile how can you go wrong with ralph richardson olivier and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> did this movie blow the characters were weak the plot weaker i figured this couldn't be too bad because it has <UNK> walken <UNK> he must have done this because he was bored and needed the money the characters were supposed to be irish but <UNK> had an irish accent i am desperately trying to find something nice about this i can't except walken did a fine job with a wooden character find something to read or watch discovery don't ever see this movie
<START> let me set the scene it is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies i am with my friend deciding what to see we look for a movie that is starting soon and the grinch comes up we buy tickets not knowing what to expect what we got was a roller coaster of fun br br jim carrey who may i add is my no 1 actor in the whole world was absolutely magnificent as the grinch in this ron <UNK> best movie next to apollo 13 the way that this movie was made the scenery the actors the props and the music was just amazing it really brought this childhood movie to life br br the story is based upon the story of the grinch as we all know the grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas he lives high above <UNK> and has never <UNK> well with the <UNK> but one little girl is going to change the <UNK> look on life and on others in a <UNK> way br br cindy lou who played by adorable new actress taylor <UNK> meets the grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away she attempts to break the <UNK> and to help the grinch move in and <UNK> with the towns people br br all up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents a solid 10 10 well done jim br br
<START> amazing movie i saw this movie for the first time on a flight and could not believe that i had not even heard of it before getting on that plane while it may seem at first to be a chick flick it is a film that everyone should see and will enjoy men watch this movie with someone you love you will enjoy it as much as she does and it will score you big points
<START> i truly wish i was not writing this review i'm a christian so i waited <UNK> to see this movie it seemed great a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing not that i buy the bible code itself you can make it say anything you want i do however believe everything inside the bible so i'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and <UNK> at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes i'm sure once the final credits began to roll however i could reflect there were many parts of the movie i liked some mostly unexpected plot twists some effects that were indeed special i'm not counting the visions those were poorly done and some interesting technical work fades sets that type of thing unfortunately i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a <UNK> for an hour i could've gotten a better script and the music was beyond cheesy even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was but i'm not someone who can be <UNK> by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and <UNK> a christian <UNK> on it i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies and this just didn't have either i'm sorry but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone and that's the tragedy when will we see some intelligent christian fiction it has to be out there somewhere
<START> i generally find loretta young hard to take too concerned with her looks and too <UNK> in all the wrong ways but in this lyrical frank <UNK> romance and even though she's playing a low self <UNK> <UNK> who puts up with entirely too much bullying from <UNK> spencer tracy she's direct and honest and irresistible it's an odd little movie played mostly in a one room shack in a <UNK> unusually up front about the depression yet romantic and <UNK> tracy playing a <UNK> hard to take regular guy who would be an awful <UNK> and bully by today's standards <UNK> his character's hard edge and almost makes him appealing there's good supporting work from <UNK> <UNK> and glenda farrell who never got as far as she should have and jo <UNK> screenplay is modest and efficient but the real heroes are <UNK> who always liked to <UNK> true love in lyrical close up and young you sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up she's too good for this guy but she's so <UNK> and <UNK> you <UNK> watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion
<START> <UNK> is a story about a troubled teen named diana <UNK> michelle rodriguez diana is <UNK> by her mothers suicide and a sexist father living in a sexist community a short temper and plenty of things to spark a fire <UNK> about to get kicked out of school for fighting her brother tiny ray <UNK> is training with hector <UNK> <UNK> in boxing diana is told by her dad <UNK> paul <UNK> to deliver that weeks <UNK> for <UNK> training while diana is walking through the gym she realizes thats what she wants to do she wants to box diana asks her dad for money to train but he refuses because <UNK> a girl and should do more <UNK> things all diana wants is to be treated like any other guy not looked down upon because she is a woman she steals money from her father to begin training br br great movie genius pure <UNK> genius recommend to anybody who needs to see a good clean movie with no <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this motion picture has a steady haunting pace backed up with great acting one of <UNK> best performances and a story that is revealed to us over time br br beyond that the music fully <UNK> the mood and <UNK> in maintaining an uneasy <UNK> and somber tone br br <UNK> story is enhanced by using <UNK> their stories and their tensions with the <UNK> white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous br br although they are unrelated in story as well as genre this <UNK> the same feeling within me as ursula le <UNK> <UNK> of heaven 1980 br br the last wave is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments remember <UNK> and <UNK> doesn't make a film a horror movie it's the psychological element of fear and <UNK> that rests within us all
<START> if you liked watching mel gibson in million dollar hotel then you might enjoy watching burt reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed i can only <UNK> to the dvd version so maybe the vhs version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that <UNK> seems red i first thought my dvd players was messed up it wasn't if you insist on watching it i recommend you <UNK> the color on your tv until it is black and white if you don't you will never be able to get through the film if you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to <UNK> the style of pulp fiction
<START> just saw this movie on tv and i have to admit i was a bit surprised it was even on there were so many goofs mess ups and bad editing that an old episode of <UNK> street would have been better to watch the acting was ok but please you can really feel the straight to video feeling the cast crew made this movie a bad melodrama yes there is a message in the movie but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it trust me you wouldn't even tell the difference
<START> frank <UNK> creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film while it has a few charming moments and many wonderful performers <UNK> outright <UNK> of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story broadway bill 1934 is downright shoddy it is understandable that he would re use footage from the climactic horse race which is thrilling but he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice for example that ward bond is 14 years older unless you want to see one of the last appearances of oliver hardy skip this one and watch broadway bill instead
<START> criminals perry smith and richard dick <UNK> believe mr clutter of <UNK> kansas keeps a large supply of cash on hand in a safe on november 15 1959 at two a m they end up murdering mr and mrs clutter and their teenage son and daughter after a little police investigation the two men are found and sentenced to be <UNK> in cold blood 1967 is directed by richard brooks now i haven't read the truman capote novel this movie is based on so i can't make any comparisons the movie does a brilliant job telling of those horrific events that actually took place robert blake is excellent as perry of course blake had the murder case of his own a few years back being accused of murdering his wife he's free now but we still don't know the truth what ever that may be he's still a very fine actor scott wilson does remarkable job as <UNK> john forsythe is terrific as alvin <UNK> paul stewart is very good as <UNK> jeff corey is marvelous as mr <UNK> same thing with charles <UNK> who plays <UNK> smith john <UNK> portrays herbert clutter ruth <UNK> is his wife bonnie brenda <UNK> is the daughter nancy and paul <UNK> is the son <UNK> great job by each of them there is much to remember from this film let's start from the lighter side it's pretty great when perry wants to go hunting for gold in mexico and says to <UNK> remember bogart in treasure of the <UNK> <UNK> and blake himself was in that movie as a boy and it's a fun moment when they giving a ride to that boy and his <UNK> collect <UNK> and turn them in for <UNK> money those darker moments are the most haunting ones the flashback sequence where you see the murders happening is extremely terrifying when perry goes to kill the girl nancy last and she says oh please don't the brutality of man it's impossible to explain then the hanging scene first there goes <UNK> and then perry first talking to the minister in the last image of the movie we see perry hitting the end of the rope sure movies and books may try to sympathize these villains especially <UNK> character is someone you could feel sorry for he thinks of his mom and dad who he hates but still loves but it doesn't change the fact both of these men these actors portray are brutal murderers who don't feel sorry for anybody they go to this house and murder an entire family in cold blood how could you sympathize these people
<START> i truly enjoyed this film the acting was terrific as was the plot jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for the only part of this flick i would change was the ending the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi channel br br there were some interesting religious messages in this film jeff combs obviously played a <UNK> figure and the creature or shark if you prefer represented the anti <UNK> there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that <UNK> of the world <UNK> i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature i know many people won't get the references to christianity but if you watch close you'll get it
<START> i rented this film on netflix after it won all the oscars to see if it was really that good br br the hurt locker is a very realistic portrayal for the most part of a group of <UNK> <UNK> in iraq the film centers around will james a reckless soldier who gets his <UNK> fix from taking risks and <UNK> bombs br br where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the plot and direction of the movie this film has no clear plot unlike other films such as black <UNK> down what this film tries to do is focus more on the characters and their different attitudes about the war <UNK> does an okay job of focusing on the characters but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag hurt locker is <UNK> minutes long yet it feels like a 3 hour movie br br one scene in the movie that was particularly awful and ruined the films perfect credibility was the <UNK> scene halfway through the movie it was both unrealistic and very long br br overall i thought this film was okay but the reason i gave it a 6 instead of a 7 was because it was a major letdown for winning best picture at the oscars i felt like this film could have been so much better considering saving private ryan lost best picture but was much better than this film another notable mention is black <UNK> down which only won 2 oscars i honestly do not know how this won best picture br br if you are looking for an action packed war flick rent black <UNK> down this film will be forgotten in a year or two
<START> after a fairly lengthy partially <UNK> nude shower scene we're off to the races for this blair witch project esquire horror film about three girlfriends <UNK> to a desolate cabin deep in the woods to get away from their <UNK> lives for a girls' weekend out and smoke pot they meet two guys who seem friendly enough so they drink and tell ghost stories until late in the movie some of them get picked off br br this is a fairly slow movie with needlessly drawn out <UNK> scenes the bad acting can't carry the <UNK> of scenes where nothing happens but mindless banter and the movie as a whole is a dud a <UNK> boring dud at that nothing at all happens until the last half hour and when it did i was to <UNK> to really care br br eye candy ashley <UNK> shows t a <UNK> <UNK> gets topless briefly and jennifer hart shows her right <UNK> br br my grade d
<START> it is a great movie if you have ever named your cars or are really into old fast or exotic cars it has a plot and a lot of action the car scenes are great except for the totally fake car jump scene all of the other scenes are great i really enjoyed it and i hope everyone else does as well
<START> believe it or not inspector <UNK> last case is what got me hooked on the whole gadget thing br br my name is <UNK> and i am twelve years old so obviously i wasn't around when inspector gadget was at the top of his career sure i'd heard of him but i didn't really know him br br while reading note that i never saw the original series i would if it came on this is just about the only gadget thing i've ever watched even though i am now obsessed and i will be focusing on what i liked about it since everyone else is so negative for all you <UNK> i've got some cons down there too p first off for a childish sense of humor you could <UNK> this movie pretty funny i thought it was so sue me i also thought the animation and character designs were good and i'm also happy there was more gadget in it since he's my favorite character i do not like penny then there was claw his voice was awful though and the <UNK> i thought they were done fairly good too <UNK> idiocy seemed pretty well in place if not a bit exaggerated i e sucking his hat hand <UNK> thumb would make a good screen shot though p oh and i liked the song that ran in the credits yes i am strange br br and like all movies there are some <UNK> too br br talking cars what's up with that you can tell this was aimed at younger boys that wouldn't bother me quite so much if there wasn't the fact that the cars basically saved the day i would have much preferred if penny and brain had taken their place and apparently gadget loved his car more than would be called natural a bit weird to say the least br br oh and the chief was downright mean to gadget i mean <UNK> yeah he wasn't always the most cheerful of people but he didn't hate gadget from what i've read like the inspector his personality was exaggerated br br well that's pretty much all i have to say about this movie i thought the animation made up for the car centered plot and that it was overall pretty decent more so than the live action gadget films butchered butchered butchered at least maybe i'm just biased because this is what got me into gadget in the first place or maybe my mind is twisted or maybe i'm just odd but i really liked this movie even if i'm the oldest it's recommended for
<START> how nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together <UNK> <UNK> and rob <UNK> who are married in real life play a couple who marry in las vegas on a <UNK> and then not only have to break the news to their kids but then have to try to <UNK> their respective <UNK> each has two boys and two girls into a cohesive family unit what <UNK> when the group which includes four teenagers two <UNK> and two younger children makes one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for carrie and jim the fights between the kids and one little love affair between two of them make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along more interesting than the brady bunch what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hours recommended as a feel good movie for all ages
<START> i think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons i have ever watched i would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5 i did used to like this show when i was 4 and 5 i still only watched it when there was nothing on now i am other 5 and i would rather do my <UNK> than watch it the cartoon used to be a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing now i am older i am interested in show witch are not rated us i have started to watch doctor who <UNK> <UNK> 15 and sarah jane adventures pg i am interested in things to do with doctor who so i am not interested in 5 year old cartoons this cartoon didn't last very long it only had 6 seasons it got cancelled because of it was low on viewers but some people say it was because the writers ran out of ideas but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons
<START> this is a movie which attempts a retelling of <UNK> history set in the ancient city of <UNK> i decided to watch this film because i thought it was along the lines of many <UNK> films i've watched and enjoyed one that has <UNK> actors speaking <UNK> and martial arts <UNK> well it's none of that this film is shot entirely in english is chock full of <UNK> actors and has production values so terrible it is laughably bad but not funny who can we blame for this rubbish the acting dialog and most of the sets were quite bad some of the fight scenes looked like they were choreographed by the local high school drama club the special effects were also mostly bad but a few were just cheap animation <UNK> onto the screen that provided an especially cheesy effect it has one large epic style <UNK> battle scene where a few thousand extras get to run across a field in costume but when we see the two <UNK> <UNK> in combat ha what a joke the film does feature a couple of <UNK> what a pity they didn't show a little more skin at least that would have been something for the guys to appreciate don't bother
<START> i'm studying <UNK> and was delighted to find el <UNK> a movie with mostly <UNK> dialogue at my art house video store br br hmmm not so delighted to have seen it br br yes as other reviewers have said it's well made and beautifully photographed although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent it's well acted and convincing for the most part that is would the <UNK> strip a corpse in <UNK> for burial right in the middle of the town square in full view of the dead man's 10 year old boy oh well minor detail up to this point it had something of the feel of a non magical <UNK> <UNK> also set in the spanish civil war br br fast forward and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age <UNK> is a nun working at a <UNK> <UNK> and the two boys <UNK> and <UNK> both are patients i know but hey <UNK> happen br br the problem as with so many spanish movies apologies to <UNK> fans is that with one exception <UNK> the characters are just so <UNK> weird their motivations personalities and dialogue are often simply incoherent br br what's more it <UNK> into some horrific wretched excess be prepared for lots of pain and lots of blood the reviewer who called it a <UNK> is quite on track if it had been made 40 years ago the poster would've said see forbidden love rape murder <UNK> <UNK> animal cruelty betrayal br br the opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable to work this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters as it is it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between brother sun sister moon and pulp fiction if that sounds like something you've got to see by all means enjoy i think i go with something that doesn't make me feel i need to take a shower to wash off the gore and <UNK> br br as for the <UNK> it's the <UNK> <UNK> fairly different than the <UNK> <UNK> though i was surprised by the comment that said that even <UNK> apparently needed <UNK> subtitles to understand it
<START> what's to like about this movie br br it is in colour br br it has some impressive underwater photography br br it has a <UNK> musical score in the background that works well at times br br so 3 out of 10 br br sometimes the music is <UNK> up especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in br br sometimes it is <UNK> as if to convey to the audience it's about to be time for sympathy br br as another one bites the dust as if in a <UNK> western this has much similarity to br br it's not that the italians can't produce quality productions there was a series of tv movies with a heading like <UNK> <UNK> about 1 to 7 screened on <UNK> tv in australia in the 1990s about mafia type conflicts and they were excellent but alas you won't find it here br br i assumed it was made about 1960s sadly it was 20 years out of date as <UNK> by a funeral scene near the end br br then there was the razor sharp bite of the <UNK> shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly <UNK> in the <UNK> waters br br amidst it all either in bar room <UNK> or in <UNK> the latest sea side bloody <UNK> by the relentlessly hungry shark the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone's character development br br at least the hero <UNK> a fleeting concern <UNK> for his ex wife br br but of course even if the music fails to <UNK> our <UNK> we have the sinister sound in the <UNK> voices as if to <UNK> us that another dark deed is about to emerge br br and near the end someone thought of a twist just when we thought it was all totally predictable but stay tuned folks for you may find another twist if you are watching closely to more or less warm your heart br br follow the advice of the hero and have a few beers along the way it'll make your viewing of night of the sharks more enjoyable br br then you'll be ready for something like a <UNK> movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over
<START> br br the main question i pose concerning this film is how do you film a cole porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs <UNK> and <UNK> played the lead roles on broadway here they are replaced by the weaker red <UNK> and lucille ball plot changes abound and the fun is lost br br skip it
<START> revolution is a terrible movie i don't care if you're a history teacher news writer al pacino fan there's no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate <UNK> br br the key point to the plot is tom <UNK> al trying to get money from a note he got for radical <UNK> taking his boat everything revolves around that note <UNK> son joins the army to make up for the note making tom join the army as well they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat the end br br it had a few battle scenes and they were pretty mediocre at best <UNK> between scenes used five months later and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle the love story is a joke and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow so save your notes and watch the <UNK> instead
<START> this was directed by <UNK> <UNK> a true icon to many horror film fans after he directed the <UNK> and notorious cannibal holocaust however don't expect to find any such <UNK> in the film reviewed here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like a conan inspired outing for a young audience br br such a description may instantly put off most fans of the whole conan inspired sword <UNK> genre but before you turn your nose up at this it has to be said this movie is just so much fun br br it's mostly played for laughs and features two huge and highly likable heroes in the form of david and peter paul aka the barbarian brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters br br b movie favourite richard lynch turns up as the main villain in the piece and it's also great to see roles for big george <UNK> and michael <UNK> br br added to this the ladies are stunning to behold and suitably scantily <UNK> throughout the films duration a <UNK> and much welcomed <UNK> in the genre br br what can i say this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre and i recommend it <UNK>
<START> after life is a miracle i did not expect much it's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as do you remember <UNK> bell for instance <UNK> is two hours of silly antics with no story the wild and <UNK> humor of underground seems to have <UNK> into pathetic <UNK> here it appears that kusturica has been going <UNK> downhill since he started making life <UNK> comedies beginning with black cat white cat which i think was great but already had some disturbing signs of <UNK> i liked his early films so much and this is why it's especially disappointing to see something like this let's hope his next one will be great
<START> i decided to watch this because of the <UNK> from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take <UNK> that this film will go on for <UNK> minutes if you don't have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights br br now to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you don't mind here goes br br alexandre is a <UNK> bum a <UNK> and a <UNK> he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a <UNK> shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at <UNK> and <UNK> the story reveals that alex had previously <UNK> <UNK> whom he used to live with <UNK> dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and <UNK> her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out <UNK> had <UNK> it and planned to marry someone else br br by chance alexandre meets a nurse <UNK> called <UNK> and they <UNK> up a relationship <UNK> fell in love with alex for the first time after all the <UNK> sex she had with men in the past marie and <UNK> struggles for <UNK> affection and had a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to boot finally at the end it's revealed <UNK> is pregnant with <UNK> child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as <UNK> with <UNK> situation alexandre will even get a job and be the <UNK> for his new found love and family there is hope br br with the title of la <UNK> et la <UNK> i <UNK> jean <UNK> was relating to <UNK> <UNK> character of <UNK> she was a whore and then she became the mother hence the mother and whore is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very <UNK> <UNK> political preaching theatrical insipid <UNK> and full of quotes <UNK> and <UNK> played their <UNK> characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed br br not a bad effort 7 10
<START> icy and lethal ace hit man tony <UNK> a <UNK> smooth and commanding performance by <UNK> <UNK> wants to quit the assassination business but the dangerous <UNK> he works for won't let him after his wife and child are killed <UNK> declares open season on everyone responsible for their deaths director <UNK> <UNK> relates the absorbing story at a constant snappy pace maintains a properly serious and no nonsense tone throughout stages the stirring shoot outs and exciting car chases with considerable rip <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the narrative with <UNK> <UNK> of explosive bloody violence <UNK> suave and charismatic presence adds extra class to the already engrossing proceedings this film further benefits from sterling acting by a bang up cast with <UNK> <UNK> by richard <UNK> as wise mafia <UNK> nick gusto carla <UNK> as <UNK> supportive lady friend sandra marc <UNK> as <UNK> loyal pal <UNK> <UNK> anton <UNK> as ruthless <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> gangster <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> glossy cinematography boasts several <UNK> pans <UNK> <UNK> funky score hits the get down <UNK> spot erika <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> pop up briefly in nifty bit parts better still there's no filler to speak of and we even get a decent <UNK> of tasty gratuitous female nudity the startling conclusion packs a mean and lingering <UNK> right to the gut a solid and satisfying winner
<START> wow this one sucks i'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible <UNK> br br a count invites 4 naive <UNK> back to his castle a bunch of nothing happens for a long time some lame and un erotic soft core sex scenes happen some girls get their heads cut off off screen the end br br the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue and a few brief <UNK> shots and believe me those things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of tedium that this film is in fact the best part is the tacked on beginning from the <UNK> that features some <UNK> <UNK> chicks covered in blood and showing their tits and again this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage as everyone else has noted the title of the film is completely nonsensical as there's absolutely no <UNK> nor dancing of any sort in the film at all it may as well have been called 'the goat <UNK> leads the circle <UNK> and at least then it would have had a better title that also <UNK> to nothing in the film an accurate title would have been <UNK> minutes of <UNK> another <UNK> title that would have at least been truthful for the viewer honestly the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts and i use the term <UNK> extremely loosely so i highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious <UNK> can't imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf 2 <UNK>
<START> a doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of <UNK> is <UNK> secretly on corpses from the hospital with varying success his final best chance comes when he lovingly <UNK> his <UNK> head in his jacket as he <UNK> it from a burning vehicle br br i was looking for cheese and with this premise i believed i found it it has everything everything that bad movie hunters look for chest and brain surgery with the <UNK> leaving with <UNK> white <UNK> unique camera angles i always love watching the rear passenger <UNK> of cars cheesy <UNK> stripper music and one of the longest death scenes in movie history but unfortunately these so bad they are good moments can't overcome the too bad they stink stretches br br jan in the pan annoyed me with her <UNK> monologues in a <UNK> <UNK> the somewhat less than evil laughter and the fact she was kept alive with some <UNK> home <UNK> coffee and 2 <UNK> <UNK> br br i couldn't even entertain myself with dr <UNK> horrid overacting and moral self <UNK> usually such ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion in this case i was bored with it br br the best part of the movie in my opinion was the 1960's version of body shopping and i even found myself <UNK> off during that br br don't spend money on this one there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor
<START> there are no people like show people marion davies as peggy pepper and william haines as billy <UNK> my introduction to ms davies was a clip from this film the delightfully <UNK> one in which she <UNK> a <UNK> to reveal different emotions my introduction to mr haines was in viewing this film <UNK> though it's possible i've seen him in a less memorable role haines makes an incredible impression when he joins davies for a <UNK> meal <UNK> his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the <UNK> table indeed haines and davies deliver great comic performances br br the story starts off with <UNK> henderson colonel pepper driving daughter davies into hollywood certain she will become <UNK> <UNK> sensation indeed davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars but davies <UNK> to become a true drama queen davies leaves haines and partners up with the <UNK> dramatic paul <UNK> but audiences prefer davies in more comic roles perhaps director king <UNK> is offering up a case for art imitating life br br full of great hollywood location footage both on the set and off full of great cameos at a studio lunch at the <UNK> table davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s hart the best bit player however is charlie chaplin who has enough nerve to ask davies for her <UNK> while the cameos are fun they and the episodic sequences do help show people become less of an important film and more of an important historical document br br show people 11 11 28 king <UNK> marion davies william haines <UNK> henderson
<START> it's really unfortunate that most people outside of canada think that the only things that canada produces are snow <UNK> and hockey players this film is the second <UNK> canadian film i have seen within the past few weeks the first was the red <UNK> far better than all but the best hollywood efforts br br <UNK> noble is anything but that he is a middle aged <UNK> bank employee in <UNK> in the 1970s this film <UNK> explores various things that happen to him concerning his family his friends and his work and their effect on him at the same time it is a fascinating and i would assume accurate portrayal of middle class urban life in india at the time br br however i was somewhat prepared for this having read <UNK> <UNK> book a few years ago the film as might be expected cannot capture all the <UNK> of the book but if you want to read a really good book and see a really good film read and see such a long journey
<START> i really wanted to like this movie it has a nice prison setting conspiracy theories <UNK> zombies a perfectly hideous 80s touch and it is a directorial effort by actor john <UNK> who also plays a bad you guessed it a bad guy it reminds me of some beloved italian horror flicks but the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish frightening moment in there it just goes on and on and on and then it <UNK> has to end more suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed
<START> joe don baker he was great in walking tall and had a good bit part in <UNK> but here in final justice all hope is gone the dark side has won br br as with most of humanity my main experience with this one was on mst3k and what an experience it was mike and the robots dig their <UNK> deep into <UNK> ample flesh and <UNK> this flick completely it's obvious they were just beginning with mitchell on their anti joe don kick and here lies their <UNK> on a theme br br it makes for a funny experience though there are plenty of choice <UNK> my favorites john rhys davies for sale it's <UNK> texas <UNK> none of them are <UNK> worthy why was she wearing her prom dress to bed and my favorite <UNK> of a ' what what was he the son of son of a preacher man br br by itself final justice is as joe don puts it in the movie a big fat <UNK> but here it actually has some entertainment value you get a chance catch this version of final justice br br two stars for final justice ten for the mst3k version only br br oh and try not to visit <UNK> when joe <UNK> in town
<START> i saw this movie on the film festival of <UNK> jan <UNK> and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards many people <UNK> shocked and <UNK> he will get a lot of negative critics but the world is cruel like this and it's not funny people don't like it that itself doesn't mean that the movie is bad i can see that difference don't shoot the <UNK> that shows us the world outside our <UNK> nevertheless i think this a bad movie film technically it's a good one nice shots and script most good fitting music great actors the director pretends to make a psychological movie the psychology however is of poor quality describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art the art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence how does a shy boy come to such a cruelty the director pretends to describe that but is not good in that br br the director used several times the word the <UNK> of people mentioning for instance the teacher only this teacher wasn't selfish just someone in several roles caring for his <UNK> <UNK> worried about his script i think it's a <UNK> to call him selfish the atmosphere in the village is creepy and the mother made awful mistakes <UNK> terribly let me <UNK> but it doesn't become believable for me that there is caused <UNK> a lot of pain that the <UNK> boy comes to such terrible things in fact reality is far more complex than the way this film describes  and it needs far better <UNK> the interesting thing would be how does it work describe that process for me please so that we understand br br with the written phrase on the end the director said to point to an alternative way of life it was the other extreme and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad <UNK> promoting black white thinking the connection between violence in films and in society has been proved use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right there are enough black white <UNK> in the world causing lots of war and misery i hope this movie won't be successful
<START> i absolutely loved this soap it has been one of my favorite will highly recommend i just love brazilian <UNK> they deal with real life events i'm really sad that the soap ended but i'm sure i'll be able to find it somewhere for those of you who have not seen it please see it i loved the characters the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains the only thing i would have changed is the end for <UNK> and her long life love i can't wait to see it again and highly recommend it <UNK> has been by far the best soap i have ever seen forget everything else go <UNK> hope you all like it as well
<START> why has this not been released i kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn't been how wrong can a girl be this film is in a word enthralling br br you will be captivated it holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows br br the final part of the film the episode as it were not giving anything away you saw that in the trailer is also <UNK> you will chose a favourite you will be shocked you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens the <UNK> rises and you cant not watch <UNK> to the actors it's very believable and it doesn't stop there they have a final shock for you br br it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch and how far away from this are we really <UNK> who make big brother made a tv show in holland last year offering a dying woman's <UNK> to patients in need of a transplant the show was revealed at the end to be a <UNK> ostensibly to raise awareness of <UNK> <UNK> but are we getting too close for comfort

<START> i am a motion picture production major at wright state university in <UNK> and yesterday i was sadly given the opportunity to watch this god awful film in class we were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films a complete disaster br br the problem with early sound films was that hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they weren't good at <UNK> lines so producers and directors would look to the stage to get actors sounds like a great idea right well the kind of acting one does on stage doesn't show up too well on film most of the actors in atlantic look and sound like they're acting in a play which results in lots of <UNK> laughs at the over acting another <UNK> of early sound film was the technology of <UNK> you couldn't move the <UNK> like you can today you had to keep them static or it would pick up the sound of air moving through there was usually one mike used in any given scene in this movie in one particular scene there is a man sitting at a table someone walks right up to him and delivers their line then walks away another actor comes up from behind him delivers their line then walks away it goes on like this for a couple more people the <UNK> is obviously right by the man at the table making for a laughable actor <UNK> br br those are only technical problems if you get into the story and direction then it gets even worse the story is a <UNK> account of what happened on the titanic the characters are unbelievable and pointless a story about a man cheating on his wife and their teenage daughter has no place in the movie it is barely resolved and leaves you wondering why it was there in the first place a lousy attempt at high drama the actors take long pregnant pauses between lines many times it is tiresome and you can't wait for this 90 minute feels like <UNK> at least movie to get over with i'm not going to talk a whole lot about the issue of racism at this time in our country but it really offended me that there were only two blacks in the whole movie and they were portrayed as animals they both pushed past the women and children to try and get in one of the <UNK> they were ordered to stop or be shot and of course they didn't so they were shot i was appalled br br i give this movie a 2 10 i would have given it a 1 10 the lowest rating possible but i gave it an extra point just because it was one of the first sound films and i tried to put it into context if you want to see a good early sound film check out alfred hitchcock's blackmail that also came out in the year <UNK> you will find that the best directors were able to adapt to new technology immediately
<START> i lost my father at a very young age so young in fact that i have no <UNK> of him over the years i have learned many things about him one of those things was that he loved westerns and watching bonanza every sunday evening was an absolute ritual for him i myself remember the tail end of the <UNK> run having been 8 years old when the show <UNK> production in 1973 watching this show over the years somehow makes me closer to my long ago lost father it has all the right elements to make a show successful laughter tears edge of your seat suspense and it even <UNK> you at times my most vivid memory of the show's original run came shortly after the death of our beloved <UNK> <UNK> dan <UNK> one particular episode and the end of the closing credits <UNK> a picture of <UNK> and faded to black and i can also recall my oldest sister with a tear in her eye at the sight of this i can remember this as though it were yesterday on behalf of my late father who is not here to say so himself we love bonanza long live the <UNK>
<START> without a doubt 12 monkeys is one of the best films of the sci fi genre and director terry gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality an apocalyptic film that holds you completely <UNK> 12 monkeys never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout excellent use of philadelphia locales and <UNK> sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place br br bruce willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen he is actually sane but the people of the future or present if you will <UNK> this guy's head so bad through time travel no wonder he <UNK> he gets sent to world war i just after <UNK> sent to the wrong year to find out how the army of the twelve monkeys pulls off the <UNK> of civilization as we know it they finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance we get to see willis madeleine <UNK> and an ominous brad pitt cross <UNK> over the course of 6 years br br <UNK> is sensual and solid as the risk taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that willis may not be as <UNK> up as he seems a captivating element of the relationship between her and willis is their sense of seeing each other before in another place or time 12 monkeys is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people <UNK> into it and the times of the present when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world br br the brooding city of philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for <UNK> plight to complete his mission which is against all usual hollywood stereotype not to save the world he is gathering information the film plays tricks on the viewer as well placing willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin this must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but gilliam seems to be the master of hard boiled movie making he even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like time <UNK> and brazil the screen is this man's <UNK> and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big budget films if you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy see 12 monkeys br br rating 9 of 10
<START> i was not expecting much from this movie but was very pleasantly surprised as it is light and funny and very well observed the central trio of <UNK> <UNK> were surprisingly likable as they <UNK> and <UNK> their way through their drug <UNK> trip to <UNK> the humour was gentle and subtle as indeed were the three characters witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady <UNK> the <UNK> of rural <UNK> were captured perfectly and the soundtrack was very well chosen cleverly and carefully scripted with great attention to detail i have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture i felt i was there with them very light in touch and full of fun not what you might expect from a movie about <UNK> and drugs a delight on all <UNK> and difficult to <UNK> though i thought the last two scenes were a bit lame the film should have ended when they left <UNK> but overall an unexpected treasure of a film
<START> holy crap this was the worst film i have seen in a long time all the performances are fine but there is no plot really no plot a bunch of <UNK> talk about this and that and that's your film <UNK> robert <UNK> character is <UNK> and keeps asking the same people the same <UNK> over and over this earns him the same <UNK> over and over i am pretty sure this film got <UNK> a six because people think they should like it good performances with famous and well regarded actors but the actual complete work is a steamy turd well maybe that's a bit <UNK> since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens sack
<START> there is a reason this went straight to video the story is smarmy nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way sex in <UNK> and other scenes that border on tasteless like the scene in the <UNK> room <UNK> this movie judge <UNK> as the <UNK> is okay but the movie itself with its themes of <UNK> and revenge are not well done but it is a good film for trivia <UNK> because so few people saw it
<START> i don't know what it is about donald <UNK> acting style or vocal style but he always seems to be acting from behind a massive <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> he's just i don't know thick <UNK> on <UNK> weird br br that said i just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release and frankly i don't remember it ending anything like that a bad ending too because nothing gets tied off what about the dead husband the annoying child and was the kid dubbed the scotland yard and military <UNK> i would have liked something <UNK> things up and giving some dramatic closure to it all not just the big <UNK> pull away br br and what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband even if she was trying to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to protect her kid she could always have had a headache that last encounter made me feel way too itchy and uncomfortable
<START> this was so far the worst movie i have seen in my entire life and i have seen some really bad movies i saw this movie at my local video store and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie little did i know that the cover would be the best part of the movie where to start the filming of the movie was scattered and boring at one point there is a one minute scene of no one talking just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day nothing happened they just drove in silence the whole movie is boring with annoying unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of if you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy otherwise when you see this movie run
<START> it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays it's like all you need is a camera a group of people to be your cast and crew a script and a little money and <UNK> you have a movie problem is that talent isn't always part of this <UNK> and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be <UNK> the video store shelves are filled with these so called films these aren't even guilty pleasures they're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema but most of their films are b movie gold however some of the films they've put out they had nothing to do with making and some like <UNK> weekend ' didn't deserve any form of release at all br br pros the cast members do the best they can with the lousy material some unintentional hilarity moves at a good pace should at <UNK> minutes br br cons awful writing which includes <UNK> dialogue and countless plot holes poorly lit especially the night scenes and the ending which you can't make out at all doesn't make a <UNK> of sense badly scored cheap and very dated effects total lack of character development and you won't care about anybody this is supposed to be a horror film but it's lacking in that area and isn't the least bit scary nothing interesting or exciting happens loaded with unnecessary padding br br final thoughts i never expected this to be some forgotten gem but i never imagined it would be this bad i don't know if it's the worst film ever made but it's a definite <UNK> troma should have let this film <UNK> instead of giving it a release don't make the same mistake i did and let your curiosity get the best of you br br my rating 1 5
<START> i usually don't comment anything i read the others opinions but this this one i have to comment i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action f <UNK> and other hi tech stuff but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind lousy acting lousy script and a big science fiction br br it's one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br simply don't bother br br and one more thing before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site 3 7 points and i give this movie a try now i'm wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points
<START> okay but just plain dumb not bad for a horror comedy film i was reading how people switched it with the michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe never seen it the horror possibly comedy uncle sam i'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on vhs of amazon and got it november 21 the day before <UNK> worth the four bucks l o l at this film br br 9 10
<START> in his 1966 film blow up antonioni had his hero question truth against a backdrop of british youth <UNK> by setting such questions against a fabric of hippie youth movements antonioni <UNK> intentionally or not the <UNK> of these <UNK> how can you fight for a cause when what you think is true may actually be a lie on the flip side the film said that we must fight and <UNK> challenge what we see precisely because others may be <UNK> us with false images and false truths though the hippie aspects were the most tacky parts of blow up they created a nice <UNK> and gave the film more meaning than it might otherwise have had it was a very <UNK> and mature little film br br with zabriskie point antonioni throws away all the <UNK> and subtleties of blow up and goes full blown hippie the result is a film <UNK> with bad <UNK> stupid ideas and heavy handed storytelling how could somebody who across his career displayed such restraint and intelligence make something so silly br br the film opens with a nice series of close ups as we watch a group of <UNK> discussing the meaning of revolution suddenly one man mark gets up and leaves he hates the rigid and ordered nature of revolution he <UNK> that though <UNK> fight for freedom to <UNK> <UNK> to such a <UNK> cause is to effectively give your freedom away and so like jack nicholson in the passenger mark just wants to be free br br as such mark buys a gun and goes solo he takes orders from no one when police raid his university campus mark shoots a guy and runs away he then <UNK> to a nearby <UNK> steals a small private plane and flies out to the desert antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful <UNK> and <UNK> it with the <UNK> <UNK> cities with their <UNK> and hollow modern <UNK> he sees the desert as a sort of garden of <UNK> br br in the desert mark meets daria and quickly falls in love antonioni then gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand free from the constraints of modern life these tree <UNK> and student <UNK> can now celebrate their <UNK> by <UNK> in the sun br br the film ends with mark dying and daria <UNK> about blowing up the <UNK> and <UNK> homes of the rich <UNK> who killed him it's <UNK> challenge to his audience pick up the guns <UNK> and <UNK> he says tear the walls down before they cage you in br br of course the film had no effect on its audience they <UNK> zabriskie point as being just another self <UNK> commercial attempt at being radical a sort of <UNK> <UNK> it felt <UNK> and tame br br <UNK> the film is pretty stupid antonioni basically says that if you are unhappy with the modern world and the fat cats who exploit you you should either flee to the desert mark or <UNK> fight the system daria that's all well and good but though artists constantly warn us of such <UNK> nightmares they're all mostly unable to show us how to effectively <UNK> change like the end of fight club <UNK> and violence achieve nothing in the real world social change tends to be <UNK> by humble <UNK> <UNK> ahead by minor technological <UNK> i mean what <UNK> women more than <UNK> br br 3 10 a very bad film the problem is antonioni does not really believe in rebellion he is a quiet and <UNK> man an <UNK> who seems to have made an <UNK> film simply to garner more <UNK> from the <UNK> who <UNK> his earlier film blow up as such <UNK> point comes across as a very pretentious and stupid film it's essentially a 50 year old man say look at me i'm a daring rebel br br there are many films in which the audience is encouraged to fight the system but they all fall into one of four categories in the first category you have films like network cool hand luke <UNK> nest and <UNK> these all show that the lives of freedom fighters all end in failure though in each case the spirit of revolution survives the message is that you can not effect change but by dying or failing the optimistic notion of change survives through <UNK> essentially we must keep on failing rather than give up hope br br then you have films like fight club zabriskie point and falling down which simply encourage you to explode tear it all down blow it all up everything is a lie so you might as well go out guns blazing these films are <UNK> out of angry <UNK> feelings rather than any sort of common sense br br then you have the flight rather than fight category <UNK> <UNK> and antonioni are the masters of this genre films like the passenger red desert and <UNK> show human beings running from worlds they do not like and <UNK> islands or peaceful <UNK> for themselves both directors are <UNK> in that <UNK> has his islands destroyed and antonioni has his islands offering no sense of happiness or solution br br then you have the fourth category films like <UNK> the lives of others <UNK> bound for glory and kubrick's a clockwork orange treat artists as a force of change and rebellion in these <UNK> worlds in which everyone is content to be a slave to the state it is the <UNK> creativity and freedom of will of the artist criminal who keeps the system in check by simply existing outside of the herd you create waves your comments actions and critical eye challenges the status <UNK> as such <UNK> film has <UNK> and artists <UNK> nazi germany whilst kubrick has alex the artist criminal fighting nazi <UNK> painting the town in blood and <UNK>
<START> this film <UNK> my expectations i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish so i wasn't expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didn't take well to the lead girl and didn't really care if she lived or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character it's not just some slasher film where people die for no reason there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if you're not sure just watch it anyway it's only an hour and a half of your life you're going to live for 80 years anyway
<START> with the current trend of gross out humor this film is the <UNK> of them all while some of the humor is dated every skit will either shock <UNK> or make you laugh out loud most memorable is the sex games commentary and of course the <UNK> commercial it doesn't always work but pays off when it does i give this a 7
<START> a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a <UNK> battling his former <UNK> for some <UNK> these non heroes plan to sell to the <UNK> low rent video nonsense by the producers of <UNK> <UNK> offers some decent action footage and a lot of <UNK> staged drama a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects although the final twists and <UNK> shifts could've been a nifty end to a better movie burt still has presence although it also means you notice more when he mouths <UNK> half baked one liners
<START> the first film ever made workers <UNK> from a factory some <UNK> most walking moving right or left along with <UNK> the <UNK> are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema with <UNK> begins narrative fiction cinema fantasy <UNK> spectacle with the <UNK> pure <UNK> observation the truth there are many <UNK> who regret the <UNK> of cinema from the latter into the tired <UNK> of the former br br but consider this short again there is nothing <UNK> about it the film is full of action a static <UNK> scene burst into life activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is <UNK> <UNK> from the back to right or left but never of course the front where the camera is and yet the camera stands stock still contains the energy the possible <UNK> <UNK> it to its will the <UNK> may be a revolutionary invention but it will be used for conservative purposes to map out the world edit it <UNK> it limit it br br worse is the historical reality of the film these factory workers are <UNK> employees the bosses are <UNK> on their workers the unseen eye regarding his <UNK> <UNK> the film therefore describes two types of <UNK> behind the gates the workers are confined in their <UNK> the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom escape but they face another wall the fourth wall further <UNK> them the first film is also the first example of <UNK> <UNK> an image of unseen all seeing authority <UNK> its servants a frightening all too <UNK> movie
<START> very good martial arts film and jet li is the best since the master himself bruce lee li is excellent as the low key <UNK> cop who saves all time and time again he has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king that you don't mess with <UNK> <UNK> is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed <UNK> she has an innocence and an <UNK> all at the same time that i found unforgettable the villain the man with the <UNK> and long hair was very good as well but i can't find his name in the credits can some one help me out with that thanks enjoy <UNK> <UNK> or black mask in any language its good entertainment
<START> i saw <UNK> on tv last night 12 <UNK> 2009 i am <UNK> years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember i can <UNK> say that <UNK> stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen the accents were shameful the local children's club would have produced better sets the characters were so wooden that they probably <UNK> dry <UNK> from the tears of the <UNK> who had the misfortune to watch them it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film
<START> little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for even though their house was filthy this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness on the message board a poster wrote that little edie has the <UNK> skills of an eight year old this reminded me of when in the <UNK> 2009 version big edie says to little edie if you're stuck it's only with yourself these women had everything beauty talent intelligence firm belief in their opinions and actions perhaps if little edie wasn't so hard on herself the first time things didn't work out losing her hair her job and the love of her life she would have made it this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead the world will never know what have happened if she didn't listen to her mom's <UNK> come home edie let me take care of you br br yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant heartbreaking and lovable even in their extremely filthy home these women were extraordinary and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness when edie had one of her emotional <UNK> <UNK> about what could have been or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that everything will be okay br br great documentary br br 9 10
<START> this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd since my 33 <UNK> got lost and any <UNK> i made are also long gone br br i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin <UNK> little st nick it also contained a few little known songs original br br even though it was done at the end of the <UNK> this show had a timeless feel to it hoping to find a copy soon
<START> it's hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts but i know that humor is very <UNK> i have seen all of their sound shorts by far the best of their stuff imo and i found this one of their weaker efforts br br in the year this was made 1930 stan and babe made 15 shorts and one feature they were extremely popular and their boss hal roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly in addition this was a time of <UNK> for the writers and stan i would say this was an experiment that really did not work as someone else said it does not play to their strengths too much dialog and plot br br the best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with stan as <UNK> the maid and the great thelma todd talking about girl stuff br br if you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out <UNK> or <UNK> from the same year br br they made so many shorts in such a short time that i think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts they made something like <UNK> films altogether very few except for the ones made at fox were outright failures but there are some county hospital me and my pal the live ghost the <UNK> <UNK> come to mind as essentially weak ones but other then those i find something wonderful in just about all their shorts quite a record in my book br br if you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out but i would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to stan and babe
<START> coming shortly before the <UNK> of a morality code <UNK> the spirits of writers directors and actors the first film adaptation of w <UNK> <UNK> of human bondage <UNK> countless <UNK> it has no shock value today just fine acting br br while the cast is excellent this is bette <UNK> first great role and one of leslie <UNK> best performances howard is english wannabe <UNK> artist philip carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius taking the lesson to heart he returns to london and <UNK> in a medical college one by the way that seems to have no female students at that time there would have been at least a few perhaps author <UNK> <UNK> didn't care for <UNK> <UNK> br br having tea one day carey is <UNK> by a waitress mildred rogers bette davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked <UNK> her cockney accent is as sharp as <UNK> <UNK> his repeated attempts to date her are <UNK> with the less than enthusiastic <UNK> i don't mind a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he's <UNK> the depths <UNK> mildred <UNK> her waitress <UNK> with a bit of old fashioned street walking something not clearly brought out here br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> serves <UNK> <UNK> need for support of the financial kind he is desperately in love with her she plays him as a sunday church <UNK> effortlessly <UNK> her <UNK> no sex here <UNK> that he is getting nowhere he begins a <UNK> relationship with <UNK> a woman who <UNK> him re enter mildred <UNK> with a baby and in her usual need of being taken care of exit <UNK> <UNK> br br another <UNK> from mildred and carey begins a long term friendship with sally <UNK> <UNK> by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be <UNK> of one of his nine <UNK> br br the movie reasonably but not entirely follows <UNK> excellent novel <UNK> carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a <UNK> facing a double <UNK> shotgun mildred is <UNK> wicked a user of the worst kind her sole <UNK> with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to <UNK> carey with a thin <UNK> of <UNK> words and offers at one point she promises she'll do anything he wants a daring statement for the times and one i'm sure audiences fully understood br br pre code it may be but <UNK> quick march <UNK> would have satisfied the league of catholic decency the ending is conventional sin loses <UNK> behavior <UNK> br br director john <UNK> <UNK> excellent performances from his two main stars one well established the other established largely because of this film the atmosphere is 1930s london and the trip back in time is worth taking br br available on dvd br br 9 10 for <UNK> and <UNK> performances
<START> a rousing adventure form director george stevens before he would turn to more serious fare such as <UNK> i remember mama and <UNK> giant that set the standard for all future action <UNK> to follow loosely based on <UNK> <UNK> poem of the same gunga din follows the journey of three military officers in 19th century india the noble trio must brave a series of battles and other various dangers including a <UNK> cult and a temple full of gold their screen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades and have <UNK> inspiration to nearly everything from the cliffhanger inspired space opera star wars 1977 to the similarly plotted <UNK> of the lost arc 1981 br br the biggest reason for the <UNK> success however is the pitch perfect performances by the film's trio of extremely charismatic actors victor mclaglen has rarely been better as the <UNK> tough guy cary grant is the ultimate comic foil and douglas fairbanks jr is as suave a <UNK> hero as imaginable perhaps even more so than rival errol flynn the chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved upon and such warm and believable <UNK> is precisely what's missing from most modern action pictures and they receive tremendous support from the marvelous sam <UNK> who <UNK> the obvious physical <UNK> and makes the title character a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and quiet strength a huge hit in its day the film was reportedly the second biggest money maker of 1939 behind the outrageously successful gone with the wind and it remains arguably the best film of its kind
<START> this movie is just horrible it's boring it's low quality the actors are just the worst actors i have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that it's hilarious br br the main actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls but he's ugly overweight and looks like he's from the early 90's br br all the characters are away for the week end for a get together amongst friends but nobody are actually friends the married couple hasn't seen the main guy in over 5 years and even back then they weren't really friends the date of the main guy only knows him from work and than there's a girl they pick up at a bar now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week end at your cabin with people that aren't even your real friends because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie br br do not waste even one minute of your time on this <UNK> i've made home movies scarier than this br br
<START> i saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening and i must say i was extremely disappointed and i have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast claire danes in the lead role depending on what you think about danes she was either horribly miscast or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 <UNK> for worst actress i think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her instead she is completely unlikeable the other great actresses do an ok job but certainly don't light up the screen out of all the great actresses in this movie i'd say the one who did the best job was natasha richardson streep is barely in the picture and only appears near the very end br br horrible screenplay as well it comes off more as them reading lines than truly being in character
<START> with the <UNK> of the imdb this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience why because users here who do a search on two time academy award winner glenda jackson can find 'the return of the <UNK> among her credits so can those checking out oscar winner julie christie fans of ann <UNK> can give the title a click as will those looking into the career of the great alan bates not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting <UNK> ian <UNK> and frank <UNK> any movie with so many <UNK> in it is rewarded by the imdb given all the cross <UNK> that goes on here so why isn't this movie out on dvd don't the producers realize the internet movie <UNK> is a marketing gift for such a film and 'the return of the <UNK> is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered get with it people
<START> there's nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience instead br br it's only my opinion but a good thriller is <UNK> upon the establishment of likable intelligent characters as far as <UNK> is concerned the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple nicely done unfortunately they are stupid beyond belief let us count the ways they <UNK> being <UNK> by a stalker br br 1 after a <UNK> threatens to kill you be sure to tell him what hotel you're staying at when you drop him off br br 2 beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses thereby allowing him to press charges of assault br br 3 don't bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume for no apparently good reason that the cops were <UNK> by him br br 4 while trying to escape let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her br br 5 after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him one on one no point in being unfair right br br now i'd never expect that any person would be <UNK> to making a few mistakes under these <UNK> conditions but the characters in say yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it's effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety since they are victims of their own doing this kills the <UNK> of the entire film br br in case you were wondering the <UNK> didn't stop with dim witted characters since they themselves are surely dim witted for writing this <UNK> they decided to make situations so <UNK> unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window br br 1 the stalker kills a cop inside a police station  while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away br br 2 the stalker <UNK> in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior br br 3 the stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being br br 4 the suspense scenes had no imagination whatsoever in fact some scenes were direct rip offs from american movies br br the only positive is the <UNK> near the end which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife it's too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left field br br truly the <UNK> behind the making of say yes should be ashamed of themselves better yet they should just move to california and take <UNK> with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence
<START> this movie is even a big step down form the typical fare <UNK> out by bollywood the performances were horrible even <UNK> <UNK> who always manages to shine goes completely <UNK> as the villain the soundtrack is not memorable either and in spite trying hard the female leads don't manage to be sexy <UNK> <UNK> is capable of far better projects while <UNK> khan seems to be stuck in similar fare for the time being but this monstrosity is even beneath his limited <UNK> as an actor <UNK> <UNK> and amrita <UNK> are horrible in badly written cliché roles it's high time for <UNK> kumar to hang up his directorial hat hope he never directs another <UNK> like this future of hindi movies are in better hands now to sum it up stay far away from waste of celluloid
<START> 2 stars for kay francis she's wonderful and she didn't deserve this horrible tripe that warner bros threw her way br br the two <UNK> premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme kay is a small town wife and mother who <UNK> for something bigger she wants to be an actress when a big shot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities kay tells her husband she's going to the movies the <UNK> <UNK> of a mother puts a bug in <UNK> ear that <UNK> not being truthful and he sets out looking for her he finds her w the actor in the hotel they are only talking and he slugs the guy who falls over a <UNK> lands face first in a pond lake and dies now here's the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based br br 1 the judge tells the jury that if it's determined that the man died before his head went into the water that they must find the <UNK> guilty of first degree murder <UNK> i think <UNK> a guy in a fit of rage would count for <UNK> or murder 2 at the most not first degree murder give me a break but the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life whatever br br 2 the <UNK> lawyer after the conviction and <UNK> tells kay that it's all her fault his reasoning is that if she hadn't gone over to the actor's room then her husband wouldn't have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him he tells her that she's the guilty one not her husband and she <UNK> and agrees what the hell the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place br br i can't even go on with this review the movie was just all too painful four years earlier in the pre code days you'd never have caught kay playing such a <UNK> in true kay francis fashion though she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this <UNK> role this character was a far cry from pre code kay roles and real life <UNK> kay francis br br steer way clear of this one there are much better kay francis vehicles out there from personal experience i can highly recommend mary stevens <UNK> and jewel robbery also good are dr monica and one way passage i'm sure there's other great kay flicks as well but i'm only mentioning the ones i've seen and can recommend
<START> i have loved this book since my <UNK> grade teacher read it to our class many years ago and i have read it to every one of my 3rd and <UNK> grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching supposedly a movie had been made in the past but i'd never been able to locate it well my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought <UNK> <UNK> excellent book to the screen br br as i watched the movie i had the highest of hopes as the film went on i became more and more <UNK> they had <UNK> it badly never had i been so let down by a favorite book to film adaption i understand that films can't stick strictly to a book but they don't need to change things for the sake of it most if not all of <UNK> from the book were totally unnecessary br br i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie well it wasn't just me nearly every single one felt the same way cheated out of the great story that <UNK> <UNK> had so <UNK> created br br why they wondered did aunt beast look like <UNK> from the star wars movie why couldn't <UNK> hair have been red why did mrs which not have the proper witch like outfit that was such a clever play on her name basically we all wondered why did nearly every single detail have to be changed br br i have always <UNK> of how wonderful a movie this book would make i am still waiting for that movie this one was a <UNK> in time in only the <UNK> of senses i'm going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task
<START> somebody owes ang lee an <UNK> actually a lot of people do and i'll start i was never interested in the ang lee film hulk because of the near <UNK> bad reviews even the <UNK> cable channels seemed to rarely show it i finally decided to watch it yesterday on usa network and wow br br spoilers for ang lee's hulk and the incredible hulk br br was it boring i almost didn't make it through ang lee's hulk eric <UNK> was <UNK> nick nolte was horrible sam elliott was unlikeable and that's no fun he's usually a cool character in fact i honestly think they chose eric <UNK> because his non <UNK> face was the <UNK> to <UNK> with computer graphics and it was clear that the ang lee hulk was meant to <UNK> resemble bruce <UNK> in his non angry state when hulk fought a mutant <UNK> i was ready to <UNK> hulk as the worst superhero movie ever br br but then something happened about 3 4 of the way through this tedious movie there was a genuinely exciting and dare i say it reasonably convincing extended action scene that starts with hulk breaking out of a <UNK> chamber in a military base fighting <UNK> tanks and <UNK> <UNK> in the desert then riding an <UNK> <UNK> into the <UNK> only to be captured on the streets of san francisco this was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie and i have to say the cgi was quite good that's not to say that the hulk was totally convincing but it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non superhero action movies and that's quite a feat br br of course the ending got really stupid with bruce <UNK> father turning into some sort of shape shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of iron man's brief <UNK> to shame and overall apart from the animated mutant dogs it really did seem like the cgi in hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really <UNK> with his environment it was certainly better than i expected br br ok but what about the incredible hulk guess what it's boring too it has just a few appearances by the hulk and here's the thing the cgi in this movie is horrible maybe the hulk in ang lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others but it had its convincing moments also the incredible hulk looked positively ridiculous it had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature just some sort of computer generated <UNK> it was really preposterous the lighting environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than ang lee's they looked 10 years older and there really is no excuse for that we truly are living in an era where computer <UNK> can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director actor or cinematographer ever could br br worse the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from ang lee's failure all the same mistakes are made bruce <UNK> is practically <UNK> the general is so relentlessly <UNK> one dimensional that he seems <UNK> than the hulk the love interest is unconvincing i have to give <UNK> tyler credit for being more emotional than jennifer <UNK> though both are quite easy on the eyes tim blake nelson overacts almost as much as nick nolte even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes the hulk really doesn't do much in this movie certainly not any more than in ang lee's version the incredible hulk was slightly more fast paced but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much oh yeah the villain is every bit as phony looking as the hulk he's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster br br this is how i can <UNK> say ang lee's version was better if i ever have the chance to see ang lee's version again i might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more more likely i'd just fast forward to the good parts but there is absolutely not a single scene in the incredible hulk that is worth seeing once let alone twice it is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies the cartoonish cgi is an insult to the audience at least in ang lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic except for the giant <UNK> of course br br it is absolutely mind <UNK> how the filmmakers intended to <UNK> the bad feelings associated with ang lee's hulk by making almost exactly the same movie br br it is to edward <UNK> credit that he seems to be <UNK> himself from this film
<START> so i rented still crazy instead when i described hardcore <UNK> to the guy at the video store he said that sounded kind of like still crazy so i rented it was i disappointed well yes as still crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band but that's ok still crazy tells the story of the strange fruit a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival twenty years later the band members are all struggling to make a living and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year <UNK> of this festival they take up the offer and decide to <UNK> on a permanent basis <UNK> europe in the process some quite funny <UNK> ensue and all the characters go through subtle changes watching this movie you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a <UNK> and that's not bad at all
<START> i feel like i've been had the con is on don't fall for it after reading glowing reviews the director was a film reviewer with sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing <UNK> reviews i expected solid acting atmosphere suspense strong characterization an intriguing plot development and poetic moments sadly <UNK> years of <UNK> doesn't deliver on the critics promises for the most part sacrifices these qualities in <UNK> of cheesy low budget special effects what was that clichéd <UNK> scene in there for unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration cliché edits and camera angles br br <UNK> years of <UNK> starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in scotland but it's straight downhill from here unfortunately instead of spending some time building atmosphere creating characters we might care about or building suspense the director <UNK> to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed <UNK> voice <UNK> the lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted the audience doesn't care what happens to them desperate actors do desperate things like this movie to make matters worse the <UNK> typical of a director trying to pay his <UNK> to past masters are either utterly cliché or unconvincing the soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the action br br for some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying i still watched the whole damn thing br br i guess i liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often inter cut with weird and abstract sometimes pointless scenes you don't need a huge budget to make truly moving film so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film half a million is not a little bit of money so no excuses sometimes i wonder what the actors or their agents were thinking br br pass on this turkey unless you're <UNK> or mindless anyway not my thing br br 1 5 10
<START> this movie is a great way for the series to finally end peter the boy from puppet master iii is all grown up and is now the puppet master well this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn <UNK> secrets but instead she <UNK> to the story about the puppets most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii puppet master iii puppet master 4 puppet master 5 curse of the puppet master and retro puppet master sorry but i guess paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from 1 personally i wish puppet master vs demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say this is the final movie in the series
<START> ok for starters taxi driver is amazing this this is not taxi driver or amazing what it is is bad but i thought it was bad funny which means that it did have some redeeming qualities like the dialogue wow there was more or less no plot the characters were all stupid and the movie was preachy there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder i can't even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie yeah it's worth watching if you are real bored and you want to <UNK> the fact that anyone can make a movie or at least can try to
<START> well when before i saw this film i really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea how wrong i was i thought that this was one of the best films i've watched for a very long time a real family classic the story of a young <UNK> and his new <UNK> dad this film <UNK> all the boxes i've not read the book maybe that's a good thing meant i enjoyed the film more but with regards to the story i really can't think of any bad points hence <UNK> it 10 out of 10 and i hardly ever think anything <UNK> top marks by the time william <UNK> 'i can ride my bike dad ' i was <UNK> my heart out anyone who's seen it will understand i'm sure really heartwarming and definitely recommended
<START> cinema is dead long live the cinema said peter <UNK> one of the most innovative and <UNK> contemporary directors at the last year's romanian film festival <UNK> which got to the third edition and takes place in the <UNK> <UNK> this year the direction prize went to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i got to see it this evening in <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> cinema is dead but still very lively <UNK> film tells in a compelling manner how iranian society looks <UNK> filmed <UNK> is a story inspired by a real life event happened to <UNK> daughter the trouble and risk took when decided to attend a football match this is forbidden in iran as we are informed what <UNK> manages to do is to render with few means but with probably a lot of work intelligence and humor the cultural <UNK> in a society that places women at a distinct level the absurdity of the laws becomes comical the film has a happy end after all because <UNK> team goes to the world cup what i appreciated most was the concept the idea behind this film i would be very interested to see <UNK> other films that were forbidden in iran as well i guess that he can be thought as an <UNK> director
<START> rip off of scream or especially i know what you did last summer there's some entertainment here and a little scary but they needed some originality br br an entertainment score 6 5 10 overall 5 5 10
<START> watching before the devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema i have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film and for me the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either <UNK> or <UNK> by the general audience it is one of those films that has stayed with me and i continue to <UNK> and think about it br br surely the dvd would <UNK> some more of the themes and the film making elements which include sidney <UNK> comeback movie the time shifting technique <UNK> in the storytelling the superb combination of lumet and masterson and why it works so well the <UNK> direction the relatively rare focus hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open <UNK> book for their women the under presented but nevertheless <UNK> marisa <UNK> performance and of course the superb hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts for me the heart of the movie br br <UNK> surely a masterful film so imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated dvd only to find no commentary no behind the scenes no interviews no extras br br hey <UNK> sort it out
<START> this is one of the all time great our gang shorts <UNK> is at his very <UNK> and funniest and the babies that he <UNK> left to <UNK> are also hilarious tiny <UNK> is <UNK> by the gang into watching all their little siblings the opening shot of them all in baby <UNK> being entertained by various things hung by the gang from fishing <UNK> is a beautiful gag br br <UNK> appearance wearing his huge toy knife when asked to <UNK> by the older <UNK> is priceless as is his response hey where do you get that stuff i don't take care of no babies the tiny fellow saying remarkable throughout the film all the beautiful sight gags and <UNK> telling the babies all about tarzan add up to make this one of the best our gang 's you'll ever see
<START> directed by brian de palma and written by oliver stone scarface is a movie that will not be forgotten a cuban <UNK> named tony montana pacino comes to america for the american dream montana then becomes the king in the drug world as he <UNK> runs his empire of crime in miami florida this gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are unpleasant to watch this movie has around <UNK> f words and is almost three hours long this movie is entertaining and you will never get bored you cheer for the drug lord and in some scenes you find out that montana isn't as evil as some other crime <UNK> this is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this you will not be disappointed 9 10
<START> this is one of the worst action films i have ever seen this is particularly due to much of the factual <UNK> like an obvious agent posing as a bank <UNK> officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though <UNK> has not found a <UNK> <UNK> does not mean that it will never find one the cheap sets the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a <UNK> and the bad acting it is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus however the head <UNK> who decides to remove it from a bank security <UNK> box does so at the same time a bank heist is going down at the same fbi agents have been informed of this and at the same time a terrible <UNK> <UNK> needless to say the aftermath of the <UNK> is messy in more ways than one however the results do not make for an <UNK> action film but instead one that has been obviously z grade junk from the beginning of the film perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the <UNK> look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film what the hell ron <UNK> was doing in this i have no idea i wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as i was to have watched it
<START> nominated for the oscar worst script ever in my opinion there's no decent story <UNK> acting very lousy humor by every means possible if you have little self respect please don't waste your time seeing this movie although u can see the actors can act it leaves you dumber after watching it precious <UNK> are being killed watching this crap br br i warned u br br don't see this movie
<START> i first saw this at a foreign film festival it's a beautifully paced nail <UNK> about a plot to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of a billion or so in gold it's all shot in a gritty grainy style that hollywood rarely uses but it captures the atmosphere of the newly <UNK> <UNK> states beautifully note <UNK> was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when i was there br br there's a lot of humor and some romance too i don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises so i'll just say this heist film starts from a great script and the directing and performances are top notch darkness in <UNK> is simply the <UNK> and most nerve <UNK> example of its genre i'd put it up against <UNK> <UNK> and it's miles ahead of the new <UNK> 11 though deliberately not as glossy rent or buy it now
<START> i turn on 700 club once in awhile and only agree with some of the statements made i'm one of many <UNK> that is considered liberal by most christians and conservative by most non christians i vote my mind and its usually not <UNK> or <UNK> i don't believe 700 club tells people what to believe but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds i think many folks <UNK> what is said on 700 club it <UNK> me out to hear name calling either direction i think 700 club folks really do love jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote <UNK> that they've forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like jesus did please don't judge jesus based on ignorant individuals that believe on him and let's also not be as ignorant with our comments about them why are people so mean to each other
<START> it has singing it has drama it has comedy it has a story it's one of the greatest movies ever made period if you can't enjoy this movie then you must be either asleep or in some kind of mental <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> dandy james cagney sings and dances his way to an academy award but in this movie he is better this is james cagney at his <UNK> best he's fast with the one liners he's fast with his feet it's <UNK> action and the song and dance skits are classics especially shanghai <UNK> and the supporting cast is great and the entire movie is upbeat fast moving and exudes confidence and even though this movie was made over 70 years ago it's still watchable even today and of course this movie features miss ruby keeler who was married to al <UNK> she is the perfect partner for james cagney and dick powell too if you like upbeat fast paced movies with lots of singing and dancing this is the movie to watch
<START> i've seen this about 2 or 3 times and haven't <UNK> it <UNK> bound is not just a typical animal movie its unique fun and <UNK> with adventure the things that make it a fun movie are the animals obvious who are wonderfully trained a very good effort br br 8 5 10
<START> the first film was a nice one but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired but the dogs are very cute here and eric <UNK> is hilarious as the <UNK> the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes especially <UNK> and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very good <UNK> <UNK> is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as <UNK> <UNK> but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously over the top performance as cruella even more evil than she was previously overall nice 7 10 <UNK> cox
<START> just watched this after my mother brought it back from america for me was <UNK> watching this after all the negative comments on here but i have to say yes the acting is cheesy some of the effects are laughable br br but you have to remember this was meant to be <UNK> not 2005 and for such a low budget i thought it was quite good i enjoyed this version much more then the spielberg version i saw last week br br i have read the book so many times and found myself going <UNK> yes that's in the book almost all the time with the other version hardly anything of the book existed br br so well done for at least trying to make a true version
<START> everything in this film is bad the story the acting the effects but its funny funny funny scott valentine with the army uniform thats ten <UNK> too big is so bad with the permanent attempt at a <UNK> on his face as the leader of a special <UNK> group its hilarious the <UNK> are as scary and realistic as the <UNK> this is so <UNK> and bad at everything it tries you have to laugh the part where the giant t rex who somehow <UNK> on board a ship and then somehow got below is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where its head was is the perfect ending if your into bad films this is the pot of gold the <UNK> lisa of b b bad
<START> everything is <UNK> in <UNK> when the little family moves in as the father have got a new job in a computer company there but no paradise would be complete without its snake strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband as it certainly holds secrets the father is not a <UNK> but pressure is on him to join as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members robert <UNK> good guy part is a bit tepid but joanna cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty <UNK> suspenseful and well made <UNK> with a bitchy susan <UNK> as club <UNK> look out for cult favorite michael <UNK> in a bit part as a <UNK> the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for i have seen this movie quite a few times
<START> spoilers maybe a few details but nothing too plot related not like it would matter with this movie br br air rage blatantly rips off the mid air <UNK> premise of executive decision ice t leads a team of four elite <UNK> who wear <UNK> black shirts that we can only imagine must <UNK> invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics similar to what 3rd <UNK> use when playing star wars on the <UNK> lead them to <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> br br what entertained me the most about this flick was the use of look alike has been actors you'll immediately recognize <UNK> <UNK> as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked though it was so long ago that you probably won't be able to place it it was <UNK> here <UNK> plays a decent knock off of a bill paxton character most hilarious is <UNK> <UNK> gerard who's so fat that you will never recognize him as tv's buck rogers instead of <UNK> his mildly heroic character past gerard gives us a passable performance of the <UNK> fat tough guy persona which was clearly <UNK> for john goodman finally alex <UNK> gives us a nice hybrid look alike performance as a chuck <UNK> kirk douglas type in the 10 years since new jack city ice <UNK> acting has <UNK> remarkably it's not acting so much as <UNK> of lines that he might have actually <UNK> br br one of the items that plays into this movie is a cd <UNK> of classified information it's being hand carried and it's apparently and unbelievably not <UNK> despite the security <UNK> aura of <UNK> <UNK> character what a joke i'm severely <UNK> that the information <UNK> to be on the cd would ever even all be assembled into a <UNK> format br br despite being in a closed aircraft without <UNK> the <UNK> is about as loud as <UNK> air and causes <UNK> a person to <UNK> so apparently no <UNK> budget the assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny the flight <UNK> use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film when she takes <UNK> to the mini <UNK> pistol which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever that's just too stupid a true elite team would carry <UNK> <UNK> for this type thing or maybe <UNK> <UNK> or even <UNK> hi powers if they were really old school or maybe something <UNK> 5 7 if new school the lame o standard issue <UNK> are totally unbelievable having lost most of their cool after lethal weapon i the bad guys supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types have an <UNK> mixture of absurdity like the aforementioned mini <UNK> pistol and a <UNK> 9 with the infamous non <UNK> barrel <UNK> that isn't a <UNK> br br there was one touch of realism on which i would like to correct the other reviewers the flight attendant and ice t did lower the craft to 10 000 feet for <UNK> air before they opened the door and i also got the impression that the flight attendant was not able to get the door closed that she basically just gave up on that point as far as the landing there was no mention of <UNK> until about 2 seconds before <UNK> sigh br br only the dukes of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> p <UNK> at the pass could shame this movie for use of stock footage they obviously chose the incredible and retired sr <UNK> because they couldn't get stock of an f <UNK> aside from the fact that they were <UNK> already in 2001 let's also forget for a moment that the sr <UNK> is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the b 2 and that at point blank range well i'm no expert but i'm having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on radar br br as others have pointed out the repeated references to f <UNK> when they were showing f <UNK> was laughable details of the <UNK> were pretty stupid no <UNK> would put that few passengers on a <UNK> to begin with not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it pay attention to the use of exposed <UNK> <UNK> br br wow what a show catch it on stars or something don't pay to rent it but do watch it for laughs in <UNK> for worst movie ever right up there with no holds <UNK> which at least had some originality

<START> i saw a preview of <UNK> at the <UNK> of man <UNK> as i had heard about it in a couple of motorcycle <UNK> although i was over mainly for the racing the lure of seeing phil daniels in a motorcycle movie yes i love <UNK> like everyone else proved enough to get me away from the beer and <UNK> at last we've done it us british have actually made a great motorcycle film and no it's not like <UNK> this is up there with the best of british comedy mark my words this is phil daniels best screen performance and as far as <UNK> bell is concerned there's a new british legend making his name felt i loved gary stretch in <UNK> <UNK> fantastic dead mans shoes and here he gives a quietly touching performance that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation this is a film not just for us <UNK> but i think for everyone even my girlfriend loved it i hope it gets the same brilliant response on the <UNK> as it got at the <UNK> of man i'm not going to go into the details of certain classic scenes that this movie has watch out for the shop as it would spoil the fun but i would say go see enjoy and have one of the best nights in the cinema you've had in a while i really think this could well be a cult classic as they were saying at the <UNK> c'mon <UNK>
<START> i just want to start by saying this is the first review of a film i have done on the net i felt the need to warn people about this film because it truly is one of the worst films i have ever seen after reading interviews with the director he says he respects <UNK> criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be so <UNK> terrible br br 1 the actors i know the budget may not have allowed for great <UNK> but with nicholson working in the industry for over ten years surely he knew some actors who were at least average br br 2 the incredibly lame make up and special effects once again budget obviously <UNK> with what was originally intended but after working in make up for so many years there is really no excuse br br 3 the obvious similarities to hostel whilst not being exactly a rip off it sure does try to cash in on the former films success only problem is roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there br br 4 the music not at all creepy or haunting not even sickening just plain annoying br br 5 the script in general all dialogue was forced and terrible also the sub plots about the theatre and the guy who comes in to save them were weak as and almost like an <UNK> br br 6 the editing wtf how jarring and not in a good way <UNK> said br br seriously i would like to hear the director's thoughts on my post he no doubt <UNK> his pages on imdb cause buddy what were you thinking surely at some point during either the shooting or editing you realised what a turkey <UNK> had on your hands sorry i don't want to be harsh but you must have more talent than this i hope your next feature that <UNK> movie or <UNK> is better hopefully practice makes progress br br but in the mean time avoid this like the plague i want my <UNK> mins back with interest at least i didn't pay to watch it
<START> a first time director <UNK> has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged middle class depressed hit man and his struggle with his relationship with his father this film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature david <UNK> as the 6 year old son of william h macy is the most refreshing little actor i've seen in awhile macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the <UNK> of his father and his business it's always great to see donald sutherland and here he's wonderful as the <UNK> father of macy the films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast locations and filmed the movie the basic <UNK> 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded the cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background any film buff or <UNK> of human nature will enjoy this one especially if he's a fan of <UNK>
<START> this along with <UNK> <UNK> ranks as one of the best bugs cartoons indeed one of the best bugs ever there are some comments about how bugs in these cartoons is basic meaning i guess that he is as yet not fully developed i actually prefer this basic version from the mid 40s chuck jones' was the best version who is actually more rabbit sized and far more amusing than the eventual long <UNK> version who <UNK> over <UNK> sam and <UNK> duck the latter day bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking also check out hair raising <UNK> 1946 and rabbit punch 1948 for great examples of classic bugs and classic chuck jones
<START> first off anyone looking for meaningful outcome oriented cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated <UNK> heartfelt <UNK> please leave now you are wasting your time and life is short go see the new <UNK> jolie movie have a good cry go out buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict <UNK> if that will make you feel better and leave us alone br br don't let the door hit you on the way out either the incredible melting man is a grade b minus <UNK> horror epic shot in the <UNK> of <UNK> by a young tv friendly cast crew and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects wakes up in a hospital and finds that his body is <UNK> on him as he sits there feeling like a <UNK> the melting man is played by one alex <UNK> who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film but once he starts <UNK> with rick <UNK> extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of <UNK> before you drain off all the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of grease br br the film has zero exposition and does not <UNK> about with plot points there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial <UNK> machine who <UNK> <UNK> a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care really it's a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out hilarious br br the hero of the film is played by <UNK> <UNK> a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype slightly twisted neurotic and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead or the alien zone that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in <UNK> which is where i suspect this film was made as well the <UNK> cold looking rural <UNK> landscapes are certainly the same and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien <UNK> in without warning which also had a sick sense of humor a tv friendly cast and some pretty outrageous gore i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies as well as the silence of the <UNK> which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan <UNK> is a part of melting man's cast br br essentially as others have pointed out this is a 1950s b movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects the inevitable boobs the movie it probably borrows most of it's ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man's motivations he simply goes on a rampage and the movie's drama comes from wondering if he's going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen rick <UNK> disgusting effects getting the <UNK> share of whatever was spent on this br br sick disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer why can't people have made more movies like these br br 8 10
<START> i have seen the <UNK> movie and think its great its laid back fun about time the british film industry came through with something entertaining its good how the guy who met them at the service station gets mentioned way into the film in the news agents nice touch the acting was convincing i am a biker they reminded me of some good times i have had in the bike scene it was good to see the film director getting in on the acting well done jon at the end a new crop gets mentioned in ireland is this the foundation for a 2nd film hope so keep them coming great film well written realistic characters
<START> this is a great movie i love it more each time i watch most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again as ben stiller tears at the hood <UNK> of the <UNK> or hank <UNK> says good bye to louise <UNK> or geoffrey rush flashes his <UNK> choreography or tom waits <UNK> while he watches the news report or <UNK> <UNK> refuses a kiss from paul <UNK> is a pleasure this is pitch perfect ensemble acting the story develops directly and consistently the action sequences are creative and not too <UNK> all the set ups payoff by the end seriously if you've seen it and it's been a while watch it again and if you haven't then get started you can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time wes <UNK> william h macy the <UNK> scene too much good stuff
<START> absolutely one of the worst movies of all time br br low production values terrible story idea bad script lackluster acting and i can't even come up with an <UNK> suitably <UNK> for how poor joan <UNK> directing is i know that there's a special place in hell for the people who <UNK> this film <UNK> right below the level reserved for child <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br this movie is a <UNK> br br terrible x <UNK> rabbit test br br avoid this at all costs br br it's so bad it isn't even funny how bad it is
<START> when george c scott played the title role in <UNK> you saw him directing tanks with <UNK> of his fist shooting at german dive <UNK> with a revolver and <UNK> profanity at superiors and <UNK> alike the most action we get from gregory peck as macarthur a figure from the same war of <UNK> greater accomplishment is when he <UNK> <UNK> with his finger and raises that famous <UNK> of his br br comparing <UNK> performance with scott's may be unfair yet the fact macarthur was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels as does the fact both films open with the <UNK> addressing <UNK> at west point it's clear to me the filmmakers were looking to <UNK> that oscar winning film of a few years before but while peck looks the part more than scott ever did he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> later career br br to this day there are those who think he was a dangerous <UNK> and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived an opening title crawl tells us it's a typical <UNK> bit of post vietnam <UNK> about those who led america's military very much of its time but what we get here is neither view macarthur as presented here doesn't anger or inspire the way he did in life br br director joseph <UNK> who went on to <UNK> the famous turkey jaws the revenge does a paint by numbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use as when the chinese attack u s forces in korea while the script by hal <UNK> and matthew robbins <UNK> out a macarthur who comes across as good natured to the point of <UNK> a bit too caught up in his public image but never less than decent br br here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the <UNK> there you see him addressing <UNK> in his old soldiers never die speech for a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in <UNK> waiting for the north <UNK> to cross the <UNK> parallel so we can get on with the story while <UNK> footage details <UNK> rise from the <UNK> under his <UNK> rule <UNK> co actors <UNK> <UNK> as his devoted wife you're my finest soldier and nicolas coaster as a loyal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eyes in the direction of their <UNK> <UNK> but garner no interest on their own br br even when he <UNK> with others peck never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with <UNK> <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> suggests <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> a point of personal pride as well as <UNK> concern for macarthur macarthur comes back with the comment just now as i listened to his plan i thought i saw our flag going down <UNK> the real <UNK> would have had something to say about that but the character in the movie just <UNK> his head and <UNK> accepts the insult in the presence of president <UNK> br br the only person in the movie who macarthur seriously <UNK> with is harry s truman who ed <UNK> does a fine job with despite a <UNK> nose that makes him resemble <UNK> sam <UNK> firing of macarthur should be a dramatic high point but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation in which peck plays macarthur as nothing less than a <UNK> <UNK> br br i've never been sold by <UNK> standing at the upper <UNK> of screen stars he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his best known roles but it's unfair to <UNK> him so much here as he gets little help defining macarthur as anything other than a <UNK> bore except for two scenes one where he <UNK> against the surrender of the <UNK> he struck old glory and ran up a <UNK> and another where he has a mini breakdown while awaiting the u s invasion of <UNK> <UNK> against <UNK> <UNK> him at the white house peck really plays peck here not the complex character who inspired the famous <UNK> american <UNK> the real macarthur might have been worthy of such a comparison what you get here is less worthy of shakespeare than shakes the clown
<START> the youthful group in st <UNK> fire who just <UNK> from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university for the most part these kids are irresponsible selfish greedy and stupid yet co writer and director joel <UNK> appears to hold them up as <UNK> for a generation with a now outdated cast of up and <UNK> a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of terms of <UNK> and writing which <UNK> the <UNK> of this circle over us fire is a <UNK> <UNK> one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on 1 2 from
<START> i can't believe currently this movie is rated a 6 9 anyway this movie was probably one of the most touching real indian movies i have ever seen it was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema as for the story i thought it was great it was about shahid <UNK> being set up on an arranged marriage with amrita <UNK> he is kind of a happy go lucky kind of guy while amrita <UNK> is a traditional indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is her cousin doesn't seem to get as much attention as she does so her aunt <UNK> amrita with a passion this <UNK> amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her it was also very touching to see that although <UNK> family wasn't that rich maybe just middle class to lower class while <UNK> family was quite upper class they still treated their family with respect and didn't even ask put them down which really struck a nerve with me this is because i've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow this movie showed that <UNK> family was willing to look at the great values that amrita had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasn't a rich business <UNK> daughter or anything all in all this movie deserved an 8 10 i wish more and more of these kind of movies were made
<START> just imagine the real hitler who was a master of propaganda and speech would have been such a <UNK> moron as <UNK> portrayed him in this film br br nobody would have followed him not even a desperate unemployed guy in the 1920s br br this is just a hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself disguised as true history br br i pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show <UNK> and the producers didn't get anything right with this br br why was hitler able to win so many people a whole county for his ideas if we was such a <UNK> why did people follow him to death by portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable this film is a mixture of old ww2 propaganda and mtv urban <UNK> about one of the most important persons of the last century imagine a film about <UNK> where the director only shows him as a <UNK> for 90 mins br br this film is a disgrace and i wonder how they could talk an actor like <UNK> into this dreck
<START> relative to other columbo movies this can only be rated a 1 awful i seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train crash of a film it was only through morbid fascination that i continued to watch it to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make next br br another reviewer suggested that it was <UNK> only directorial outing because it <UNK> with his acting role in fact i think the real reason lies with the studio bosses who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money it's a wonder they didn't murder him
<START> i would love to have that two hours of my life back it seemed to be several clips from <UNK> animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script don't go if you must see it wait for the video
<START> its about time that gunga din is released on dvd i cannot accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but i never tire of it the lead actors worked so well together victor mclaglen sgt <UNK> cary grant sgt cutter and douglas fairbanks jr sgt <UNK> are an <UNK> team br br i just cannot get over their exploits in india your first glimpse at the <UNK> three is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so called treasure map the three <UNK> are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the <UNK> line an they enter a mostly deserted town or so they think br br they engage in the necessary <UNK> and soon find a few residents in hiding soon after they get attacked by a group of <UNK> and barely make an escape back to base br br later they are sent on another mission which gives sgt cutter a chance to go hunting for the gold with din they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil <UNK> supporters din is sent to <UNK> help and cutter gets captured soon <UNK> and <UNK> arrive with din and they are too captured br br faced with being killed they watch <UNK> as their <UNK> comes to rescue them the evil <UNK> watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs onto the golden <UNK> and blows his <UNK> which then <UNK> the british to the <UNK> in doing this din is shot dead br br the soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them at the end din is <UNK> as he is made an <UNK> <UNK> in the british army
<START> the best modesty blaise movie i have seen so far it's like a good pilot for a tv series i even think it's a little bit cult like with a <UNK> touch of quentin <UNK> magic or something they have caught a great deal of <UNK> character but i admit missing willy <UNK> a bit even if i have read many comics and book by peter <UNK> i'm not disappointed of this film quite the opposite positive surprised of this story about modesty and her childhood i did not put my expectations so high because of the bad movie from 1966 so i may have <UNK> this movie just a little but if you like the comics and other <UNK> about modesty blaise you should definitely see this one can't wait for a follow up
<START> i haven't read through all the comments but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be <UNK> i'm curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just didn't make much sense to me even when i <UNK> them 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in <UNK> also poor little rich girl which was <UNK> next film is <UNK> minutes long and pride of the clan which was his previous feature was <UNK> minutes long so i'm <UNK> to see that i wasn't crazy there must be part of this film missing and that's why the resolution didn't make much sense br br it's hard to review or comment on a movie that you're only able to see half of but i would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the <UNK> of an east coast movie studio of the time it's the earliest film i've personally seen that's based on the movie industry itself the main character is a movie star played by robert <UNK> who was later a <UNK> hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of preston <UNK> films he plays a western actor perhaps vaguely <UNK> on william s hart who <UNK> does resemble somewhat after the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl doris <UNK> and convinces her to come to new jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly after that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have now br br again i'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in film history for the documentary value but in the form we have it doesn't hold up much as a movie and isn't a particularly good example of maurice <UNK> work
<START> i heard many stories about this film being great well i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last month br br i watched it and i have only a few comments about it br br 1 terrible story line 2 terrible acting 3 bad fighting scenes br br i never seen any worse movie in my life so far when the storyline is bad than at least make the fights something more interesting but both are done ridiculously bad br br the only positive thing about this movie in my opinion is <UNK> <UNK> god she looks nice in this movie br br that's about it
<START> some day we'll walk in the <UNK> of a beautiful sun some day when the world is much <UNK> the 5 <UNK> o o h child br br movies about black teenagers usually involve inner city gangs dealing drugs or committing violence to a hip hop soundtrack films about the everyday problems of ordinary inner city teens are hard to find yet there is an <UNK> gem that i would like to recommend our song by jim <UNK> is about three girls in the crown heights section of brooklyn who learn that their high school will be closed for <UNK> <UNK> and must decide on their future direction one that may involve going their separate ways the story is told from the point of view of a 15 year old not from an adult <UNK> about the past as in most coming of age movies avoiding the mandatory street <UNK> and excessive use of f words it delivers an honest and loving portrait of three friends at a <UNK> in their life the girls <UNK> <UNK> washington <UNK> anna simpson and maria melissa <UNK> are in their <UNK> year at the local high school they are active members of the jackie robinson <UNK> a real life <UNK> band whose <UNK> for a labor day parade provide discipline and purpose to their lives br br similar to david gordon <UNK> george washington but less stylized the film showcases non professional black and latino actors with <UNK> washington as the standout while the performances have some amateurish moments i became so involved with the story that i forgot the girls were even acting maria whose father is in jail has learned that she is pregnant by <UNK> a local student she wants to have the baby in spite of the fact that she is only 15 and knows that <UNK> is probably not going to be of much help <UNK> works in an up scale dress shop but dreams about becoming a singer in a very poignant scene in her bedroom she pretends to be talking to her fans then lies down in bed to <UNK> one of her <UNK> she is close to <UNK> and maria at the beginning but <UNK> off to make friends outside of the neighborhood none of the girls receive much support at home and maria is too afraid to even tell her mother about her baby yet the single <UNK> are not typical movie <UNK> or <UNK> they are warm and loving parents whose time with their children is limited because of the pressure of supporting the family br br <UNK> parents are divorced but she is able to visit her father a <UNK> in a luxury apartment building and talk about music her mother is <UNK> when <UNK> learns that a friend in the neighborhood has committed suicide a somewhat melodramatic plot point in an otherwise realistic film as the summer winds down the girls drift apart and each decides on a different course there are no big dramatic moments however only the sad recognition of the <UNK> of change though we do not have <UNK> on about the <UNK> that may <UNK> them we identify with their hopes and dreams without <UNK> on the negative our song is an emotionally satisfying film about growing up in the projects that refuses to see life in any terms other than possibility
<START> the brain that wouldn't die is one awful piece of film that stinks from the opening credits it's got all the classic signs of being bad <UNK> <UNK> terrible acting low grade sets and lighting the <UNK> goes like this when a doctor and his <UNK> get caught in an accident she gets decapitated and he picks up her head and takes her to his lab where he sets up her head in a pan with some special <UNK> that keeps it alive i'll bet <UNK> <UNK> who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and <UNK> under a table anyway the doctor then tries to find her a new body and hires two <UNK> so she can chose one to have her new body bad all the way through so bad it was torn to pieces on mystery science theater 3000
<START> here on imdb com i read an opinion that grey owl is best character of pierce brosnan ever performed i do not know if he had better nor worse roles i'm not his fan but this one was really exceptional br br the other thing impressive hand of the movie director i give my respect the <UNK> the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really <UNK> i never met such <UNK> it in any movie before br br another thing left in my mind after the film this is the movie closest to the original books and atmosphere in it br br and little bit more i pay my respect to the original grey owl
<START> in the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some <UNK> and a giant chicken too this one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats you know how it is this movie has some kills and its moments but i find it to be on par with the original i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies well that is not true i actually like empire of the ants maybe i just do not care for giant <UNK> all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre i just can't recommend this one
<START> warning possible spoilers not that you should care also sorry for the <UNK> br br starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that's all the more annoying for talking nonsense it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama that's badly but accurately put br br we know space travel is a <UNK> enterprise there's a complicated system with a lot of potential for <UNK> radiation stress related <UNK> etc and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown <UNK> they knew stuff could go wrong in fact stuff had gone wrong it's called learning granted <UNK> 11 wasn't safe by today's standards and there was immense political pressure but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive br br <UNK> mistakes comments i hadn't even to look up br br 1 <UNK> prepared a speech in case something went wrong well duh that's what i would've done it was the <UNK> of a propaganda war after all br br 2 <UNK> gives green light despite the fact that <UNK> 11 will probably blow up this is only <UNK> though yeah that's why they let people and press watch in almost real time br br 3 the capsule <UNK> wouldn't work like it didn't work the time a <UNK> was in it the one that survived it was a test launch and the rocket <UNK> the capsule <UNK> away and landed with a <UNK> there's a video of it you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere br br 4 one interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of florida i can only assume it was meant as a <UNK> 'cause if not i'm just <UNK> how he could get it so wrong br br 5 the technology then was primitive compared to today's standards actually relatively primitive <UNK> and <UNK> is used even today the reason being that it must not crash it's even worse for <UNK> because their computers must be built of <UNK> large <UNK> that aren't that <UNK> to radiation and the craft itself must be <UNK> <UNK> anyway so a complex <UNK> system like the <UNK> wouldn't do what's with the fact that they were using tv screens rather than computer screens it's the same damn technology actually tv <UNK> were and are produced with a significantly higher definition br br 6 if that object wasn't part of the rocket it could be only one thing we see where this is going apart from the fact that the statement is wrong who says it wasn't a rocket part at least an <UNK> <UNK> up that if a thing is flying and you don't know what it is it's by definition an <UNK> flying object br br 7 the voice over as well as some <UNK> make it seem as though the <UNK> radiation foil was actually its <UNK> which would make it thinner than a space suit br br 8 neil <UNK> near death during a practice flight is footage i can appreciate i hadn't seen it before as i said any piece of <UNK> technology can go wrong especially if it's not been tested <UNK> on account of being you know <UNK> br br 9 the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> due to <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> was at no time <UNK> life threatening neither was the fifteen seconds of fuel left which was in fact fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to <UNK> the mission and returning to the command <UNK> br br 10 a <UNK> chain of events usually results in catastrophe i really don't know how to put it any simpler this however is a prime example of the <UNK> used br br 11 there's a short sequence of one of the <UNK> walking and <UNK> around <UNK> like a <UNK> kid followed by the voice over telling us that the reason for this strange behavior can now be revealed turns out he was walking and <UNK> around <UNK> like a <UNK> kid hilarious stuff br br 12 it's mentioned that during re entry all contact was lost this is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it's impossible to <UNK> with contemporary technology again the gravity of this is <UNK> but very <UNK> so br br 13 there was never a <UNK> lost in space itself while the voice over presents this fact as evidence that <UNK> 11 was a pile of crap <UNK> 13 was a near loss but the two real disasters happened during <UNK> and re entry respectively in any case comparing <UNK> to <UNK> rockets is somehow well okay just plain stupid even ignoring that the successful <UNK> missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience br br 14 what the <UNK> up with the <UNK> even in the context of the movie it makes no sense unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes aimed at a specific audience which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history science or <UNK> br br even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure catch phrases like covered up until now <UNK> revealed here for the first time come up but the film doesn't place any blame or offer a lesson or anything which could be expected of a film so emotionally done in the good old tradition of <UNK> there are numerous interview shots and recording <UNK> that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except <UNK> scientist wow so the <UNK> were very nervous before the <UNK> fancy that what does this have to do with the point of the movie again oh yeah which point br br in summary in addition to being either <UNK> or <UNK> inaccurate it's not even good entertainment and believe me i'm a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries this film isn't funny witty quaint it's nothing
<START> what a relief to find out i am not imagining this programme the summary from <UNK> is great i too remember finding it haunting and not particularly family viewing i must have been 10 11 at the time i watched it i think for a girl that age part of attraction was <UNK> very blond hair and his <UNK> sad state the theme was played on a <UNK> i recall although i cannot remember how it went i think the intro showed him playing it or maybe he played a <UNK> in the programme and especially when he was sad maybe i am destined never to know how it ended or to see clip or hear the tune but at least i now know it is not just me
<START> my first fassbinder was a wonderful experience film and alternative cinema small hall with uncomfortable seats public had to wait while <UNK> were changed were perfect match br br there were many cliches used in the film but fassbinder presented them so cleverly that i found them really amusing sound was also brilliant sometimes back being <UNK> than dialogue br br everything seemed to be in right place and i loved the way how after war time was presented real fun br br
<START> jake speed 1986 was an amusing parody of indiana jones and other <UNK> films that were popular during the eighties wayne crawford stars as jake speed an <UNK> who's always battling evil <UNK> wherever he goes with his assistant <UNK> <UNK> dennis christopher they globe <UNK> looking for some action and some decent story lines the duo meet a young woman named margaret karen <UNK> who's sister has been kidnapped by an evil white <UNK> <UNK> john hurt can she find and convince jake and <UNK> to help her rescue her sibling br br a sappy and cheesy film that doesn't pretend to be something that it's not i have to give this one a recommendation that's if you enjoy movies that like to have fun and for those who don't take everything at face value br br recommended
<START> i saw this film at its new <UNK> high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a lot to be desired j c mac was i felt the redeeming feature of this film true action and <UNK> and out of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast and a <UNK> reign on the directing this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in <UNK>
<START> i don't know why some guys from us georgia or even from <UNK> have the courage to express feelings about something they don't understand at all for those who did not watch this movie watch it don't expect too much or don't put some <UNK> just because this is <UNK> watch the movie without prejudice try to understand the whole humor inside people of <UNK> did actually getting married while <UNK> <UNK> bomb their <UNK> <UNK> in all <UNK> are always try to f <UNK> you up in any way they can love is always unexpected pure and colorful and <UNK> are extremely creative for those who claims this is a bad movie i can see only that the <UNK> sh t like meet dave get smart etc are much much worse than a pure frank <UNK> <UNK> love story movie as promise me the comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer i think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside it is simple but true it is brutal but gentle and makes you laugh to dead
<START> a comedy gem lots of laugh out loud moments the shop and pub scenes had me belly laughing <UNK> the characters are <UNK> and the dialogue well observed i know people like this the humour is surprisingly gentle and the film this may sound strange puts me in mind of an ealing comedy it's a quirky little film with lots of detail it certainly takes a number of viewings i've watched it a few times i've been showing all my friends and notice something new each time a bit of dialogue something visual that i hadn't picked up on before i could get really <UNK> and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but i'm not going to because overall this is a great fun feel good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy it is a film which will find it's friends and i hope there are a lot of them out there oh and it has a great soundtrack
<START> as incredible as it may seem <UNK> is an anime and hong kong inspired samurai action flick with a <UNK> message this <UNK> of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist a great acting job done by <UNK> <UNK> a killer turned to <UNK> monk <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> never to kill again but he still takes up the sword to fight what he thinks is a demon invasion br br <UNK> is a film difficult to rate it's visual imagery is stunningly crafted and beautiful but it uses too much <UNK> <UNK> camera and high speed drives <UNK> shots <UNK> colors digital effects etc so the end result is somewhat <UNK> that said the beginning and the ending of the film are nevertheless both elegant and powerful if only the director <UNK> <UNK> would have been wise enough not to <UNK> his bag of tricks br br other problem with <UNK> is the amount of violence for a film with such an anti violent message <UNK> wastes way too much energy and screen time to depict the endless battle scenes also the way the violence is shown is always on the edge of being self indulgent in fact a blood shower against the night sky seems to be one of the films signature images luckily <UNK> is wise enough to show the ugly tragic side of violence as well still it seems that <UNK> is not sure whether he's making a traditional action film or a deeply moral allegory the audience can't be sure of this either until the very end of the film the powerful albeit cynical ending is what saves <UNK> it clearly <UNK> that this film is something more than a mere gore fest
<START> spoilers classic 70's sex trash the swedish gal <UNK> was what made this movie so great she was beautiful but what really got to me was how sexual she was she <UNK> massive <UNK> of sexuality throughout the film her best scenes were when she was er stimulating herself whenever she was on screen i became <UNK> br br also the doctor julia sister of the <UNK> male focus of the film was very interesting visually although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than julia she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes especially the scenes with the <UNK> <UNK> and black <UNK> also grabbed my attention <UNK> you also got to love the major <UNK> scene where the bats stripped her <UNK> i don't know if i've ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time classic stuff
<START> i saw and liked the first two a lot really especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first and it's a story standing alone you don't have to know the first movie i liked that in the free willy movies too br br but the third here is absolutely useless i tried it with a friend of mine because we both liked the first two we decided to stop after a good half an hour the movie is okay there are funny parts in it alright but what for timon and <UNK> were funny creatures in the first two movies what lion king 1 1 2 is for me is a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already plus telling the story from their point of view but what for i'd really like to know you know the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one is really nice but what comes after is mostly unnecessary i guess many people liked timon and <UNK> and so do i really yet for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny no chance most of it wasn't funny at all at least for me btw what was the movie about anyway was it a about timon and <UNK> or b an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie i tend to choose option b and i'm very disappointed about it br br if you like to see stories like the story behind <UNK> you should see <UNK> and <UNK> are dead by tom <UNK> with tim roth and gary <UNK> that's really funny and no try to get more out of hamlet then it has
<START> jane austen would definitely <UNK> of this one br br gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma she is funny without being <UNK> silly yet elegant she puts on a very convincing british accent not being british myself maybe i'm not the best judge but she fooled me she was also excellent in <UNK> doors i sometimes forget she's american br br also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and <UNK> law emma <UNK> sister and mother as the bates women they nearly steal the show and ms law doesn't even have any lines br br highly recommended
<START> i was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic private lessons which portrays the dream of any male teenager br br private lessons ii has nothing to do with the title i mention it's just a regular soft core <UNK> flick that won't make a change in your life there's just one hot sex scene in a <UNK> but that's it i watched this a long time ago but believe me this is just a regular boring soft core flick br br the women are hot but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie my advice is to watch this only if it <UNK> on cable
<START> now this is what i'd call a good horror with occult supernatural undertones this nice low budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene this proves you don't need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie br br the plot revolves around 4 <UNK> in a prison and each of these characters and their motives become gradually more interesting as the movie builds up tension to the finale most of the action we see through the eyes of <UNK> who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates br br i won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen there a few flaws though the fx are not that good but they're used effectively the plot leaves some mysteries open and things get very confusing towards the end but <UNK> <UNK> itself by the time it's over br br i thought his was a very good movie 8 10
<START> there were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life not only in japan but everywhere it shows how <UNK> ones culture can be and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you br br the dancing was just a vehicle for saying do what you love even if its against the norm rather billy elliot like i would say i enjoyed that film as well br br the humour was well timed and the touching moments felt so real you could feel the <UNK> between <UNK> and his wife the <UNK> in the dance hall i loved <UNK> him and that wig and his <UNK> on the dance floor made me simply <UNK> br br the actors all did a wonderful job the story was well written i watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that i missed on the first viewing good entertainment
<START> ira <UNK> broadway smash comes to the screen with hardly any meat on its bones a mystery plot with just a few tricks and twists but nobody worth caring about frustrated writer michael caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his own his <UNK> plan may include murdering the talented kid which has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up in arms the first act in which everyone is introduced is excruciatingly dead with caine doing everything an actor can to keep the pacing up <UNK> cannon is miscast as his wife she's too smart and clever herself to be passed off as a <UNK> and christopher reeve in the middle portion of the film seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer these three characters and irene <UNK> <UNK> neighbor are so <UNK> that what happens after the set up barely even <UNK> until well after the second act has begun sidney <UNK> direction is <UNK> and fuzzy the set design unconvincing and poorly lit and the finale is a total disaster the actors struggle to give the script some substance but with such thin material all we see are their <UNK> efforts 1 2 from
<START> evening is the beautiful story of the flawed love of a mother the movie split in time is magically shot amazingly acted and has a touching script vanessa redgrave plays anne grant lord a woman sun setting out of life lying in her bed her mind remembering and <UNK> she recalls her first mistake claire danes plays the young anne giving a youthful <UNK> to dying bed ridden woman daughters nina toni collette and <UNK> natasha richardson try to <UNK> the real story from the <UNK> <UNK> her first mistake revolves around harris <UNK> patrick wilson the man her best friend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> deeply loved the daughters must come to terms with their mother's past and their <UNK> the cast is glowing in evening the collective acting energy of this movie could have powered the equipment for the production of this entire film i am so glad to see claire danes working again especially in this role she is so young and alive fully living the <UNK> mistakes and <UNK> of young <UNK> first mistake this is a true feat when you realize she is playing a woman dying in bed when her life <UNK> her you can feel her desire to crack and her hopeless hope that she won't some of her facial expressions <UNK> on me a little but over all her performance was so <UNK> i was left with that only as a side note toni collette continues to prove that you can be a powerful actress without being a super model she plays the black sheep of the family a little lost nina finds a great deal of strength in her mother's mistake collette <UNK> avoids creating a cruel character who <UNK> in the mistakes of her mother instead choosing the <UNK> path of learning from her mother's mistakes there is a great deal of <UNK> between nina and her sister <UNK> their fights remind me of ones i have with my sister all the time <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> youthful best friend is wonderful her character is stuck between her heart and her status in society even when she is crying and her heart is breaking she is incredibly regal and charming i can't wait to see her act in something else in the future vanessa <UNK> performance is very hard for me to describe her talent at making her mental status ambiguous without being <UNK> or even especially tragic is why it is so powerful the audience does not know if she is making up the story because she is <UNK> away or if these events truly happened physically and emotionally speaking redgrave is acting in a box not much physical space and limited emotional range might have been a <UNK> to a lesser actress but she makes the limitations work for her i was constantly amazed the movie is definitely woman focused but the men in the movie are not just <UNK> patrick wilson is mesmerizing as harris it is no wonder that everyone in the movie is in love with him i sure was buddy <UNK> is <UNK> brother <UNK> out of control hugh <UNK> <UNK> buddy out of control without sending his acting down the drain <UNK> close has my favorite scene in the movie it reminded me of the famous scene from <UNK> ball it is terrible and jaw dropping grief i was utterly stunned the one acting disappointment was natasha richardson while her fight scenes were memorable most of her acting <UNK> of melodrama it would have suited her to take an acting bath before we had to breathe her stink it's a good thing she wasn't in charge of the visuals the visuals of the movie are <UNK> cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> couldn't make a film <UNK> in color light so perfectly matched to mood and emotion the visual concepts of the flash back sequences are powerful and <UNK> there were many scenes that could have been stopped <UNK> <UNK> and sold as art i admit it i cried evening is a powerful movie evening is <UNK> a chick flick but a really great chick flick if you want to impress a woman with a movie choice pick evening
<START> another fine effort by america's most underrated filmmaker his knowledge on the subject of racism is <UNK> and <UNK> me on more than one level <UNK> that lee is really just a <UNK> little racist a <UNK> dwarf who <UNK> exploits hollywood's <UNK> action system to make movies of inferior quality is utter nonsense mere right wing propaganda the very notion that lee would resort to <UNK> the current climate of political correctness in america in order to produce hate filled anti white movies is simply false and <UNK> br br some of lee's <UNK> even go so far as to suggest that <UNK> <UNK> african americans while putting down other races obviously another <UNK> <UNK> by people who are against peaceful co existence between different races in america and elsewhere br br my favourite scene in the movie is a lengthy dialogue early on between the rich black <UNK> and the others in the bus the views presented by that man are simply wrong all across the board 100 untrue he lacks education unlike the brilliantly informed guys who quite deservedly throw him off the bus br br terrific performances and an intelligent script make for a viewing experience that has been rarely <UNK> by any political movies made since br br i also want to point out the <UNK> lies that the million man march had only 80 000 people taking part in it br br and now all you have to do is take the <UNK> of all the words written in capital letters br br so what message does lee send here if someone doesn't agree with your political views you simply apply violence and throw him off the bus i thought the movie said get on the bus br br apparently mr lee is for bus <UNK> after all i e is no different than those <UNK> <UNK> before him the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the <UNK> <UNK> line of thinking so much for <UNK> the slaves br br the end credits this movie was entirely <UNK> by black people and distributed and <UNK> by a major hollywood studio run by jews and whites whom <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the good earth is not a great film by any means it is way to ordinary maybe it was different in the 1930's but who would want to see the life of a farmer it is not very interesting to me yes luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act in short wang lung muni a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death <UNK> the film does a complete <UNK> going from one generation to the next also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis
<START> lost is an extremely well made tv series about some people that are lost on an island there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is one minute its him then he does something so he's coolest then <UNK> about to do something so <UNK> the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like <UNK> so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait suspense action romance humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better i have a review on that too that you could check it out i would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable you never know what will happen next
<START> this is such a fantastic movie a western about a self concerned man jimmy stewart going up to the <UNK> for gold on the way he gets <UNK> by a local sheriff in <UNK> john mcintire giving a wonderfully evil performance whom he <UNK> back mcintire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town which is unfortunately the only way back to the states the main <UNK> of the story is about the peaceful <UNK> town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from <UNK> town ruth roman for instance who has come with stewart and his two companions jay c <UNK> and walter <UNK> who plays stewart's best friend builds a saloon a hollywood front for a <UNK> and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang out place out of business she <UNK> the way for mcintire and his <UNK> to come up too in 1953 jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre the naked <UNK> the far country is just the <UNK> bit less and it contains 99 9 of what made that film so special without of course feeling like a cheap copy like the naked <UNK> the far country boasts beautiful on location cinematography the landscape is gorgeous stewart gives one of his best performances nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 rear window i suppose it could be considered cliche as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end still stewart plays it so damn well he makes this character very human and the supporting performances are universally fantastic in addition to those i've mentioned the adorable french actress <UNK> <UNK> is very good and i ought to single out walter <UNK> as well he seems to have <UNK> in playing best friends his relationship with stewart is very touching since he is at first the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man the screenplay is very well written and <UNK> direction is impeccable a masterpiece 10 10
<START> william hurt <UNK> diving scientist us agents running the investigation abroad the sick <UNK> man kicking butt after falling 20 feet on his back and running away sniper missing and not killing hurt just <UNK> him but the second kill shot is dead on waste of time to compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing <UNK> on their hands except for the evil agent and hurt decides to kill him by giving him the virus <UNK> what btw when did imdb require 10 lines of text i'm just <UNK> here doesn't this just <UNK> the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines
<START> i hope whoever <UNK> these losers on their accents was fired the only high points are a few of the supporting characters 3 of 5 of my favourites were killed off by the end of the season and one of them was a cat to put that into perspective br br the whole storyline is centered around sex and nothing else sex with vampires gay sex with gay vampires gay sex with straight vampires sex to score vampire blood sex after drinking vampire blood sex in front of vampires vampire sex non vampire sex sex because we're scared of vampires sex because we're mad at vampires sex because we just became a vampire etc br br nothing against sex it would just be nice if it were a little more subtle with being <UNK> into the storyline perhaps have a storyline and then <UNK> some sex into it but they didn't even bother to do that and anna <UNK> is a <UNK> gap tooth bitch either she sucks or her character sucks i can't figure out which br br another part of the storyline that i find highly implausible is why 150 year old vampire bill who seems to have his things together would be interested in someone like <UNK> she's constantly flying off the handle at him for things he can't control he leaves for two days and she already decides that he's not coming back and suddenly has feelings for dog man give me a break she's supposed to be a 25 year old woman not a 14 year old girl people close to her are dying all over and she's got the <UNK> smile on her face because she just gave away her v card to some dude because she can't read his mind as the main character of the story i would've hoped the show would do a little more to make her understandable and someone to <UNK> your interest in not someone you keep secretly hoping gets killed off or put into a coma i can't find anything about her character that i like and even the fact that she can read minds is <UNK> uninspiring and not the least bit interesting br br i will not be wasting my time with watching season 2 come june
<START> you loose 100 iq points just for <UNK> in this show has to be awful i refuse to tune in from just what i've seen in commercials where did they dig this guy up at anyway also what do they intend to do next season the secret is out everyone already knows the set up are they going to look for people who has been living under a rock to star in next season where are they going to dig up more stupid women no wonder america is a big joke to <UNK> look what you are watching
<START> i wasted 5 75 to see this crappy movie so i just want to know a few things br br what was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie the disease had nothing to do with being split in half br br what was the point of dragging karen into the shed she already totally infected her room they could have just locked her in there where she would have been <UNK> br br why would the <UNK> be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative the <UNK> lady to take him to the hospital br br why didn't any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad are they all really that lazy br br even if paul was threatened by the guy w the shotgun for <UNK> on his wife paul could have just sent jeff or bert back to the house to ask for help the girl he loves is <UNK> br br what was the point of the box br br why did jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldn't he have just gone back home br br if the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit why did they throw paul halfway into the river it wasn't even necessary for the plot because the water was already <UNK> br br who makes <UNK> out of river water that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it why couldn't the two kids have just use the tap water it was <UNK> too so the stupid ending would still work
<START> since the title is in english and imdb lists this show's primary language as english i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing 2000 as presented in the <UNK> released dvd set my actual review for the whole series is under <UNK> entry of shin <UNK> <UNK> gundam w 1995 br br very little is changed in respect to plot script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in <UNK> can stick to japanese all they want but for a more realistic experience i recommend the english track since all the characters except <UNK> <UNK> are not japanese most of them are <UNK> in fact with a couple of non japanese <UNK> for one thing the characters' personalities come across more directly than in the japanese version the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give or take performances but a very well cast group of actors br br wing <UNK> pilot <UNK> <UNK> is a highly trained soldier who <UNK> his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity voiced by mark <UNK> who's deadpan delivery can be criticized as bad acting but it matches <UNK> personality very well br br <UNK> <UNK> duo <UNK> ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the <UNK> the value of life and friends he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show masterfully played by scott <UNK> he may sound a little too old for his age but <UNK> english voice easily out ranks his <UNK> <UNK> japanese one br br <UNK> the pilot of <UNK> is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him he only knows how to kill not to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gives a somber but realistic performance as <UNK> barton br br <UNK> <UNK> winner is voiced by brad <UNK> who has no trouble <UNK> out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand a huge plus point is that <UNK> no longer sounds like a girl and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version but a <UNK> <UNK> typical 15 year old guy br br the <UNK> but determined <UNK> chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over the top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of <UNK> and <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> sounds older in english voiced by lisa ann <UNK> this might not sit well with her youthful <UNK> early in the series but as her character <UNK> later into the story her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development br br <UNK> <UNK> would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version both voices bring out different sides to the same character his japanese voice is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> respect keeping in line with his high <UNK> status and charismatic nature his english voice by brian <UNK> is more subdued sounding more <UNK> and snake like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nature regarding his hidden <UNK> and <UNK> beliefs in his ideals br br the members of oz are a mixed bag really <UNK> <UNK> voiced by david <UNK> is given a more realistic and down to earth performance compared to his larger than life japanese style of speaking however lady <UNK> does not convey her split personality as <UNK> as in the japanese version and <UNK> <UNK> just sounds bored most of the time the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either br br i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds the <UNK> <UNK> voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents the members of the <UNK> foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of <UNK> br br despite <UNK> acting from the side characters the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over the top and more realistic rendition of gundam <UNK> script very faithful to the original japanese script keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics war and human nature sadly it also <UNK> the flaws of the original japanese script
<START> the movie is far more sophisticated and intelligent is its exploration of sexual tension than such american attempts as 9 and a half weeks the courtroom scene itself with the couple <UNK> in the cage while the heroine <UNK> for their <UNK> is amazing i have not seen this movie in 20 years but it made <UNK> pictures in my mind it is rich in <UNK> and successful in creating a world where sex is the engine for all activity and at its bottom is the <UNK> angst that lives in us all the plot is european and it <UNK> a bit but so does life especially when you are 17 and have a constant hard on
<START> <UNK> by michael jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family br br before the real story of the movie starts we get a performance of the bad tour man in the mirror and it kicks off a great movie after that we get a kind of a <UNK> of michael <UNK> as it was until <UNK> came out in 1988 after a few music videos also speed demon leave me alone etc the story starts br br the plot is basically that michael and his 3 friends who are kids are being chased by the bad guy of the story mr big because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world <UNK> on drugs during the chase we see fantastic segments fx michaels video for smooth criminal which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences etc but then one of the kids get kidnapped by mr big and michael will <UNK> to save her before she gets a drug addict br br during the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards but also impressive today for instance see michael turning in to a robot spaceship in order to protect his friends it's so cool br br the movie ends with a performance of come together later published in michaels double album of history and you leave the movie with a magic feeling amazing br br i recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the tv and now some parents might stand up and say but michael jackson is an alleged child <UNK> yeah he is indeed but come on we all know it isn't true wait and see
<START> i just want to add my two cents worth and forgive me if i am repeating something that has already been posted but i feel it is worth reminding people of the <UNK> genius of damon <UNK> without the wonderfully street hilarious <UNK> of damon <UNK> this film would never have been made nor most of the other great classics that deal with <UNK> the like from before 1960 damon <UNK> worked as a newspaper man and he was from <UNK> but he sure did get the street scene of the east coast if you are not a dedicated fan of old hollywood comedies i would recommend a few other flicks from damon <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> kid and little miss <UNK> both feature bob hope who aside from his politics has always been a funny man as a west coast liberal i find his politics fairly funny too damon <UNK> lives
<START> such a long journey is a well crafted film a good shoot and a showcase for some good performances however the story is such a <UNK> of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of jack of all plots and master of none also western audiences will likely find the <UNK> of the rather obscure <UNK> culture a little much to get their arms around in 1 7 hours recommended for those with an interest in india
<START> the performances were superb the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living <UNK> i was impressed with the accuracy of <UNK> and attention to detail br br i wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge do not expect as some rather silly people do any of the characters to have the <UNK> accent as we know it it was at that time a country during <UNK> br br ok the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film <UNK> jordan said in the extra feature on the dvd that he wanted his movie to <UNK> an <UNK> and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here br br see it and you will not be sorry
<START> this is such a great film never mind the low rating here i really have no idea where that came from they must be discussing a different film then because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure br br it's story was so original and charming i really can't think of anything bad to say about it maybe it has to be <UNK> type of <UNK> but i saw this with my sister and my mother and we all were taken by it br br the acting was also very good and that is hard to do in a film like this but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic br br i've always been very fond of <UNK> scott and found his new <UNK> role very interesting it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy but i absolutely had no problem with that this time even more so i <UNK> him br br everyone who loves a good thriller drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film no question about that anyone wanting to see a film with 80 bloodshed should go rent something else though but i guess the title already kind of gives that away this is a love story not saw 3 br br i give this film 4 out of five stars good job br br <UNK> enjoy
<START> this <UNK> of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking jared <UNK> gives an adequate performance of a very poorly created character in an ill <UNK> movie thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie the film's main thrust is how a boy's temporary <UNK> into the canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother's <UNK> affair unfortunately it turns into a bizarre <UNK> of random survival events including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isn't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie and what a nightmare it is furthermore despite the <UNK> of some reviewers of the family <UNK> of the film there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently <UNK> br br all in all a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to much less innocent kids
<START> <UNK> telling of the american revolution br br when farmer <UNK> <UNK> al pacino and his son arrive in new york harbor they are immediately <UNK> by street <UNK> annie <UNK> annie <UNK> to contribute to the war effort br br after getting chopped down by bits of chain link fired from british <UNK> tom and his son are promptly <UNK> by <UNK> army <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kinski for <UNK> standing their <UNK> following this <UNK> moment a series of <UNK> chapters take place including <UNK> participation in a <UNK> in which he must carry a model of poor old <UNK> washington stuffed in <UNK> while running from a <UNK> <UNK> wielding english captain <UNK> <UNK> and having a <UNK> with a group of <UNK> indians as they plan on the best way to sneak back into the fighting so al and his <UNK> kid can kick the crap out of british officer donald <UNK> butt br br director hugh hudson presents a unique style of film making and the atmosphere is as thick as the proverbial london fog but the <UNK> painting of the <UNK> as evil monsters once again reveals hollywood's <UNK> hatred of the british br br steven <UNK> appears as an <UNK> american soldier
<START> this movie down shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd <UNK> <UNK> all the way to the sappy b movie finish line the con at the beginning is easily the best and <UNK> part of the movie that is worth seeing the scene with harlow in the <UNK> occurs so fast you may miss it definitely not worth all the <UNK> provided by robert <UNK> in his tcm intro to this bad to mediocre confusion there is no real conflict and all of the characters in this supposed <UNK> society turn out to be saints especially the unbelievable character al i wonder if he's got a job for me in <UNK>
<START> 'a smile like <UNK> is a pathetic comedy that actually makes no sense i don't mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot is based on one thing a <UNK> desperate and expensive <UNK> attempts to <UNK> children people who tried that hard must've forgotten of the option of the <UNK> to which this movie is not kind to br br lauren holly plays jennifer robertson a complete <UNK> to anything offered by the women's <UNK> movement <UNK> almost no sense of independence she is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with <UNK> nothing else on her mind but to have kids like a dumb 50's romance comedy greg kinnear is her <UNK> husband who likewise displays no personality no independence and from us no interest br br they are the two most boring and often annoying characters and they hardly make for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many <UNK> which should <UNK> from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant except they really don't do anything except go to a <UNK> clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the <UNK> of their own except for that in <UNK> <UNK> number the plot hardly allows for any <UNK> because well the couple don't do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation they just go to this clinic so what br br the subplots are meant to test the <UNK> of the couple a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on <UNK> children together jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend played by joan <UNK> and they are in the business of developing <UNK> christopher macdonald plays the <UNK> <UNK> and jennifer is the promising <UNK> of a pretty price for her and her friend's product the subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested although joan <UNK> is pretty funny in the <UNK> scene br br danny <UNK> is an architect who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills by taking on a job in seattle where his boss is the crass <UNK> also another hopeless helpless female character who tries to influence danny as dumb as he is to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons i don't care to give away jill <UNK> is good in the role but her character is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for danny it is stupid and once again hardly interesting br br the overall movie itself is utterly boring and hardly funny at all save the <UNK> scene and the <UNK> flight the plot offers nothing that is really attention grabbing even if the story was entirely about two people trying to <UNK> the writers could've figured out several hilarious <UNK> to develop out of that second the main characters are completely boring they are complete <UNK> of dumb 1950s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband so even without <UNK> present in the plot the characters themselves offer nothing interesting let alone funny br br joan <UNK> should've been in the lead and someone else should've taken <UNK> part <UNK> would've made even a lousy story outrageously funny as she sometimes does in her co starring role here this is definitely one to pass up
<START> this has got to be one of my very favorite twilight zone episodes primarily for the portrayal of two lonely souls in a post apocalyptic environment br br the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> laden streets are eerie in that particular way the twilight zone does best br br while the <UNK> can be a bit heavy handed by today's drama standards it is an excellent one using the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience as well as <UNK> in a way that is timeless the entire drama rests solely on the shoulders of mr bronson and ms <UNK> who do not disappoint may they both rest in peace br br a true classic
<START> spoiler this is a great film about a <UNK> he goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner he learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds if you love birds like my wife does this film is for you this film also has some sad parts that make the tears run in the end it all works out for paulie and his russian friend rent this for the whole family everyone will enjoy this
<START> even though there's a <UNK> of over <UNK> films to choose from this <UNK> is often named as the best jess franco film heck even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts <UNK> among his personal favorites so maybe it's me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie the opening is great though and shows <UNK> <UNK> performing an <UNK> act on stage it's all downhill from here unfortunately <UNK> character is a <UNK> who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of <UNK> franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score this could have been his greatest film indeed if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story it's supposed to be psychedelic but i'd say <UNK> is a better term to describe what's shown here half of the time you don't have a clue what's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages this most certainly isn't <UNK> best film according to me i wouldn't even recommend it to die hard exploitation fans if you're looking for more superior jess franco film try to get your hands on <UNK> <UNK> 'the awful dr <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i have a nice collection on movies going and this one was added to it number <UNK> to be exact br br the title had me going at first splatter university i thought this would be a great horror movie was i ever wrong don't get me wrong this is not the worst movie i have ever seen but it could have been a lot better i love all movies but this one was one that was more of a laugh then a scare br br poor audio quality poor acting and poor shot <UNK> are some of the areas that could have been improved 3 out of 10 stars br br movie is ideal for a good laugh if your looking for one of those movies to make fun of then this is one
<START> that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was <UNK> at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days br br first of all there is such a thing as the art of cinematography just picking up a <UNK> camera and pointing it at <UNK> has a line does not make for a real movie br br i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn't pick up someone's camcorder br br second indie films are supposed to be about real people there's nothing real in this film none of the characters come across as being even remotely human br br what they come across as being is <UNK> of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how cool and edgy he is br br sorry but this is not good writing or good directing br br what is left is a <UNK> of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance hard to believe this was one of the best films <UNK> br br in any case it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand
<START> i like many horror fans have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years here at last is an original horror genre movie that <UNK> all the right boxes br br you want a hot lead actress you want vampires you want cool weapons you want cool vehicles and you want blood lots of it by the bucket load you got it br br with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie <UNK> this really is fantastic stuff br br despite it's low budget by <UNK> to use 35 <UNK> stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix director james <UNK> has created something that feels much bigger br br a must for old school horror fans
<START> it takes a little while to get used to nick <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> before we can easily accept him as a famous <UNK> playwright once you get past the bar it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good br br nolte an american moves to germany marries a famous actress and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out he's visited by a <UNK> american john goodman who <UNK> him to accept a post as an anti <UNK> radio <UNK> for the nazis nolte has no politics but thinks it's a challenge to write a role that's almost impossible and then play it himself another american secret agent will <UNK> <UNK> radio scripts <UNK> a <UNK> here a <UNK> there that will serve as a code for the <UNK> of intelligence to the allies there's a catch though nobody will know about <UNK> real role as an american agent except goodman <UNK> and <UNK> himself if he's ever <UNK> he'll be refused recognition by the americans br br nolte <UNK> ahead and his vicious <UNK> are wildly popular in germany his <UNK> wife <UNK> lee knows nothing of what's going on nor does she care nolte and lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as a nation of two the war ends and the trouble begins he's captured by americans who are bitter because of his betrayal they beat him and leave him in the mud he's rescued by goodman his fairy <UNK> who sends him to an anonymous existence in <UNK> village and sends him a little cash now and then br br by 1960 he manages to <UNK> a friendship with his neighbor the painter alan arkin who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret <UNK> but his location and his identity somehow <UNK> out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient <UNK> <UNK> led by a dentist and a priest his house front and <UNK> are painted with <UNK> and <UNK> he's beaten senseless by an ex <UNK> but miraculously his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient <UNK> another catch it turns out later that it's not his wife but rather her younger sister who has loved him since <UNK> br br the ending has him <UNK> his <UNK> in an israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity it's not a happy ending br br nolte can talk with but not see the <UNK> of the cell above his in jail it's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seems pleasant enough he <UNK> nolte that it's a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours it's important to relax you must learn to relax nolte laughs out loud and shouts that's how i got here the film is filled with such <UNK> at one point in their relaxed conversations arkin tells him that in spite of everything i still think people are good at heart i don't know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasn't that's the sort of thing that might have <UNK> it for a younger audience of theater goers who may never have heard of anne frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary br br the fact is that it's a movie for adults and patient adults at that the story moves slowly there's very little violence no car chases no shootings and people don't seem subject to manic speech pressure a lot of it will probably slip past viewers who don't open themselves to its deliberate approach nolte refers to the war time relationship between him and his wife as a nation of two this is a pretty <UNK> phrase no doubt anyone could come up with a <UNK> definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional <UNK> br br it's a story of a man who loses everything his ability to write his identity his wife twice his sole friend his country his self respect at one point he stops walking along a crowded new york street and simply stands there until after dark when he is moved along by a curious cop the reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go what <UNK> is describing is far more than depression i don't mean to sound condescending but it's the sort of feeling that's hard to understand in your youth <UNK> might like to think they know what's holding nolte in that one spot but it really requires maturity and the <UNK> sense of <UNK> that only maturity can bring br br remember robert <UNK> line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in well no place will take nolte in
<START> the third muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright yet <UNK> lights of broadway filled with typically <UNK> optimism of course their first attempt fails and <UNK> leader of the group and author of the show blows his top so the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them <UNK> himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner the old man then has a line in particularly <UNK> non <UNK> we get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars art <UNK> as a producer james <UNK> as an <UNK> dog owner <UNK> coleman as a confidence <UNK> elliott <UNK> who was also in the muppet movie 1979 gregory hines <UNK> minnelli as herself  having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by <UNK> sporting fake <UNK> as an ostensibly celebrated <UNK> in a <UNK> to attract publicity to the <UNK> show brooke <UNK> and even director john <UNK> in possibly the film's funniest scene as a broadway producer before whom <UNK> appears acting <UNK> and <UNK> and hilariously <UNK> shades and an <UNK> wig the other muppets more or less go through their typical <UNK> with <UNK> less space given to <UNK> this time around while miss <UNK> is something of an acquired taste with me the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be <UNK> romance with the waitress  and especially her violent reaction to this  are undeniably funny what disappoints however is the climactic show itself after a fairly redundant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets <UNK> and eventually picks up advertising on madison <UNK> which rather than the expected <UNK> routines <UNK> nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of <UNK> and his eternal flame miss <UNK>
<START> can <UNK> imagine a better movie than this br br hey before you all go chick flick on me i am a very large strong <UNK> macho man who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last 20 years br br the acting was superb and the story was marvelous this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul the acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast br br i have known for a good while that <UNK> <UNK> along with holly hunter joan <UNK> dame edith evans sissy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film and of course <UNK> <UNK> also in this film in my view may in fact <UNK> them all in the <UNK> <UNK> of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years at any rate this was an amazing cast this film was like a book that you cannot lay down and when you have reached the last page wish for more still more i cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the imdb only rates a 3 9 br br that rating here is utterly amazing to me or perhaps not perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad it makes me ever so sad that films like american beauty leaving las vegas sexy beast and fight club ratings <UNK> off the <UNK> in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an r rating r that is for rubbish hey o k i realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences but it is a sad commentary when this lovely powerful extraordinarily directed acted and written film seems to be over looked br br it obviously was at the academy awards as well how sad and how predictable my <UNK> is that if you want to see a powerful happy sad beautiful story watch preferably own this film
<START> i was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of <UNK> last night full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause i didn't speak to anyone who disliked <UNK> although two teenagers sitting next to me <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> for most of the film they were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves br br <UNK> is a quickly paced murder mystery a young female <UNK> student is <UNK> <UNK> by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose plenty of <UNK> ensue as she partners up with a traveling <UNK> and falls in love with a <UNK> and charming young <UNK> br br <UNK> isn't a bad addition to the woody allen filmography it isn't his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp i'd say it fits quite <UNK> into being an average woody allen film right in the middle of the pack if you're a woody allen fan you'll probably enjoy yourself if you're indifferent to his work then <UNK> might be enough to get you interested in seeing more i don't think that anyone who <UNK> his style of film making and acting are going to change their mind woody plays the same kind of neurotic character we've grown so <UNK> to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film while potentially <UNK> for some who might find themselves wishing he'd hurry up and just spit out the words woody allen fans know what to expect br br very good performances all around in my opinion although i found myself missing ian <UNK> who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough hugh jackman is great as the charming <UNK> and i think woody allen has found a new regular star to work with in scarlett johansson i think that with <UNK> <UNK> this is their second pairing and she's just magic with the material that woody gives her could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship i'm glad i saw the movie and definitely recommend it more sophisticated comedy than movies like <UNK> movie <UNK> so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former <UNK> probably isn't for you if on the other hand you like a touch of class sophistication and fun <UNK> is for you probably not the woody allen film i'd introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try
<START> i guess this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of lord of the rings well so i was and so i really love this movie especially i like all those flawless <UNK> from lotr being so perfectly and <UNK> <UNK> most brilliantly is the counterpart of <UNK> the brave and wise and completely <UNK> know it all wizard <UNK> the <UNK> and brain dead <UNK> <UNK> counterpart <UNK> from east germany of course is wearing a simply bucket with eye holes as a helmet <UNK> alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword <UNK> the legend with <UNK> tape and <UNK> the counterpart of <UNK> indeed has some strong resemblance with brad <UNK> and don't forget <UNK> and <UNK> huh huh
<START> this one is a real bomb we are supposed to believe that <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the tom <UNK> of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate poor <UNK> can't go anywhere but is surrounded by politicians and their <UNK> <UNK> wives and supported only by kindly uncle harry <UNK> she joins her two <UNK> on a blind date and gary cooper happens to show up some shots of <UNK> might have <UNK> things a la <UNK> but no such luck with this one gary later breaks in to a <UNK> dinner at which <UNK> is <UNK> and though invited to sit down and join the group reads them a lecture on their <UNK> where did this <UNK> <UNK> sudden <UNK> come from the most excruciating scene in the film is a phantom party that gary holds in his unfinished house for his absent wife <UNK> will it never end one to avoid
<START> <UNK> should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the <UNK> <UNK> i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the <UNK> <UNK> it is a very entertaining <UNK> which is set in brazil the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the <UNK> takes place is beautiful <UNK> contains a lot of history of that time period i wish <UNK> would <UNK> it again even if it was a 2 in the morning i would highly recommend watching <UNK> if it is ever shown again on <UNK> i've e <UNK> <UNK> a million times already to show the <UNK> again but my <UNK> have fallen on deaf ears the only <UNK> statement about <UNK> is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not watch <UNK> overall <UNK> merits a 10 out of 10
<START> watching it lives by night makes you wonder just who in the world <UNK> this crap a <UNK> couple go <UNK> on their honeymoon get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his <UNK> attacking various people and where exactly are they they're in the desert then they're <UNK> then they're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby the town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal <UNK> against whiny doctor boy the <UNK> hospital is run by a really <UNK> guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like mary tyler moore or marilyn <UNK> there's no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger special effects and makeup guru stan winston did the effects for this movie i guess you have to start somewhere
<START> this afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw neil <UNK> stardust and all i can say is wow br br it is rare that i am completely taken <UNK> by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all neil <UNK> fault br br sure i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart <UNK> smoothly and made the characters completely believable br br i could go on for days about the spectacular acting charlie cox is perfect as <UNK> claire <UNK> is brilliant as <UNK> and robert <UNK> <UNK> almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate <UNK> shakespeare br br the pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be laugh our loud funny intelligent enough to make the first shrek look like an 80's sitcom and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie br br special effects were near perfect true this was no lotr or star wars sf <UNK> but where they were use they were exactly what was called for not too much to distract you from the movie itself and <UNK> into the story perfectly br br then there is the story what can i say how often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula <UNK> that doesn't just come off as another cheap princess bride <UNK> it manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time br br any one of those things would have made this a good movie all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well once again neil <UNK> has done it he has driven another <UNK> into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that i would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it i didn't want it to end i wanted to be sucked through a <UNK> to the land of <UNK> and get to meet <UNK> and <UNK> in person to travel it's fields and <UNK> <UNK> through it's <UNK> and meet it's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever it is a feeling that i have noticed whenever i have read anything by <UNK> the <UNK> american gods <UNK> all left me with a deep sense of sadness when i finished reading them because it was over i could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one i am forced to live in and watching stardust was no different br br in the end i'm sure that <UNK> writing and this movie won't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when i say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie it is easily one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen and i can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it
<START> this is a nice piece of work very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout its main <UNK> is that it seems like it was made for tv full screen and though there were several sex scenes there was absolutely no nudity but boy did it come close strange too since netflix shows that it was rated r br br nonetheless very <UNK> and i wish alicia <UNK> made more movies like this br br one netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series but i have been unable to find out what series that is i'd like to find out though because this movie was that good br br walt d in <UNK> 8 23 2005
<START> in a way this is the disaster fellini has been working towards all his life the line between absurd masterpiece and free association <UNK> is very small and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings that said <UNK> left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by <UNK> br br <UNK> died too just an old guy with a big <UNK> and a long tongue and no guts at all to say that he lived well is true to say i could spit on his grave without feeling is also true the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find that is why the human race stands where it does today we have <UNK> the clever and lasting <UNK> all hollow inside like the <UNK> <UNK> we foster upon our poor children br br as far as i could make it out this is the position fellini takes regarding his subject granted with more empathy but disgusted nonetheless br br <UNK> environment is made from <UNK> and incestuous behavior themes fellini dealt with more <UNK> in <UNK> the succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn just without the <UNK> and donald sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction br br yet there might just be a point in portraying <UNK> as an <UNK> fool and i challenge anybody to <UNK> this point without being obvious fellini couldn't more than ever he seems here like a dirty old man a <UNK> for sure but one whose <UNK> satisfy himself more than anybody else i find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film it was a story not worth telling
<START> drew <UNK> ben affleck is determined not to be lonely this christmas not only is drew a millionaire but also obnoxious and guilty of being very <UNK> drew goes back to the home he grew up in and offers the family living there the <UNK> 250 000 to be his family through the christmas season tom <UNK> james gandolfini is reluctant but is greedy enough to take <UNK> offer christine <UNK> catherine o'hara has little to say in the matter but learns to like having drew around not exactly the same sentiment with daughter alicia christina <UNK> but that too has room for change <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> jennifer <UNK> tracks down drew and wants her folks to meet his family genuine fun is in store as a happy <UNK> becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare other members of the cast josh <UNK> bill macy david <UNK> and stephanie <UNK> affleck is comedic albeit strange
<START> the cure uses voice over to create an intense mood although the <UNK> accounts for all of the film's lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story the use of multiple film <UNK> add a lot of <UNK> to the story the choice of combining b w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time the ending will make you jump despite being able to <UNK> the result i was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense the close ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a <UNK> eye the piece is quite short but <UNK> a lot the tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do worth watching more than once
<START> when viewing a movie as silly as <UNK> rod ' one must sit back relax and alter one's intellectual capacity to a like state  which is in this case a state <UNK> enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy with a brief runtime of <UNK> minutes this film was long past drawn out and buried itself beneath a <UNK> of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and weren't even funny in the first place <UNK> <UNK> base material is as superficial and irrelevant as <UNK> cult hit <UNK> dynamite ' though it's much more contrived and comes without any of the laughter in fact the movie's blatant desperation to be compared to <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and offensive and left me <UNK> off instead of just being annoyed br br the movie if one were compelled enough to call it such poses a <UNK> story that puts self <UNK> <UNK> rod <UNK> before us with the <UNK> intention of jumping fifteen <UNK> one more than his idol <UNK> <UNK> jumped so we're told by rod and raising 50 000 dollars for his <UNK> impending life saving heart operation all so that he can fight his <UNK> once <UNK> and gain his <UNK> because in order to gain one's respect one must first fight them huh whatever each character is no more interesting than <UNK> stick on mustache and from the film's opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion each scene played like a nonsensical and terribly unfunny snl skit  which with the addition of an extra 85 minutes is essentially what <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to be br br the film's star andy <UNK> contributed an effort to the screen that <UNK> <UNK> every last <UNK> drop of his comedic <UNK> unfortunately  rather realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five year old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the <UNK> crude <UNK> and pee pee gags and if that's disappointing pull a chair hide your face in your hands and <UNK> yourself for the real blow he is the film's humor to rescue them of their <UNK> i'll willingly <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> co <UNK> roles and leave the second third of the lonely island team director <UNK> <UNK> to his non existent talent as a <UNK> or a comedian basically every thing one could possibly do to further <UNK> a crash course comedy is perfectly portrayed here and done so <UNK> as though the film would be funnier that way trick yourself into believing that there's even a single laugh in this heap or treat yourself to another movie  any other movie
<START> this is one of the best reunion <UNK> ever with adam west and burt ward <UNK> themselves and having fun while doing it it's amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail particularly <UNK> the feel of the 1960's era the <UNK> set wayne <UNK> the costumes and the actors selected to play the younger versions of west ward burgess meredith <UNK> romero and frank <UNK> this 90 minutes is well worth your time and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960's batman television series i note that clips from batman were from the movie and not the series itself probably because of legal <UNK> let's hope the three seasons of the show are <UNK> on dvd
<START> i am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen slow badly cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the <UNK> <UNK> of the recent years and failing <UNK> and parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless they seem to be in this one for any pay <UNK> they are getting for it and not because they thought it was a good idea the plot is dull i love great chick films as much as the next girl and this is not one if you avoid one film this year let it be
<START> shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect certainly much more true to the peter <UNK> books and comic strip than the previous two films you can read the strip currently in the <UNK> from <UNK> books or in comics <UNK> <UNK> it is one of the greatest adventure comic <UNK> of all time the movie isn't great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest on the dvd extras the interview with quentin <UNK> who is obviously stoned is a gas some people have <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> his name with the film but without him it would never have been made he is a modesty blaise fan and picked a good writer and director all things considered worth 8 stars
<START> <UNK> is a pleasant and interesting <UNK> to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the world war ii years when you've got such stars as gary cooper james cagney doris day gordon <UNK> and randolph scott etc in the film and with such people as the gershwin brothers cole porter <UNK> <UNK> and sammy <UNK> <UNK> the music it's an easy to take film and the plot isn't even in the way br br what plot there is involves two air force <UNK> men dick <UNK> and ron <UNK> trying to meet warner brothers <UNK> <UNK> rule using as a gimmick the fact that both come from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> father was <UNK> dentist as well as half of the town's the scheme works too well as <UNK> parsons is soon putting them as an item in her <UNK> yes <UNK> in the film as well she must have liked warner brothers or jack warner <UNK> to her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to <UNK> her hollywood hotel radio program back in the day br br but the rest of the plot also touched on the real life efforts of ruth roman also playing herself to get her studio and others to do shows at the air force <UNK> for the <UNK> and women going to korea some of the names i've mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at travis air force base where a lot of this film was shot br br one <UNK> number was shot for the talents of phil harris who sing <UNK> a <UNK> look out stranger i'm a texas ranger aided and <UNK> by virginia gibson frank <UNK> and gary cooper <UNK> cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image br br this is the oldest of clichés when you say they don't make them like this any more but they really don't because you don't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract that's one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can <UNK>
<START> <UNK> swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it i suppose it's one of those films that is intensely intelligent so intelligent that i think you need to be well <UNK> in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind i don't consider myself <UNK> i've been studying politics since my early teens and i enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message <UNK> tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away i would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it's a 10 10 are lying because they think they look better this film was the most confusing senseless mindless <UNK> i have seen in awhile especially considering the critical acclaim the oscar <UNK> and the cast screenplay writer stephen <UNK> has disappointed me yet again his horribly written havoc <UNK> this film and i think he's just trying way too hard i can't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the da <UNK> code screenplay on top of that <UNK> directed the film which made it an absolute mess i had no idea who anyone was why things were happening who was who and what was what it was a disaster br br because i don't really know who anyone was i can only mention the actors and what i thought of their performances because despite the <UNK> complicated script the actors did alright george clooney plays c i a field agent and assassin i think bob barnes clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he's managed to <UNK> out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part barnes was a complex character with a <UNK> history and if i knew what was going on with him i would have really enjoyed his character matt damon plays bryan <UNK> and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the <UNK> which i can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it amanda <UNK> plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given christopher plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something i like plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn't get top billing anymore br br the cast is intense if only the story made sense i'd like to exact quote the description of plot on imdb a missile disappears in iran but the cia has other problems the heir to an <UNK> gives an oil contract to china cutting out a us company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and <UNK> with a small firm that has landed a <UNK> oil contract the department of justice suspects <UNK> and the oil <UNK> law firm finds a <UNK> the cia also needs one when its plot to kill the <UNK> apparent fails agent bob barnes the fall guy sorts out the double cross an american <UNK> <UNK> the death of his son into a contract to advise the <UNK> the cia wants dead the <UNK> <UNK> join a <UNK> group all roads start and end in the oil fields what say who now <UNK> might be the thinking man's movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard i tried to stay with it i eventually <UNK> and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn't have <UNK> me enough to get me to finish it i suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but i promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour 1 10
<START> the third and last part of the bourne trilogy duh is lacking a bit in the story department but covers it with extensive action scenes <UNK> in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better br br the director and star damon themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part because the end of the second movie was quite advanced story wise how they got around that the action scenes for once but they did another thing too which i can't reveal because that would be a spoiler but if you watch the movie than you'll notice it <UNK> enough i read that this adaptation of the bourne books is the least accurate of all three films if that means anything to you o
<START> i won't go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground br br just wanted to say that i really enjoyed the film very much peter <UNK> performance alone is reason enough to watch the film br br a small scale <UNK> <UNK> movie with falk paul reiser in <UNK> ny in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film br br very well written with an adult target audience in mind plenty of reality based humor some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family br br really can't say enough about this film except that it's a damn shame that a lovely movie like this doesn't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does br br it's great to see falk with a big leading man role again he makes the most of it it proves that his famous friend writer director john <UNK> was right in casting falk in many of his ground breaking films of the 60s 70s
<START> reading a wide variety of scoop reviews over the past few days i walked into the theater prepared for a <UNK> outing from woody happily i couldn't have been more wrong granted woody the performer is <UNK> down a touch or two but woody the writer director is in fine form and found a credible way to <UNK> his 70 year old self into the story judging from the laughter and <UNK> the audience ate up allen's one liners and dialogue in a way that i haven't seen in several years br br in a movie landscape dominated by <UNK> <UNK> story <UNK> <UNK> tastes and <UNK> line formula fare for <UNK> it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still rewarding path
<START> this movie has everything emotion power affection <UNK> <UNK> adorable naked beach dance it exposes the need for real inner <UNK> and outer communication in any relationship just because cedric and mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesn't mean there isn't quite useful insight for anybody in it i would probably <UNK> it as a gay movie but one that can be appreciated and loved by <UNK> people as well as homosexual and <UNK> people <UNK> <UNK> to handle his emotions <UNK> the way our society doesn't encourage us to act any differently and that is what <UNK> the <UNK> between him and cedric this is definitely a must see
<START> picture the classic noir story lines <UNK> with hyper stylized black and white visuals of frank <UNK> sin city then picture a <UNK> science fiction thriller such as steven spielberg's minority report or richard <UNK> a <UNK> darkly an <UNK> of the above would be a suitable way of describing <UNK> french director christian <UNK> bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut but although <UNK> work does <UNK> take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance <UNK> end result justice the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that br br genre <UNK> is usually a hit and miss affair especially in a contemporary context with the well of <UNK> appearing to be increasingly exhausted as such renaissance is <UNK> as a cinematic experiment at the very least with its unique <UNK> of the gritty <UNK> of the neo noir detective thriller and the fantastic <UNK> terror of the <UNK> sci fi drama which serve to compliment each other's storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation the film's title also becomes far more poignant managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their <UNK> making for a truly compelling work br br <UNK> film truly excels in its visual <UNK> and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film's highlight superbly moody and stylish it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to <UNK> the emotional tension of the scene the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic but with a twist the end result being consistently visually <UNK> br br the film's english rendition is also given added <UNK> by its very fitting array of voice casting the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim stoic policeman <UNK> and catherine <UNK> is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister's disappearance he is investigating despite a <UNK> english accent <UNK> <UNK> does great work as the frantic sister in question and jonathan <UNK> is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega corporation <UNK> ian <UNK> <UNK> voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist and <UNK> makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes br br all together renaissance boasts a visually stunning unique and compelling futuristic thriller just as intelligent as it is entertaining though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may <UNK> the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional <UNK> for fans of either of the film's <UNK> genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller or those willing to appreciate a <UNK> crafted slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller the film is without question worth a watch br br 8 10
<START> but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did it's a <UNK> about his life and career beginning with <UNK> and going back to trace the origins it's uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although it's not quite as emotionally <UNK> as lost in translation and he doesn't find love however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural <UNK> that is tokyo street life br br perhaps weird al isn't recognized as the insightful cultural <UNK> that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is a funny movie
<START> a girl's <UNK> is a sort of half comedy half <UNK> look at the motion picture business of the mid <UNK> we get a glimpse of life at an early movie studio where we experience <UNK> of a set running through a scene handling of <UNK> movie fanatics even lunch at the <UNK> we are also <UNK> to little known cinematic facts for example did you know that frequently <UNK> actors do not know the plot of the picture in which they are working br br the plot of this film in essence is movie star kenneth <UNK> discovery and <UNK> of a budding young <UNK> whom he discovers while shooting on location in the country i believe the 30 minute version i watched was <UNK> included on the same tape with cecil b de <UNK> the cheat it is a very credible film an easy watch with a large cast of extras as a bonus it includes some of best illustrated <UNK> i have ever seen accompanying a silent movie
<START> definitely one of the lesser of the astaire rogers musicals it's just very poorly plotted and paced it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time for example but it feels a heck of a lot longer this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet <UNK> scott is rarely ever interesting i like <UNK> she's sweet and i love at least one of her songs but where are you get <UNK> behind me satan her other number is a weak <UNK> from top hat thankfully cut from that masterpiece follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers the dancing contest <UNK> for the top spot of any of their numbers the dance is just fantastic i'm putting all my eggs in one basket presents the two <UNK> a dance that they don't quite have <UNK> yet its <UNK> make it all the more perfect and let's face the music and dance is easily one of irving <UNK> best songs so the film is well worth watching for its great moments
<START> ah the 1970's a time when it was in to be a <UNK> to be honest today is also a good time to be a <UNK> but it just felt more daring then br br joe <UNK> offers up a pretty good soft core film in fact just like today some of the actors are famous hardcore actors unlike today these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development br br it's pretty much what you would expect out of a <UNK> movie two couples with open relationships re <UNK> the <UNK> out of the <UNK> of one of the women who has come for a visit not much more to it br br of course when the <UNK> is jennifer welles then it is a different story not too many 40 somethings look as delicious <UNK> as ms welles it's worth the price alone to see ms welles look at herself in the mirror as if she's <UNK> she's no <UNK> mom she's way <UNK> br br i also <UNK> chris <UNK> anna jordan looks and sounds so much like <UNK> <UNK> that i thought she might be her separated at birth twin or even <UNK> herself anna is always eating but must have incredible <UNK> br br unlike 1990's soft core porn 70's <UNK> porn <UNK> the hardcore film's realism something that <UNK> soft core has brought back on occasion instead of the 90's music and <UNK> <UNK> and it is here in full force it's not real but it feels real br br for those who enjoyed the <UNK> produced <UNK> <UNK> en or you'll enjoy this one another classic film only on drive in classics the best 2 50 can a month you can spend
<START> one can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as morgan freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs help br br it all comes down to loving people as will rogers said i never met a man i didn't like of course if you meet paz vega what's not to like that smile of hers can melt <UNK> she is just so fantastic that i can watch anything she is in the same goes for freeman he is just magic on the screen br br the two of them gave us a film that was funny from start to finish from the mexican supermarket to <UNK> bobby to <UNK> it was tender charming and just plain funny br br you have to check this out
<START> ok the cons first the obligatory <UNK> alligator all right <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> limbs is made the worse for scale <UNK> underwater shots with the full length of <UNK> <UNK> to the size of the boat <UNK> a toy alligator being <UNK> around the toy boat in <UNK> lit water even for <UNK> shots br br unlike most <UNK> killing exploitative <UNK> films the <UNK> natives going bat and start <UNK> the <UNK> seems <UNK> this time no one really abused the natives exploited yes but far from abusive treatment after all it was one of the natives <UNK> with a spoiled <UNK> during a taboo full moon that brought the curse of the river demon on them right br br the <UNK> are easily annoying with the notable exception of the token old soul mildly <UNK> little girl who takes a shine to the heroes that you often see in 70's <UNK> but far from from deserving violent death unless they were your next door neighbors mind you a couple actually get killed being heroic notable in that none of them fill the role of sidekick there are only two straight villains in the entire film so the <UNK> feel more <UNK> than <UNK> br br the sequence where the giant <UNK> <UNK> down and <UNK> thirty tourists in under five minutes will probably strike you as unintentionally hilarious br br the point at which the natives decide not to wipe the surviving <UNK> and practically saying hey you aren't so bad after all sorry about that fuss last night because they blew up the monster lizard has you shaking your head as the corny music kicks in you know the local military <UNK> will wipe out the village for ing with the tourist trade after the credits roll br br the pros barbara bach barbara bach barbara bach barbara bach you all know why you're interested in this film in the first place right i thought so if you're a bach <UNK> get the dvd <UNK> by <UNK> films earlier this year <UNK> <UNK> with no real extras to speak of aside from the director <UNK> the current state of international film distribution br br the hero isn't half bad being far from an idiot always a plus in b films and the cynical little kid provides most of the comic relief br br worth a look but get it cheaply
<START> an enthralling wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent martin scorsese many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works particularly the earlier ones the silent era very enjoyable despite being a bit long i found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet required viewing if you admire martin scorsese and his work
<START> as predictable as a hallmark card but not without merit the rookie makes for a solid outing dennis quaid the most reasonable jock actor working today is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player jimmy morris the film is never <UNK> down for the children as would be expected from a g rated film as a sports film the rookie is one of the best i have seen since any given sunday
<START> bizarre tobe hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young man brad <UNK> with the ability to set people on fire this ability <UNK> from parents who <UNK> in atomic experiments in the 50's they die of spontaneous human <UNK> and it seems that what sam is beginning to suffer from <UNK> by these <UNK> his girlfriend lisa <UNK> <UNK> gives him to take for rough <UNK> in <UNK> lisa was told to manipulate sam into taking the <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> william prince pretty much the young man's father who raised him from a child <UNK> has <UNK> plans he sees sam as the first atomic man a pure killing machine in human form sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for his condition as the film goes <UNK> blood is slowly growing toxic green in color instead of red it seems that water and other <UNK> which often put out fire react right the opposite when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of flame <UNK> come to find out lisa has <UNK> condition whose parents also dies from <UNK> dr <UNK> jon cypher someone who sam has known for quite some time as his <UNK> is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies i'm guessing to increase their levels of flame nina melinda dillon sporting an accent that fades in and out was <UNK> parents' friend and associate on the experiments in the 50's who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening and rachel <UNK> young is <UNK> ex wife who may be working against her former husband with <UNK> and <UNK> to harm him and lisa br br quite a strange little horror flick filled with some pretty awful flame effects <UNK> tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to his character whose plight we continue to watch as his body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often <UNK> from his <UNK> there's this large hole in his arm that <UNK> out flame like a <UNK> and a massive burn spot on his hand which <UNK> in size over time best scene is probably when director john <UNK> who portrays a rude <UNK> engineer trying to inform sam to hang up because the radio program he's calling has sounded off for the night becomes a victim of <UNK> the flick never quite works because it's so wildly uneven with an abrupt ridiculous finale where sam offers to free lisa of her fire by taking it from her
<START> i'm a true fan of the original cracker series and own all of them on dvd cracker had a tendency to be over the top on occasion but <UNK> <UNK> and the other cast members as well as the writers always seemed to carry it off despite themselves i count the original cracker among the great brit tv crime series of that time and there's some stiff competition prime suspect inspector frost inspector morse jeremy <UNK> sherlock homes and a host of others cracker along with prime suspect was on the top of my list br br which makes a new terror all the more sad br br ultimately this was a very pale imitation of <UNK> former glory i forced myself to sit through the whole thing convinced that it couldn't actually be this bad and that some spark would eventually <UNK> i was wrong it was bad from beginning to end br br a few criticisms first just to get any potential bias up front right off i was offended by the anti american anti war <UNK> that <UNK> on and on throughout most of the show the <UNK> the murder of two <UNK> innocent of any crime and a british <UNK> is in <UNK> words understandable but not justified i thought i <UNK> through two hours of crap just to hear this disgusting bit of drivel so i had a negative reaction to the anti war american tone brought on by my beliefs beyond the politics i had the distinct sense that this cracker was merely a prop for the propaganda and it actually helped to <UNK> an already terribly weak script br br second just how much air time did <UNK> <UNK> get <UNK> was almost a bit player in this one as if he was an <UNK> <UNK> into some story originally written without any thought of <UNK> role <UNK> could have carried the show on his own broad and still suitably <UNK> shoulders but the writer was apparently thinking of other things and missed the chance and by a wide <UNK> br br third what an abysmal script there was some <UNK> and a couple of bits of actual character development <UNK> son <UNK> that <UNK> couldn't stay at his house if he missed his plane to australia the detective that liked to beat his poor performers over the backs of their heads and some of the old sparks between <UNK> and his <UNK> but not nearly enough to carry the tedious storyline br br fourth where the hell was <UNK> now that would have been interesting it was <UNK> after all and 10 years on she'd be up in the ranks another wasted opportunity or perhaps the actress wasn't interested br br well there's much more that's bad to say but i'll close with a curiosity at the end of the show as it aired on <UNK> when the <UNK> announced that the director's cut was available on bbc on demand i thought ah ha the director's cut which presumably one has to pay for might have all of the <UNK> i expected to see tonight but never did like a coherent interesting storyline unfortunately after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of a new terror with the hope of seeing something anything worth watching only to be disappointed i have no hope left to <UNK> me to actually pay for a second potentially longer and more tedious version besides it <UNK> me to think that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and sacrificed show time to <UNK> the endless every ten minutes or so stream of commercials and then turned around and asked me to pay for what probably should have been version aired tonight br br to close i quote the first paragraph of <UNK> review of a new terror it really says it all initial excitement about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his role as the <UNK> flawed <UNK> <UNK> criminal psychologist is <UNK> under by the heavy handed political statement writer jimmy <UNK> is determined to deliver within this revival <UNK> <UNK> at first in its message namely that americans are a bunch of whiny <UNK> <UNK> who didn't care a <UNK> about terrorism before it came crashing onto our <UNK> <UNK> chest <UNK> rant <UNK> the narrative and <UNK> the pleasure of seeing <UNK> back on the case
<START> this movie had some great actors in it unfortunately they had forgotten how to act i was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time maybe it was the musical score or the director himself but one thing is for sure the make up artist needs to get another job the facial <UNK> was so thick you could see it <UNK> on the actors faces would not recommend this movie to anyone no wonder it never hit the theaters cuba gooding jr james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all the plot was great just needed a whole lot more
<START> this is one of my favorite films of all time al pacino acting is at its best and the story is excellent too bad it didn't do to well in the 80's when it was first released because people didn't get a chance to experience this classic
<START> there is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film let's just face it though the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for leo and <UNK> who are not necessarily the best actors in this film i'm not saying they're not good actors i'm saying they <UNK> in this film the special effects were decent and i will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye pleasing but it even has several major flaws for instance right before the ship goes under you can see an unfinished blue screen image behind your main characters br br don't get me wrong i love the story of the real titanic but i find this movie an insult to that story editing was atrocious there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1 2 hours with the exception of maybe a <UNK> movie and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted br br i will say that the music was perhaps better than i could have predicted and not just the my heart will go on song either there is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and <UNK> bass music is heard that could very well be the highlight of the film as for the mood throughout it was extremely dull i was more <UNK> than sad when jack died which i know cannot be what the director intended br br in a nut shell i find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the titanic into an over hyped chick flick
<START> leave it to <UNK> to put on a good show finally he and <UNK> are living their own lives outside of <UNK> ghost coast to coast i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot they are completely what started adult swim <UNK> made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 it may not have been <UNK> but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love adult <UNK> shows i have to say that out of all the adult swim shows with no plot this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made that is why i like it so much it is just such a classic in the adult swim history i believe this is just such a great show if you don't like it hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it
<START> the problem with the <UNK> is summed up by the opening scene the cia want an international terrorist dead so contact black <UNK> assassin james <UNK> the terrorist is appearing at the old <UNK> court in london which begs the question why do they want to <UNK> off a terrorist if he's going to spend the rest of his life in jail he's going to be out of <UNK> either way didn't the cia have a chance before he was arrested if by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him there's no logical reason to kill someone who is going to spend life in a maximum security prison br br since the premise sets up the story an audience might be choose to ignore the plot hole but the <UNK> itself <UNK> fuel upon the fire <UNK> colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they're driving in crashes but <UNK> manages to escape so the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to <UNK> someone from a car crash the film of this type of plot <UNK> later <UNK> finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying this airport is surrounded by armed <UNK> yet <UNK> manages to escape very easily without explanation the whole film <UNK> its audience by relying on things that are never explained this includes an important supporting character called emily day why does she help <UNK> even though he's a wanted fugitive your guess is as good as mine br br this is a fairly poor thriller and don't be taken in by the big name cast wesley snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more <UNK> films charles dance also appeared in big budget hollywood productions such as last action hero and alien 3 but again he's someone best known for appearing in straight to dvd fare these days and he's basically playing a cameo role anyway the likes of lena <UNK> may go on to become big players in cinema but <UNK> certainly fail to put the <UNK> on their resume
<START> the story for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> actually came to <UNK> <UNK> mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in <UNK> where he was on a visit after the <UNK> against his previous <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> he was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt <UNK> <UNK> posters but the life of hippies re <UNK> a story in <UNK> mind to be made into a film br br this was <UNK> <UNK> perhaps best directorial effort the film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> sister made a tremendous impact br br this film was <UNK> <UNK> call to the nation to keep up their moral values br br it is about a <UNK> based indian family and the brother's role is a very <UNK> one for his sister but the parents <UNK> and separate leaving <UNK> <UNK> with mother and <UNK> <UNK> with father she is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see <UNK> again br br she is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home <UNK> grows up to be a pilot and he learns that <UNK> is in <UNK> with certain hippies br br to reunite with his sister <UNK> travels to <UNK> and meets <UNK> <UNK> who was to later marry him and also <UNK> who in reality is <UNK> with a new name and new identity she has forgotten her childhood and <UNK> too br br <UNK> has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in <UNK> and the people are after his life br br this was a story well directed and acted both by <UNK> <UNK> we see more of <UNK> <UNK> than of <UNK> but the music by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was well composed <UNK> had first offered the music to be composed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> da did not want <UNK> to do the film he was very close to <UNK> and his earlier film <UNK> <UNK> though was good but had been opposed in <UNK> <UNK> da wanted <UNK> to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie <UNK> film might <UNK> people's anger against <UNK> but <UNK> continued with the film <UNK> <UNK> da and the film was indeed a success br br r d <UNK> had <UNK> <UNK> sing the award winning <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> re <UNK> re was another good number br br overall it is a good film
<START> i love these actors but they were wasted in this flick br br i can only wonder what were they thinking <UNK> to this crap br br debra <UNK> just <UNK> it in dennis quaid and <UNK> howard were caricatures some people thought it was deep well if you liked breaking the waves you'll probably like this too i hated both 3 10
<START> this movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching sloppy editing little to no continuity insane dialog bad you might even say non existent acting pointless story lines shots that go on far too long and it's perfect for mst3k style <UNK> not to mention the corpse <UNK> drinking game <UNK> on forms take a shot sign your name take a shot catch a bad <UNK> edit take many many shots br br the only reason i didn't rate it higher than 8 is because there's not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness it's only an hour long hell a movie like this should have been at least 20 30 minutes longer
<START> i'm not even sure what to say about this film it's one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank <UNK> like dancing about architecture it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write the ending is left open and ambiguous no happy ending here just mystery no profound life lessons just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings romantic love br br 10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger
<START> besides being boring the scenes were oppressive and dark the movie tried to portray some kind of moral but fell flat with its message what were the redeeming qualities on top of that i don't think it could make <UNK> look any more <UNK> than it did
<START> this is an interesting idea gone bad the hidden meanings in art left as clues by a serial killer sounds intriguing but the execution in <UNK> is excruciatingly slow and without much interest there is no other way to describe the film except boring the death clues are the only interesting part of <UNK> everything connecting them is tedious willem dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit several supporting character actors are wasted including peter <UNK> as the art expert james <UNK> as the police chief paul <UNK> as the medical <UNK> and most notably deborah harry who is featured on the back of the dvd case yet only has a couple lines spoken through a <UNK> door not recommended <UNK>
<START> i understand this film to be a debut feature and as such it is very impressive it has the feel and pacing of a true indie yet director todd <UNK> clearly possesses the <UNK> and <UNK> vision command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional the shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward he and screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> deliver a story that has much more depth and <UNK> than typical paint by numbers type scripts it's a story that needs judd <UNK> caliber character talent to have a shot at working judd is fantastic as usual as are scott cohen and the beautiful susan <UNK> the real surprise though is elliot <UNK> who plays adam <UNK> <UNK> was able to <UNK> nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily <UNK> by stereotype or <UNK> anyway i found the film refreshing and entertaining
<START> okay let's not get confused here if this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror <UNK> sequel here's to hoping that's not a general rule as wes craven's own sequel to the original the hills have eyes  released somewhere during the mid 80's  is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made part two didn't have an actual plot and re used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and <UNK> premise craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories as the loyal german shepard of the carter family re experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain <UNK> there were quite a bit of <UNK> signs <UNK> us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well the remake came out barely one year ago and here's the sequel already the incredible speed of its release <UNK> causes you to question the quality of the script don't they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary menacing and disturbing with his excellent film alexandre <UNK> nearly single <UNK> altered the general opinion about horror remakes as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for also <UNK> is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his french instant cult classic high tension but who is this new director <UNK> the hills have eyes was an unexpected hit appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over <UNK> target groups it's a really good film and even though an <UNK> of new sequels and <UNK> will be inevitable it's highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of <UNK> <UNK> hit bearing all this in mind plus a rather large dose of personal <UNK> i must admit this rushed sequel really isn't as awful as anticipated the screenplay is routine and clichéd horror fodder introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no <UNK> and <UNK> depicting how they get slaughtered by <UNK> repulsive looking freaks after the events of the first film the us army has set up a camp in the middle of the new mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear <UNK> which took place there in the 50's and 60's for the horribly mutated survivors of the <UNK> community that stayed there during the <UNK> testing the scientists and <UNK> form a tasty <UNK> until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck they are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless <UNK> that live inside the <UNK> of the mines br br this basically is just another by the numbers slasher with dumb characters who are even after losing several of their friends already still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill it's also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3 year old son the hills have eyes ii completely lacks  as to be expected  originality logic and plausible situations the mutated <UNK> aren't nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one mainly because they aren't organized this time and only just behave like <UNK> and sex hungry prototype monsters since you don't care for the amateur g i joe heroes and definitely don't feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year's original most <UNK> this second film isn't nearly as violent and gory as the first sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor there are a handful of scenes to satisfy the <UNK> horror fanatics  mainly showing soldiers falling down <UNK> or getting shot by their own guns  but there sadly aren't any outrageous pick axe battles or <UNK> dog attacks what a shame what's the point of a sequel if it even fails to <UNK> the level of <UNK> and or gratuitous filth of the original luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental and you'll have the most fun <UNK> all the things that don't make the slightest bit of sense for example <UNK> falling out of people's <UNK> heads women without any muscle power cast as tough ass soldiers and  my personal favorite  <UNK> the one soldier with a speaking <UNK> to operate the radio <UNK>
<START> what happened to peter bogdanovich once a brilliant director a trail <UNK> is now <UNK> the very bottom is this the same man who directed the last picture show here he takes a somewhat interesting albeit <UNK> premise and turns it into bubble <UNK> that loses flavor the moment you take the first bite dunst is not bad but izzard is miscast as chaplin and all the other actors seem to have been cast for their looks and not because they were right for the part too bad i'll go rent paper moon again
<START> what a horrible horrible film the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time not that i saw much i left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to <UNK> my nerves meryl streep was awful as usual how many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have <UNK> <UNK> talents were as so often totally wasted and who told gloria <UNK> she could act trying to be <UNK> correct this movie still <UNK> racial stereotypes brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches <UNK> kids <UNK> in poor <UNK> school the kids weren't even cute just written in to suit the appalling script <UNK> wes craven really made me cringe for once real horror this one
<START> i saw this film for the first time not too long on <UNK> <UNK> series the eye of the <UNK> cliché was never more <UNK> this <UNK> saw little of value in this one i was puzzled by the <UNK> attraction that lucy lauren bacall possessed granted ms bacall was a beautiful woman but in this film her character comes off more <UNK> than attractive i would think men like mitch wayne and kyle hadley would more likely ignore lucy than fall into an instant <UNK> with her in <UNK> defense this film was made at the time of <UNK> <UNK> last illness and the weight of his <UNK> health may have affected her performance of course part of this <UNK> on the part of lucy was to contrast her to <UNK> <UNK> played to the <UNK> and beyond by dorothy malone the scene where she <UNK> in a wildly sensual dance while her father <UNK> climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film <UNK> performance <UNK> the rest although <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by robert keith generally though i would have to say that i'm just not much of a fan of melodrama the cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes
<START> so much is wrong with this abysmal little wet fart of a movie that it's hard to know where to begin br br first of all it's a remarkably un scary scary movie even by <UNK> standards the dialogue is cliché the characters are two dimensional the writing is ho hum and what little story there is is neither coherent nor remotely interesting br br we meet the following stereotypes in order <UNK> loser guy probably divorced but who knows this movie doesn't tell us with a brave heart the young hero who doesn't do anything heroic at all brave little kid with a homicidal streak a mile wide and black bad ass bitch with more <UNK> than brains these guys take up an ongoing fight with the tall scary <UNK> man and his evil ewoks br br oh and the film is full of wicked little metal <UNK> <UNK> around menacing people given a chance they perform <UNK> brain surgery on those who <UNK> have the mental <UNK> to duck when they come at them <UNK> actually one of them is haunted by a good ghost but then again it might be a <UNK> <UNK> who seems intent on helping our brave <UNK> retrieve their young kidnapped friend br br there is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters it starts with some kind of <UNK> of the ending of the previous movie but this doesn't explain a lot if you've seen the first two movies fine otherwise you don't know who these people are how they are related why they aren't in school or at work or why you should care whether they live or die consequently you don't the only point of interest becomes any splatter effects and there aren't enough of those to keep you awake br br of <UNK> interest amusement are the three <UNK> <UNK> as stupid as they are evil who menace our heroes but they don't get much screen time they are <UNK> almost immediately then they are buried why anybody should take the time is beyond me then they appear again as evil <UNK> punk zombies only to be <UNK> again literally within a minute br br the rest of the movie mainly seems to consist of <UNK> the friendly ghost appearing and disappearing driving around looking for places and <UNK> loser trying to score <UNK> bad black bitch <UNK> using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager no <UNK> there not even some gratuitous sex could have saved this movie so good thing there never is any br br the head baddie called the tall man doesn't manage to scare anyone older than 3 years howling <UNK> every five minutes isn't enough why he with his amazing <UNK> powers and uncanny upper body strength doesn't simply <UNK> our heroes like bugs isn't explained instead he <UNK> the job to his inept retarded little <UNK> who never manage to kill anyone before being shot to hell br br <UNK> who like masterpieces like friday 13th part <UNK> jason goes to college might find some entertainment the rest of us who have developed <UNK> hair will be bored out of our <UNK>
<START> no matter how well meaning his message is this film is a terribly made <UNK> awful acting lame camera work i do not know why <UNK> agreed to try and pull off a <UNK> he is lousy at it you watch the extras on the dvd and the way he has a camera follow him around he just <UNK> it up he loves being the center of attention he is a bad actor he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker eric <UNK> some how <UNK> has had this film shown at city youth centers and new age <UNK> where damaged people looking for <UNK> and attention themselves <UNK> on about how the film touched them and maybe it did but as a film itself it is choppy predictable and sappy
<START> i've seen a lot of seagal movies and while most aren't great or even good this steamy pile <UNK> the bar for bad movies br br the plot not sure really something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something who are the good guys and bad guys hard to tell most of the movie is cut scenes going back and forth between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about how good <UNK> character <UNK> is br br acting blows br br voice dubbing what was with the horrible voice <UNK> could they of found anyone who sounded any less like seagal may as well had cheech or chong doing the voice overs might of at least been entertaining then br br this movie is boring and completely stupid avoid it at all costs
<START> penny princess finds american working girl <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of a small kingdom that lies in that triangle where france italy and switzerland meet called <UNK> it seems as though the <UNK> owe bills all over europe and the main <UNK> of the country is <UNK> due to its <UNK> an american multi millionaire buys the place but dies before he can take title his nearest heir is <UNK> br br but of course the estate has to go through <UNK> in america and what are the <UNK> to do especially since <UNK> who has now become a princess has <UNK> <UNK> br br enter <UNK> <UNK> who is on a trip to switzerland to learn about the cheese industry it seems as though the <UNK> have a kind of cheese that they <UNK> refer to as <UNK> with a few <UNK> in the road <UNK> <UNK> all the problems both financial <UNK> and romantic between <UNK> and <UNK> br br how does <UNK> work well that's the gimmick to the whole film but here's a hint in lover come back jack <UNK> might just have gotten a hold of the secret of <UNK> when he was busy <UNK> <UNK> for rock hudson and his advertising agency br br anyway penny princess is a delightful blend of british farce and romantic comedy <UNK> <UNK> once again plays a role that marilyn monroe would have been cast in if the film had been made this side of the pond <UNK> <UNK> was well cast in the part which was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart <UNK> way before anyone but him suspected he had the acting chops he had br br this film was sadly shown at three <UNK> in the morning on tcm but at least i found a reason to be grateful for insomnia
<START> well i couldn't even enjoyed this movie much for its cult values it's a b movie action flick by the director of <UNK> that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good b movie with enough entertainment value in it br br it's an <UNK> flick but foremost the movie should remind of an <UNK> action movie when these type of b movies were at an all time high these movies always went over the top and never paid much attention to its story or acting it was all about blowing stuff up big muscle heroes and bullets flying around this movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet i really didn't liked watching this movie as much as i like watching some similar type of movies hard to say why really since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same era br br it's probably because the movie is being often far too silly all these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it the fighting dolph lundgren running around <UNK> the characters the story it all just isn't very good because it's often just too lame for words the story at times isn't even trying to make a bit sense and what's even the main plot line of the overall movie its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences gun fights and such and those sequences aren't even much good to watch really the moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really from the man who brought us <UNK> br br it's foremost a dolph lundgren in which he gets to play the big action hero star who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl played by <UNK> <UNK> this all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence i have seen in any movie really both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put together br br none of the characters work out really the good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one they simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest or to inform anyone about their <UNK> not even when they find out a big japanese crime <UNK> is trying to take over the streets of l a and a beer <UNK> is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs <UNK> and also just think about it for a moment what is brandon lee's overall purpose in the movie the movie could had easily done without him and the girl as well br br too silly lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enough br br 4 10
<START> i guess i have still enough brain left to not find this movie funny great comedians but a very poor movie the best performance still did nina <UNK> br br trivia did you realize that it the real world scenes in <UNK> the cars are almost only new <UNK> br br i guess i have still enough brain left to not find this movie funny great comedians but a very poor movie the best performance still did nina <UNK> br br trivia did you realize that it the real world scenes in <UNK> the cars are almost only new <UNK>
<START> whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of <UNK> and rome otherwise this is only for hardcore <UNK> of elizabeth taylor her <UNK> phase and richard burton his <UNK> phase <UNK> williams wrote the milk train doesn't stop here anymore and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play but apparently he was the only one taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money br br whatever it amounts to a hill of <UNK> with taylor <UNK> and <UNK> in her shrill manner exploding at the servants and <UNK> bad baby talk with no less than <UNK> coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears br br it's so campy that among taylor fans it's probably considered a must see kind of thing but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand you're way ahead of me sadly this is the film that <UNK> the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress even after winning two oscars for burton it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb judge for yourself if you dare
<START> on broadway a chorus line was pure magic from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale a <UNK> curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show we were totally engaged captivated by the intensely personal stories some funny some clever some stirring of this chorus line the movie is another matter entirely the focus is now on the director and what an ogre he is every time the film switches to michael douglas there he is with a bitter sour expression <UNK> out questions and orders screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance <UNK> that changes the dynamics of the story on broadway the director was indeed an <UNK> <UNK> presence but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong fragile intriguing hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity there is a reason this work won the <UNK> prize and actually in one of the only moments the director appears he is there to comfort the young puerto <UNK> dancer after we hear that <UNK> heart breaking story he appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection concern for cassie but in the movie from the second <UNK> director starts <UNK> <UNK> orders the chorus line <UNK> stories become secondary it's like they are in a lousy profession where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show is jaded exhausted furious at having to audition these chorus members on stage there was always the excitement of the show here in the movie practically from the word go you feel sorry for everyone involved during the course of the musical we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job but of course that couldn't happen but in the finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage sometimes <UNK> us in the audience in our hearts and we know also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much bringing magic to the theatre in the movie after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis that magic becomes totally <UNK> all we feel even with the exact same curtain call is that some of the members got a job with a mean spirited director so they all come on the screen and are dancing again big deal
<START> and that's a bad thing because at least if this had been a troma film it would have had <UNK> violence and a greater sense of <UNK> abandon that might have brought my rating up a bit br br so what we have instead is a very tame rated pg barely <UNK> low budget roger corman produced it with an unknown director who has subsequently remained unknown <UNK> 1984 <UNK> 1986 wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor little of the logic that made <UNK> work so well fantasy logic or not no suspense no sense of adventure and no violence or nudity to make up for it br br although i'm sure some of the problems with the film are inherent in the script let's face it no one could deliver these jokes so that they would be funny it seems like the biggest blame has to fall into the lap of the director <UNK> <UNK> in more capable hands <UNK> could have been entertaining br br after all it starts out like many great adventure films simon <UNK> harvey <UNK> and his son paul charles <UNK> are in <UNK> on an <UNK> dig simon is a bit of a wacky <UNK> who is always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien <UNK> for example he thinks he sees evidence of laser cutting on ancient <UNK> so they're at <UNK> <UNK> looking for more evidence of simon's theories when they happen upon a secret chamber inside they quickly find the animal they later dub arnold one of the titular <UNK> br br they take arnold back home to their small california desert town simon who thinks that arnold is probably an alien creature has to go off to a <UNK> lecture and he plans on telling the colleague that he finally has an alien <UNK> paul and his extremely cute girlfriend cindy <UNK> van der <UNK> are left in charge of arnold but as they haven't seen each other in a long time they leave arnold <UNK> while they hop in the sack br br meanwhile simon's brother cecil played also by <UNK> in a <UNK> role owner of a successful <UNK> <UNK> company is eager to buy off simon's home and land they're <UNK> to his own simon doesn't want to sell so cecil hits upon a scheme to steal arnold things gradually spiral out of control and the <UNK> who have a mean streak to go along with their <UNK> for junk food begin to <UNK> the town br br that reads better in a summary than it plays on the screen the best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background such as when characters are driving on the <UNK> of the desert town interiors with the exception of <UNK> home tend to look like poorly <UNK> cheap sets and more importantly they tend to show that <UNK> is not very skilled at <UNK> and setting up shots oddly given the <UNK> of the production design overall <UNK> home is quite a gem <UNK> as it is in overblown 1980s style down to the smallest details and <UNK> <UNK> dude jon <UNK> was an amusing <UNK> too bad then that he's out of the film so quickly br br at any rate <UNK> is a fun actor but he comes across much better here as simon than as cecil unfortunately simon ends up being absent for most of the film cecil who is <UNK> physically by a ridiculous wig and facial hair is not only the evil <UNK> of the film he's one of <UNK> classic <UNK> <UNK> characters that was one of his <UNK> frequently <UNK> on in carol <UNK> show 1967 skits unlike the carol <UNK> show which tended to succeed because directors clark jones and dave powers had a studied way of pushing the skits just to the brink of chaos <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in way too far and the cecil character just doesn't work the way it should br br there are a lot of other director related problems not the least of which is <UNK> pacing and editing which completely <UNK> any possible suspense or compelling dramatic impact from the film even scenes that should have been shoe ins for <UNK> up the drama such as when the <UNK> are <UNK> an old lady on the road are put together far too <UNK> to have much affect br br there are also serious logical problems with the story as it stands where did the <UNK> in the chamber at <UNK> <UNK> come from the film's trailer seems to show an answer to this but it was edited out of the final cut a more serious problem is that unlike <UNK> there is no clear reason for <UNK> to go from cute <UNK> <UNK> to menacing monsters it just happens further because <UNK> was kept pg and the violence remains toned down when the creatures are in their monster phase they're never very threatening they're also easily <UNK> at least <UNK> br br admittedly the <UNK> of the film isn't suspense horror compelling drama or any of that other stuff but humor it's intended more as a spoof of <UNK> and the countless rip offs in its wake the only problem with that is that the film just isn't funny even though i <UNK> a couple times a surprisingly high <UNK> of the jokes are bland clichés too much of the remaining material consists of non <UNK> given bad timing from <UNK> it all just falls flat there was potential to make a film that while a spoof was both funny and frightening hilarious and disturbing cheesy and suspenseful all at the same time ala killer <UNK> from outer space 1988 too bad then that <UNK> comes nowhere near that
<START> time travel is a fun concept and this film gives it a different <UNK> i got a kick out of captain <UNK> one of the more down to earth characters who was just not having a good day <UNK> i don't choose to watch horror films but this is an exception good story excellent acting
<START> this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen the footage is extraordinary mesmerizing at times it also received an oscar for best photography and deservedly so i have many movies in my film collection and several more i've seen besides them and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this one br br it's unique and an overall great movie the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters we follow their <UNK> with devotion and get very emotionally attached to them along the way we also learn things about ourselves and our lives i think much of this film for what it represent and how it present it i <UNK> recommend it
<START> <UNK> is another glossy movie failure i am trying to think of one good thing that i could say about the movie and i am having trouble coming up with something i guess the red dress that <UNK> <UNK> was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part the writing and the script was not the worst that i have ever encountered but it could have been a lot better <UNK> was very pleasing to the eye to view the sets were very glossy and nice to look at the cast was okay i felt like anne <UNK> character was the only <UNK> character in the entire movie it was sad to see chris sarandon waste his time on this one
<START> this western is done in a different manner than most others realism is the key here <UNK> farrell comes to <UNK> to work for rip torn on his ranch how this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of <UNK> i would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape but it's worth a look to see just how life was back in the real west cinematography is excellent solid 9 torn farrell <UNK> in this movie
<START> emma is my favourite jane austen novel emma is well meaning despite her flaws so readers can forgive and love her and the relationship she has with mr knightley which is warm familiar <UNK> but playful <UNK> that warm fuzzy romantic excitement mr knightley is the perfect man and emma is as close as you could get in those times to an independent clever confident woman remember she is only 21 and was sure to have <UNK> and grown out of her flaws who doesn't want to be emma who doesn't want to be told off by mr knightley this version of emma gives you no sense of the things that i love about emma i couldn't even finish watching it i just found it so awful i couldn't see that warm generous side of emma which drives the reader to love her the patience and warmth she shows to her father the <UNK> between her and mrs <UNK> which demonstrates her <UNK> to put her friend's happiness above her own as she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by <UNK> miss <UNK> marriage mr <UNK> character in this adaptation just appears bizarre rather than just quaint elderly and a bit trying br br this adaptation most importantly fails bring to life the relationship between mr knightley and emma their relationship is built on mutual respect and affection mr knightley is indulgent of <UNK> minor faults <UNK> that her intelligence and genuine care for others will never allow her to go terribly <UNK> and emma looks up to him though <UNK> hiding this and continuing to use her own judgement the dressing down he gives her right at the beginning of the show completely <UNK> the argument between them and ruins all possibility of portraying the nature of their relationship as i've described above mr knightley is also <UNK> attractive to bring to life the sexual tension between the leads or to inspire any admiration from the female viewers br br really horrible i can't understand why anyone who truly like the novel emma could like it unless it miraculously <UNK> itself after the point i switched it off
<START> i watched peter jackson version of lord of the rings when i was half way through reading the two towers and i thought it was absolutely brilliant br br at this time the animated version of the lord of the rings was released on dvd but i told myself that i will finish reading the two towers and return of kings before watching it as i thought it showed the whole of the trilogy br br so when i did finish the trilogy i went and brought the dvd which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish br br i was <UNK> bored 20 minutes in to it which was really strange because i love the book and i am <UNK> that the maker of this film could of even thought of fitting at least 1 and a half of the books in to a 2 hour 8 minute film br br none of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page even my favourite character who is <UNK> did not seem interesting at all br br the animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the <UNK> they looked awful and <UNK> and sam face br br i don't know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film couldn't of got any better br br i just hope that nobody judges the books by this film br br 3 10
<START> billed as takashi miike's first family film by people who haven't seen <UNK> presumably yokai <UNK> takes things even further in the direction of family <UNK> <UNK> the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures the yokai perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous <UNK> but i think it's probably just that he wanted to do something different he's really never been a one trick <UNK> but often gets accused of it perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics regardless it's a great project for miike to channel his <UNK> imagination and invention into br br there's a very cartoonish feel to the production <UNK> thoughts of miyazaki in places the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales which certainly influenced miyazaki as well particularly spirited away it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with so the special effects aren't going to be <UNK> hollywood style work some blue screening is especially obvious some of the special effects are great though with some very well animated creatures a mix of cg stop motion and <UNK> i think the little <UNK> puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was meant to look really cheap and is all the <UNK> for it the young <UNK> who plays the hero of the film does a really good job it's so hard to find a pre teen who actually understands the concept of acting but 9 year old <UNK> <UNK> is a genuine talent i see he did voices in the last 2 miyazaki films <UNK> <UNK> is delicious as the <UNK> of the piece though <UNK> <UNK> made an even greater impression as the <UNK> <UNK> river princess <UNK> <UNK> those looking for another violent perverted gangster film aren't going to find what they're looking for in yokai but if you're a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit there's plenty to satisfy here and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you've got
<START> as if the storyline wasn't depressing enough this movie shows <UNK> being butchered <UNK> in a <UNK> for all of five minutes while the protagonist is <UNK> her early life as a butcher weird stuff then there's the core premise of the hero heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he's <UNK> ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl is this person a psycho a <UNK> just a doomed queen who takes things too far and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have just that he didn't get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was <UNK> he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did but it's really really so hard to empathize such sad and unusual self destruction was it supposed to be funny what was it all about really
<START> the second in the vacation series is easily the least enjoyable one as clark <UNK> wins a trip for the whole family to europe br br the tasteless below the belt humor that worked so well the first time around is practically nonexistent here that fault surely lies with director <UNK> who's obviously nowhere near as good a director as harold <UNK> and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around br br the cast does what they can chevy chase <UNK> some form of life into the proceedings but it's simply not enough and the very funny eric <UNK> is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky <UNK> some potentially hilarious moments aren't played out to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly <UNK> all depictions of europeans are one dimensional and almost universally not funny at all like how the english are <UNK> polite br br apart from a few scenes there's hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick but if you're a chevy chase fan like myself the film is watchable but no more than that
<START> i knew i was going to see this when i saw the first preview dennis quaid was one reason but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me people talk about this as a movie for kids but i think it's a movie for baby <UNK> who are coming to terms with aging <UNK> parents our own <UNK> our kids growing up and leaving us and all the other things we never thought would happen to us br br the movie doesn't fall into the trap of tragedy it's about what living your dreams means when you have a real life br br quaid is too small for a <UNK> but he makes it look good and rachel <UNK> makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful layered performance the camera work is slow and sweet when they put this movie together they left out anything that wasn't necessary very nice
<START> this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west <UNK> and it stars <UNK> from the seinfeld show patrick <UNK> made his film debut in this contrived movie and he's <UNK> <UNK> here oliver reed got top billing but he's hardly in the film at all <UNK> plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men <UNK> on him because they all want to have sex with him <UNK> <UNK> plays an owner of a <UNK> and they're is so much nudity in the film if its not drunken <UNK> at the <UNK> then its the young wives having they're turn with him then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there's the bloody <UNK> no real political message like the film burn but just another contrived plot device to move the story along incredibly they made a sequel and <UNK> and all the rest of the cast came back i hope they got paid a lot of <UNK> because this first film is pretty bad the nudity keeps it watchable and <UNK> lack of any accent make it at times laughable very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel
<START> i love this tv series so much it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful i cant believe that they cut it off tv and also that i never found out whether <UNK> and <UNK> die or not apparently they survive but i'm not sure <UNK> was by far the best tv show ever i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so i'm really glad i got to watch it i <UNK> it so much 3 br br its about a women by the name of <UNK> she is not human she goes by adrian <UNK> a man teacher at a <UNK> now <UNK> is actually a women she is just disguised as a man in the day by night <UNK> <UNK> the city br br a guy by the name of von <UNK> is the one who created <UNK> and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture her br br if u have never watched it before u should totally <UNK> it it was the best tv show in the world why did they cut it off some people have issues but i'm glad i got to watch the 13 episodes
<START> what a fun filled sexy movie they certainly don't make them like this anymore 4 sexy <UNK> <UNK> arrive in london and have all sorts of sexual <UNK> the tone is oddly innocent as the considerable nudity <UNK> out of stock <UNK> situations rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters it is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant richard <UNK> sullivan literally gets <UNK> <UNK> the film certainly betrays the origins of the <UNK> feature as lying in the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> films of the old school my special interest in <UNK> pair girls' is that i am a huge fan of <UNK> drake if any actress has ever looked better naked she's slim but wonderfully <UNK> or <UNK> come to that i've loved her since the original run of <UNK> who else could carry off a purple wig i'll eat my hat
<START> i love horror movies i can even appreciate most cheese face it 9 out of 10 horror films these days are cheese but this was just ridiculous terrible acting terrible writing completely hollow and unbelievable characters no <UNK> actors here and a total lack of sufficient body count i wish i could salvage the <UNK> minutes of my life i just wasted at least the crook brothers are <UNK> named the only good thing about the whole film was watching the alicia <UNK> wanna be get <UNK> in the face how this ever made it to sundance is completely <UNK> to me most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic even by slasher film standards i mean come on who would rush out to get a cheap <UNK> 10 seconds after a creepy stalker guy just left their <UNK> lame
<START> this film concerns the story of eddy as mentioned in the title and his <UNK> to old friends in a <UNK> community the plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible but this is <UNK> as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized screenplays not always need be <UNK> but they should at least assist the development of the story here one line attempts such as he just took off or i know you don't have love in heart just do fully evoke something worth the audience's time also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music talk about trying to hard if you are interested in a good film the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you
<START> this is a good movie although people unfamiliar with the modesty blaise comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action for the modesty fan the movie will be very enjoyable particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the modesty blaise history peter <UNK> is listed in the credits as creative <UNK> and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years although the events have been <UNK> to modern days the only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no willie <UNK> in the story this lack of willie is again just being faithful to the modesty blaise <UNK> since the movie takes place in the very early days of <UNK> career alexandra <UNK> makes a very believable young modesty who actually looks a lot like modesty is supposed to look a welcome change from the travesty of the monica <UNK> portrayal of modesty
<START> i must say this movie has given me a <UNK> personality i've been told again and again to shut up and start speaking like a normal person but it's very hard no not the wang did you find that disgusting and <UNK> well get in the mood for a lot more this movie is just filthy it's not a film to show your grand parents but you should show it to a teenager or some immature guy at your <UNK> anyway back to the voice mannerisms fortunately this site has some ladies man did anyone at the studio notice that there's supposed to be a <UNK> between the e and s so you can always have a fine little something to say to your boss or the cops i have a sheet in my <UNK>
<START> at first i had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this that shots of fat people <UNK> etc were cheap shots in a way ok so he's doing diane <UNK> meets whatever but it wasn't long before i realized that this wasn't being done in a <UNK> way as the images unfold i felt that the problem was entirely the audience's we are <UNK> by hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something <UNK> something that ought not to be shown if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal however the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of <UNK> very <UNK> storytelling incredible performances and to think the scene was improvised that blonde guy is a genius actor finally i want to <UNK> those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a ok character that breaks that mold so don't <UNK> the film by <UNK> him yes his dog gets killed this ain't a <UNK> picture of the world but it's not completely hopeless anyway i felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all i wouldn't say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest but i say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it

<START> successful self made married businessman harry mitchell a superbly <UNK> performance by roy <UNK> has an <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> young stripper <UNK> the gorgeous kelly preston harry's <UNK> by a trio of <UNK> low life <UNK> sleazy porno theater manager <UNK> a <UNK> slimy john glover <UNK> strip joint owner leo well played by robert <UNK> and crazed <UNK> bobby shy a <UNK> intense clarence williams iii who have <UNK> his affair with <UNK> when harry refuses to pay up the <UNK> kill <UNK> and make it look like harry did it this in turn <UNK> a dangerous battle of wit and <UNK> between harry and the <UNK> director john <UNK> <UNK> a tough script based on <UNK> <UNK> gritty crime thriller novel expertly maintains a steady snappy pace delivers plenty of gripping tension and effectively creates a <UNK> <UNK> atmosphere the leads are all uniformly excellent with stand out supporting turns by ann <UNK> as harry's bitter neglected wife barbara vanity as <UNK> jaded prostitute <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as harry's loyal business partner jim <UNK> the <UNK> plot keeps viewers on their <UNK> throughout the <UNK> <UNK> dialogue <UNK> <UNK> glossy cinematography gary <UNK> stirring score the <UNK> amoral tone and the rousing conclusion are all likewise on the money as well as an added bonus both vanity and preston take their clothes off a very strong and satisfying little number that's well worth checking out
<START> as i watch this film it is interesting to see how much it <UNK> black men the film spends its time showing how <UNK> the most visible black man in it is save for an heroic moment for much of the film the other black men and dark skinned black women in the film are way in the background barely visible br br vanessa <UNK> character was strong and sympathetic the viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her there are also some fairly visible and three dimensional support characters who are light skinned and some white characters of some warmth and dignity but 99 of the black males in this film are nothing but invisible men <UNK> shadows in the background of no consequence such a horrible flaw but anything but unusual in the mainstream media
<START> this movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel the sets costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book this is the movie i think of when the mob is mentioned the suits the hats and the attitudes br br hoffman gives comic relief as <UNK> and you can't help but feel sorry for madonna as she tries and fails to win tracy over this movie contains all the classic mob clichés <UNK> people in <UNK> blowing up peoples cars <UNK> up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house br br this movie is a classic in ever sense of the word even camera angels cry out comic book its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as <UNK> and the hulk br br you have to see this movie
<START> they probably should have called this movie the map because the majority of the whole stupid film is <UNK> around a map of a cemetery not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are the only thing they show more than the map itself is the little <UNK> of sweat that is constantly building up on the <UNK> of our main character this of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the immortal hills cemetery come on now couldn't they have shown us just one of the death scenes we hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don't get to see anything some how i bury the living <UNK> to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone unless you have a deep fascination with <UNK> or sweat i recommend renting a better i movie such as i spit on your grave or i drink your blood
<START> moe and larry are newly <UNK> husbands having married <UNK> demanding sisters at his music studio <UNK> learns he will <UNK> a fortune if he marries someone himself br br husbands beware is a remake of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> widely considered by many to be one of the best <UNK> films with <UNK> the remake contains most of the footage from that film the new scenes shot may 17 1955 include the storyline of moe and larry marrying <UNK> sisters along with their cooking of a turkey laced with <UNK> a few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well a double for dee green was used if you blink you will miss the <UNK> appearance br br husbands beware would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters budget <UNK> coupled with fewer <UNK> for two reel comedies influenced the decision to use older footage br br although completely new films were still being made by the stooges most of their releases by 1955 <UNK> were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in husbands beware while one of these <UNK> is watchable and entertaining we get to see most of <UNK> <UNK> again and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film this film is one of the last <UNK> comedies to feature new footage of <UNK> and it was released six weeks after his death br br 7 out of 10
<START> this is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre action comedy <UNK> it resembles rush hour but completely lacks the action the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a stand up and as a talk show host but he just cannot act he is awful when he tries to act tough he barely manages to keep that trademark <UNK> off his face while saying his one liners which by the way aren't very funny and seeing him run even back then is not a pleasant sight in addition i have a feeling that pat <UNK> at least by today's standards doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the japanese don't even get me started about the story i give it a 2 out of 10
<START> this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time all of you who regard this movie as absolute sh t <UNK> are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer it shows us that real life and <UNK> action can produce a winning combination also as a romantic comedy it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as donald sutherland singing a song like they're going to find your <UNK> on a mountain on mars
<START> gene kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with mgm here he's at the top of his creative powers working with the arthur freed musical unit hard to believe when you watch an american in paris that the players never left the back lot at mgm br br the magic of an american in paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of vincent minnelli and the sets that mgm designed <UNK> with some background establishing shots the idea of the film <UNK> with kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving george <UNK> tone poem an american in paris it sounded good to arthur freed who approached ira gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other gershwin material br br gershwin got the kind of deal for gershwin music that irving berlin normally got not one note of non gershwin music is heard in an american in paris listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like <UNK> you and but not for me which are not real musical numbers br br another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics alan jay <UNK> wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one all about an ex <UNK> played by gene kelly who after world war ii never left france just settled into an apartment on the left bank and <UNK> to become a starving artist he lives with eccentric composer oscar <UNK> and does that ever sound like a <UNK> br br two women are interested in him another <UNK> american played by nina <UNK> who wants to <UNK> him as a painter if he'll <UNK> in other matters but kelly falls for a shop girl played by leslie caron in her film debut caron also has musical comedy star georges <UNK> interested in here br br of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of george gershwin an american in paris happens to be the first film i ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip i ever took i still remember flying back from phoenix arizona to kennedy airport seeing gene kelly doing i've got rhythm my favorite number in the film however is <UNK> la la which kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with oscar <UNK> playing the piano at one point kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano br br in a book about arthur freed i read a quote where he said in the american in paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the french <UNK> which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot so it happened that way kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in words and music the pirate and on the town but this one topped them all still does in my opinion and that includes some of gene kelly's later films br br in a surprise upset at the oscars an american in paris was chosen best picture for 1951 beating out the heavily <UNK> a <UNK> named desire i guess fantasy <UNK> realism that year big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well br br still an american in paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof something less likely to be repeated
<START> i've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life <UNK> what it takes to get into music school britney bashing etc etc so let's focus on the movie and the message br br i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years and for a family movie for the average adult male 2 out of 10 br br i like pop rock music i'm 45 i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews i didn't <UNK> her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any <UNK> <UNK> br br i watch movies to be entertained i don't care about casting lighting producers directors etc what is the movie and does it entertain me br br i watched this movie for the message the world's greatest <UNK> is low self <UNK> which is a whole other story so watched with the message in mind as that is an area of interest the movie is light bright and <UNK> great for kids i found the <UNK> <UNK> began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up don't give up message so <UNK> it was a bit predictable great message though should be more of them br br this movie is a great family movie but for a bloke watching by himself get <UNK>
<START> i saw the 7 5 imdb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented she said she had seen it before it's funny and sad i cried the first time i saw it she <UNK> maybe compared to other bollywood movies this deserves a 7 5 out of 10 but in comparison to all the other movies i have seen in my lifetime this deserves no more than a 3 any movie where i can <UNK> guess what is going to happen next is no good for me the characters are unbelievable how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived it is over dramatic and the songs aren't all that great my biggest problem with bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety all the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be <UNK> with an unnecessary song i think i understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song the stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary we get it <UNK> isn't the <UNK> tool in the shed if a movie tries to <UNK> tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just isn't meaningful just a bit embarrassing br br spoiler br br generally if someone has <UNK> stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told too many plot holes to count at first the movie was amusing and cute in the way bollywood movies are to people who don't watch them that <UNK> but it just got tedious it takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and <UNK> and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the <UNK> parts at the end br br spoiler over perhaps it had a very little more depth than other bollywood movies that i have seen but not much at all i spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny i didn't shed a single tear nor did i feel like it rather i was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending i don't recommend this movie if you want to watch something good i recommend it if you want to watch a bollywood movie that is kind of sad
<START> i do not watch much television and came across this show reality show i sure hope this is not for real if i was a man and had such a <UNK> and was married to someone so <UNK> it would be grounds for divorce i think she sets a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love that is one thing that is wrong with our world now so many people in bad relationships selfish and do not know the meaning of what it is to truly love another it is self <UNK> and not something that should be on <UNK> that does not give one a very good feeling to watch what should be in private <UNK> if his personality on the show is for real then he deserves someone much better that would show real true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is is this show a reality or made up for ratings i really would like to know sincerely <UNK>
<START> i'm not going to criticize the movie there isn't that much to talk about it has good animal actions scenes which were probably pretty astonishing at the time clyde beatty isn't exactly a <UNK> idol he's a little slight and not particularly good looking but that's ok he's the man in that lion cage we know that when he can't take the time away from his lions to tend to his girlfriend he will end up on an island with her and have to save the day someone said earlier that it is a history lesson the scenes at the circus are of another day especially the kids who hang around i didn't realize that even back in the thirties they <UNK> on three <UNK> <UNK> it looked like something out of <UNK> i guess that's the stock footage they had no wonder the thing got <UNK> they're always talking about <UNK> her up there's even a <UNK> it tells us a little about male female relationships at the time a kind of <UNK> silliness but if you don't take it too seriously you can have fun watching it
<START> i've tried to watch this so called comedy but it's very hard to bear this is a bad narrow minded cliché ridden movie <UNK> not funny but very much boring and annoying indeed bad script bad acting it's a complete waste of time and there remains nothing more to say i'm afraid br br 1 out of 10 points
<START> born again is a okay episode of season 1 the reincarnation bit in my opinion is cool the more i watch it the more i like it yet it will never rise above <UNK> <UNK> for me even though it is not very memorable i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode anyway now i will say what is good and bad about this episode br br the good <UNK> oh yeah br br that fish tank was nice br br thrown out of a window very classy x br br the bad marry your best friend's wife o o br br what a random pick to <UNK> br br why didn't the guy who died by having his <UNK> <UNK> up try to take his <UNK> off instead br br conclusion okay episode not very memorable 7 10
<START> one of the most interesting movies to be classified as <UNK> bakshi's <UNK> is a rich text full of wonderful insight he wrote it in collaboration with <UNK> man <UNK> and barry white who appear in the film as well the racist imagery can often be disturbing but the message of the movie was so powerful that the <UNK> gave it an <UNK> but only <UNK> br br i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the <UNK> atmosphere of racism that bakshi attempts to <UNK> wonderful stuff
<START> this movie was pretty absurd there was a few funny parts its goes right in to the bin of movies in my memory where i think hmm that movie had a few funny parts but overall pretty ridiculous plot or lack of br br i thought it seemed like ben was trying a little too hard to be a <UNK> funny guy and i didn't understand how he was a self made multi millionaire and still such an idiot anyways i like ben affleck he makes some crap but hey i can forgive him i mean i liked jersey girl i didn't think <UNK> was all his fault i like him overall i guess he's kinda like the kid you feel sorry for <UNK> he just can't seem to get it right br br my advice would be to avoid this flick it didn't really develop in to a <UNK> plot and catherine o'hara and jimmy g weren't used as well as they could have been they deserved better overall this movie is not home alone it's not a christmas story its not christmas vacation or any of the other classics forever forgettable
<START> i very nearly walked out but i'd paid my money and my nearly as disgusted friend wanted to hold out after the endearing wide eyed innocence of a new hope and the thrilling sophistication of the empire strikes back i remember awaiting return of the jedi with almost <UNK> anticipation but from the opening scene of this <UNK> commercial <UNK> i was <UNK> disappointed and <UNK> at lucas he should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have <UNK> <UNK> of shame in his cold greedy heart episode i would go on to <UNK> this fact your honor i call <UNK> <UNK> but please issue <UNK> <UNK> to the members of the jury first br br from the initial raising of the gate at <UNK> <UNK> this film was nothing more than a two plus hour commercial for as many <UNK> profit making action figures as lucas could <UNK> into it the pig like guards the hokey flesh <UNK> <UNK> that vile muppet pet of <UNK> the new and recycled <UNK> figures the monsters etc etc ad <UNK> then there were the <UNK> cute and <UNK> ewoks pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens fifteen seconds each on screen or less and the <UNK> just gotta have one for their collection the blatant exploitative financial <UNK> of children is nauseating br br lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot he just <UNK> the death star from a new hope and <UNK> in a <UNK> of cheap sentiment what an appalling slap in the face to his fans i can't shake the notion that lucas took a perverse pleasure in <UNK> this dreck on his fans i've got these <UNK> hooked so bad that i can <UNK> out the worst piece of <UNK> <UNK> garbage that i could dream up and they'll flock to the theaters to <UNK> it up plus all the <UNK> will <UNK> and torture their parents until they buy the <UNK> a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that i stuffed in and i get a cut from every single one it'll make me even more <UNK> rich br br there may have been a <UNK> partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip off i seem to recall that harrison ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this <UNK> but whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are <UNK> <UNK> by the offensive <UNK> that lucas so <UNK> <UNK> in this total absolute sell out to profit
<START> growing up in nyc in the late 80's early 90's club scene i can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering that place in this time period no madonna did not come up with the idea of <UNK> but this is where she got it from instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights <UNK> allowed people to fight within the confines of everything short of touching each other which would warrant an automatic <UNK> seeing these kind of extraordinarily talented well <UNK> throw downs in the <UNK> was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from back in the day are here pepper la <UNK> paris <UNK> <UNK> etc all <UNK> in the likes of such period pieces as <UNK> <UNK> song deep in <UNK> it didn't matter who you were or where you were from because when you walked through those doors into this magic kingdom of sorts you became part of something bigger than yourself you were important and most importantly the creation of your own moves and imagination and anybody from anywhere could become king or queen as the case may have been the words and wit were just as sharp as the moves on the floor all of the tension excitement and magic of that very urban nyc energy is captured in this film brilliant please release on dvd for the world to see thank you
<START> i rented this film about a month ago when i had nothing else to do on a friday night all i can say to describe this worthless film is <UNK> the acting is so badly done i've seen kids in high school do a better job the whole cast seems like they're just reading their lines out no feeling no emotion and no room to capture the viewer on another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack br br the clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover heck he doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters there is no real murder shown either so this isn't a real slasher film either since i've seen it i've <UNK> a few things 1 if is <UNK> insane clown <UNK> wouldn't that be a serial killer who kills <UNK> 2 if your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her sad really br br 3 why is it that the only real acting <UNK> <UNK> out at the end all of a sudden did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs this film is as sad as they come my advice is to avoid renting it <UNK> you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming
<START> no one is a greater fan of <UNK> macdonald <UNK> <UNK> papers than i am br br i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash since i also see he had made the three four <UNK> with <UNK> which i though turned out rather well br br not so royal flash br br i was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the <UNK> papers published up to that time and was <UNK> with a clockwork orange and malcolm <UNK> i still am but he was never really given a chance after that br br what a disappointment i saw it once again when i was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse br br none of the sharp dialogue in the books is <UNK> to the screen the comedy of <UNK> character seemed to me to have been <UNK> in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do the <UNK> and <UNK> was awful and <UNK> br br looking back with more mature eyes the film failed <UNK> to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of <UNK> br br if you have read the book and not seen the film i can only say that the film ends with <UNK> and <UNK> von <UNK> becoming fast friends and playing a game <UNK> has just invented russian <UNK> br br a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about br br my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently but i am glad i have not br br if by any chance <UNK> ever reads this i can only say i think he is a genius perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation but based on my appreciation of that <UNK> of work it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films
<START> <UNK> <UNK> love crimes is an important film dealing with the dark side of female sexuality and including full frontal female nudity which sure beats the male kind it <UNK> with <UNK> and the captive falling in love with <UNK> theory br br this treatment of feminine <UNK> is sometimes shallow and jerky but <UNK> has <UNK> well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their <UNK> lust br br one striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses when the antagonist a <UNK> fashion photographer is <UNK> an older woman wearing <UNK> by asking her to show how she rides a horse he <UNK> a riding crop between her legs <UNK> it against her <UNK> and this greatly <UNK> her excitement br br then suddenly he leaves her home and she <UNK> <UNK> at the closed door br br patrick <UNK> plays the con artist and though he falls a long distance from handsome he picks on plain <UNK> and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line by all reports sean young proves a weird person and she is <UNK> beautiful yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long <UNK> <UNK> body and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> disjointed movement <UNK> into erotic fascination her performance is <UNK> and complex br br <UNK> possesses an intriguing <UNK> and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern <UNK> <UNK> i truly appreciate
<START> the poster who called this <UNK> and pointless literally took the words i would have used in my subject line the only thing i'd add is <UNK> for a film made by a real life married couple and featuring lots of graphic sex scenes this movie manages to make what should be a <UNK> situation into one beyond ice cold dafoe and <UNK> look bored during the sex scenes and the viewer might as well take a <UNK> and have done with it also please the women in the audience have seen way too many used <UNK> in their time and any guy who is turned on by seeing willem dafoe pull a bloody <UNK> out of his wife's <UNK> really needs to get therapy br br i think the key to the film if there is one is the restaurant scene where a <UNK> explains to the <UNK> sleepy eyed dafoe what a <UNK> <UNK> is all the ingredients of the dish still separate rather than <UNK> together this movie is a <UNK> thriller all the elements are there spooky isolated house dead <UNK> creepy <UNK> on the score weirdo caretaker who comes and goes as he <UNK> auto accident deaths and near deaths characters with a secret past basically every thriller cliché you can think of but nothing comes together everything just sits there and never <UNK> into a coherent plot or even an artsy mood piece at the restaurant dafoe passes on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of this mess would do well to leave this <UNK> thriller on the video store shelf
<START> in my opinion this has to be one of barbara <UNK> best performances she was one of only a handful of actors then and now who could say more with a single look than an entire page of dialogue and i was lucky enough to see the original and <UNK> movie with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage too bad the movie is so short lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in his illegal <UNK> her only link to anything is her good friend <UNK> played wonderfully by <UNK> harris though <UNK> is african american and having a white woman be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was as controversial as the subject matter of this movie and lily is not they have a special bond and it is not sexual just 2 women stuck or shoved into a situation beyond their control after <UNK> father dies and she does not know what she will do she is told that she has the power to get out and to get what she wants yes it's <UNK> but that's the entire point of this movie then they had to go and ruin the last few minutes so up until the last few minutes of the movie it's a superb film and worth watching the lesson of the movie is still as valid today as it was back then and i'm sure will be a 100 years from now women it's awful what lily does in order to get what she wants but it works men take note

<START> in 1976 i had just moved to the us from <UNK> i was 23 and had been married for a little over three years and was beginning to come out as a lesbian i saw this movie on an old black and white tv with terrible reception alone and <UNK> in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story i was living in a small house in <UNK> arizona and it was <UNK> like everyone else here i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth and its <UNK> of fragile magic and i have <UNK> a hope that i would see it again someday i'll keep checking in i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley <UNK> 'the other side of <UNK> it also has some of the same <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> jeremy northam struggles against a total recall clone script and <UNK> romantic by play to bring life to a confused character lucy liu <UNK> her acting from a wooden start to a <UNK> like finish you can't fail to laugh when viewing her interviews on the dvd when she uses the term femme fatal and romance french film noir actress she is not and they lack chemistry together br br this movie fails not in the plot or the action sequences but in the lack of attention to detail in the films photography and ham <UNK> portrayal of the world of technology surrounding the main protagonists little attempt is made to dress the scenery to represent any <UNK> <UNK> landscape or period <UNK> are very 1990's and the architecture barely modern with open plans that hint at a <UNK> budget rather than conscious set dressing techniques br br the technology is positively hilarious massive 2001 a space odyssey <UNK> fed by man <UNK> cd <UNK> with data <UNK> for some unexplained reason in spite of the <UNK> <UNK> network that even the most un <UNK> <UNK> today would obviously be aware there is an obvious lack of research done here and given the open source nature of the <UNK> community research would have cost little more than a <UNK> board and personal time br br dvd interviews also reveal the original movie name was company man but this likely <UNK> in order to cash in on matrix hype the cypher title has only the slightest link with the movie terry gilliam would have done wonders with this concept and completely re written the <UNK> br br this is <UNK> movie quality and extremely disappointing for a movie length production it might have made a good sub plot for <UNK>
<START> this has to be one of the worst movies of all time the graphics were horrendous the acting was b movie and the effects were just plain <UNK> 64 <UNK> you would think that they would put a little more effort into it of course it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate but this one takes the cake hell i'm still laughing so as a shake your head in disbelief movie this one does well br br although it appears to have some <UNK> actors and actresses in this it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort br br the graphics might have been good in the <UNK> or even early <UNK> but come on this is 2009 i wont give spoilers out let's just say that if you have played jurassic park on the <UNK> 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this film br br it is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
<START> the groove tube was initially shown on video in the first video theaters here in boston in one room there were tv <UNK> on high stands with old movie theater seats in small groups facing the <UNK> there were old <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> of york <UNK> <UNK> in a second smaller room there were no seats just large <UNK> that was the <UNK> room i e people got high in there that act only added to the hilarity of the video br br i was a <UNK> <UNK> the scenes i liked most and remember to this day are <UNK> the clown the <UNK> family kitchen <UNK> easy <UNK> <UNK> safety sam <UNK> <UNK> the chevy chase <UNK> w nude runs through the woods the finger ballet on what was eventually revealed to be the nude body of a woman the last item was very reminiscent of the late incredible ernie <UNK> now i've lost a lot of readers that are under 48 who is ernie <UNK> but trust me it's funny stuff br br one reason i was a <UNK> <UNK> was that i and my friends would bring other groove tube <UNK> to see it we would sit and <UNK> watch the faces of the <UNK> as the safety sam <UNK> would play as the camera slowly <UNK> in on sam we would wait for that oh of recognition on the <UNK> face each time was more hilarious than the last and then that <UNK> would then bring a friend to see the show repeating what we had done to get this joke you must watch the video br br yes some of it is dated but most plays film television and now videos are just look at any video made in the 1980's br br i did see the groove tube in a theater as a film a grainy transfer from the original video it had been cut and was missing some of the original high point scenes br br the first saturday night live show featuring chevy chase <UNK> instant remarks of that's the guy from the groove tube so it was a <UNK> for chevy br br i can't look at a can of <UNK> without hearing the voice over coat your hands with a generous amount of <UNK> easy <UNK> <UNK> and thinking of the <UNK> holiday <UNK> recipe always gets me laughing in the <UNK> needs <UNK> in the <UNK> store br br the early 70's were <UNK> times the groove tube was fresh new and really <UNK> the humor of the times it offered a <UNK> <UNK> humor that wasn't available in any other format medium <UNK>
<START> some of the background details of this story are based very very loosely on real events of the era in which this was placed the story combines some of the details of the famous leopold and <UNK> case along with a bit of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the story begins with two mothers shelley winters and debbie reynolds being <UNK> as they leave a courtroom the crowd seems most intent on doing them <UNK> harm as their sons were just convicted of a <UNK> thrill crime one person in the crowd apparently <UNK> <UNK> hand as they make their way to a waiting car br br soon after they arrive home they begin getting threatening phone calls so reynolds suggests they both move to the west coast together and open a dance school the dance school is s success and they <UNK> to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next shirley temple one of the parents of these spoiled kids is a <UNK> who is quite smitten with reynolds and they begin dating life appears very good but when the threatening phone calls begin again winters responds by flipping out behaving like she's <UNK> a psychotic break and she <UNK> further and further into religion listening on the radio to <UNK> <UNK> almost constantly again and again you see winters on edge and it ultimately <UNK> in very bad things i won't say more as it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting film br br in many ways this film is a lot like the bette davis and joan crawford horror films of the 1960s like whatever happened to baby jane straight jacket and the <UNK> while none of these are exactly intellectual fare on a <UNK> level they are immensely entertaining and fun the writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it all very exciting winters is great as a fragile and demented lady and reynolds plays one of the <UNK> <UNK> year olds i've ever seen plus she can really really dance br br my only concern about all this is that some might find <UNK> hyper <UNK> in the film a bit tacky like a cheap attack on christianity at first i felt that way but when you meet sister <UNK> she seems sincere and is not <UNK> so i took <UNK> religious <UNK> as just a sign of <UNK> which i assume is all that was intended br br by the way this film is <UNK> along with whoever slew <UNK> <UNK> another shelley winters horror film from 1971 both are great fun and quite over the top
<START> it takes a serbian or at least a <UNK> <UNK> to understand and enjoy many of the situations characters and jokes of <UNK> as well as of many other films of kusturica see for example the opening scenes with the remote village in the serbian mountains with the low tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants the nostalgia for the good days of the communist rule and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the soviet <UNK> kusturica not only tries to <UNK> from the tragic history of <UNK> described in his previous movies but creates a whole world of himself in the process br br this is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case it's a fun film before all kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies his style is direct and grotesque we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same the space he develops <UNK> present history and magic and the colours seem to be of a <UNK> <UNK> of modern cinema br br this is not a perfect film either the principal flaw is the length some editing and <UNK> would have been useful as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and <UNK> show up it is yet one of the most catching amusing moving films that i have seen lately
<START> if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about however there is not much tension and <UNK> mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy br br <UNK> <UNK> much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear the production felt rushed and holes are apparent it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort the book is probably better br br one thing is certain <UNK> must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort
<START> during the early 1980's kurt thomas was something of a hero in the united states inevitably men in his position get offered film roles that exist solely to capitalize on that i have no idea what thomas was paid to make this film but i would have to be paid a big heap of money to agree to make a national fool of myself in a motion picture the film is obviously derived from enter the dragon as are most martial arts pictures only instead of a real martial art they <UNK> an absurd new martial art accurately described by one critic as a cross between kung fu and break dancing a <UNK> thomas of course is hired to rescue some lady from an <UNK> <UNK> yet every room has a prop that is exactly what thomas needs to kick the assistant baddies of course he fights his way to the lead villain and of course they have a fancy <UNK> fight with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a <UNK> arts film there are touches which nostalgic types will like particularly the <UNK> <UNK> of thomas and many of the male co stars have but the only reason to watch this film is if you have a grudge against kurt thomas who now wishes he had never set foot on the film set
<START> as i've noticed with a lot of imdb comments certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have <UNK> intelligent plots that <UNK> in there own <UNK> i am not one of those people if i watch an action film i want to see explosions <UNK> and <UNK> if i watch a comedy i want to have tears of laughter in my eyes you get the idea therefore watching a horror film i primarily want to be scared the grudge is a very scary film in both it's well executed <UNK> scenes and it's creepy imagery i've been a horror film fan for many years and i'm talking about the masters such as <UNK> <UNK> rather than directors of some of the <UNK> teen horror flicks that are <UNK> out these days if you want to be scared watch this film way scarier than the original japanese <UNK> which i also think is a great film
<START> a super comedy series from the 1990s two series were made in total that suffered in the uk ratings due to poor <UNK> when you are up against established comedies like <UNK> even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get noticed br br luckily i caught the series from episode one and followed it <UNK> i mentioned it to friends and family at the time but everyone seemed to have been watching something else very very frustrating br br anyway i loved both series and never forgot it br br then i looked it up on the internet and found that an ultra fan was trying to get both series released <UNK> his <UNK> br br well both series are now available on dvd br br http www <UNK> co uk joking apart <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is probably the first entry in the lance <UNK> nurse <UNK> detective series in subsequent <UNK> films he was played by much younger actors than guy <UNK> br br a group of relatives all played by well known character actors <UNK> in an old house on a rainy <UNK> of course to speak to a wealthy relative who goes into a coma br br while they wait for him to recover all sorts of mysterious goings on happen including a couple of murders br br a creepy film worth seeing
<START> i actually felt bad for the actors in this thing no doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job the actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film it certainly was not besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable the one about the remote control didn't even make any sense to bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch br br i'm all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer i only watched it because of some good comments posted here they must have been planted by people with ties to the film you may fool people into watching this but you can't fool them into liking what they saw br br i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming sure it failed miserably but it tried i <UNK> 1 s for the worst of the worst br br do yourself a favor and skip this <UNK> i wish i had

<START> <UNK> a chinese girl who speaks czech invited us to screening of a czech movie with english subtitles in the department of visual and <UNK> studies <UNK> it was the first time i saw <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> 2000 and it was pretty good br br much like in many other czech movies the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult dirty life the web <UNK> that this theme was popular among the u s movies in the early 1990s their relationships are breaking up combining and <UNK> another typical feature of the czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a <UNK> positive character either also you can see how the characters judge the features of others depending on the context that's a very realistic feature of the movie's psychological analysis br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters nevertheless you learn that he has only studied <UNK> to prove how much he loved another woman <UNK> he is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses up as a <UNK> to get into <UNK> parents' house a house that he repeatedly burns br br meanwhile <UNK> has a very mixed relationship with her parents she just decides by <UNK> up a <UNK> to break up with <UNK> who works in a private radio station <UNK> does not view her parents' <UNK> life as a good example but seems rather <UNK> in creating a better environment but she is a very <UNK> figure as far as the type of her boyfriends go br br for a while <UNK> seems to have serious plans with <UNK> an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be rather <UNK> by the drugs however the friends from his band inform <UNK> that he already has another girlfriend <UNK> is disappointed and returns to her parents br br when <UNK> and <UNK> break up it is organized by robert a <UNK> who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of ordinary czech people to japanese tourists robert who also provides <UNK> with marijuana is never serious about anything and he usually sleeps with many different women eventually his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depression br br <UNK> a <UNK> word for spring who came to <UNK> from <UNK> works as a <UNK> and you won't learn whether she came to <UNK> in order to see her dad or <UNK> she seems pretty confused but sometimes helps the other characters from their problems br br <UNK> works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job a job that he eventually loses he <UNK> to his audience that he broke up with <UNK> which is how <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> learns about the news that make him very happy br br finally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wife <UNK> is always ready to forgive him and <UNK> their marriage even after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> asks a magician to make him disappear so that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> can try to capture <UNK> again the magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of an important car accident <UNK> and <UNK> bring the victim to the hospital and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> saves his life <UNK> also works for the travel agency as a <UNK> and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for 20 or so japanese tourists who are shooting their movies during <UNK> parents' dinner br br the seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if <UNK> were smaller by four orders of <UNK> given the actual size of the czech capital it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people but it is fun
<START> i love bed <UNK> and <UNK> so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time i have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it i would also like to <UNK> the simple fact that i love it so much too much some have said i have 27 copies on video and i love them all equally i also love anyone else who loves it i love you my favourite scene is the dance scene at <UNK> road i have learned the dance moves and practice it everyday i have some audio <UNK> of myself singing the song if anyone can play the drums or guitar i am thinking of <UNK> a bed <UNK> and <UNK> band i hope to call it 'the <UNK> love me liz
<START> i usually try to be professional and <UNK> when i criticize movies but my god this was the worst movie i have ever seen bad acting bad effects bad script bad everything br br the plot follows a group of teen <UNK> on their way to a rave that takes place in broad daylight at a remote island however when the group arrives all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party goers the clan <UNK> off on a mission through a zombie <UNK> forest during this <UNK> they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids they also meet up with jonathan <UNK> and some other survivors basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the house of the dead this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence redundant clips from the <UNK> video game and sloppy matrix <UNK> camera <UNK> one of the character's even <UNK> to sacrifice himself to save the others why not because he was noble and brave but because part of his face got <UNK> by acid a zombie <UNK> on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy br br to sum it all up there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen and i'm sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh t could easily cover the costs it took to make it grade f
<START> stephen king is generally known for the morbid and that's fine but this story is too morbid some movies by the end you feel sad for the characters or the situations they were put through here you just feel depressed the movie has a nice feel to it at first with the family moving to the country and creepy old fred <UNK> <UNK> and warning them of the pet cemetery but this plot leads nowhere it starts with so much potential but by the end it loses the potential to be a good horror movie and becomes corny extremely stupid and ultimately depressing br br louis <UNK> <UNK> his wife rachel denise crosby their kids <UNK> and gage and their cat move to a new home in <UNK> they are warned by the loony farmer neighbor <UNK> fred <UNK> about the local pet cemetery and how it is cursed louis thinks nothing of this and <UNK> fine until the family cat is killed he <UNK> it in the cursed cemetery and it comes back to life constantly <UNK> at the family and wanting to be left alone one day <UNK> gage runs out in the road and is run over and killed by a truck and louis knows he must bury him in the cemetery when gage comes back to life he is changed and wants to murder br br with many of stephen king's works that don't translate well into films i blame the directors and screenwriters in this case mr king was the screenwriter but i'm going to blame him for his awful story by the end it's so pointless and though unfunny the premise is laughable a little boy comes back from the dead and manages to kill people with what looks like a tiny <UNK> and not only that but he manages to lift their bodies and in one case carry a body from the ground to the attic i know this isn't set in reality but seriously how stupid can this get the scene where louis <UNK> his deceased now living again cat to kill it is strangely sad because the cat did not deserve this all it did was go around <UNK> it's own business and he killed it the scene where he <UNK> his own <UNK> son is almost unbearable not <UNK> sad but the whole situation is just awful to think of after being <UNK> gage <UNK> <UNK> around before falling down dead why did they need to make a movie ending with the death of an <UNK> but even worse the actual ending of them film involving louis <UNK> someone else not going to give away who in the cemetery after gage kills them what did he expect why did mr king write this horrible story and why was it made into a movie it's depressing and pointless br br my rating out of 90 mins r for violence
<START> in the history of movies based on comic books mystery men is one of the most underrated ones this is no regular comic superhero movie it follows the exploits of a <UNK> crew of well meaning <UNK> which include mr furious played by ben stiller the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> william h macy the blue <UNK> hank <UNK> and the <UNK> paul <UNK> mystery men spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like superman or batman such as the <UNK> <UNK> and the questions about secret identities most of the <UNK> aren't <UNK> like bruce wayne but blue collar types with <UNK> jobs and neurotic home lives so it looks as if director <UNK> <UNK> is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to i found mystery men to be visually stimulating and very funny even if it doesn't turn into a franchise it's still a joy to watch
<START> i rented i am curious yellow from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967 i also heard that at first it was <UNK> by u s customs if it ever tried to enter this country therefore being a fan of films considered controversial i really had to see this for myself br br the plot is centered around a young swedish drama student named lena who wants to learn everything she can about life in particular she wants to focus her <UNK> to making some sort of documentary on what the average <UNK> thought about certain political issues such as the vietnam war and race issues in the united states in between asking politicians and ordinary <UNK> of <UNK> about their opinions on politics she has sex with her drama teacher classmates and married men br br what kills me about i am curious yellow is that 40 years ago this was considered pornographic really the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno while my <UNK> mind find it shocking in reality sex and nudity are a major <UNK> in swedish cinema even <UNK> bergman arguably their answer to good old boy john ford had sex scenes in his films br br i do <UNK> the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in america i am curious yellow is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and <UNK> no pun intended of swedish cinema but really this film doesn't have much of a plot
<START> this episode is certainly different than all the other <UNK> though some of the details are still there the setup is completely different that makes this columbo unique and interesting to watch even though at times you might wish for the old columbo i liked it a lot but then i like almost any columbo
<START> another cult strikes again this isn't a spoiler because the real ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly long pseudo scientific <UNK> <UNK> school of enlightenment br br when any religion philosophy needs to hide behind an oz like screen of <UNK> i walk away thank <UNK> i watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a friend to have wasted precious resources on this new age <UNK> would have been tragic i can only hope that they truly believe they can walk on water enough to take that <UNK> to it's logical conclusion in other words walk <UNK> or shut up as a movie it deserves a strong 1 on it's entertainment value especially for creating the most <UNK> character in film history the <UNK> roommate <UNK> if you must see this film borrow it from one of the <UNK> folks who recommended it
<START> never even knew this movie existed until i found an old vhs copy of it hidden deep in my dusty horror closet the title on the box said <UNK> and the <UNK> on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80's horror movie they can surely be fun of course as long as don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you're not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make up effects just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is <UNK> here in blue monkey the plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal the acting performances are painful to observe and there's a total lack of suspense following the always popular trend of big bug movies blue monkey handles about a new and unknown <UNK> species that <UNK> out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital the makers couldn't be more <UNK> about the actual origin of this <UNK> over sized <UNK> all we know is that it's not from outer space and it initially <UNK> out of a <UNK> plant other than this there's absolutely no explanation for where this new type of <UNK> all of a sudden comes from like i said don't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay the first half of the film is entertaining enough with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters an 80 year old blind and alcoholic lady but the second half when the entire hospital is put to <UNK> is dreadfully boring it is also near the end that blue monkey begins to <UNK> rip off older and better films approaching the climax they apparently ran out of budget as well since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isn't very well <UNK> anymore blue monkey is worth a <UNK> in case you're really bored or if you really want to see every 80's horror movie ever made fans of b cinema may recognize john <UNK> killer <UNK> from outer space <UNK> in the small and meaningless role of roger who's in charge of the clinic
<START> does anyone happen to know where this film was shot the <UNK> scene on the cliff is beautiful it appears to be england however <UNK> apartment building certainly looks like the <UNK> building with its fascinating <UNK> br br charles <UNK> is listed as playing sir charles gage maybe i <UNK> but i never saw him perhaps he was the husband's lawyer but again i don't recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call perhaps he was in the <UNK> scene or the ballroom scene did anyone spot him br br herbert marshall was <UNK> years old when he shot this film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a pleasant episode with a few faults the first thing about the episode is that it takes place near mountain home air force base in <UNK> <UNK> season one's <UNK> <UNK> takes place near <UNK> air base also in <UNK> <UNK> i'm wondering if the air force <UNK> are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> have some good dialog always a plus ed <UNK> the <UNK> keeper reminds me of <UNK> old school teachers they must have liked children at one time you just can't imagine how just like he must have cared more for animals at one point i liked the concept of the episode but i felt it had some inconsistencies if aliens are so <UNK> at <UNK> humans and returning them safely why can't they put the animal back in the right place and the aliens are just now having problems returning the animals i don't buy <UNK> theory of a problem with the space time <UNK> as if he's an expert on that i also thought <UNK> <UNK> performance as <UNK> <UNK> was not well done besides those <UNK> i still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens <UNK> animal <UNK> as well as human <UNK>
<START> what in god's name happened here how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap <UNK> of redneck zombies was zombie <UNK> ever supposed to entertain someone anyone or even make a dollars profit but mainly what happened here br br zombie <UNK> extreme <UNK> was directed by a lunatic by the name of <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> in earth shattering gore films such as <UNK> of gore and <UNK> 2000 and some of which contain profanity in the titles in the gore department this one isn't much different than the rest although the level of <UNK> well earth shattering br br zombie <UNK> extreme <UNK> is as bad as peter jackson's dead alive is gory think about it br br getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time an accident involving <UNK> causes the dead to come back and eat the living never has the concept been treated in such a manner the gore effects are a whole new low just a z grade nightmare i can't tell whether or not this was originally meant to be funny somehow i doubt the english dubbing was being very true to the original script but stranger things have happened the whole thing just reminds me of a shot on video introduction to a troma movie except it lasts a hell of a lot longer br br i've seen only one film that was worse than this the <UNK> br br for proof that <UNK> <UNK> is an actual director i would highly recommend <UNK> the <UNK> if you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie give extreme <UNK> a try but you've been warned it takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through but if gore is all you're here for then you might be able to stomach this one other than that no atmosphere no and i mean no budget no entertainment value but mostly no pride show some pride <UNK> 1 10 br br updated 7 5 <UNK> after a few more viewings of zombie <UNK> i've had a change of heart or i guess i just get it now zombie <UNK> is hilarious so <UNK> the harsh words although extreme <UNK> still only deserves one star
<START> this is a hard boiled warner brothers film starring a very young barbara stanwyck a <UNK> master at portraying <UNK> cool a technique she <UNK> eleven years later in billy <UNK> double <UNK> stanwyck plays lily powers the well worn daughter of a violent <UNK> owner in a <UNK> steel town she has been rendered cynical and <UNK> by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her father's customers once her father dies in a <UNK> explosion she <UNK> a <UNK> train to new york and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bank br br this would come across as preposterous were it not for <UNK> blazing work here with her dead eyed stare and amoral seduction methods it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive <UNK> one of the young men she <UNK> along the way is a fresh faced john wayne as of all things an <UNK> named jimmy mccoy the melodrama gets heavy handed toward the last third of the film with a murder suicide a <UNK> <UNK> job in paris to keep lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to lily that he <UNK> company <UNK> to keep her in luxury a tacked on ending is somewhat disappointing but not before stanwyck <UNK> the screen the film has curious touches like <UNK> bonding friendship with an african american woman named <UNK> and the german immigrant who teaches lily about <UNK> philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality
<START> judy <UNK> struck gold in 1950 <UNK> george <UNK> film version of born yesterday and from that point forward her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold again br br it never happened in it should happen to you i can't think of a <UNK> title by the way <UNK> does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde who's maybe not so dumb after all but everything about this movie feels <UNK> over and half hearted even jack lemmon in what i believe was his first film role can't <UNK> up enough energy to <UNK> this recycled comedy the audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch up br br maybe if you're <UNK> of <UNK> you'll enjoy this otherwise i wouldn't bother br br grade c
<START> my left foot is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of christy brown an artist who was crippled with cerebral <UNK> and learned to paint with his left foot the only <UNK> in his body he had control over daniel day lewis won his first oscar as best actor for this film which i'm not absolutely certain was deserved but is still noteworthy day lewis give brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch brenda <UNK> as <UNK> devoted mother also won an oscar for a believable and touching role my problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times when brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot the film can be difficult to watch this gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time however if you look beyond that you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have <UNK> and other difficulties to overcome those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties we can certainly do the same thing well made occasionally enjoyable but difficult to watch may not be for everyone but not bad at all br br out of
<START> my god was this the run lola run adaptation of <UNK> it was horrible bad enough that the screenwriter and i use the term very loosely cut and <UNK> dialogue from one character onto another often completely out of context and to rush the story along but anne elliott running from location to location in pursuit of <UNK> near the end of the piece was an abomination austen must be spinning in her grave no respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious fashion and the actress that played mary horrors needless to say if the rest of the austen remakes are this bad they will be turning off a new generation of <UNK> br br if you want to see an impeccable version of this otherwise wonderful novel get the 1995 roger <UNK> directed version starring amanda root whose expressions alone can speak volumes and <UNK> <UNK> it is superb
<START> what is love what is this longing in our hearts for <UNK> is it not the <UNK> flower does not this flower of love have the <UNK> <UNK> of fine fine <UNK> does not the wind love the dirt is not love not unlike the unlikely not it is <UNK> to are you with someone tonight do not question your love take your lover by the hand release the power within yourself your heard me release the power tame the wild <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> heaven with one intimate <UNK> that's right don't be shy whip out everything you got and do it in the butt by leon <UNK> when tim meadows created his quintessential snl playboy leon <UNK> i <UNK> hearing his smarmy <UNK> and <UNK> comments made my remote <UNK> with outrage i employed the click feature more than once dear readers br br so when the film version of the ladies man came on cable i <UNK> a few comments of my own and <UNK> yet again but there comes the day gray and <UNK> when nothing is on any of the 100 channels sigh yes  i was faced with every cable <UNK> torment  watch it or turn my tv off there he was leon <UNK> <UNK> and making me laugh what had happened had i <UNK> to hollywood's <UNK> <UNK> sit com humor was i that desperate to avoid <UNK> my sacred throne the truth of the matter is i like the ladies man more than i should a story about a vulgar playboy <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> at every female form goes against my feminist sensibilities br br what began as a crude snl skit <UNK> before my eyes into a tale about leon and his playboy philosophy going through life helping people solve their sexual conflicts i am the mother <UNK> of <UNK> he <UNK> informs julie <UNK> parsons his friend and long suffering producer of his radio show the ladies man and he's not kidding leaving a string of broken hearts and angry spirits leon manages to bed and breakfast just about all of chicago that he does so with such genuine good will is his calling card through life br br our self <UNK> expert in the ways of love manages to get himself into a lot of trouble with husbands and boyfriends one such <UNK> <UNK> lance will ferrell forms a victims of the smiling ass usa club <UNK> to catch our lovable don juan oh yes we will have our revenge he <UNK> to his <UNK> in a show stopping dance number br br plus it's such a total delight to see billy dee williams as lester the <UNK> owner and smooth narrator of <UNK> odyssey to find his sweet thing and a pile of cash where has he been hiding but would i choose this movie as my <UNK> day choice <UNK> search for the easy life changes him in so many profound ways that i had to give the nod to our ladies man that he can at the movie's close find true happiness with one woman while still offering his outlandish advice is the stuff of dreams
<START> for some reason various young couples <UNK> through the italian <UNK> split up to see who can reach their <UNK> <UNK> first james gregory lee <UNK> enters a cave finds a <UNK> of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of <UNK> when he puts on a helmet <UNK> to the corpse he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and <UNK> off their limbs to add to some <UNK> to bring the undead <UNK> back to life this shot on digital full moon release is stupid senseless has terrible acting and sound and the los angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy however it's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance whether bug eyed running around in cheap looking armor <UNK> a sword or <UNK> neurotic latin <UNK> about demons and <UNK> <UNK> ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed oh well at least he's not boring like most of the rest of the cast
<START> what keeps us going or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether <UNK> has done the dirty deed without spoiling so much of course there is a red <UNK> and a twist but then we discover that this is the story of <UNK> <UNK> and his difficulty in <UNK> when there is the revelation we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick perverted <UNK> that we're <UNK> to have in mind one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof these problems of course are given their denouement in the film's shocking finale br br this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear they were <UNK> obviously because they aren't partial to central location films although there is a bit of travelling when we get to the woods and the beach and we realize that <UNK> isn't as clever as we are made to think he is br br the <UNK> is 5 5
<START> everyone in the cast from <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> is someone we know in everyday life they were so natural and <UNK> transformation is incredibly believable the score is so moving it brought me to tears the choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic <UNK> <UNK> dancing and charm gave me <UNK> <UNK> is such a wonderfully delightful character you can almost see the <UNK> <UNK> in her face as she <UNK> about seeing the king and i <UNK> character is both hilarious and pitiful <UNK> is so <UNK> natural as the <UNK> wife you almost want to hug her to <UNK> her that everything will be all right br br this film is truly a keeper
<START> this movie is ridiculous anyone saying the acting is great and the casting is superb have never seen even mediocre cinema the acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet lame i feel like all the other <UNK> comments must have been made by people associated with the filmmakers i was not very impressed by the storyline but just wanted to see some beautiful <UNK> countryside and there was some decent cinematography but the casting was anything but inspired i think this movie also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in the <UNK> culture has been ignored and perhaps lost and that <UNK> it is worthwhile and possible it places jokes in the wrong and all too obvious places and makes me think it was written by the state department or something back to the drawing board to even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same <UNK> of classics like harold and <UNK> is absolutely retarded and along the same line of begging and <UNK> and joking as is rampant in this film
<START> as you may or may not have heard there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film one may then ask why the title suggested such a thing but really it's kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either there was absolutely no story or plot just things happening the acting was incredibly bad worse than <UNK> commercials bad br br not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but i think there was only one scene with zombies even in it their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl the scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a <UNK> <UNK> i'm not kidding but they used chainsaw sound effects br br this was undoubtedly the <UNK> movie i've ever seen in my life the only <UNK> that i wouldn't totally <UNK> every person responsible for production of this film is if i learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year <UNK> br br really though even with all of the criticism i offer here i'd suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever and because of this is quite comical even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained
<START> and rent a good horror movie it's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been <UNK> to perfection in movies like scream and scary movie br br in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written stupid we're going to the prom junk i wanted to claw my ears off honestly the hills has better dialog br br there really was no need to make this movie leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking her really guy is obsessed with her really br br all the characters act in stupid ways including the police cover the place in teams of 2 front and back not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be <UNK> br br the serial killer just <UNK> about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem no resistance from victims or doors nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door the people are like mentally disabled sheep br br by the by if you're a gore fan you'll be disappointed too all the killing is kept <UNK> and is <UNK> <UNK> done so boo <UNK> for you br br none of the killings is the least bit interesting most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out br br the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies oh kitty you scared me i thought you were the killer <UNK> br br and then at the end when it's time for the killer to die well let's just say it's the <UNK> and most obvious choice <UNK> br br the audience was <UNK> and talking back to the screen throughout it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough don't encourage this kind of lazy film making br br oh and by the way no <UNK> of a prom king or queen no <UNK> no bucket of blood br br so save your money and rent carrie or friday the 13th or halloween or scream or scary movie any of them to get a good scare with some original twists
<START> gene tierney and dana andrews who were both so memorable in <UNK> laura re teamed for this excellent 1950 film noir br br an <UNK> policeman andrews as mark can't get over the fact that his father was a <UNK> who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail as a result of his <UNK> mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands it's this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small time hood craig stevens br br in trying to frame gangster gary <UNK> mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab drive tom <UNK> who is the father of gene tierney who was separated by stevens br br this is a well thought out film dealing with the conscience of a basically decent human being br br the ending is not exactly upbeat as mark will have to face the music at least he finally admits to what he has done
<START> when people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it's another <UNK> with great stars in the lead of tragic <UNK> roles this opinion however does not resemble <UNK> movies in particular this one directed by count <UNK> visconti ossessione as his debut once <UNK> and once <UNK> as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others the <UNK> opinions about the film that have appeared in these <UNK> years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past at the same time while being based on the novel by james m cain the <UNK> always rings twice it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style view his own art i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which i'd like to <UNK> below br br first <UNK> movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life in particular those absorbed by desire these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face gino <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> with bear like shoulders turns up at the <UNK> of a <UNK> near <UNK> and enters the <UNK> although many people go there to have a meal gino occurs to get something more much more the <UNK> desire of beautiful giovanna clara <UNK> a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar mr <UNK> <UNK> juan de <UNK> her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love the couple plan to get rid of the old <UNK> and build up a new life together however are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire can one build love upon murder what is love and what is loyalty does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession such questions intensely <UNK> while watching the movie when to the core the viewer is <UNK> with an insight into characters we have to love each other <UNK> answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may <UNK> love justify and cure everything isn't it what we both wanted says one of the couple it occurs that it's not therefore the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not <UNK> with intellect and heart yet it constantly remains thought provoking br br second ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch they range from <UNK> erotic images to purely technical shots who can possibly skip that moment in <UNK> where gino meets a beautiful girl a sort of <UNK> <UNK> perfect girl a dancer anita and buys her ice cream his desires show him totally different direction do viewers remain indifferent at gino <UNK> first meeting the first focus of camera is on <UNK> legs seemingly representing <UNK> desire over love that gino experiences a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the <UNK> of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look br br third ossessione can <UNK> outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast <UNK> <UNK> once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet consequently what comes out is a flawless acting he portrays a <UNK> man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim which represents conscience his <UNK> is <UNK> through the character of lo <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for <UNK> clara <UNK> who was cast in the role after <UNK> anna <UNK> had refused fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple they are both very convincing besides i liked juan de <UNK> in the role of <UNK> he portrays an old husband not <UNK> to his wife and still crazy about high art in some of his most witty moments he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of <UNK> performance br br in sum we as modern viewers who are capable of critical view have to look at this film very <UNK> it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet is it educational visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity in such case his films would only entertain which is of course not entirely <UNK> style too visconti always had something to convey what did he want to say here is the film against bad marriage or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire the final shocking moments say for themselves though you don't have to agree with the vision ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film one of <UNK> best 8 10
<START> what do you get when you mix a <UNK> of clichés with a <UNK> pacing and a group of characters who you don't care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger <UNK> of clichés and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget why you get one of the most <UNK> unwatchable movies ever made i'm referring of course to domino br br here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this movie br br <UNK> wow the storyline is told out of sequence that hasn't been done a billion times before and much more <UNK> than in this movie br br wow look at all of the flashing lights and grainy film <UNK> and elaborate transitions the director is trying so hard to make things look arty and to establish a visual style it's just too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes they're in and it's also too bad that most of them come across as irritating br br i've heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before br br i've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before br br this one too br br uh didn't they reveal this <UNK> <UNK> about half an hour ago was that supposed to be surprising br br if this movie is supposed to be showing a <UNK> <UNK> going around kicking ass when why doesn't she do very much of it br br i can't believe how unoriginal this dialogue is br br how long is this thing i feel like i've been watching it for over four hours already br br i have no idea what just happened but also i don't particularly feel motivated to try to figure it out br br is this over yet br br i want my money back br br the songs in this soundtrack feel so <UNK> here br br it's ironic that all of the <UNK> they use actually <UNK> from the impact of each one br br ugh br br and finally i might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me br br in <UNK> this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect avoid watching it at all costs if your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that isn't <UNK> you should seriously consider being burned alive instead br br if i sound bitter it's because i just spent over two hours watching this movie and uh i didn't enjoy it very much
<START> not a woman <UNK> but film for the gang one of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman director andy <UNK> simply doesn't know woman peaks of bad taste american <UNK> humor style crude story no sense <UNK> story <UNK> characters vulgar fantasies came to life on screen insulting and definitely not funny i wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it
<START> what was there about 1939 that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films well whatever it was the magic may also be found in this columbia picture it's a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show <UNK> movie book does not contain it in nearly every department amazing mr williams is a jewel br br it's the story of a first rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended as the wedding <UNK> are about to ring he gets called to the scene of a murder the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force there are a lot of laughs in the process br br melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight edward <UNK> and donald <UNK> are hilarious br br the film goes on a bit too long but who cares the screwball comedies are always able to entertain and this film belongs right in there with the best
<START> my husband and i went to see this movie being the horror movie buffs that we are two hours later i found myself wanting both my money and time back i was so disappointed the <UNK> for this film basically contained the best points of the film there was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise <UNK> etc i found most of the <UNK> parts to be more comical than anything after viewing other movies based on the works of japanese writers i have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in japan is not what is frightening here in the us my advice if you are a fan of true horror movies save yourself the pain of sitting through this one i can't really say that i would recommend renting it either unless you have a free rental coming to you
<START> no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only 3 have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these 3 in the last series jaw <UNK> ludicrous as a bbc <UNK> <UNK> after the show i <UNK> bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i'm amazed that actors of the <UNK> of <UNK> eve and sue <UNK> didn't object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons <UNK> they can see it's lost all direction it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas br br paul <UNK> west <UNK> england
<START> drawing restraint 9 is a kind of movie one either loves or hates fortunately or not i left it with a strong feeling of wasted time and of being thoroughly stuffed with killing <UNK> is bad propaganda <UNK> the movie could have been pleasing especially its first half until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting until then it might be slightly amusing to look at daily <UNK> of japan workers but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda and no single frame is an exception i use the word propaganda because the movie uses basically the old morality play device where good and bad are not <UNK> in the course of action but are set in stone probably it's just me but i find such type of art shallow and <UNK> even when it's all about the noble no sarcasm here quest of protecting the environment br br in my opinion it is a <UNK> sin when a movie material is stretched out without any justification for the sake of <UNK> only in my opinion drawing restraint 9 could've been easily fit into 75 minutes but has a <UNK> length of 2 and 1 4 hours yes there were interesting shots but there were not enough of these to leave 15 minute gaps of <UNK> without notice the movie has no standard scenario and there's no evolution of characters but neither it is a documentary it's rather a kind of <UNK> <UNK> that's an unusual form for a movie but it still can be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here <UNK> i also believe that the director should've had some honesty and did not pretend that it could be only delivered in no less than <UNK> minutes br br and yes the music score mostly <UNK> whale sounds how surprising br br 2 10
<START> i love <UNK> <UNK> and maybe that's why i enjoyed the movie so much two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert i saw the trailer and the video <UNK> before the movie and i thought i had it all figured i was wrong instead of a good movie i <UNK> a great one i felt the movie it was sad it was funny but most of all it <UNK> love i can't even begin to describe the soundtrack so i won't i'm not a movie critic i can't describe it in more words my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless thank god for the keyboard thank you <UNK> <UNK> thank you maria <UNK> thank you <UNK> <UNK> and thank you <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i already loved how the grinch stole christmas when it was released and i'm still loving it now 5 years later still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out br br sure the movie is over the top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch all of the sets costumes and characters are done perfectly over the top in a fun way without ever becoming truly <UNK> it's a visually spectacular movie to watch it's a campy movie making at its very best director ron howard really surprises with this fun little christmas movie br br main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is jim carrey as the grinch he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role he is of course helped by the convincing make up which also received an academy award of course if you're a jim carrey <UNK> you shouldn't even think about watching this movie this movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch other fun and memorable roles are being played by jeffrey <UNK> clint howard and josh ryan evans as the young grinch br br the movie has a good <UNK> but it is all a bit sappy to me perhaps it's because i'm dutch and we don't really celebrate christmas that enthusiastic and big here as in the united states or england for me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the <UNK> just left me quite cold to be honest br br the musical score by james <UNK> is good and fun even though it's your average every day <UNK> stuff it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the <UNK> work br br perfect christmas entertainment br br 8 10
<START> i didn't like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s so i tried watching it again to see if my <UNK> for this film was down to my movie going tastes in the 80s or was it that <UNK> is simply a bad movie well the verdict is in and <UNK> is a bad movie br br now <UNK> may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans but its still a bad movie br br why is it bad mostly because <UNK> is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not that funny there are some laughs but they are few and far between most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman which <UNK> for laughs in every part of the movie br br <UNK> further suffers from bill murray and harold <UNK> lack of acting ability bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and harold <UNK> is playing harold <UNK> these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie br br lastly most of the comedy that there is in <UNK> revolves around bill <UNK> self centered smart alec man child character so if you don't find that character funny like i didn't you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in <UNK> funny either br br <UNK> is very much a movie of its era it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching if you want to watch an early 80's buddy comedy i would recommend stir crazy like <UNK> the humor in stir crazy is not as fast paced as in contemporary comedies but unlike <UNK> it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable
<START> a longtime fan of bette midler i must say her recorded live <UNK> are my favorites bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her <UNK> a literal <UNK> of emotion and talent bette shows us her best from her solid <UNK> as well as new songs from the bette of <UNK> album <UNK> generations of people she offers something for everyone the one and only divine <UNK> proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around
<START> i really like slasher movies but this one is truly awful the acting is lame the script is bad and the atmosphere is non existent the plot is as follows a <UNK> <UNK> charlie <UNK> <UNK> people in a small american town that's right this is the plot very original eh the night brings charlie isn't even gory enough if the film ain't gonna be scary at least they should make it bloody avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs if you want to see some good slasher flicks check out madman the burning the <UNK> just before dawn or <UNK> just don't waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage
<START> at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie i though that will be great but it wasn't br br is a bad copy of the richard <UNK> work lex is again a villain that makes no more else even played by kevin spice br br the evil plan is the same of the first movie of <UNK> just a lot forced br br the script is predictable and simple all stuff luthor finds in a museum or an old lady br br the story is the wrong thing it must be the kevin smith script and may be it could be better br br i just hope a sequel without brian singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy br br all read you later
<START> <UNK> is normally <UNK> and it's never really bothered me before i loved <UNK> 2 but i really don't like pseudo <UNK> or playing on <UNK> the whole movie is based on a man with <UNK> caused by an <UNK> accident and a witch i'm not opposed to witches and i liked carrie the novel and the movie but this one bothered me i think it's because of the main character developing <UNK> from an electric line also the university professor wasting his time studying <UNK> cases i wasn't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not <UNK> was a common <UNK> then but i assume that any theory of such nature would simply be <UNK> what really bothered me was the way the police were describing <UNK> as ruthless unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99 of the time and then just snap nothing could be further from the truth i <UNK> such concepts because they add to public idiocy many people still think that <UNK> is <UNK> identity disorder whoever wrote this script didn't know much about psychology br br there were some decent concepts to the movie i liked the way the witch used men it was a nice change i liked how she could make herself attractive but didn't when she was around her forced lovers i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience dumber this may have been a decent movie
<START> what makes for best picture material the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown <UNK> that have aged poorly and ignoring the <UNK> who would be <UNK> in decades to come it wasn't because hollywood was against art or creativity the academy awards are the <UNK> made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest <UNK> the most sensational <UNK> of creative minds br br the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar winning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before freed aided by his strongest director <UNK> minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a best picture freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else <UNK> pictures which <UNK> story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals the point about freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of <UNK> or <UNK> don't have to tell or even relate to the stories what's important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film br br an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals the other two being <UNK> in the rain and the band <UNK> which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story the words don't fit the plot but the routines fit the show so when gene kelly sings i got rhythm he hasn't even got a girl yet but the way it's done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point an american in paris also uses the rule breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional <UNK> of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which <UNK> the description of leslie <UNK> character br br and what better director for this project than minnelli himself a painter and a <UNK> at this time there wasn't really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor while some directors would <UNK> each scene in one colour or fill the screen with <UNK> shades <UNK> colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red during oscar <UNK> and georges <UNK> meeting in the <UNK> a few more vibrant shades are introduced then during the first musical number by <UNK> minnelli gradually brings in <UNK> of red  a table cloth a bunch of <UNK>  until it eventually <UNK> as if the song has <UNK> the <UNK> colour scheme for most of the songs the colours are choreographed as <UNK> as the people however in some numbers such as <UNK> la la he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song <UNK> up and the characters become more animated br br the <UNK> <UNK> of an american in paris is its story i personally find the romantic angle particularly <UNK> playing as it does like a last <UNK> for the misogynistic love stories that <UNK> supreme in the 30s the <UNK> independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is <UNK> into loving the hero even if you don't mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances compare this to <UNK> in the rain which doesn't really have as many great routines or memorable set pieces as an american in paris but it has a winning storyline <UNK> in the rain was overlooked at the <UNK> oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all <UNK> form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tear <UNK> but like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show
<START> i saw this movie in new york city i was waiting for a bus the next morning so it was 2 or 3 in the morning it was <UNK> and did not want to wait at the <UNK> <UNK> so i went across the street and saw the worst film of my life it was so bad that i chose to stay and see the whole movie i have yet to see anything else that bad since the year was <UNK> so call me crazy i stayed only because i could not <UNK> it
<START> there were a lot of films made by hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public seen today some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda which they technically are but of a positive sort and meant to <UNK> the nation this film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre having a pretty realistic script and good production values pat o'brien plays pretty much the same character he played in many other films you know the tough talking hard driven but <UNK> guy randolph scott is as always competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent look for a young robert ryan as one of the <UNK> in training while the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and <UNK> the film is well crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far fetched that it perhaps except for the very end where the film is a bit over the top but also very satisfying about the only serious negative and this is mostly for <UNK> is that some of the stock footage is somewhat <UNK> integrated in the film and nuts like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this all others probably won't notice
<START> this is ostensibly a movie about multiple grief as such it ought to move viewers and make them <UNK> with the plight of the main characters however its <UNK> <UNK> style makes it almost incomprehensible the camera continually switches from one scene to another from one personal crisis to the next creating a choppy disjointed effect most characters appear to live <UNK> <UNK> lives held together by their professional <UNK> it also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence would <UNK> <UNK> in a sex romp with a woman he has just met the storyline if there is a storyline is difficult to follow in sum the overall effect is rather disappointing in spite of all that the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful
<START> an innocent man steve <UNK> has a one night stand with his <UNK> wife isabelle <UNK> she spots a woman elizabeth <UNK> being attacked outside but she can't call the cops because it would blow her marriage to <UNK> boss paul <UNK> so <UNK> honest citizen that he is when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack merely <UNK> to pass on the information given to him by <UNK> well never bear false witness against <UNK> neighbor as they say br br this simple attempt to help the police <UNK> a murderer turns rapidly twisted when he meets the first near victim <UNK> she immediately <UNK> to what happened but agrees to keep quiet for the moment but then <UNK> finds himself in court supposed to identify the heavy <UNK> and we discover through cross examination that he is near <UNK> and can't identify objects at a distance let alone faces not that it matters because after all he never saw the creep in the first place the plot gets practically <UNK> <UNK> winds up the chief suspect when <UNK> is murdered too br br he barely escapes arrest and holes up with the now sympathetic <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> a plan to trap the murderer she will serve as bait they'll follow the <UNK> creep into one of his seedy haunt and <UNK> will act like the <UNK> that the murderer is attracted to just to get him to try to kill her but everything will be okay see because not only will <UNK> keep a close watch on her and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive but she will keep a can of <UNK> handy just in case br br i ask you the alert viewer does this scenario unfold as planned elizabeth <UNK> has a <UNK> interesting bone structure she seems all <UNK> and tiny mouth at times but she's vibrant steve <UNK> has hair on his <UNK> and that's about it otherwise he's as helpless as the character he plays if isabelle <UNK> can act it isn't evident in this film the killer is so formed and so <UNK> that he looks like he's wearing one of those masks of <UNK> in that twilight zone episode about greedy <UNK> br br didn't the director curtis <UNK> go on to make l a <UNK> that was a nicely done piece of work here everything seems clumsy and contrived down to the small bit parts just before the inevitable violent climax a <UNK> police officer is introduced to <UNK> <UNK> rescue and the scene is embarrassing to watch dick olsen has a bit part as a late <UNK> he's a neat guy and always reliable paul <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too br br that <UNK> joint where <UNK> <UNK> the attention of the murderer where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes was shot at a bar in <UNK> beach in north <UNK> not far from where i lived the way the interior is set up it's clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in reality br br overall this is hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story
<START> i have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it but this movie was terrible i have yet to see why people thought it was funny the idea behind it is stupid plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb why anyone would want to watch this more than once just <UNK> me
<START> this movie does not rock as others have said i found it really boring and silly the story is about this metal high school kid who <UNK> this really bad heavy metal singer the singer dies but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at of course midnight on halloween which would actually make it november 1st a much less potent date to be sure the kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back play messages it also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world br br the first part of this film is not a horror film at all but rather an after school special we see the metal kid the <UNK> tormented over and over by the popular kids and he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies when the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party don't go it is a trap especially if it is a pool party anybody surprised when he ends up in the water it was such an after school special that i kept waiting for melissa sue anderson to show up and teach <UNK> foster a lesson br br so back to the horror part of the film so this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys which would have made much more sense he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm what a sensitive hero what fun is that in a horror movie thank goodness carrie white did not follow this lesson he actually tries to prevent having the music played at the halloween dance the very music that could <UNK> a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him if it were me i would have put that music on and <UNK> br br the rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he <UNK> why not partner with him and really do some damage why you ask it seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt more appropriate for a molly <UNK> film is this a horror film or an episode of beauty and the beast the movie just goes on and on at this point with no scares horror or anything worth watching if you went to high school in the late 80s like i did this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair but that is it for this film skip it and stay home and just listen to some kiss
<START> great battle finale and nice sets help keep this often slow movie enjoyable at times it had me checking my watch although there were enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it the ending should surprise even those familiar with the <UNK> story line
<START> attack of the killer tomatoes consists mostly of rambling poorly assembled footage in search of a movie the plot makes no sense and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all watching this silly spoof you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately that it's easy to make a cheap low quality film and then use the parody angle as an excuse for its <UNK> and low quality in one scene female <UNK> are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them how far can suspension of disbelief go even in a parody the title song is great though 1 2
<START> near the beginning of the godfather part iii michael <UNK> son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician michael <UNK> does not want this but his estranged ex wife kay manages to convince him to let anthony <UNK> pursue music as he wishes so he does br br that seems like an odd way to start a review as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action just bear with me here you'll see where i'm going with this eventually now let me tell you about the major plot it is about michael <UNK> wanting to quit crime for good he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business but then along comes vincent <UNK> an <UNK> nephew who is involved in a <UNK> so of course michael must endure yet another brush with <UNK> and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff meanwhile vincent has a semi incestuous affair with michael's daughter mary oh and michael and kay are trying to <UNK> up all the horrid things that happened at the end of part ii br br it is like a soap opera one horrid awful <UNK> minute soap opera gone is any sort of the sophistication romance and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard after a 16 year break in the franchise francis ford coppola delivered a mess of <UNK> and <UNK> entirely <UNK> with the first two films once again proving his last great work was apocalypse now back in the 1970's br br what's worse the godfather part iii isn't even a logical follow up of the godfather part ii michael is a completely different person he hasn't just gone to seed which might be legitimate even if it'd be no fun to watch he's become a <UNK> <UNK> that's trying to fix all the tragedy that made part ii such a devastating masterpiece his confession to the priest was bad enough but that little <UNK> attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating he also gets back together with kay for <UNK> <UNK> there is absolutely no way that should happen as the 2nd movie made <UNK> clear she <UNK> his baby and his <UNK> upbringing made him despise her for it didn't francis ford coppola even think of these things br br and don't even get me started on mary and <UNK> affair for a romance so forbidden it was shockingly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> acting did nothing to help she made the <UNK> move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it because she was possibly the worst actress i have ever seen in a best picture <UNK> every line she delivered was painfully <UNK> and every time the drama <UNK> on her acting abilities all she <UNK> was inappropriate <UNK> in the climactic scene i won't go into detail but you'll know which scene i'm talking about when if you watch it she looks at michael and says daddy i think i was meant to cry but the line was delivered so poorly i burst out into long loud laughter br br now we get to the climax and now you will also realize why i took time to start the review with a description of anthony <UNK> musical ambitions after <UNK> minutes of petty drama and irrelevant <UNK> anthony <UNK> returns with an opera so michael kay mary and vincent go to see it and for about 10 15 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to <UNK> michael about this climactic sequence i must say one thing it was really good but not because of the killers they were pretty boring i just really liked the opera it had some great music and real great set pieces and from what little it showed us it seemed that the story had echoes of the <UNK> family's origin i'll bet it was one <UNK> opera and i'll bet michael <UNK> was glad he let his son switch from law school to music br br my biggest wish is this that francis ford coppola had merely filmed anthony <UNK> opera for <UNK> minutes and <UNK> the rest of the <UNK> melodrama better yet i wish he hadn't made the godfather part iii at all part ii gave us the perfect ending this spin off was self indulgent and unnecessary br br p s this is not a gut reaction to the film i watched all 3 godfather films over a month ago though i was <UNK> the first one not only does this mean that my expectations for part iii weren't screwed in fact i had set the bar rather low for it after what i heard but it also means i've had a good time to think about all three films while i was a bit disappointed with part ii at first the more i thought about it the better it seemed but with part iii it was bad to begin with then got worse the more i thought about it the sad thing is that many people will stop with part i but if they watch part ii as well they will most likely go on to part iii if you have the will watch parts i ii and pretend like part iii never existed
<START> i love zombie movies and i love amateur productions and meat market 2 starts really promising with a nice homage to <UNK> classic zombi br br so i <UNK> back and waited to be impressed okay some of the <UNK> are great for such a no budget movie and some actors the <UNK> and the cook really stand out but else <UNK> nothing br br i <UNK> expect a new romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value the director sure knows how to stage body <UNK> and interesting eating <UNK> but now after two parts it´s time to learn something more br br in <UNK> gore <UNK> with bore for me <UNK> not enough sorry br br out of
<START> i just couldn't stop laughing this movie is incredibly funny and stupid but never mind that it is very entertaining in this film you don't need to pay attention to anything the acting is the same lame the dinosaurs are the same rubber oh my i could see the stick that holds t rex head for a moment the <UNK> are the same from the <UNK> 2 t rex is also the same but in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from <UNK> action is fast sometimes too fast actually i talk about fast editing they edited it so fast so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs but <UNK> to late they are rubber well only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel br br what can i say don't rent it watch it on tv with friends it is much more entertaining
<START> i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasn't that bad or else people wouldn't even bother to talk about it i personally enjoyed this film <UNK> and still do i guess this film isn't for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many br br as for those that think that this film is overrated or over hyped well we only have the movie going public to thank for that lol you see it's not critics article writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general movie going public people make the film a huge success with titanic everyone was in awe let's face it a film like this had never been made before at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that <UNK> day in april <UNK> even the <UNK> for goodness <UNK> matched br br give this movie a break you guys the critics thought this movie would sink big time when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of <UNK> mind you that this was a good decent movie worth seeing then everyone started <UNK> to the theaters in <UNK> to see this movie not once not twice but maybe 3 times and more so i really wouldn't say that this movie was <UNK> at least not like the <UNK> for the matrix <UNK> or the hulk is being <UNK> ha critics didn't even think that titanic would make enough money to cover <UNK> gigantic film budget that it took to make this <UNK> of a film however the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more br br personally i love this film however this film might not be for everyone don't say that this film sucks just because of romance though that is the most sexist thing i've ever heard <UNK> a movie just because it has romance in it the story was sweet the dialogue could have been better but let's face it the real star of the movie wasn't leo or kate it was that gigantic ship i think all of the actors including <UNK> and <UNK> did a fine job it's not <UNK> best work i've seen much better work from both of them but it wasn't the worst i've seen on screen before give them a break br br
<START> ok who brought the cheese i love it during it's run it became a phenomenon the <UNK> twins became popular bob <UNK> started making a paycheck instead of his really funny stand up and people knew who dave <UNK> was this is when life was good and simple this is one of the great american classics it was humorous and always brought home a good lesson and this is where i <UNK> from the norm i liked the last few seasons like home improvement when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script this is why i dare say it could have gone much later than it did but anyway i gave it an 8 10 because of its wholesome funny story lines and because of bob <UNK>
<START> brilliant film the next best film to the drunken master jackie chan i recently bought it on an original vhs and i haven't seen this film for 15 years but still as good as it was back then the acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film and many other old fashioned chinese kung fu movies great the choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic i have never seen the <UNK> chamber of shaolin but know it is the same film but gordon liu plays san <UNK> but san <UNK> in <UNK> return to the <UNK> chamber is played by a different character it has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung fu
<START> here's why the jane show won't work once again canadian <UNK> producers and writers can't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it i guess these people don't watch a lot of t v from the u s which has the sitcom model down pat no here we have to do something different we have to make the a story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful b story to try to make up for it the characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top <UNK> races give me freaking break here's a little advice for the writers of the show don't write funny situations find the funny in situations and remember you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff not just be an <UNK> monkey
<START> to say funky forest the first contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions i can really get into a good art house film even a surreal and twisted romp like el <UNK> naked lunch and survive style 5 because those movies actually have something worth discussing when the credits roll br br <UNK> attempts at every <UNK> to be this deep and intellectual essentially there is no substance in this movie this movie is badly done the visuals in this movie are not inspiring the dialog is worse the musical numbers destroy this movie i <UNK> for guitar brothers but that was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary and irrelevant it attempted to be deep and meaningful i think but its just pretentious <UNK> nonsense <UNK> film students without a camera could craft something more interesting br br guitar brothers and the stand up routines in between skits get 1 point each everything else is just badly paced pseudo creative heavy handed attempts at being as good as films by other real directors like <UNK> <UNK> david lynch and <UNK> give me a break i am convinced that people that rave about <UNK> are doing so because they have no idea of what they saw because it was nothing but mild <UNK> statements here and there mixed with stupidity and <UNK> until you <UNK> on your own shoes br br this movie was an extreme disappointment coming off the high that was survive style 5 a film that actually has meaning combined with excellent use of scenery cinematography catchy dialog funny moments good soundtrack excellent performances fantastic pacing and flow <UNK> features the exact opposite in every way boring scenery 20 minutes staring at a bland beach at night a completely white stage alien balls floating in white space a <UNK> school <UNK> and then a school <UNK> terrible cinematography forgettable dialog nothing funny or humorous save the fact you just wasted your life for two hours soundtrack amateurish performances uneven disjointed and often flat out dragging pacing zero flow whatsoever br br there are those that claim this is what makes <UNK> a great movie that it is so unconventional at every turn that its pure genius this is simply a way to stroke your own ego it seems because unpredictable could be a good quality for a film if it wasn't coupled with boring <UNK> and terrible personally i have spoken with two people who admitted to me that <UNK> was terrible when they left the theater but overwhelming rave by art house <UNK> made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a hey it was pretty good i liked it br br i'm going to put my foot down this movie is <UNK> i don't care if roger ebert says this film is the best thing he's ever watched since he lost his own virginity the <UNK> new cloak i say this movie is no way <UNK> of the other psychedelic <UNK> films to come from japan in the last 10 years taste of tea party 7 and <UNK> girls are much better movies even with a low budget and none can honestly compare with survive style 5 watch <UNK> only if your interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a <UNK> budget
<START> hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly you might think things would <UNK> up when they explore mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red orange <UNK> which makes everything very murky the martian landscape <UNK> consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing there are echoes of <UNK> of the <UNK> when the heroine carefully winds the <UNK> like <UNK> of a flesh eating plant around her before <UNK> <UNK> about the difference being that the ed wood film is a hundred times more entertaining better wear <UNK> when watching otherwise the <UNK> <UNK> music score repeated endlessly will drive you insane if you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the vcr and your insomnia will be <UNK> in no time
<START> <UNK> will always go down as one of <UNK> most legendary games in <UNK> history their is no doubt about that but this game although quite different could quite possibly be the modern day bond <UNK> of its time br br this was not a bond game based on material from another medium this was a completely new scripted game which even had its own theme song <UNK> be bond without it haha <UNK> was excellent and if you're a fan of the bond games or films alike you'll enjoy it br br unlike some most games these cast members portrayed their characters themselves as opposed to fictional creations for the game which gives it that more cinematic feel with a very <UNK> able storyline you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie br br enjoyable in all aspects from start to finish even after beating the game there's still plenty more to be done with the <UNK> system and <UNK> to be achieved as well as its multi player missions this is a stand out game despite being quite old now in video game years it's still a good game that you can pick up play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life even now just thinking about it i've got the theme song stuck in my head such a great cast and well written storyline br br the story comes to life on the screen almost as if the actors were their in front of you and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself superbly done in true bond fashion which can only be named awesome completely awesome br br i've gotta go throw this game on now if you haven't played it yet you're missing out
<START> the killings in this movie isn't that bad but for sure the movie is it's even worse than that it's not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your dvd player br br not even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the dvd store not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it horrible br br it's beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie it was just a bare <UNK> tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching add to that the group pressure from my co <UNK> br br the <UNK> is awful the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicable br br i hope you don't see this as a spoiling your fun i'd rather see it as a fair warning do not waste your time watching this garbage
<START> despite the acclaim on the dvd cover of the version i borrowed this film was a disappointment yes it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud boredom and frustration of the <UNK> but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that's all there is to this movie there is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous it's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute one of the best world war ii films twelve <UNK> high has very little action but it <UNK> with <UNK> dialogue and psychological tension the exception to the story of g i joe is a brief battle segment titled city under siege on the dvd which takes place in italy admittedly it is one of the most fast paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie but alas the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight another turn off is <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> who is meant to be a romeo but comes off a <UNK> by contrast sgt <UNK> is a sympathetic if flawed man as he says to capt walker mitchum when <UNK> for another <UNK> every step forward is a step closer to home but that last step  one <UNK> too many  drives him over the mental brink too bad the rest of the movie doesn't do justice to some otherwise fine touches as for <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> it is practically <UNK>
<START> the college girl murders is my first <UNK> with the writing work of edgar wallace  and generally my first real <UNK> with <UNK> films in general  and i can say that i'm moderately impressed this stuff is really entertaining although i never would have expected it to be so  goofy the film has an <UNK> and nicely convoluted plot with a healthy dose of humor flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings there's some james bond type of evil mastermind  who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large <UNK> <UNK> prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison there's also a villainous monk with a whip dressed like a communist <UNK> member getting rid of the <UNK> characters like overly curious teachers and such as well as a <UNK> police <UNK> who <UNK> on solving the case with a psychological approach seriously if i had known sooner that these <UNK> films were so colorful and crazy i would have purchased a whole collection of them already the <UNK> plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end and the <UNK> of comical gimmicks on the account of scotland yard inspector <UNK> are sometimes a bit much to swallow but i don't care because it was sublime entertainment even the funky 60's soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time it's like a <UNK> on the italian giallo but with slapstick elements
<START> if you think weird al <UNK> is hilarious you won't be disappointed by the <UNK> al not only does this rare <UNK> feature many of <UNK> more memorable videos like a surgeon and i love rocky road among them but they are inter spliced with funny vignettes supposedly <UNK> the <UNK> rise to fame <UNK> is not for all tastes but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non fans will at least be lightly amused die hard fans will love it not only for its content but also for its relatively early look into <UNK> now nearly three decade career suitable for all ages <UNK> will no doubt love the funny visuals
<START> in joel <UNK> you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time but this is common knowledge i think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror thriller chaplin liked his comedy scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and spielberg likes his large scale big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids other more obscure examples include kubrick and welles who covered too much to write about here br br but <UNK> is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise falling down had a great idea behind it but i found it flawed and <UNK> with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy batman is a superhero superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me then comes <UNK> a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before <UNK> which is <UNK> best film from what i've so far seen in my opinion with the war genre laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time i can remember <UNK> at the absurdity of the d day <UNK> during saving private ryan at the time when i first saw the film i had not much knowledge of the second world war bar when it began and finished my <UNK> were up my mouth slightly open with a weak 'i can't believe it <UNK> on my face needless to say it was because of that film i searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole in <UNK> you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through <UNK> farrell a tough and <UNK> soldier training for the vietnam war br br but what's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time the things he says and the <UNK> at which he deals with his <UNK> is reminiscent of a school child <UNK> up a series of teachers at an extremely strict <UNK> school <UNK> may borrow from full metal jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the vietnam war but <UNK> and <UNK> play more of a part here i think the <UNK> that are the <UNK> <UNK> go up against <UNK> whose ego is extremely large there is also the third part of <UNK> triangle that <UNK> into <UNK> the id compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large <UNK> <UNK> is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the <UNK> thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldn't do to <UNK> to the surface and express itself you are all dead in this situation <UNK> a sergeant any questions yeah if i'm dead how come i can ask a question replies <UNK> whose <UNK> such as push ups and dirt eating seem to un <UNK> him in true id style that is he enjoys the <UNK> br br also regarding the <UNK> <UNK> at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training this is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the <UNK> required for the job and the confidence to tell <UNK> he is in charge what follows is an actual conversation between <UNK> and an existing <UNK> sergeant who gives him his christian name this is where private <UNK> <UNK> character steps in his <UNK> rage and anger at <UNK> explodes at certain time all culminating in the film's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river wilson cannot control his <UNK> and dislike toward <UNK> and acts out br br what i also liked about <UNK> is that it's shot in such a way that is brave while lacking in <UNK> <UNK> seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and <UNK> but we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for tv the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but <UNK> is clever he never allows the film to become too much like a <UNK> whilst at the same time suggesting the film's budget could've been half of what it was it's worth saying here that spielberg said he wanted saving private ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes br br while being very funny and entertaining <UNK> is still a great study of what makes people <UNK> not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier there are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy if not unhappy ending that'll open your mind and make you think about what it's perhaps really like in the military
<START> okay this film is about <UNK> and <UNK> it's one of the most charming delightful movies you'll ever see as a kid it's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two <UNK> kids on an adventure for fun it may be a little <UNK> to watch but try it i neither my mother didn't think it was bad i was very <UNK> with the movie and the animation they were all quite good br br it is a delightfully wondrous comedy for the whole family to enjoy even the kids ages 7 years and up will enjoy this wonderful musical comedy with you and your family especially the animation the animation movements and <UNK> are really nice and deserve a thumbs up it's a <UNK> good musical for the whole family so what are you waiting for go to the video store and rent <UNK> and <UNK> now
<START> i watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly split my sides laughing each time i love eddie murphy as an actor but this stand up is some thing else he is so funny even the p c <UNK> would find this hilarious it's a must watch and even better if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink the take off of michael jackson is so like him if you close your eyes you believe it's him singing the things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour <UNK> if you thought this was not funny my local video stores do not stock this video any more but i would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour anyway highly recommended hope you enjoy
<START> and not in a good way baseketball is a waste of film in all most every single way it is offensive to all the senses this doesn't necessarily bother me i've seen plenty of bad movies really bad movies before and will see them again baseketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it the reason baseketball <UNK> me is that it stars <UNK> parker and matt stone in a film they didn't write any respect i had for david <UNK> has long since <UNK> his recent spoof films are lazy <UNK> that look and feel as if they were made by pre <UNK> boys <UNK> at penis jokes airplane was a revolutionary and very funny comedy watching baseketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person br br i have so much respect for <UNK> parker and matt stone these men are the funniest and <UNK> comedians in mainstream entertainment today their pictures and south park episodes are as relevant as they are funny every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them it's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach <UNK> i imagine baseketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons it is a stupid mess with no sense of dignity or class parker and stone have essentially <UNK> themselves out the film plays like a 90 minute episode of family guy br br parker and stone have never been great actors they've been <UNK> in their films i can't really find a way to describe their performance in baseketball other than the fact that it feels like they are <UNK> a spoof film <UNK> a spoof film every line is delivered in such a silly <UNK> way it's like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way i am reminded of the south park episode how to eat with your butt where <UNK> sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no plot or <UNK> except to gross out parker and stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture really it's sad br br and yet that is not my problem with baseketball my biggest <UNK> with the picture is that i sit there knowing that parker and stone are <UNK> following this piece of crap script i know that if they took the damn thing and <UNK> it that this could have been <UNK> to the point of being watchable there isn't any indication that <UNK> let them <UNK> scenes either parker and stone are merely tools to a bad director baseketball has some funny concepts and i think parker especially if he were allowed to take <UNK> script could have <UNK> on them more instead we get <UNK> humor don't rent baseketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade <UNK> joking around
<START> this movie probably had a <UNK> budget and still managed to <UNK> titanic i rented this the day i crashed my mom's car and it was the only thing that <UNK> me up beyond belief it has to be tied with 'the <UNK> of the killer <UNK> things to look for are 1 the drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 the <UNK> blonde in the <UNK> shirt who never changes 3 the <UNK> like <UNK> out driving 4 the <UNK> ensemble worn by the <UNK> right before she gets killed don't worry i'm not ruining any surprises for it's <UNK> predictable 5 the guy who finds it necessary to <UNK> 6 the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by <UNK> out the eyes of a <UNK> 7 the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest 8 the <UNK> writing <UNK> on the bathroom wall 9 last but not least the wonderful special effects especially the stab in the <UNK> that made a heaven help me popping noise br br enjoy br br
<START> bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors <UNK> greene <UNK> <UNK> michael <UNK> dan <UNK> and even guy williams as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace adam when he was leaving the series the cast had chemistry and they seemed to genuinely like each other that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have it also made many of their best stories into great western drama br br like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season there are bound to be some weak ones however most of the time each episode had an interesting story some kind of conflict and a resolution that usually did not include violence while bonanza was a western the <UNK> was never featured as the main attraction while i am a fan of the <UNK> and wanted dead or alive those shows usually ended with a <UNK> <UNK> were how many westerns resolved every conflict and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful <UNK> and harmony instead of killing br br in the early years of bonanza there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of <UNK> those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series but they are pretty good in and of themselves in 1964 when <UNK> <UNK> wanted to leave the show guy williams was brought in to replace him williams was playing the role of a long lost cousin unfortunately <UNK> decided to stay one more year and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry <UNK> old girlfriend if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 when <UNK> <UNK> left the show br br undoubtedly once <UNK> <UNK> left the series the stories focused more on comedy and country <UNK> <UNK> had often played the heavy in many episodes and his absence left a void in the cast little joe always wanted to play the nice kid and <UNK> always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold since ben was the kind and wise <UNK> of the family that did not leave too much room for any <UNK> br br at some point they hired a ranch hand called candy david <UNK> who became their fourth member of the cast but candy was never featured in any <UNK> and he was hardly more than an older version of little joe for a year or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin jamie played by the forgettable mitch <UNK> who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone br br apparently by adding the teenager the studio was looking to attract younger viewers it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems alcohol <UNK> etc those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter culture movement <UNK> was probably the most popular source of law and order tv though hawaii 5 0 the f b i and many other shows also tried to jump on the <UNK> by doing tv shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing <UNK> mayhem and crime br br the addition of a teenager to the cast gave the <UNK> more chances to show up and solve problems but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general after dan <UNK> died the series <UNK> along for another year or so before it was canceled the last season was pretty bad as it featured little joe tracking down the killers of his wife and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because little joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife and how unfair it was that she was killed br br i don't think i have ever seen the last episode of the series and i wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way by the last year there was only ben <UNK> greene actually living on the <UNK> as adam had moved away and never came back even once as a guest and <UNK> had died and little joe had left after his wife in the series had been killed by <UNK> br br overall the era from 1959 1965 is the best of this series once adam left it slowly <UNK> most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too by 1970 the series was trying to hard to be hip and <UNK> and it had lost a lot of its western flavor the addition of candy and the teenage kid also <UNK> the general quality of the show and the death of <UNK> dan <UNK> was the final nail bonanza is probably the best western series ever made and of the <UNK> episodes that were produced at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama that is a pretty good record even the worst of bonanza is better than a lot of other tv shows
<START> released in december of 1957 <UNK> went on to earn 8 oscar nominations and would pull in 4 wins red buttons won the oscar for best supporting actor in his role as <UNK> joe kelly who falls in love with a japanese woman while <UNK> in <UNK> during the korean war oscar nominated for best leading actor marlon brando plays major lloyd <UNK> a korean war flying ace <UNK> to japan who <UNK> supports the <UNK> opposition to <UNK> between american troops and japanese women and tries without any success to talk his friend joe kelly out of getting married ironically marlon <UNK> character soon finds love of his own in a woman of japanese descent this movie highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of that time filmed in beautiful color and with stunning backgrounds i found this movie to be well worth watching just for these effects alone good movie <UNK> more <UNK>
<START> director brian <UNK> has had an uneven career in the horror genre creating masterpieces such as return of the living dead 3 or bride of re animator but at the same time he has done awful movies such as <UNK> love for the damned or the mediocre <UNK> he is obviously better in the seat of producer where his work producing stuart <UNK> films has been superb br br the dentist is one of his lesser works as director but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of <UNK> makes it a very enjoyable experience it tells the story of dr alan feinstone played superbly by corbin bernsen a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife linda hoffman has an affair with the pool boy this event <UNK> his mind and puts him in a killing spree as he takes revenge on the world for being so filthy br br the premise is very well handled by <UNK> as he takes us on a ride following <UNK> day of revenge what makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the <UNK> perspective we follow feinstone because he is the main character we witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day <UNK> manages to give the movie the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie br br most of the success of the premise is in <UNK> performance as feinstone he can make you feel sympathy and hate towards him at the same time and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that aids the film the rest of the cast is not as good and i think that their sub par acting hurts the film more than it should a notable exception is ken <UNK> as the detective trying to catch feinstone while his part is quite small he makes a great job with it br br with a dentist as killer gory scenes are expected and brian <UNK> delivers great <UNK> in the correct amount it's good to see that he does not go over the top with it as he usually do and i dare to say that this is a highlight of the film it has the exact amount of gore that is expected nothing less and nothing more <UNK> restrained himself of his common <UNK> and the result is great br br while this is not among <UNK> most well known films i would say that it is one of his best sure it is not classic material as his masterpieces but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring it is a low budget simple film but for what it is i think it <UNK> 7 10
<START> i was waiting to see this movie from a long time it's <UNK> gave a fair idea about the content and when i finally saw it i really find it was quite well made most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great <UNK> needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life this is what this movie is all about the period when a newly <UNK> couple <UNK> and <UNK> get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon the acting is really spell <UNK> though i think <UNK> remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself the story was well <UNK> and dialogs were more or less appropriate the editing and direction were also good <UNK> <UNK> really did a good job here to <UNK> i would say it is a good drama <UNK> romance a true combination of what bollywood can offer a clean entertainer
<START> anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series the <UNK> does not come around until q brings the enterprise to the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> are never seen until kirk encounters them the <UNK> <UNK> was the first ship to carry the enterprise name need i go on <UNK> and <UNK> have made a mockery of gene <UNK> creation after he died they only saw and just went their own way no wonder <UNK> <UNK> was in every single episode of star trek until this series i don't blame her for not being involved with this mess poor <UNK> he's a great actor as are the entire cast i like them all but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the <UNK> set by the original series just check the ratings i think more people watched deep space 9 which was <UNK> canceled
<START> this cecil b demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean <UNK> finest performance as a hysterical eccentric <UNK> amoral but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jane she really pulled it off gary cooper is at his most <UNK> but manages some occasional <UNK> <UNK> 'the <UNK> are big but <UNK> cross sometimes ' the story is a <UNK> to end all <UNK> all the cowboy heroes of western <UNK> seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james even abraham lincoln opens the story in person or at least demille would have us believe so there is no room for anything so <UNK> as subtlety this is a <UNK> 'em in the <UNK> tale for the masses a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what <UNK> was eventually to name 'the military industrial <UNK> it isn't just a story about gun <UNK> but about <UNK> anyone for money and doing so from the heart of washington but let's not get into politics let's leave that to demille who can be guaranteed to be superficial the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george <UNK> who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography <UNK> boy of <UNK> <UNK> seems to have <UNK> 'the big <UNK> adopted by all subsequent westerns <UNK> the <UNK> sing out with the voices and sounds of countless <UNK> in the sky celebrating the open spaces and <UNK> common <UNK> that is why it does not sound at all unusual because we have heard it a thousand times but he seems to have been the first to <UNK> up the combined <UNK> of all the <UNK> brush into this <UNK> of the open <UNK> which has entered into american <UNK> <UNK> and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then corny as it may be but <UNK> appropriate it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a <UNK> indian <UNK> hayes is in there somewhere but you miss him in the crowd gary cooper <UNK> them all <UNK> large but when did he ever <UNK> small
<START> <UNK> a television series on a popular author's works is no guarantee of success <UNK> television <UNK> this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to dick francis three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'the racing <UNK> mike <UNK> was sid <UNK> a former <UNK> turned private eye following an accident in which he lost his right hand only to have it replaced by an artificial one <UNK> suffered from an <UNK> lack of charisma and looked like one of the bad guys while mick ford who played the irritating <UNK> barnes made me think of a <UNK> <UNK> whenever he was on screen for six weeks this less than dynamic duo charged about the countryside <UNK> <UNK> plots to fix races usually by the same methods blackmail kidnapping riders or <UNK> horses <UNK> television threw money at the show but to no <UNK> violent sexist far fetched and <UNK> it was quickly <UNK> off to the <UNK> yard
<START> this is really terrible br br the only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie i have ever watched i would have a suitable <UNK> br br i think it is filmed on 35 <UNK> so it is already tacky like hell i wouldn't have bothered commenting but i noticed some <UNK> probably connected to the movie had claimed that this was the best movie since the matrix let me <UNK> the <UNK> and lies br br there is nothing good in the movie everything yells tacky the actress is ugly the fight choreography is the worst i have ever seen the fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish imagine a girl <UNK> her arms around in a circle <UNK> and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a <UNK> obviously the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie br br i know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before unforgivable
<START> much in the same way frank miller and his sin city comics used black and white to express itself and its film noir influences so does christian <UNK> with renaissance br br it is the year <UNK> in paris in the tradition of science fiction the future is a bright <UNK> multi <UNK> jewel this is a jewel in a setting of misery <UNK> and darkness bright and beautiful on top with a dark <UNK> beneath one of these bright people at the top a research scientist from a very large and influential global company <UNK> is kidnapped the well known and efficient captain <UNK> voiced by the new james bond himself daniel craig is assigned the task to find her br br the plot and <UNK> is not overly original it is heavily influenced by film noir <UNK> <UNK> and other detective stories along with movies like blade runner sin city fritz <UNK> metropolis and minority report there is the main plot surrounded by other possible sub plots that all connect at the end it is not hard to figure it all out br br the movie's strength and originality is in its intense visual presentation paris is an intricate array of levels and sub levels at its base is the more primitive industrial <UNK> as the city rises so does its <UNK> complexity and <UNK> yet in this structure the top does not <UNK> with <UNK> of human ideals and behavior paris has been <UNK> animated and laid out in brilliant black and white the movie is closer in spirit with sin city the comics then sin city the movie was with its source material this is done all the more easy because it is still remaining in relatively the same medium animation much in the same way as a <UNK> darkly pushed the visual aspects of story telling so does this the light and dark black and white creates an atmosphere of <UNK> as well as visual ambiguity right and wrong black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us the movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time br br in keeping with the spirit of the movie i can be both critic and fan i can love and <UNK> in the same light it is definitely an experience i recommend for lovers of the visual arts so pour another black and <UNK> enter the void and enjoy the ride
<START> in the recent movement to bring asian films over to america this is the last movie that should be released here being a big fan of asian movies from all genres i was <UNK> the net and came across this <UNK> to be re released into the us market so i decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this at a local video store br br trust me the action scenes are incredibly disappointing <UNK> tiger and iron monkey completely blew this movie out of the water jet li would fall asleep watching the fighting sequences if you're looking for martial arts entertainment your time would be better off with a jackie chan flick br br moreover you think you're going to watch a martial arts with about a girl <UNK> in <UNK> for her parents death but surprise a good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue an <UNK> of action the lack of <UNK> a <UNK> plot pretty much nothing to do with the premise we are exposed to it has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer director dedicated no time in <UNK> and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect br br speaking of which i really don't believe the choreographer of iron monkey did the action sequence in princess blade i was completely insulted in the frequent usage of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the <UNK> physical <UNK> i just didn't buy it br br please i'm warning you to please do not waste your time money with this movie the premise is <UNK> and the trailer might even <UNK> you but i am positive that this movie is not suited for the public maybe in japan but not in the states and will be the worst film brought over to the states from the asian film industry
<START> really good horror flick featuring to of the greatest boris karloff and bela lugosi dr <UNK> rukh karloff is on an expedition in africa trying to find an ancient <UNK> after finding it rukh is <UNK> by the its radiation all he touches dies and the dark side of rukh makes him become an <UNK> murderer his friend dr felix <UNK> lugosi finds a limited <UNK> to the problem and at the same time realizes the radiation could be used for the good of mankind by <UNK> <UNK> the two <UNK> will battle over the <UNK> possibilities pretty good special effects others in the cast frances drake frank <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and frank <UNK>
<START> some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good <UNK> century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great but although <UNK> released some fulci films amongst others the bulk of their <UNK> is crap like the zombie chronicles br br the only positive thing i can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh other than that its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical <UNK> of a <UNK> house built by a <UNK> br br it's been noted elsewhere but you really do have to worry about a film that <UNK> previews of the action into its credit sequence so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks you've seen it all already br br bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18 000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast especially the <UNK> who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit and kudos to <UNK> for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip br br awful awful stuff we've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera but common sense <UNK> and these films <UNK> in our <UNK> somewhere avoid
<START> much of over her dead body is so painfully unfunny that i was actually <UNK> in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors br br eva longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy and further that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing she's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a <UNK> psychic from dating her widower fiancé the fiancé is played by paul rudd <UNK> and <UNK> while the psychic is played by lake bell bringing the movie whatever <UNK> energy it has i felt most sorry for bell as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working <UNK> in an effort to make the material work unfortunately she is up against the <UNK> task of making any movie that features jason <UNK> tolerable and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like leo <UNK> at the end of titanic br br over her dead body actually <UNK> ed me off because of its <UNK> and utter lack of effort i started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get <UNK> because vast amounts of money are being <UNK> into bland crap like this seriously does hollywood think movies like this are good enough how stupid do they really think the movie going public is br br grade f
