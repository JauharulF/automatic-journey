<START> while this movie won't go down in the <UNK> of great cinema it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family the film is finally being released in video where it should have <UNK> in the first place br br the film is about an <UNK> group of friends who gather for <UNK> which they have named the hungry <UNK> club <UNK> fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down <UNK> for the restaurant that she wants to open bill <UNK> plays a <UNK> loving mystery man who becomes her lover fox gives an understated and touching performance and <UNK> is <UNK> talented as always micheal des <UNK> is a hoot as an over the top attorney the ensemble casts made up of familiar faces works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life this is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family
<START> the selection of <UNK> stallone to perform the protagonist by <UNK> <UNK> is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and <UNK> person who had earlier rendered the requisite <UNK> versatile aura to the characters of rocky <UNK> and rambo but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far fetched notion br br the excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill suspense and intrigue which is going to <UNK> them in the ensuing bloody and <UNK> encounter with the <UNK> the heist and the high <UNK> transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before br br the biting cold of the snow <UNK> <UNK> and the unfolding <UNK> and <UNK> among the antagonist forces makes one <UNK> with <UNK> the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end br br good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then apart from the filthy language <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> excitement during certain scenes the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years
<START> this film made john glover a star alan <UNK> is one of the most compelling character that i have ever seen on film and i mean that sport
<START> i took this out <UNK> from the library the other night having no idea of the film's cult influence or that it is currently being staged as a musical most of the comments here are on target it's moving funny sad and yes a tad <UNK> despite the best intentions of the filmmakers the expanded <UNK> edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out br br i think you can also see in little edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared you can hear it in old films of jackie o too people just don't talk like that anymore i think as a documentary it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into <UNK> old edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree couldn't she see the once spectacular home <UNK> br br yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now a real life <UNK> williams one act well worth your time
<START> movie goers avoid watching this movie if you are faint hearted you might want to commit suicide if you are a short <UNK> you would want to kill the lead performer of the movie br br though he does not have any talent in acting he is the mass hero for all the <UNK> <UNK> auto <UNK> drivers <UNK> thugs and immature and ignorant <UNK> br br he proves you do not need neither talent nor knowledge to be successfully br br he is the highest paid actor in india that shows the taste of movie going public in india 90 of movie goers in <UNK> <UNK> are definitely attracted to his kind of nonsense movies
<START> big bad ralph is also on the not so <UNK> truck commercials and can be found at numerous <UNK> around melbourne any given night br br terrible film by the way wasn't shocking just bad uninteresting br br the main guy was in charge of the metal section on <UNK> and was the lead <UNK> at a gay night club in melbourne br br i <UNK> who the women where probably <UNK> that ralph knew br br no story of interest its one of those fast forward jobs br br please look up big bad ralph at <UNK> around melbourne br br hes famous in them br br i wish i could give 0 10 but ill give it 1 only <UNK> i cant give 0
<START> jennifer jason leigh and <UNK> <UNK> are a good match portraying vastly different siblings but only <UNK> is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role leigh playing bar band singer and alcoholic <UNK> <UNK> constantly <UNK> on older <UNK> georgia an acclaimed folk singer in the <UNK> mitchell mold perhaps due to her double duties as co producer on the film leigh seems to have <UNK> herself into a corner she isn't credible as a singer and even if this is intentional gives herself far too much screen time at the <UNK> probably hoping for a tour de force leigh is wire drawn and nervous and <UNK> however we simply do not see any talent within this character leigh is obviously a solid actress but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her if <UNK> had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the small breaks that she does as it is the <UNK> of her ever getting up on stage is slim director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a few intense dramatic sequences and the editing at the finale <UNK> <UNK> bar performance with <UNK> sold out <UNK> show both singing the same song and it's a sadly nuanced moment but really what's the point 1 2 from
<START> i just finished watching dressed to kill which is written and directed by brian de palma the dvd had both the r rated version and the <UNK> version i chose the <UNK> version since i have yet to view the r rated version i can't be completely sure of the difference there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self <UNK> in this version i guess you could call this scene soft core porn if this sort of thing may offend you i would suggest you view the r rated version but i <UNK> any comment from here on refers to the <UNK> version this is a murder mystery psychological horror suspense movie there is very little violence and blood there is however one death sequence of note the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic however the blood it self does not look real it is reminiscent of how a 70's slasher film would look i believe this is done deliberately to <UNK> the violence of the act itself to give the scene a low budget feel most of the violence or rather possibility of such is implied the film is very well paced as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose which i find very rare when compared to many of today's films anyway i also thought the acting was good especially angie dickinson and micheal <UNK> turns in a quietly understated performance in his role which works brilliantly in this case the movie also has one great twist in it in my mind although some people might find it predictable the only complaint and it's really more of an observation i have is that i thought the character played by nancy allen could have been fleshed out more especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time but i think she does a good job with what she is given and this doesn't really take away from the quality of the film the film also has a strong moral to it which is even more relevant today but the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it i also really liked the musical score composed by <UNK> <UNK> felt it was very similar to the music in the original psycho to me this music really <UNK> the movie i thought this movie was brilliant for me dressed to kill 1980 is 10 10
<START> i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being <UNK> with the typical genre hollywood film story lines fail and camera work is merely copied from the last film of <UNK> taste but then i saw <UNK> europa and my faith was <UNK> not only is the <UNK> storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating the narrator max von <UNK> takes you through a <UNK> journey every step of the way and <UNK> you into europa 1945 we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow moving moment that leads you to death unlike many films it doesn't cut after one second of showing for example a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet <UNK> beauty of a man's final moments i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email enjoy it
<START> not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be <UNK> but clearly this movie has the seed of a <UNK> br br we should not tend to be <UNK> and see <UNK> in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment but didn't we say this of 1984 had james <UNK> known the internet becoming reality not long after 1984 in fact it was in 1994 he might have <UNK> writing his story the way he did <UNK> rewarded br br it doesn't matter what does matter is that we often regard ourselves as superior to our surroundings but indeed become emotional about a love apple when necessity knocks at our door a <UNK> of ourselves at old age br br whatever the time line will prove to be for us i know for a fact we haven't seen the beginning of it yet br br
<START> <UNK> <UNK> goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to <UNK> they are artistically made with also often deeper meaning to its themes this movie is a perfect example of his work br br it's also really hard to label this movie it's not really a movie with a story to it in a sense of having a beginning middle and end in it it also doesn't have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different <UNK> and killings on 7 different days br br all different stories are being told with lots of class though some of them are of course more <UNK> and realistic than the others they are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story the movie doesn't feel disjointed at all all different stories have a different feel to it and <UNK> tells the story without hardly using any words also typical for his style but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story it helps to make this movie an effective one to watch br br again the production values all aren't too high and this might be something that might scare off some people it however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark disturbing and depressing themes br br a <UNK> movie that i <UNK> watching br br 7 10
<START> this series had potential but i suppose the budget wouldn't allow it to see that potential an interesting setup not <UNK> to lost it falls flat after the 1st episode the whole series 6 episodes could have made a compelling 90 minute film but the makers chose to drag it on and on many of the scenes were <UNK> slow and long without moving the action forward the music was very annoying and did not work overall there were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame well one grew a bit the ending was as terrible as the rest of series the only kudos here is to the art <UNK> and set <UNK> they created an interesting look too bad the writer and director lacked the <UNK> to do something interesting with that element
<START> dialogue stilted clichéd acting hammy clichéd plot predictable clichéd br br just what are christopher plummer <UNK> kinski doing in this b rubbish plummer was well established decades before this movie was made kinski had masterpieces like tess and cat people behind her must have been desperate br br the bad guys all have bad guy accents bad bad guy accents plummer especially where did he learn to do german and most of them have bad guy <UNK> as well the innocent <UNK> all <UNK> their <UNK> enough to make you laugh the good guy survives amongst other things a 5 throwing knife buried <UNK> deep in his shoulder just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all <UNK> machine gun fire i think someone referred to a 50 in the leg which he sorts out by <UNK> a <UNK> around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp several fist fights in which he <UNK> multiple punches to the face as well as being run <UNK> first into a door frame a fall backwards from what looks like the third floor onto <UNK> without the slightest sign of a twisted <UNK> or any other such <UNK> <UNK> the script has exactly 3 clever lines the rest of the time it's all so dull and boring br br ok it's not all bad plummer does bring a certain class to his part and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick of course that doesn't say much but he can do the <UNK> villain without <UNK> to the ham techniques most of the villains use here he delivers his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> type lines with some menace but you are always aware you are watching christopher plummer acting the villain br br this movie is truly an awful waste of time the acting such as it is is sort of 70's <UNK> movies wooden line delivery meets bruce lee's very obviously <UNK> fight scenes but it's not even anywhere near as good as either a roger moore <UNK> or a bruce lee film don't bother
<START> i really really didn't expect this type of a film outside of america how anyone can take the subject of sexually <UNK> children and turn it into a thriller is just sick <UNK> whom i had previously admired going around like some sort of child saving rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world br br what's <UNK> depressing is that the stunning and ground breaking film happiness came out the year before this film <UNK> and his <UNK> should be ashamed of themselves it's admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there they were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch happiness to open your minds to the true horrors of <UNK> br br do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be <UNK> by a neighbor teacher friend or even a relative hmm i wonder if they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this button pushing crap 1 10
<START> oh god what an idiotic movie incredibly cheap with fake special effects the creature is played by one guy in lame costume and stupid plot all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ha ha ha they're simply ludicrous for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more all in all this is a great entertainment if you're drunk avoid it like the plague am i drunk i don't think so
<START> some illegal so called asylum <UNK> comes to <UNK> and finds that germans are racist br br this is just another already forgotten steaming <UNK> in a long list of post wwii anti german propaganda films aimed to make germans feel bad for not <UNK> each and every <UNK> in their country so he can chase german <UNK> and sell drugs to german teenagers br br if you're looking for good german films in general see der tunnel der <UNK> europa europa and lola <UNK> br br but not this br br also <UNK> experiment with the same male actor from lola <UNK>
<START> i think this show is definitely the greatest show jessica alba does such a great job in it michael <UNK> also does an awesome job as well as the rest of the cast the show is very intriguing and they have wonderful <UNK> and their stunts are amazing it's like watching a 1 hour movie it's definitely worth watching
<START> as a movie critic for several dutch <UNK> i have to see <UNK> of movies and not all very good ones some movies are so bad you won't be surprised that they are released straight on video with taboo <UNK> surprised that it is released on video at all this is really low budget bad quality bad written rubbish br br a group of youngsters plays a game of taboo they write down their most sickening wish or act and later on people are murdered for their <UNK> the question is should we believe what we see br br the movie has a potential interesting plot twist and i won't give it away here but what could have been interesting stays stupid bad acted and without any reason br br some of the actors have played in bigger titles before so why on earth did they sign up for this if you see this anywhere try to dodge it there is no logic no human sense of quality in this movie
<START> in watching this early demille work it was once again <UNK> to me that early demille is far superior to late demille his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable his pacing is very good <UNK> much to be told in the space of an hour or so it is a pity that he wasn't as <UNK> about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films br br this was the first film in which i had seen <UNK> <UNK> she was remarkable quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions br br the ending is wonderful
<START> i love this movie short thing jason steele is amazing my favorite parts are the french song and in the opening title when the <UNK> soldier yells <UNK> i crack up every time i would recommend this movie to knox <UNK> fans and people who enjoy jason <UNK> other movies his style of animation is very original it takes a few views to notice the detailed backgrounds his humor is also hilarious and is definitely not something you'd hear before like max the <UNK> <UNK> who has a sound and light system in his head that <UNK> colorful lights and happy music whenever he talks about his miserable life this is a wonderful animation to watch anytime any where
<START> i have to say that this was not very exciting but talk about fashion and weird ways to solve a mystery a little too simple nancy drew emma roberts uses imdb that's fantastic i really liked about that part of the movie br br corky josh <UNK> is however extremely hilarious and ned <UNK> max <UNK> seemed really hopeless he should have been more angry with her for how she has treated him br br alright this movie is tour and fashion in disguise anyhow i recommend this movie just for summer fun <UNK> nancy just for fun more teen spy movies by emma roberts <UNK> remember she's becoming good at this <UNK> detective work
<START> what an awful movie i love monster flicks but i couldn't watch even half of the terrible acting cardboard characters and abysmal special effects there is nothing redeeming about this movie the characters come from either an endless supply of <UNK> stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous uninspiring <UNK> puppets the plot is formulaic cut and <UNK> standard science run amok drivel even the cgi is horrible you know it's bad when you can't even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy no surprises here just same old same old this is truly one of the worst films ever made director roger corman should be hung from a <UNK> so that children can use him as a <UNK>
<START> i just saw the movie in theater the movie has very few good points to talk about <UNK> beauty and a couple of songs may be thats it the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed even <UNK> indians too just now <UNK> has made it to semi final br br but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work all the action scenes i wish i could have <UNK> at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar this is height of stupidity audience is not paying to watch such stupidity i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies they cant make it the last good action i have seen was from <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me does these people see their movie after <UNK> can't they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using <UNK> is too unrealistic and childish better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it i just want to go back to <UNK> era where movie like <UNK> and <UNK> were having thrilling action scenes the sound effect was not very effective in those days but visually it is much better than current era scenes br br this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors please don't make any more action movies until you <UNK> the art of making it realistic
<START> a chinese ghost story stars the late great leslie cheung as <UNK> <UNK> sin a <UNK> tax collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted temple where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman called <UNK> joey wang when <UNK> discovers that <UNK> is actually a ghost who has been forced to seduce victims for an evil tree spirit who <UNK> on <UNK> life force he decides to try and free the girl by giving her remains a proper burial <UNK> the help of <UNK> <UNK> wu ma a crazy <UNK> monk <UNK> successfully <UNK> the tree spirit but must also do battle in hell against the evil lord black to whom <UNK> is due to be <UNK> br br the first hong kong film that i saw which wasn't purely martial arts action a chinese ghost story opened my eyes to the incredible world of asian fantasy horror a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghosts bumbling innocent heroes sword wielding <UNK> monks monstrous spirits and dark <UNK> of the underworld i instantly fell in love with the film's <UNK> energy humour <UNK> and visual excellence br br two decades later and this amazing movie still remains one of the finest examples of its genre that i have <UNK> <UNK> breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly <UNK> horror comedy fantasy and romance with superb direction from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> excellent editing from david wu stunning cinematography and a whole slew of imaginative special effects including a <UNK> killer tongue a many <UNK> monster and multiple flying heads a chinese ghost story is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish
<START> about the worst movie in distribution right now i love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so i thought why not oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school there are so many gore <UNK> out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film doesn't dignity i know it what it takes to make films and i'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making meat market but none of that money and time went in to making it good you need actors a script a real camera <UNK> in some books on how to make independent films i don't know how you got a dvd release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or <UNK> their head on the wall in gore films it is quality not <UNK> the effects are weak i was so angry that this is actually in stores and that i couldn't get my money back please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to <UNK> i know i'm being very harsh i only had 10 lines so i'm trying to get to the point
<START> this is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and <UNK> aren't enough to make a good film sure the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of los angeles in the thirties i especially liked the view of the <UNK> approaching the tunnel and the <UNK> rising up the <UNK> but in a sense this fine cinematography is self <UNK> because it creates a mood that <UNK> going to happen and nothing does the script too keeps <UNK> toward some plot or action or trauma and time after time not delivering not even delivering the i assume theme of the movie the characters' essential <UNK> the lead actors both too pretty for their roles didn't convey any <UNK> or agony and the script didn't expose us to any br br now donald sutherland that's another story his character was so well fashioned so perfectly played that i wanted the camera to follow him
<START> there are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that br br 1 the people who made this documentary including the director and the producer are <UNK> or of serbian origin therefore the <UNK> of <UNK> fails for instance they mentioned that the <UNK> <UNK> the so called <UNK> played a huge part in the fall of <UNK> but they didn't mention that there were equal serbian <UNK> as well <UNK> for you who aren't that familiar with <UNK> ww2 history the serbian so called <UNK> that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped british <UNK> during the war well that's only half the truth they were also a fascist <UNK> group who <UNK> with the germans but then switched side when hitler started losing the war it's also ironic that they don't mention the <UNK> leader <UNK> in the documentary a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of <UNK> all over <UNK> and <UNK> but they mentioned a certain <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> allow me to be just a little suspicious br br 2 most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown and i've studied this war for a long time who is the old british lady she really hasn't made her <UNK> and they are not even presented by name so they could more or less be anybody maybe someone they took from the street who knows br br 3 in the documentary they talk about <UNK> and how the <UNK> have lived there for ages and therefore it should belong to <UNK> even though they are a minority well when they mention the serbian dominated part of <UNK> <UNK> suddenly the <UNK> are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long fine but what people don't know is that the largest city in <UNK> <UNK> has great historical importance for the <UNK> people it was there where one of the most celebrated kings of <UNK> history <UNK> was <UNK> and therefore the city has a historical value for <UNK> the <UNK> arrived almost <UNK> years or so later but no the <UNK> should have <UNK> and <UNK> according to the documentary is that fair to me it looks like double standards of morality from the director plus it is said in the documentary that the <UNK> <UNK> didn't have any laws about minority rights this is a lie because it was one of the first laws <UNK> because of the fact that <UNK> had a huge serbian minority br br 4 the film mentions a radical <UNK> <UNK> leader called <UNK> or the muslim radical <UNK> they accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war yes they were <UNK> but if you want to talk about <UNK> why not also mention the serbian radical <UNK> leaders such as <UNK> and <UNK> the flaws are so many that i just presented a few of them just so that people get an <UNK> of the documentary it looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the <UNK> because they were afraid that their serbian relatives would slap them or something there aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality but the best so far is the death of <UNK> where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed e g <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of <UNK> and the war br br one other thing i saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the us gave support to a country <UNK> that had connections with bin laden during the war well first of all all the countries involved in this conflict had <UNK> <UNK> and because the <UNK> muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity <UNK> they were called muslim <UNK> they had to rely on something else besides <UNK> to raise the spirit among the people and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common their religion and they took help from the <UNK> because no one else would support them they had to fight the 4 <UNK> largest army in europe they needed all the help they could get <UNK> is the best way to <UNK> a people during war history has shown us that
<START> one of my sisters friends <UNK> me this game and it is too damn hard it carries the appearance of a kids game but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes to improve your <UNK> you also have to find these <UNK> hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them and i am only up to stage three maybe if you have no life <UNK> can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this but otherwise keep away and it is <UNK> not recommended for kids they will pull their hair out within the hour
<START> first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema the all <UNK> passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or worse slightly ridiculous br br <UNK> manages to avoid all the <UNK> and delivers a moving sexy thoroughly engrossing tale of love disaster and possible redemption while <UNK> touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence br br the core story is of mathieu 18 a <UNK> <UNK> boy who meets <UNK> <UNK> more <UNK> but just as lonely while on holiday with his family as the summer <UNK> on they fall in love and when the holidays end decide to live together a year later the relationship ends in catastrophe <UNK> <UNK> on mathieu who <UNK> tries to take his own life he survives and in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the <UNK> town where they first met this time <UNK> in the chill of winter br br if the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does much of it is implied all of it happens non <UNK> br br the intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced through the use of <UNK> and <UNK> perspective fortunately the three time lines used the summer of love the post suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of <UNK> are colour <UNK> warm <UNK> and <UNK> for the summer an almost <UNK> chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming <UNK> and blues for the winter <UNK> br br both main actors put in excellent performances though whilst it's a delight to see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> used to his full capacity i'm more used to seeing him under stretched in <UNK> <UNK> rather limp dramas <UNK> <UNK> mathieu has to be <UNK> out for special mention you can feel his loneliness then his almost <UNK> passion then his character <UNK> behind a wall of <UNK> beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could br br the themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling our difficulty in <UNK> fully the shifting <UNK> of <UNK> the film's title <UNK> <UNK> almost nothing points to all of these and indeed to one of the key scenes in the film in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself a psychiatrist asks <UNK> if he had ever cheated on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> well <UNK> once but it was nothing <UNK> still loves mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt none of which we see and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever because something that seemed nothing to him a meaningless affair is everything to mathieu br br whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et <UNK> poster would suggest it is not without hope we get to see <UNK> slow painful attempts to get back in touch with life first through a cat he <UNK> then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre who may be his next love but here the story ends a teenage passion over within the year another perhaps beginning so what was it almost nothing certainly not when you're living <UNK>
<START> ever wanted to eat worms here's a <UNK> to show you how yeah the kid eats live worms and that's about the most interesting part of the movie br br this movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring i'm totally in <UNK> here the movie just doesn't go anywhere unless you're fond of worm eating this is one movie it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for because nothing much happens br br now on the technical side they should have given that kid a <UNK> who's he trying to look like anyway <UNK> the clown it was almost comical i almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something br br and on top of that the kid was way too <UNK> to ever look hungry should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming br br all in all this movie nearly put me to sleep and my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting br br i will admit that the scenery was very impressive and had there been a decent story to go with it it might have made a hit br br it did seem safe enough for kids to watch the bear scenes and the <UNK> <UNK> were too weak to <UNK> most kids and the brief <UNK> <UNK> scene didn't show anything br br i gave this one a very generous 3
<START> this one is tough to watch as an earlier reviewer says that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii particularly the <UNK> of <UNK> it is clear that as of the middle of the war we knew exactly what was happening to the jews the sequence that shows a transport is vivid almost as if based upon an actual <UNK> the nazis liked to record their atrocities knox as the nazi is brilliant he <UNK> the course of a nazi career that <UNK> is particularly telling when <UNK> with the reactions of other germans at first laughing at hitler then <UNK> and finally helpless that contrast however <UNK> us to believe in the <UNK> of one young nazi officer to an anti nazi stance that did happen as witness the several attempts against hitler most notably the <UNK> plot which occurred as this film was coming out a strong film effectively using flashbacks accurately <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and others that would occur once the war ended
<START> loved the movie i even liked most of the actors in it but for me ms <UNK> very poor attempt at an accent and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms davis they would be laughed off the screen br br i really think she <UNK> this one <UNK> now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much more br br i guess i just don't <UNK> bette davis i've always thought of her as an actor that <UNK> <UNK> no matter what role she's in the possible exception is now voyager br br i'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful and i hope civil detail how i am totally wrong on this but i'll continue to watch the movies she's in because i like the stories writing supporting casts but i'll always be thinking of different actresses that could have done a better job
<START> there are bad movies terrible movies even boring movies i can watch most and put up until the end not this time avoid this like the plague annoying music throughout terrible editing no comedy its <UNK> than a novelty <UNK> my <UNK> wanted to watch this thinking it would be <UNK> blonde material or something kind of watchable but never better than average chick flick its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button br br the girls well they were not great to start with denise done ok in starship troopers and wild things but you have <UNK> to the <UNK> i feel like a <UNK> having spent 30 minutes on this pamela anderson is almost <UNK> after much construction work to her face br br please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable <UNK> and brain cells <UNK> at the utter <UNK> that is on your screen
<START> this is the final episode we deserved at the end of the last season things were left in a <UNK> goes <UNK> mood which was hardly the wrap up that this realistic series deserved while not a happy show this series was always one that made you think a rare thing on television and this is no exception <UNK> death justified by reasoning ' <UNK> morals <UNK> of society or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power ' <UNK> is a just death and can it exist ' all of these questions and more are <UNK> by the writers of this show every week and this is their final <UNK> fine acting great writing wonderful camera work brilliant editing clean direction if you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran then get a hold on a copy somehow if you never watched the series when it ran then this will stand up on its own but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are <UNK> to in their varied <UNK> for those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons this is very satisfying viewing
<START> its not sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a great career but taken as a whole because there are no famous personalities the film seems more realistic than some high budget well cast films br br a film made for a few bucks that is worthy of watching should give hope to all those would be film makers and <UNK> actors br br the problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time tv was taking over the <UNK> of the film industry and this film could have easily been shown on tv in 1950 all the fare on tv would qualify for a g rating the film industry began to make more adult films that could not be shown on tv during the days when tv wouldn't dare show the sex and skin of today's commercials
<START> <UNK> <UNK> popular i love the 80's is an inane idiotic offensive and downright disgusting pop culture mess of a show that was the first in a long line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of <UNK> which was at one time the only real music oriented channel left on tv i used to practically live on <UNK> up until the spring or winter i forget which one now of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever out of sheer morbid curiosity i'd guess that's what you'd call it i had decided that i would go ahead and give it a look see anyhow the first night it came on even though the <UNK> looked like complete crap at least i can honestly say that i wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement level to begin with the emphasis of this show i found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't <UNK> significant or popular which is what i was expecting to see but instead more of an <UNK> platform for a whole slew of really god awful no name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills rolls eyes more like lack thereof if you ask me it's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so called humor that i swear i could feel my intestines <UNK> up with each and every <UNK> one liner they shot off one after another altogether i have no problem in saying that i love the 80's was is trash of the lowest <UNK> and one of the main reasons why i almost never watch <UNK> anymore
<START> everybody just seems to be raving about the subject and not really <UNK> how the movie was made the deaf mute guy is fine the underdog wins that's good the <UNK> aspect is great but the movie is average overall i think it could be made much much better than it is br br the plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real life event i'm sure the movie could have been made more interesting the songs are just stuffed in there and i had to literally forward the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles br br good acting though watchable
<START> i guess it's jack's great <UNK> ability that makes him the powerful performer that he is but empathy comes at a price like all things when he's surrounded by mediocrity he <UNK> <UNK> the standard and becomes one with it he is a joke as a mafia hit man also because the part doesn't suit him one bit him being so <UNK> and just <UNK> avoids making a fool of himself in this kathleen turner had a much <UNK> long career just by being tall and blonde because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes when she opens them wide which she's convinced is <UNK> damn sexy and <UNK> huston is the absolute same granted interesting in everything just like robert <UNK> br br the movie is a lame draft and this will be the only mention of the <UNK> they call script of a gangster movie with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after party faster they certainly gathered the party going elite in this what did they shoot it in 1 day cause that would be the only explanation
<START> me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so demanding to watch however the movie greatly <UNK> my very low expectations br br it is so much more than just a representation of a century it has very real portrayals of the characters within it and most of the actors do an amazing job the different stories are baked together with actual footage from the time that gives it a very unique touch while watching it i really felt that i cared about what happened to the characters br br i would also like to give endless amounts of praise to julia stiles in her portrayal of katie she was great in a way that stood out br br i would recommend this movie to anyone
<START> a pretty memorable movie of the animals killing people variety specifically similar to <UNK> in that it stars an aging character actor in this case a step down a bit to the level of les <UNK> who puts in the only distinguished performance i've seen him give in a role as a man whose life is <UNK> and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have <UNK> him yes this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable so that you will cheer when they die and really the selection of actors locations etc couldn't be better at giving the film an atmosphere of <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> character is <UNK> <UNK> and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip <UNK> music when the local preacher <UNK> down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local <UNK> as bait for his snakes and his friend gets married to a stripper thus <UNK> his ritual <UNK> night band concert he goes on the rampage in the process creating a memorable pile up of <UNK> beneath the cliff where he <UNK> the <UNK> after <UNK> of their unfortunate owners one amusing game you can play while watching snakes is to place <UNK> on which cars will land the <UNK> down the cliff br br all in all very cheap and exploitative but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies
<START> in 2005 george w bush started with his second period as a president of the united states north korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons <UNK> john paul ii died after a long illness and a movie called into the blue appeared the existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year but the film itself was pathetic and maybe the worst one from that year now in 2009 the united states have another president there is another <UNK> new korean nuclear weapons and the film into the blue 2 the <UNK> which is better than the original one but that's the same as saying getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut this sequel is a really bad film which kept me tremendously bored and <UNK> the cast of into the blue 2 the <UNK> is composed by tv series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight but who are perfect for showing their bodies chris <UNK> the o c david <UNK> heroes and <UNK> laura <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lost and <UNK> <UNK> the hills bring hollow and boring performances i have liked some previous movies from director stephen <UNK> <UNK> and bill and ted's excellent adventure specially but on this movie he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension emotion or entertainment the characters from this movie are not only badly performed but they are also repulsive honestly i wanted all of them to die the cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes <UNK> videos for <UNK> <UNK> into the blue 2 the <UNK> is a horrible movie which is better than the original film but that's the same as nothing as i previously said avoid this crappy film at all costs
<START> <UNK> <UNK> curiosity with insects and cinema <UNK> into a short film about a love triangle between mr beetle an artistic <UNK> and mrs beetle the rather simple story of an <UNK> beetle couple that both seek <UNK> outside their marriage is similar to a <UNK> or <UNK> short of the time <UNK> twist on the story is to use <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> the legs in frame by frame animation the story builds as mr beetle is <UNK> caught on camera with a <UNK> from the local nightclub by a jealous <UNK> when mr beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend he chases her around <UNK> but eventually <UNK> her and takes her out to see a movie however mrs beetle soon learns of her husband's <UNK> as the movie they watch is the jealous <UNK> footage of mr beetle and the <UNK> together mrs beetle <UNK> mr beetle with her <UNK> mr beetle jumps through the screen and they both end up in jail after the <UNK> they wreck catches on fire the insects are placed in <UNK> settings such as a house or a nightclub and are given human characteristics of jealousy anger lust and revenge the <UNK> characters carry <UNK> drive <UNK> and even wear shoes yet they also <UNK> their <UNK> and open and close their <UNK> as real insects would the novelty of the story doesn't wear itself out even after multiple viewings but as fluid as the movements are the film moves slowly action happens with intricate detail but <UNK> and a <UNK> pace of filming is lost in the process despite its pace the film is an excellent example of <UNK> early <UNK> and is highly recommended
<START> i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of disney this movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and i have been looking for it i would have to say that out of all the kids movies i saw back then this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once i really hoped i would get to see it again the story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory to this day i never did see it after that day back in the 70s in fact i never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today <UNK> it to me i loved it and want my kids to see it does anybody know where i can find it
<START> this film may have a questionable <UNK> because it was made for tv but it is one of the best movies i've seen the film and its actors won several awards it is gripping fascinating and it will <UNK> you completely the story of a chase for a killer in iron curtain russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction but it's ostensibly a true story i highly recommend it
<START> unlike many i don't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive its execution however is another matter entirely like so many b minus movies all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers for most of the 22 or so minutes we sit in <UNK> anticipation any <UNK> of real humor or at least something to keep one from <UNK> with the remote or counting carpet <UNK> with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful the comical over <UNK> and <UNK> of some cast members might be well suited to a late night <UNK> but not a <UNK> sitcom even a canadian one notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle i cannot help but think this is mainly a <UNK> shot by the cbc to <UNK> the success of corner gas unfortunately they got the tone and the script completely wrong for the <UNK> the final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town why are they so hard to find in <UNK> did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown <UNK> <UNK> as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon and that the rest of the world <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> quickly forgets this <UNK> embarrassment of a sitcom
<START> the only reason i give this movie 8 10 stars and not 10 is because 1 sinatra is awful and 2 the love interest of kelly's character leaves much to be desired imho do love that dean <UNK> quantum leap al is the little boy the dance sequence with jerry mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences i have ever seen tom and jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter's i'm 28 and she's 4 so while the character is less iconic than mickey he is still a favorite of many children and adults today kelly is as always captivating his eyes full of fun and excitement in every movie i have ever seen him in he always steals the show one of the best dancers of the 20th century it is no wonder paula <UNK> <UNK> kelly's moves i would also list gene kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century if you were to watch only one part don't miss kelly's dance with jerry mouse you will not be disappointed
<START> i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this 4 the <UNK> theater was full and at the end it received a standing <UNK> this was classic peter falk if you are a falk fan and displayed a lot of chemistry between the peter falk and paul reiser characters the film's title seemed to long and too odd sounding to me i am surprised this didn't make it into general release this was far better than the majority of junk that the major studios throw at you maybe too adult in that it was <UNK> to the baby <UNK> and senior audience a lot of people could relate to situations in this movie this will probably enjoy a revival of sorts years from now when people look back at this film and consider it a kind of a gem i would rate this 8 0 to 8 5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it
<START> and a few more no s on top of that voodoo academy is without a doubt the least ambitious film of all time what exactly is it trying to do tell a story obviously not as has been pointed out most of it's just barely legal guys <UNK> themselves could it then be an attempt at <UNK> <UNK> well maybe if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most <UNK> and <UNK> forms of male contact which is to the delight of none repeated about <UNK> thousand times well it is sort of a horror movie is it trying to scare us not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and <UNK> of his work br br never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less this is the most boring and unnecessary thing i've ever seen it's like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror zombie and gay movies puts them in a <UNK> then runs them through a coffee <UNK> only instead of it being the kind of coffee <UNK> that <UNK> out coffee <UNK> it's the kind that takes out everything vital edgy or in any way interesting the result is <UNK> minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water only without the ability to <UNK> you after the 10 day <UNK> <UNK> that will inevitably <UNK> you if you watch this abomination of human effort
<START> the filmmaker <UNK> andy <UNK> art his search for <UNK> with the land and the water and his sense of <UNK> and so gently so beautifully <UNK> it back on to film for the rest of us rivers and <UNK> loves <UNK> work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world a world that hides its power in plain sight see this movie
<START> this tear <UNK> written by steve martin himself is so unbelievably bad it makes you sick to your stomach br br the plot is pathetic the acting awful and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending br br avoid at all costs
<START> one of the most underrated movies i've seen in a long time bill ted's bogus journey is the second hilarious adventure of bill s preston <UNK> and ted theodore logan aka <UNK> <UNK> there are two ways to look at this film first you see dumb dialogue far fetched plot juvenile idea or you see brilliantly <UNK> idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains throw a bruce willis or a arnold <UNK> into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie bill and ted go into the story with the same level of sincerity only it's bill and ted this is a <UNK> fence to balance on but when you watch the movie not as a throwaway screwball comedy but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure it becomes so much more
<START> a group of models is seeking an apartment to live in and are shown one by a local real estate agent unknown to the models and the agent however is that <UNK> <UNK> is in the apartment and when crossed the demon <UNK> is <UNK> to kill all those in his path the story is told by sam bishop a journalist who was accused of the murders br br although i am a champion of low budget <UNK> and independent films i cannot praise this movie the creators take pride in their 24 hour shooting schedule and at least one actor boasts on the dvd of his acting <UNK> but i cannot wrap my head around this why make a film in 24 hours if an extra one or two hours of editing would make all the difference and why pride yourself on acting that is poor nonsensical and results in the bad delivery of a handful of lines br br through much of the film the models are being shown parts of an apartment by a real estate agent the dialog is clearly ad <UNK> because no scriptwriter could come up with such empty <UNK> the agent also clearly knows nothing about <UNK> she focuses on aspects of a home that no one could care about <UNK> explains the heat source didn't she see the <UNK> and says the <UNK> problem will be solved when they call the terminator please write a script some <UNK> is fine but this was a mess br br and why were the girls moving in models their careers had no point in the plot and this seems like a forced situation at one point an actress breaks character and says something to the effect of dude they're going to be upset which sounded more natural than any other line though out of place because of the other bad dialog br br the demon made no sense i appreciated the attempt to explain how <UNK> <UNK> jumps to random places on earth including apartment <UNK> but why not explain where the demon came from his background involves a man whose love is killed by another man how does this make you a demon also why did we need all these victorian flashbacks with no dialog and <UNK> across a field it was overdone br br the dramatic pauses between lines was awful the sam bishop character was by far the worst with the <UNK> not far behind does every question require a pause a funny face and a response followed by a pause a funny face and a response i was so frustrated to me the only point was to drag the time out but i'd rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of horrible delivery and then more time is wasted by rolling through the same credits twice br br who was the sam bishop character anyway allegedly he saw all this and was accused of killing the girls but yet at no point was he ever in the part of the tale with the girls so how did he see them and if he didn't how did he know <UNK> killed them and if he didn't see <UNK> how does he know <UNK> is the spirit of <UNK> i was so lost was there even an outline for a plot when this was written br br the only part i found enjoyable in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom not that it was really important or anything but it was the only break from boredom i was given i wonder what director felix diaz was thinking his music is very good see the dvd behind the scenes for his <UNK> playing but i wonder about his movie making skills although by far the best part of the dvd was the trailer for his superhero <UNK> the trailer alone was better than this entire waste of time br br i am sorry i have to be so harsh i'd like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in 24 hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality film but if superhero <UNK> is any indication diaz can make quality so why did he choose to avoid that here perhaps the world will never know
<START> a student filmmaker <UNK> a b grade actress a <UNK> <UNK> ish molly <UNK> to complete the horror film that her mother a dreadfully dull <UNK> <UNK> tried to make 12 years ago it's a curious plot choice to say the least as any aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors the film has a curse on it because molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set but she's back because she needs the exposure unfortunately the curse is still there and people start dying on the set cut is an aussie attempt at the modern slasher but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table in fact it rips half of wes craven's 90s filmography lots of film world name dropping a la scream except it's aussie name dropping jane <UNK> see how this isn't as funny and lots of is this real or is this a movie a la new nightmare the editing is bad the music is annoying the effects are laughable almost everything is bad about this fortunately the film can have a sense of humor at one point a well dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at don't worry we'll treat your house as if it were our own to which he responds that doesn't mean anything to me you look like you live in a dump ha and <UNK> ridiculous one liners were enough to not regret renting this one you got any <UNK> coke in here as she rides in the film <UNK> car and does anyone know where i can buy any <UNK> the first thing she <UNK> on the set and where the hell is my agent oh wait that's what i was thinking for her
<START> i just saw this movie on hbo and it was really good a tragic love story indeed i really appreciated the fact that the guy at the heart of the story had lost the use of his legs in an accident it's rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically handicapped the love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life nicely portrayed how i'd like to think love can <UNK> someone's heart laura <UNK> all of 27 when she made this movie was great as the woman so full of life she's able to revive this guy's heart unfortunately since his family is wealthy and <UNK> is not problems develop br br it's playing on hbo some more times this month check out the schedule here http www hbo com <UNK> schedule <UNK> action detail detail focus id <UNK>
<START> there seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net those who hate it and curse ralph <UNK> name and those love it and call it work of <UNK> i'm inclined to be in the middle <UNK> forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film e g the cruel cutting of the story badly <UNK> <UNK> over acting etc but <UNK> this i still love this film the <UNK> when done properly adds an eerie <UNK> dimension to the <UNK> and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic the <UNK> scenes when the <UNK> chase <UNK> are stylish and well executed and the musical score magic sadly the bad points <UNK> film but if you can bring yourself to ignore them it is a great film br br no doubt i'll be <UNK> by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing this review ah well such is life
<START> this film is another of director tim <UNK> attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his <UNK> to the screen he has done it with <UNK> sleepy <UNK> and now this this is not a remake the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has <UNK> that can speak and <UNK> heston makes a cameo burton has <UNK> the entire story <UNK> it down for today's mass <UNK> br br the original planet of the apes was a product of its time during the 1960's america was struggling to <UNK> its civilization it was a <UNK> time of soul searching and <UNK> social <UNK> it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior <UNK> to be treated as equal in that context <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day <UNK> was an extremely intelligent film that <UNK> difficult questions and <UNK> held the <UNK> of american society up to <UNK> by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior the <UNK> between colonel taylor <UNK> heston dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and dr <UNK> kim hunter was thought provoking and intelligent with <UNK> both subtle and obvious br br <UNK> version is as much a product of today's times as <UNK> was of the sixties this is apes for <UNK> it is superficial and <UNK> <UNK> politically correct <UNK> for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance the <UNK> ending is utterly <UNK> and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel while the ending of the original <UNK> <UNK> tied everything together in a single powerful scene <UNK> ending simply <UNK> the audience <UNK> i know something you don't know and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out ' br br from a technical perspective as is always the case with <UNK> film the film is excellent the makeup is fantastic and <UNK> <UNK> is outstanding though i continue to dislike his dark look however thirty three years of <UNK> in <UNK> makeup can not compensate for the <UNK> vacuous script br br the story has been reduced to a monster movie the humans band together behind captain <UNK> mark <UNK> to fight the monstrous apes aided and <UNK> by a few <UNK> notably helena bonham carter as <UNK> the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence perfect for today's fast food mentality br br the acting is mixed mark <UNK> is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role <UNK> is excellent at playing dark <UNK> characters that are tormented but strong this part requires an inspirational hero a profile not in <UNK> <UNK> helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the <UNK> is laughable she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace <UNK> and love sick teenager br br then there is tim roth his is a <UNK> performance single <UNK> saving the film from total ruin roth is <UNK> hateful as the <UNK> general <UNK> he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time additionally his physical acting is <UNK> rendering a <UNK> man that is such a perfect <UNK> that one can almost believe that the species exists br br this film is a great disappointment it is decent entertainment as long as you check your brain at the door i rated it a 3 10 from a technical perspective it is much better than that perhaps a 9 10 however the story is an insult to the original franchise it is simply another attempt by burton at self <UNK> using a familiar title to attract <UNK> to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is of course it's true but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films instead of simple minded <UNK> <UNK> for mass <UNK>
<START> when this first came out 6 months after the tragedy i didn't want to see it i didn't want to open old wounds i <UNK> it now i have seen the movie thank god i did it shows you the bravery of all the <UNK> and <UNK> i <UNK> you it offered me closure i can now move on with my life
<START> i've read a few books about bonnie and clyde and this is definitely more accurate than the beatty <UNK> version in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang particularly well done is the death of buck <UNK> and the capture of his wife <UNK> this actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of <UNK> <UNK> over her dying husband however this movie is still hollywood and our anti heroes stay pretty to the end even after being shot full of holes in life bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous <UNK> and did not look like a <UNK> <UNK> at the time of her death the script is tedious and the acting is poor particularly the leads very disappointing stick with beatty and <UNK> <UNK> may not be the true story but it's a great film
<START> i'm not going to approach and critique the theories of raw i mean this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well made and not a site <UNK> philosophy br br having said that this video really blows it's one talking head shot of raw after another some of it is <UNK> video so you can see how he has aged over the years and that's pretty cool but otherwise the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous br br it's a strange comparison but i kept thinking of the sunday afternoon when i watched some of the barbra streisand star vehicle funny lady another really bad movie after a while i was so <UNK> on barbra i kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldn't appear in you know a meanwhile other characters in the movie were up to something else moment but it was all about barbra well this video is <UNK> funny lady br br so if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of raw while he <UNK> on with his theories assembled in a lame structure that doesn't add any interest or insight then be my guest for me i couldn't take it after 20 minutes
<START> i have seen this movie more than several times on tv i always watch it again never turning the channel this movie is full of chilling surprises and absolutely edge of your seat suspenseful without being overbearing or stupid helen <UNK> talent is <UNK> shown in this movie i recommend this movie to anyone
<START> this is just a joke of a movie they lost me already at the opening scene <UNK> dangerous creature kills other creature in his cage this is watched by a scientist that works there on a <UNK> and guess what she does well lets go in to the cage to check the stuff out <UNK> how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on thats the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your <UNK> pretty useless and even more dumber and i will not even talk about the cast because they aren't worth the effort why they didn't fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to me and this kinda <UNK> continues the entire movie only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low budget movies br br if these kinda things don't bother you go see it but be warned if your iq is above 60 you will probably hate it
<START> aka demons iii br br made for italian tv although shot in english and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier demons films it was supposed to be simply titled the ogre which is how director <UNK> <UNK> had released it br br an american family <UNK> an italian villa for the summer the woman virginia <UNK> has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine <UNK> of this villa an <UNK> this <UNK> like structure hanging down from the ceiling it <UNK> and is covered in <UNK> and has what looks like spider or <UNK> legs hanging down from it it <UNK> what looks like green paint br br of course the husband doesn't believe any of this the villa just is old and <UNK> and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it br br but then the ogre itself appears in what looks like some kind of <UNK> <UNK> costume with what looks like a <UNK> head attached to it and it's attracted to the <UNK> of <UNK> br br the films isn't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring there's no real gore other than some <UNK> rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool the ogre itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family's <UNK> <UNK> br br the copy of the <UNK> dvd i watched was <UNK> with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film a flaw i hope <UNK> has since <UNK> extras include a short interview with <UNK> <UNK> where he explains how this wasn't a sequel etc etc along with some trailers to other <UNK> dvd releases this is pretty standard stuff br br 3 out of 10 br br
<START> phantom of the mall is a film that fits best in the easily forgotten category it's a pretty lousy <UNK> on the famous story by <UNK> <UNK> the phantom of the opera not a bad idea to itself but the plot and production of this movie are way to weak to bring a decent homage to that story on the bright side <UNK> <UNK> doesn't has to turn over in his grave just yet it could have been a lot worse br br phantom of the mall has too many useless flashbacks in it and way too many boring sequences to make it memorable also the <UNK> wanted to give too much <UNK> to the story than necessary and even though there's a lot of mystery getting build up about the character of eric the basic plot is ordinary and <UNK> <UNK> spoilers it's about a young couple that brutally gets torn apart because the boy gets killed in a fire that fire was set to his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home in order to make room for a huge mall to be build the boy survived the fire and he has hidden himself in the mall to avenge himself meanwhile he guards his girl who now works in the mall and tries to forget her loss end spoilers this pretty simple but rather effective plot gets <UNK> by lots of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories while it should just be an entertaining horror movie it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller and that's not what the fans look for there are a few innovative killings but they're not satisfying enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie and besides phantom of the mall could have used at least a bit of humor this entire production the cast included takes itself way too serious br br i'll try to finish with a few positive aspects like for example it stars ken <UNK> die hard horror fans will certainly recognize him as peter for dawn of the dead that's like the horror <UNK> that yet has to find an equal even though his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessary it was good to see him again tv movie fans will also recognize morgan <UNK> as the mayor she's a fine actress and an elegant lady <UNK> shore is also in this but i can't stand him so my opinion about him may be a bit biased and finally a bit of praise for the leading actress named <UNK> <UNK> she's an extremely beautiful girl and she does have a bit of talent too bad she never made it to the top actually this movie is her biggest achievement and that says enough about her career
<START> the title of this film is taken from a party game called seven minutes in heaven the game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in junior high school in brooklyn ny and he describes it as something like spin the bottle <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> kissing games according to the rules a boy's name and a girl's would be drawn and the chosen ones ordered to get into a dark closet together and to stay there for seven minutes in the meantime there would be <UNK> among party guests as to whether or not the two had the nerve to hold hands embrace and or kiss each other in the <UNK> of the closet at the end of seven minutes the game leader would say <UNK> up or knock on the closet door and the couple would emerge from the closet after being <UNK> by the other guests the couple would have to admit what they had done during their seven minutes in heaven then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had <UNK> the couple who admitted to doing the most would be the winners of the game br br such games have served as social ice <UNK> for children and teens but they can be embarrassing and <UNK> to shy individuals the film has been given this title because it deals with the <UNK> first experiences with <UNK> and romantic love
<START> spoilers br br what is this movie offering out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot it is sad to see denzel <UNK> talents go wasted in <UNK> like this we are certainly hinted how the <UNK> cannot save themselves outside forces needed possibly <UNK> american ones and we know the father is a shady character he is a mexican after all unlike the wife who <UNK> <UNK> more because he is american he killed all of them thinking she died and did she of course she won't she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the hollywood fan the trade off scene was the only thing that <UNK> me from rating it below the <UNK> successful as some critic pointed out <UNK> the <UNK> of such movies will take time to go it is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt <UNK> <UNK> 7 7 for a movie like this and 7 0 for my own private <UNK> go figure mine will be in the range of 3 5 4 0
<START> though structured totally different from the book by tim <UNK> who wrote the original 'the <UNK> <UNK> it does have the same overall feel except for that <UNK> style is less business like and more <UNK> the beginning is great the middle is fine but the <UNK> is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour it is a shame american films can't be as open an <UNK> as this one where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject <UNK> <UNK> stays always within the boundaries of good taste <UNK> <UNK> tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years when you'll leave the cinema you'll be moved what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more
<START> this show was laughably bad the writing sucked the dialog sucked the guy who played craig couldn't act his way out of a paper sack being it was on <UNK> night this was definitely great to watch with some beers cool music bad acting poor writing all came together for my entertainment br br it was a drama unintentional comedy i don't care what happened to any of the characters they were all boring and stupid the first five episodes were the worst since they couldn't reveal who the victim was they had to write the dialog around it which was terrible i mean the <UNK> at the funeral was ridiculous actually all the scenes that occurred in the present were utterly horrible br br so let's review everything happening in present time sucked the flashback scenes only the writing dialog and <UNK> acting sucked the music ruled though
<START> i watched this on the tube last night the actor's involved first caught my attention the first scenes were attention <UNK> some funny some sad good character development i felt that the latter third of the film <UNK> if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching i kept watching wanting to how how it tied together br br unfortunately i feel that it never happened i especially did not like the <UNK> period that several of the character were talking <UNK> was that the other shoe br br would i recommend no i think not as other reviewers mention much of the <UNK> is dated 60's <UNK> but it was not too distracting the ending totally turned me off
<START> this is a formula b science fiction movie and the director made no bones about it it is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team everything done is stuff you've seen many times before it is a weak script with no real characters in fact it is full of stereotype characters and situations the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie with no attempt to fool us and that gives this movie a mild appeal but it isn't something you're likely to remember a while it is best seen while you're cooking cleaning working out sort of mindless fun it has its place in entertainment but it certainly isn't something you sit down with friends to watch unless you're all just drunk and don't care the mass rating of 3 2 is probably fair i don't think it is as crappy as most people but i am surprised that some people in the <UNK> thought this was spectacular that really <UNK> me as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film
<START> being a big fan of <UNK> horror movies i expected from his western a bit more than i got well i was entertained all right i had almost as many laughs as watching mel <UNK> blazing <UNK> br br see the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the <UNK> of the old west you can kill time by counting them if there happens to be an otherwise boring scene going on and the horses seem to have <UNK> in them too considered the fast forward chases see also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number that reminds of a certain <UNK> dance from <UNK> here decades before the style was invented hope the saloon around them won't <UNK> br br in the middle of all this mayhem the main actors do a decent job ireland garland and hayes are all truly fine a special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from <UNK> <UNK> but doesn't quite impress the same way but there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this just like a really bad old horror movie it might fail one way but succeeds to give joy anyway that is one of the reasons <UNK> work appeals to me and that is why i dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance
<START> this document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the united states thought about the september <UNK> attacks this film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on u s <UNK> the aftermath of this disaster is <UNK> from many different countries and perspectives i believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point it also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks and some of the pieces are actually funny but not <UNK> so this film came highly recommended to me and i pass on the same feeling
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br <UNK> played by gary busey before the name became <UNK> with the character in the simpsons is a typically <UNK> cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten avoiding the cliché of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to mexico where a top secret american super tank with incredible <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> has been <UNK> through only to be taken hostage along with the crew by a gang of terrorists br br this cheap looking even by 80s standards boring little action film was a bizarre career move for gary busey after making an impression as the flame haired villain mr joshua in lethal weapon he just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here edgy and zany as ever with <UNK> being his trademark put down for the bad guys but without the material to back him up henry <UNK> has presence as a screen villain but he's totally miscast here as an arab leader in a red <UNK> and the awful script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogue that make his performance come off as laughably wooden he's just one of a host of action film character actors including l q jones and lincoln <UNK> who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix after a dull first half without much exciting action things do pick up a bit at the end but it's too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun
<START> the larger than life figures of <UNK> <UNK> and bat masterson and the <UNK> of george armstrong <UNK> and sitting bull <UNK> over director anthony <UNK> hugely entertaining first western with james stewart although stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece with the eponymous one in a thousand <UNK> passing through the hands of many colorful owners including a <UNK> <UNK> john mcintire especially great and outlaw dan duryea who's even more despicable than usual the film's <UNK> of fiction and history produces a <UNK> pace and an <UNK> tone brilliantly in step with <UNK> <UNK> down <UNK> <UNK> film making his themes of psychological <UNK> and past <UNK> present <UNK> <UNK> this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a <UNK> gun but they <UNK> emerge in a <UNK> about a husband's <UNK> and failed attempt at <UNK> and are defined in stewart's conversations with sidekick <UNK> mitchell <UNK> use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns instead of <UNK> at <UNK> from <UNK> he <UNK> them into the drama as characters that <UNK> <UNK> or evoke the human characters' goals just as mountains <UNK> and <UNK> had to be <UNK> for in the naked <UNK> here a <UNK> occurs amidst the loose rocks and <UNK> of a small mountain a physical <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled <UNK> i would be <UNK> in not <UNK> cinematographer william h <UNK> contribution particularly his <UNK> day for night open range photography not merely an <UNK> <UNK> mann presents an equally vivid picture of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dodge city primarily through <UNK> multiple plane staging the shooting contest does not depend on <UNK> camera shifts or <UNK> cuts for effect because mann <UNK> knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest <UNK> of information in a given shot nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue relying on the actors' eyes or a well chosen image to convey the stakes one scene in particular serves to explain his attitude <UNK> telling of stewart's motivation to shelley winters which is interrupted by the climactic <UNK> that soon enough reveals all light without feeling <UNK> intense without being overbearing winchester '73 seems more modern than its <UNK> and is a joy to behold
<START> i guess if you are into the sci fi and horror stuff it might be interesting the acting was okay but not great the two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty one at the time the plot is okay but the story does jump around a bit leaving one guessing whether you're in boston or <UNK> the priest seems to use <UNK> speed between the two the catholic church is portrayed as having a <UNK> <UNK> for investigating events which only happen to those of that faith what if the two girls had been <UNK> would the <UNK> of cared therefore some what contrived who knows some day the catholic church might even learn what the bible teaches if you miss this one don't feel you've lost anything
<START> part ii or <UNK> known as <UNK> is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as part i because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of che guevara once again i'm impressed by the cause and effect that both parts have in their <UNK> stories we're reminded again and again that the lead character che guevara is an <UNK> some of the men in <UNK> army chose not to take orders from a <UNK> and now that che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in bolivia he doesn't get much respect from his new army and the natives either only because he's a <UNK> br br as far as technical goes i think part ii would've been more helpful if before everything else right after the display of the map it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to <UNK> memory about his characters and what he's set himself on doing to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in cuba but they don't work in bolivia it is clear now in this segment that che is not as charismatic as <UNK> castro in bolivia he's dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it it's said that the <UNK> for revolutionary is love well they don't give a damn that much about their country so it's a tough sell it's excruciatingly painful and difficult for che to get the others to buy into his vision br br i like one particular scene that illustrates che's <UNK> condition a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly che tries to direct it and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there he forgets he's a doctor and he becomes this desperate soldier who's stabs his own horse his army is like a horse that doesn't want to be led but at the same time the film drags it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that you'll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part you get <UNK> left and right by one <UNK> after another but maybe that is the intention of part ii if so then it definitely works standing <UNK> to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of che's last breath this movie may not answer the questions of why che guevara was so stubborn why he was so determined he could pull it off even <UNK> the odds were against him and why he deeply wants south america to have the same fate as cuba but the movie che is a story worth telling
<START> in a series chock full of brilliant episodes this one stands out as one of my very favorites it's not the most profound episode there's no great meaning or message but it's a lot of fun and there are some fine performances br br but what makes it really stand out for me is that it is to my knowledge the only twilight zone episode with a double <UNK> ending the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story but this time you get a surprise and think that's that but it turns out there's another surprise waiting i just like that so much that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes the other being a deeper more message oriented one
<START> damn i thought i'd seen some bad westerns can't top this one though hell i think i'd rather have my eyes <UNK> open for a <UNK> triple feature for <UNK> out loud i dont think i'll be able to watch ben <UNK> again without laughing my ass off just really bad br br but hey if you like stupid westerns with acknowledged stars in the thing take a <UNK> at shoot out with gregory peck it's just as bad but much funnier 1 10
<START> have no <UNK> this is a morality story granger is the troubled ex buffalo hunter tempted back to the <UNK> one more time by kill crazed taylor granger can see the end is near and feels deeply for the cost of the hunt on the <UNK> the indians and the land itself taylor on the other hand admittedly <UNK> killing buffalo or indians to <UNK> with a woman ' while <UNK> role of the tortured hunter is superb it's taylor who steals the show as the demented <UNK> <UNK> out for the fast buck and the <UNK> there's not a lot of bang bang here but the story moves along quickly and we are treated to a fine character performance by nolan the theme of this story is just as poignant today as in the <UNK> man's relationship to the land and what's on it and racism considering when this was made the censors must have been <UNK> their <UNK> during the scenes in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> relationship with the <UNK> and much of the dialogue although downbeat this is truly a great western picture
<START> the plot of <UNK> returns to earth as a <UNK> monster died out in the 1950s mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the <UNK> <UNK> doesn't humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters and that the first film to use this plot the <UNK> experiment was the only decent sci fi movie to use the idea so the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start alas watching the incredible melting man it seems the plot is the least of its problems br br first of all this is an incredibly badly made movie the budget is in single figures and i'm talking about <UNK> not dollars there is no cinematography to speak of and there's countless editing <UNK> for example a photographer takes his barely legal model for a photo shoot cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him then cut back to the model where the sun is br br the lack of budget drags the film down in other aspects too according to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers couldn't get any stock footage of <UNK> so when astronaut steve west mentions how beautiful <UNK> looks we get footage of the sun actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human actors wouldn't be employed by a porn studio if i was appearing in this i wouldn't be scared by the eponymous monster i'd be terrified of <UNK> from the rest of the cast perhaps we should be slightly <UNK> though since the obvious lack of budget <UNK> itself in things like the actors having to wear their own clothes a general for instance doesn't wear his nice fancy dress uniform complete with <UNK> he wears a <UNK> jacket and baseball cap br br there has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level the tone is set early on in the film where mr <UNK> murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital instead of the police getting a call saying there's been a murder dr nelson just decides to track down his patient on his own own same as he'd look for a missing cat it's also strange a thoroughly <UNK> homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone <UNK> but this is typical of a film where horny 70 year olds stop their car down dark roads for a <UNK> and people <UNK> mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there's a monster on the loose br br the incredible melting man is z grade rubbish i can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it does reach the heights of it's so bad it's good but apart from rick <UNK> sometimes impressive make up effects it's nothing more than a very guilty pleasure
<START> i am curious is really two films in one half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with political <UNK> whatever the director's intention the two don't really <UNK> together the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics there is a bizarre mixture of political war <UNK> dr king serious political interviews <UNK> breasts and <UNK> hair the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie other than the interesting sex scenes you'll be bored dry watching this film unlike many other reviewers i think the nude sexual scenes are overdone for what it is if you want to see real porn i'm sure there are better choices the <UNK> nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is i think the cast did a fine job however they played their parts <UNK> there is little of the over the <UNK> i'm so used to seeing in the american films during this time
<START> elephant walk 1954 starring an early peter <UNK> as lord of the <UNK> in some god <UNK> plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad <UNK> staying out in the <UNK> sun and going <UNK> well eventually they do after the <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> of course and much mayhem ensues taylor replaced an <UNK> <UNK> leigh in this pot <UNK> adventure flick when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand <UNK> i still get <UNK> <UNK> thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day one of my favorite guilty pleasures in color too
<START> this show is one of the worst shows of all time absolutely no original jokes and they're always a year late like in 2009 they will finally say something about michael <UNK> <UNK> all of the cast members are people who wanted to be on s n l but had to go to the lowest of the low mad tv its an hour of mad magazine jokes witch aren't funny to begin with told by terrible john stewart wanna <UNK> so if you have any problem tell me id love to hear the opinion of the 3 people who watch this show family guy put it well <UNK> bin <UNK> was hiding in the one place no one would look the cast of mad tv there is a reason why no one watches the show
<START> personally i think <UNK> was the greatest movie he ever made it touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy and brando should have won for best actor anyway the movie is awesome the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it do so and fall in love
<START> stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films professor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> the <UNK> of his <UNK> formula with the ability to reverse <UNK> after twenty years ollie and stan are the <UNK> <UNK> that arrive to do their job and very quickly ollie wants to get away from stan making mistakes ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the <UNK> but stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic after breaking an <UNK> stan gets a replacement a loaded gun from off the wall and of course it fires the brush off stan goes up to have a look and ollie standing on the attic door of the roof falls into the <UNK> stan asks if he was hurt and ollie only answers with i have nothing to say ollie gets back on the roof and he and stan end up in a <UNK> and pull <UNK> which ends up in ollie falling down and destroying the <UNK> ollie <UNK> in the <UNK> is hit on the head by many <UNK> coming down and the butler <UNK> sam adams is covered in <UNK> ash smoke oh and ollie still has nothing to say to stan the boys decide to clean up the mess and when stan tears the carpet with the <UNK> ollie asks can't you do anything right and stan replies i have nothing to say getting the <UNK> <UNK> on his head as ollie holds a bag for stan to <UNK> in the <UNK> they get distracted by a painting on the wall and the <UNK> end up down <UNK> <UNK> so stan gets another <UNK> <UNK> on the head professor <UNK> finishes his formula and does a final test on a duck with a drop in a tank of water changing it into a <UNK> he also shows the boys his success turning the <UNK> into an egg and he next <UNK> to use a human subject i e his butler while he's gone the boys decide to test the formula for themselves but ollie ends up being knocked by stan into the water tank with all the formula in the end what was once ollie comes out an ape and when stan asks him to speak all ollie ape says is i have nothing to say and stan <UNK> filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film it is an enjoyable film stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the <UNK> comedian very good
<START> to call this anything at all would be an insult to everything else some <UNK> might describe it but still too positively normally one ignores this kind of rubbish but it was so stupid that one can but despair would have though that even americans and commercial tv stations would have given this piece of s t a miss but as the germans say <UNK> die <UNK> <UNK> die <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics spider man has been framed by a mysterious <UNK> the city is being <UNK> by a strange gas and <UNK> like those of <UNK> and carnage are appearing all over the city who is behind these crimes could it be doc <UNK> well he seems to have turned over a new <UNK> <UNK> also does not seem to be involved as he is just <UNK> off that spider man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later <UNK> will unravel the mystery the fighting is basic not to hard to pick up the fights with the bosses are rather fun you get to collect comics you run out of web and it is somewhat fun <UNK> the city however that is also a weak point the swinging is not all that great as all you do is <UNK> through the city as spider man seemingly <UNK> his <UNK> to the sky you also do not have much <UNK> web <UNK> either especially compared to a say spider man 2 movie video game still it makes up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story so be prepared to see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doctor <UNK> and carnage for one wild action packed ride
<START> how to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach br br it's actually a story of sidney young simon pegg breaking through in journalist and magazine writing business which is interpreted in a funny way simon pegg made an ok appearance slightly worse than his usual movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that but it has its moments and those moments are really hilarious br br i recommend this fun and worth watching american with english cream comedy to all people who just wanna sit relax and enjoy movie for what it is if you're about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start <UNK> it
<START> it is fitting on a musical sunday to get your heart a <UNK> and no one can do that better than little richard the man could sing the <UNK> off the ladies and defined rock and roll br br look to leon to provide a definitive characterization as he has done so with david <UNK> in the <UNK> and jackie wilson in mr rock <UNK> roll the alan freed story br br this was a fascinating biopic as we saw little richard struggle with his father with his church and with himself over just who he was he won the battle and there is no one else that has his voice or his style
<START> problem child is one of the worst movies i have seen in the last decade this is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents but he gets into trouble later that junior can drive <UNK> car he can scare people with a bear he can put a room on fire it is a bad movie as much as battlefield earth a sequel is an even worse fate rent chicken run instead br br 1 2 out of i give it
<START> do we really need any more <UNK> garbage on the baby <UNK> generation technically i am a <UNK> though at the time when all the idealistic <UNK> of the '60s were reading marx burning their draft cards and generally <UNK> a war which destroyed <UNK> of thousands of lives i was still in grade school but i remember them well and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools who would believe anything as long as it was destructive br br this is just another <UNK> in self importance from the kids who never really grew up
<START> nyc <UNK> the <UNK> effect <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of water power and food and new <UNK> population has topped 40 million this is a little gem of a picture not least because a <UNK> <UNK> future is a reality for us 21st century citizens br br the low budget opening titles of this movie are great set to music a low tech <UNK> <UNK> sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973 depicts an <UNK> american <UNK> developing into a <UNK> and crowded hell in less than 2 minutes <UNK> and <UNK> it's truly memorable budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints at odds with the story's brilliant premise the police station sequences are like an episode of some 70's tv detective show and the other interior sets look basic at best the budget probably all went on trying to <UNK> the soylent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> apartment with state of the art <UNK> meaning the other costumes are <UNK> some establishing shots are <UNK> <UNK> and the daytime <UNK> seemingly all shot through a smoke <UNK> br br the memorable scene where <UNK> and thorn charlton heston share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly <UNK> their society they enjoy real <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> apple and <UNK> and we really sense their lip <UNK> appreciation of someone else's wealthy <UNK> br br <UNK> pivotal death scene in which his character is willingly <UNK> at a place called <UNK> depicts him immersed in images of the world's once beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> as he remembered them beautifully <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> realization that the future has been <UNK> among other horrors br br this is one smart film and its core message is as <UNK> today as it was in the early 70s yes i know we're not eating the dead yet but with our <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> poverty gap corporate global capitalism and <UNK> <UNK> destruction leading to climate change the lasting <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> may come to pass
<START> this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a <UNK> <UNK> on not only the british film industry but the talentless <UNK> at work today not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors so what went wrong i don't know and simply i don't care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot a <UNK> of a man is setup by his evil friend and co worker out of his father's company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid very stupid plot twists devices i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather what about lock stock thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film
<START> i originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven't much changed br br documentary about the infamous edward d wood jr covering his life and movies there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him they include <UNK> <UNK> fuller bela lugosi jr loretta king gregory <UNK> and paul <UNK> interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre <UNK> it is interesting somewhat but was this really needed i've seen all of <UNK> films and they're just terrible wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out i wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there do we really need a <UNK> on a very mediocre film maker i do like the fact that they didn't try to make wood out to be some sort of saint more than a few of those interviewed especially lugosi jr pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s still it's of interest if you're a wood fan the best interviews are with <UNK> who tears wood apart and <UNK> fuller a long time girlfriend
<START> this movie does not really promote kids to be <UNK> and have better attitudes as a family movie should and this wouldn't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldn't be seeing not the best abc family film if you ask me if there were less sexual themes in the movie then maybe it would be better hollywood isn't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations there's really no reason for them at least this is a tv movie i wouldn't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it if you have other things to do other than watch this movie please proceed to them
<START> i have read the whole 'a <UNK> in <UNK> book and then saw the movie the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was <UNK> pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really <UNK> in with too many effects and bad acting br br a <UNK> in time is about a girl named meg charles wallace and <UNK> must team together to find <UNK> father and get off the island <UNK> br br the beginning of the film is really a stinker the acting is awful the direction is laughable and so far the situations aren't necessary i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine <UNK> that wrote the book and created the movie made a great book and a terrible film the acting is worse than any straight to video acting yes i got to admit there was cool effects but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie i wish could give it a 0 but sadly i can only give it 1 a half could have been useful
<START> power rangers the completely awful kid's show from the 1990s still continues to <UNK> young children with it's complete cheesiness and awful settings br br this show was not entertainment it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing kids how to fight one another in order to solve their differences br br the toys were further <UNK> in how to promote a violent television show and such br br i have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show ever was br br as such it remains one of the worst kids shows ever made
<START> for a movie that gets no respect there sure are a lot of memorable quotes listed for this gem imagine a movie where joe <UNK> is actually funny maureen <UNK> is a scene <UNK> the <UNK> character is an absolute scream watch for alan the <UNK> hale jr as a police sgt
<START> this movie is actually funny if you'd like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it it's called blonde and <UNK> so don't expect profound and meaningful jokes what this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two <UNK> it's just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends especially if you're not too sober lol pamela and denise are still pretty hot chicks it's a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art c'mon this movie is about <UNK> it's supposed to be light funny and superficial one more thing i do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will
<START> the old mill pond is more of a tribute to the african american <UNK> of the <UNK> than any <UNK> of the entire race <UNK> <UNK> caricature notwithstanding besides who i just mentioned there's also frog or fish versions of cab <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> baker bill <UNK> robinson and louis armstrong this happy <UNK> cartoon from hugh <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is very entertaining <UNK> with perfect characterizations all around they all sound so much like the real thing that half of me thinks they could possibly be if not they're certainly very <UNK> <UNK> even the lazy <UNK> <UNK> characterization gets an exciting <UNK> here when he gets chased by a tiger as hold that tiger plays on the score highly recommended for fans of <UNK> animation and jazz music
<START> i did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the <UNK> to be four brothers with their teacher <UNK> and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> so <UNK> here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and i believe that the old <UNK> series was much more better than that new one which contains <UNK> as a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the <UNK> we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action we wish to see more new of <UNK> series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle
<START> this was no <UNK> or guy ritchie film it was a big <UNK> it wanted to be an edgy nervous laughter urban life <UNK> film but it's more of a camera jerky mess it's a lot easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters from the beginning i couldn't care less about the characters or what they were involved in they were always always hitting <UNK> or crying on each other only there wasn't any substance to what they were doing the dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so i could be wrong
<START> i am a massive fan of the book and <UNK> is certainly my favourite writer ever since studying animal farm at <UNK> i bought the dvd out of sheer curiosity burton is an actor i hold in high regard so when i heard that he played the role of o'brien i was <UNK> br br i watched the trailer on the dvd first and some fears started to set in mostly regarding the frankly terrible theme song hearing the <UNK> <UNK> shouting 1984 over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds br br the acting on a whole is pretty good burton and hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the <UNK> of truth towards the end can be felt especially in the harrowing room 101 scene however this is also where the movie is let down the movie spends too much time focusing on the love affair between winston and julia which frankly isn't what <UNK> was writing about he was writing about a harrowing future about how <UNK> build up a mans beliefs and then <UNK> them all in the name of him being made to love big brother the movie <UNK> over what is essentially the most important part of the book <UNK> coming to terms with his position in life and the world and his re education via o'brien br br the comment on imdb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect julia is not present when winston visits o'brien they do not commit themselves to <UNK> <UNK> and confess their crimes there is no obvious mention of the initial instances where winston finds the article with the <UNK> but it does get mentioned near the end if you have not read the book it is completely confusing br br a terrible screenplay which some excellent acting cannot rescue michael <UNK> seems to have completely missed the point <UNK> was trying to make and the <UNK> sound track is frankly terrible
<START> this is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film <UNK> after all <UNK> <UNK> crush will have you know that real men don't watch anything by <UNK> br br it might have been interesting if <UNK> had anything to say here the camera as <UNK> <UNK> was nothing new have we all forgotten de <UNK> <UNK> thief or anything by hitchcock br br so all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as <UNK> who spends all his free time <UNK> up his <UNK> at the movies who <UNK> <UNK> discipline gets accused of <UNK> the many petty <UNK> and ultimately escapes societal confines to make <UNK> own <UNK> sorry been there done that too many times for this to matter
<START> a remarkable example of cinematic <UNK> at work with a <UNK> <UNK> of lead script penned by numbingly mediocre hollywood hack <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> no less being magically converted into a choice <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> 24 <UNK> musical drama gold thanks to <UNK> direction fresh engaging performances spot on production values a <UNK> recreation of 50's era new york an <UNK> <UNK> roll with the punches tone and a truly wondrous rhythm and blues score by the great curtis <UNK> br br the story loosely based on the real life exploits of the <UNK> <UNK> documents the <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> climb of three bright eyed <UNK> black teenage girl singers who desperately <UNK> to escape their <UNK> <UNK> ghetto plight and make it big in the <UNK> <UNK> world of commercial r b music all the obvious <UNK> of instant wealth and success <UNK> run <UNK> amok drugs corruption fighting to retain your integrity and so on are predictably <UNK> forth but luckily the uniformly excellent work evident in the film's other <UNK> almost completely <UNK> out <UNK> flat uninspired plotting the first rate acting helps out a lot irene <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> smith are <UNK> sexy vibrant and appealing leads and great singers to boot <UNK> fine performances are also turned in by a <UNK> <UNK> pre miami vice philip michael thomas as the <UNK> patient <UNK> manager <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dog boyfriend and <UNK> <UNK> baddie tony hell up in harlem <UNK> king as a dangerously seductive smooth operating stone cold nasty gangster the tone <UNK> and <UNK> from funny and poignant to melancholy and <UNK> without ever skipping a beat <UNK> <UNK> into a glowing uplifting <UNK> to the human <UNK> extraordinary ability to effectively <UNK> extremely difficult and <UNK> odds br br veteran editor sam <UNK> <UNK> himself superbly in his directorial debut bruce <UNK> <UNK> cinematography and gordon scott's expert editing are both flawless <UNK> firm grasp of period atmosphere keen eye for tiny but telling little details and <UNK> sense of busy <UNK> pace are just as impressive no <UNK> about curtis <UNK> impeccable soundtrack <UNK> either jump what can i do with this feeling <UNK> up take my hand precious lord <UNK> you baby and look into your heart are all <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> almost unbelievably fantastic songs with the <UNK> <UNK> love jones number something he can feel which was later covered by both <UNK> franklin and en <UNK> clearly <UNK> top musical <UNK> as the best ever song in the entire movie the net result of all these above <UNK> outstanding attributes <UNK> illustrates that sometimes it's not the screenplay so much as what's done with said script which in turn <UNK> a film's overall sterling quality
<START> ronald colman gives a terrific performance as a stage actor who really gets into his work when he plays othello on the stage he takes on the persona with dire results good film with a great supporting cast well worth watching
<START> i saw this movie first on the berlin film festival and i had never seen hong kong cinema before i felt like sitting in a roller coaster the action was so quick and there wasn't one boring moment throughout the film it has martial arts love special effects and a fantastic plot my favorite scene is when the <UNK> drinks sings and fights for himself one of the many scenes which stress the extraordinary musical <UNK> of the movie this film is a definite must
<START> i have a six month old baby at home and time to time she fights sleep really bad one morning she was having a particular difficult time getting to sleep when the <UNK> <UNK> theme song came on t v she stopped crying almost instantly and for the rest of the show was content i sat her in her <UNK> seat and watched her kick her legs swing her arms and actually laugh at this show the kept her entertained and happy the entire time i also got a video of them so that at times when my little one is <UNK> i have something to calm her granted late at night if she <UNK> with <UNK> to fuss the <UNK> <UNK> are not her cup of tea but they sure do come in handy when i need a little time to do <UNK> etc the biggest surprise about the <UNK> <UNK> is that my child doesn't even like watching t v she'd rather be in the floor playing with a toy or with our small toy <UNK> than watch t v yet the <UNK> <UNK> have totally captured her attention i don't know if she will continue to like them in the future but for now she's attached
<START> i thought what's new scooby doo was pretty bad yes i'm sorry to say i didn't like it since <UNK> <UNK> didn't produce it and it took a <UNK> step away from the old series when i heard shaggy and scooby doo get a clue was in the works i thought it could be better but when i saw a <UNK> of how scooby and shaggy were going to appear i knew this show was going to be bad if not worse i watched a few episodes and believe me it is just yet another teen <UNK> or <UNK> unleashed wannabe no longer are scooby and shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool creepy monsters that rob banks now they are going after a typical super villain whom wants to destroy the world shaggy and scooby doo have become more brave too also since shaggy is not going to be a <UNK> in this series <UNK> <UNK> whom actually is a <UNK> the original voice of shaggy will not voice shaggy he will only voice shaggy if he doesn't eat meat and that was just a stupid corporate done change to update the franchise as if the internet jokes weren't enough so scott <UNK> whom previously voiced red <UNK> on a <UNK> named scooby doo voices shaggy here believe me the voice is really bad it makes shaggy sound like a <UNK> 10 year old and i must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look however <UNK> does voice <UNK> uncle albert which is a sort of good thing scooby doo on the other hand does not look that well he seems to have been designed to look more like the cgi scooby doo from the live action movies also <UNK> frank <UNK> voice need i mention brain the dog again still hasn't improved <UNK> the robotic butler is practically worse than <UNK> doo he tries to be funny and does comical impressions and gives safety <UNK> remember kids don't stand under trees during a <UNK> but it just doesn't fit into a scooby doo cartoon again the <UNK> <UNK> sound effects are rarely used here however on one episode lightning strikes twice they use the castle thunder <UNK> during it almost <UNK> although they do still use the newly recorded thunder sound effects too scooby doo hasn't use castle thunder sound effects since 1991 but my question is why use castle thunder on shaggy and scooby doo get a clue while not use it on the direct to video movies or even on what's new scooby doo two episodes of <UNK> used it and it wasn't enough unfortunately if <UNK> and the <UNK> movies used it then they might be better than this crappy cartoon the day this show premiered i watched the first episode and it was so bad i turned it off after only five minutes to get my mind off of this poor show i rented scooby doo pirates <UNK> which came out around the same time and you know what the pirates <UNK> movie was actually better than shaggy and scooby doo get a clue and even better than what's new scooby doo and it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise the direct to video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs thankfully but whether you loved or hated what's new scooby doo i don't recommend it but if you hate the old series then you'll love it oh god i hope the old scooby doo cartoon stay better than this new anyways like <UNK> a really bad addition to the scooby <UNK>
<START> hood of the living dead is about a young scientist named rick who lives with his brother in the town of <UNK> where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets then one night <UNK> brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier desperate rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health the formula hasn't been tested on a human or even a dead body but rick is determined to bring his brother back to life he gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens so rick calls <UNK> and the body is <UNK> away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh now rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead hood of the living dead is one piece of trash the plot is a direct rip off of resident evil the acting is just horrible especially with <UNK> s fake crying for his brother the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out and the make up is just lame it's only fake blood covered over the actors face the zombies are also <UNK> they run <UNK> and must be shot in the heart to die zombies should only <UNK> <UNK> and must be shot in the brain to die this film is so horrible the <UNK> is the only true good moment of this film hood of the living dead gets a 3 out of 10 a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest
<START> i saw this movie once a long time ago and i have no desire to ever see it again br br this movie is about preston waters a hard <UNK> <UNK> who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash all this changes when a bank <UNK> runs over <UNK> bike and passes him a blank check as <UNK> preston uses the check to <UNK> 1 million from the bank ironically the money belongs to the bank <UNK> who gave him the check preston then buys a mansion and says that he's working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy <UNK> named mr <UNK> named after his computer after that he just goes crazy with the money br br on paper this sounds like a great idea however on screen it is one of the <UNK> movies i've ever seen for one thing it's too unbelievable i know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible but i draw the line at a twelve year old boy going out with a thirty year old woman and being put in charge of a imaginary person's small fortune also this was a shallow movie with weak acting a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable the characters were either cheesy over the top annoying or underdeveloped but juice was a funny character br br if you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family skip this one
<START> twin brothers separated at birth due to the deaths of their parents reunite twenty five years later to avenge their parents and take back their million dollar tunnel double impact runs at two hours long and basically adds no real approach to the <UNK> brothers plot and jean claude van damme while adequate as the evil twin brother is just embarrassing as the good twin brother also the action sequences aren't as exciting this time and jean claude relies more on <UNK> then on his martial arts also the supporting cast is wasted and at two hours the movie is just plain dull br br out of 4 bad
<START> i first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and i could not stop laughing everything about this movie seemed to click the storyline the characters the setting as far as film is concerned i wouldn't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic it gets it's meaning across the cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie <UNK> <UNK> fred <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and ed <UNK> are hilarious for this who haven't seen it i will give you a brief synopsis four criminals meet up in a small town in montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist however when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from new jersey they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose the film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of <UNK> eleven only with four criminals who can't stand each other and in montana rather than las vegas all in all if like to laugh i would strongly encourage you to see this movie
<START> columbo movies have been going downhill for years this year it may have reached the bottom peter falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie as is usual in this series crime scene <UNK> are <UNK> of so <UNK> is always lacking brenda <UNK> <UNK> the scenery and pulls <UNK> faces and andrew <UNK> is a pretty unconvincing <UNK> man his faint though was a hoot the script was by the numbers and its delivery <UNK> they should never have brought columbo into the nineties just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots better scripts and sharp <UNK>
<START> perhaps being a former <UNK> myself and having an <UNK> sense of humor <UNK> me from <UNK> this movie into the <UNK> festival <UNK> <UNK> it's not the greatest film of 2005 nor is it complete garbage it just has a lot of problems i also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> or any other reason this movie might <UNK> be called <UNK> and <UNK> abroad it was banned because the censors knew 99 of the russian film goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste <UNK> during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film br br so we have a strong opening shot wonderful sound design excellent premise laden with meaning and symbolism the usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film's strongest aspects not that the number 4 is a <UNK> visual challenge over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup an amusing and well written bar conversation among the 3 main characters and we feel pathos for these people the great country of russia the human condition and all that then the movie starts <UNK> down we begin to wonder what yawn lies ahead br br the rest is quite boring simply put sure the guy in the village <UNK> the <UNK> and there are some slightly amusing moments nice sound sure but the enjoyment of this movie not to mention the plot are seriously <UNK> by the pacing problems and this this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the nicely shot <UNK> misery and <UNK> is what ultimately will make people angry at the <UNK> stuff personally the main offensive scene <UNK> on being endearing in that pathetic way harmless <UNK> can appear br br if you want to watch an enjoyable movie where russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time the entire film watch <UNK> of the national hunt much more rewarding post soviet stuff so yeah a 4 out of 10 for 4 nice and symbolic of my post mediocre film condition
<START> i have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written the acting was not much more above the lower production values however i feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it in keeping with this thought i feel it is important to point out that one actor has <UNK> and <UNK> well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer i am referring to laura harris a canadian born actor who has <UNK> her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the hbo hit dead like me where she plays the role of daisy <UNK> and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner i remember having a typical <UNK> crush on the young actress during this series where she played ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent <UNK> <UNK> i felt as though if anyone might make it from this series it surely would be laura harris and true to her nature she did <UNK> in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique <UNK> blond <UNK> if you ever do have the opportunity to view this series i recommend that you have something epic to watch after <UNK> such as the <UNK> or perhaps <UNK> in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low budget reminder of what laura harris can simply state about her time on the show and i bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying it's a start
<START> oscar caliber performance by peter falk in an oscar caliber written role i loved the nuanced balanced exploration of a long time marriage how often do we get that in films where usually the movie ends when boy girl get together this is a movie for adults a complex view through the eyes of all parties husband wife son how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story on top of that it gave me about 10 major belly laughs and i'm one of those people who usually sits <UNK> when the rest of an audience is laughing this was one of the few truly funny movies i've seen great original jokes
<START> one of the worst films i have ever had the <UNK> of sitting through killer tongue is a horrible <UNK> of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the most <UNK> <UNK> would be taken in by it
<START> i had to endure teen aged high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show i really do not care about high school girls <UNK> about their relationships i've spent my time in hell dealing with such issues and i care nothing about fictional <UNK> going through <UNK> versions of the horrors i endured i want science fiction that's the only reason i'm here there were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show we finally see a <UNK> <UNK> it was good but with one problem its red eye <UNK> would lock onto an object of interest we all know that <UNK> <UNK> always <UNK> back and forth giving the machine a map of the world the red eye <UNK> does not ever stop moving back and forth br br i really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode
<START> i signed in just to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is besides being a rip off of executive decision or air force one or any other kind of terrorist story this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well it's hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid cliché ridden script to work with it's bad enough if you <UNK> once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence but when you find yourself <UNK> over and over again you have to conclude that the director also isn't the <UNK> <UNK> in the movie business nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place the mostly low rent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure not that being a part of this joke of a movie is going to earn them any awards or recognition it may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser i see no point in <UNK> the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case for to do so would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this <UNK> could <UNK> just as studying well made movies can inspire you how to make a good <UNK> put together work of art and beauty the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what not to do and what does not work be warned
<START> this was far and away the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life it was slow boring not scary not funny not dramatic not entertaining br br sarah michelle <UNK> was up to her old <UNK> of empty expressions of fright and shock she couldn't sell her character nor could anyone else in the picture br br for those who thought the grudge was <UNK> of <UNK> then don't go see this unless you get enjoyment out of wasting your time and your life br br i saw this movie for free by the way so i don't want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost 8 bucks on a terrible movie it was free it still sucked i hated it br br avoid
<START> the john goodman program was pretty awful but this thing just plain stinks the one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was <UNK> the voice of patrick <UNK> as <UNK> the story is hopeless written by somebody who has <UNK> memories of childhood <UNK> but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the <UNK> years paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit everybody is unpleasant and for no reason the plot is predictable but the show <UNK> from one inexplicable <UNK> scene to another in such a pointless way there is no fun in watching it the worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow
<START> everybody's got bills to pay and that includes christopher walken br br in vietnam a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of <UNK> including christopher walken following a mad max 3 <UNK> fight and a short massacre later walken and some <UNK> guy split a dollar bill promising something or other br br cut to the present 1991 and <UNK> guy is leading a revolution against el <UNK> he's successful at first but after el <UNK> threatens to crush folks with a tank he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television this is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on american telly which leads walken to <UNK> the old squad even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with in order to <UNK> <UNK> and gun down thousands of people br br <UNK> is a <UNK> stupid film but for all that it's also a good laugh and action packed too this is one of those movies where logic is given a wide <UNK> how else could walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from <UNK> or even breaking a window also it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in new york without the police bothering br br there's plenty of b movie madness to chew on here from michael <UNK> diabolical acting in the vietnam sequence to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes to the side splitting confrontation between walken and el <UNK> and let's not forget the <UNK> speech by the sister of the rebel leader being watched on television in america nearly brought a brown tear to my <UNK> eye that bit br br it's out there for a <UNK> buy it if you have a sense of humour see how many times you can spot the camera crew too
<START> if you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it then <UNK> is the film for you i love this movie from top to bottom this movie's picture perfect scenes look so real it's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama boy i tell you real drama they actually real fought in one of the scenes get the dvd listen to the commentary its not obvious i see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an ill <UNK> destiny after watching saving private ryan i have an a appreciation of what an ill <UNK> destiny is and know exactly how the men in the film feel i see this movie as a <UNK> between stand by me and saving private ryan what do men do when they are with a situation that's hard pressed in real life some men go crazy some men cry some men through <UNK> others do drugs some randomly sleep with <UNK> <UNK> trying to <UNK> the meaning of love from their life some try drink the pain away some jump off buildings or bridges some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse physically this movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball but don't get me wrong its not depressing movie its realistic its a very very humorous movie the cocky and funny <UNK> <UNK> character lights it all up and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movie i'll let you figure out what their in there for with dialogue war action sequences picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music this movie has it all like i said from top to bottom i don't why <UNK> is heavily under credited the best thing about <UNK> the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing the best film of the year and it absolutely falls nothing short of that keep the rare gems coming hollywood 10 10
<START> this film is worth seeing alone for jared <UNK> outstanding portrayal of john lennon it doesn't matter that harris doesn't exactly resemble lennon his mannerisms expressions <UNK> accent and attitude are pure lennon best scene lennon in a local <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> fan as to whether paul <UNK> <UNK> silly love songs is worthy of 1 status in america
<START> oh my gosh i thought cbs <UNK> television shows were the br br worst things <UNK> <UNK> appeared in br br four people are <UNK> on by a crazed mind control br br computer that's it don't rent it br br i saw this under one of its many titles grey matter and it is br br perhaps one of the worst films of recent memory the other br br reviews are right it is awful never have so many establishing br br shots appeared <UNK> never the cast is awful the direction br br is awful and the script is awful i cannot stress how awful this is br br avoid it like you would <UNK> br br this is rated pg for physical violence some gun violence mild br br gore some profanity and some adult situations
<START> i just saw this film last night in the 2006 <UNK> film festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before <UNK> them the film was simply awful i say that without <UNK> or <UNK> motives it was awful matthew <UNK> days as a leading man are way over gina <UNK> <UNK> an inexplicable and unnecessary english accent she should be ashamed of her participation in this film gloria <UNK> had a weird little cameo in it she should also be ashamed the script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters i highly doubt this will be picked up but then again people in hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes i really think <UNK> of fish is a serious <UNK> for the worst movie i've ever seen
<START> human <UNK> 1976 is in many ways a better film than it's predecessor the director knew what he had to work with and <UNK> towards <UNK> ray moore's limitations as an actor it's a fun movie that's more technically sound and acted the performers don't take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow <UNK> ray moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in <UNK> br br i enjoyed the film very much and i highly recommend it just like his first film it's <UNK> towards a certain audience i highly doubt that mr moore was trying to <UNK> his audience at this point in his career check it out br br <UNK> recommended
<START> spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead br br when this show first started i found it tolerable and fun fairly <UNK> was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked it also had high ratings along with <UNK> but it started to fall because of the following crap that butch <UNK> and his team shoved into the show br br first off toilet humor isn't all that funny you can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a <UNK> but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a cliché joke next there are the kiddie jokes lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross dressing <UNK> i just can't stop laughing at such gay bliss somebody help me but of course this show wouldn't suck that bad if it weren't for stereotypes did you see how the team portrayed <UNK> they saw them as nothing but <UNK> loving <UNK> throwing <UNK> who live in a hot desert but now is the coup de grace of why this show truly sucks the <UNK> of them all over used jokes the show constantly pulls up the same jokes the majority of them being unfunny thinking it is like the greatest thing ever <UNK> is mostly the one to blame i hated how they kept on mentioning super toilet which also has a blend of <UNK> humor in it just as well and <UNK> would freak out and who could forget that dumb <UNK> ram joke that every <UNK> parent in <UNK> would use in that one e mail episode you know the one in which every single parent oblivious to other parents saying it would utter the exact same sentence before breaking into their kid's room yes it may be first class humor to some people but it is pure s to others br br if i'm not mistaken i do believe butch <UNK> said something about ending the show thank god everyone around my area says it's like the funniest <UNK> show ever i just can't agree with <UNK> i think it's just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday only worse
<START> writing something genuine and true is challenging knowing how to shoot it and putting it together without making it trivial is even better <UNK> <UNK> movie is one of those where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty i have been touched by the big bad swim and from now on i will promote it as far as i can it is just a shame that i can't have something to show to my friends you know such as a dvd because talking is good but giving something to see is better everyone can't go to festivals to discover <UNK> like that and this movie's really worth to be put out there a big thank you to the staff of this master piece and i am waiting for it to be distributed
<START> roger corman is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors producers in history he was single <UNK> responsible for some of my favorite horror films ever like the edgar allen poe adaptations <UNK> of the red death and pit and the <UNK> as well as some <UNK> cheap and tacky rubbish <UNK> like creature from the haunted sea and she gods of the shark <UNK> corman also made a couple of movies that are simply <UNK> and  simply put  nearly impossible to judge properly the trip for example as well as this <UNK> titled gas s s s can somewhat be labeled as psychedelic exploitation in other words they're incredibly strange hippie culture influenced movies half of the time you haven't got the slightest idea what's going on who these characters are that walk back and forth through the screen and where the hell this whole thing is going the plot is simply and yet highly effective a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally unleashed and promptly <UNK> that the entire world population over the age of 25 this could be the basic premise of an atmospheric gritty and nail <UNK> suspenseful post apocalyptic sci fi landmark but writer george <UNK> and roger corman decided to turn it into a <UNK> road movie comedy none of the characters is even trying to prevent their inevitable upcoming deaths they just party out in the streets and found little juvenile crime <UNK> gas s s s is a <UNK> boring and tries overly hard to be bizarre the entire script appears to be improvised at the spot and not at all funny definitely not my cup of tea but the film does have a loyal fan base and many <UNK> so who am i to say that it's not worth your time or money
<START> stargate sg 1 follows the <UNK> <UNK> of a team named sg 1 through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the <UNK> br br having seen this series <UNK> for it's first few seasons when it first came out i didn't know how good this series would really be 10 years after i had last seen an episode my old impression was that the series was great but my impression was far from the truth stargate sg 1 is more than just a simple sci fi series it is one of the most well made interesting long running exciting sci fi ever produced and why because it runs on an amazing premise br br this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television as a medium with a suitable premise is able to provide something that doesn't work on the time <UNK> of film the sense of <UNK> created by a long running series watching the characters and their circumstances <UNK> with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief and it's all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show br br stargate sg 1 kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show br br the first few seasons perhaps up to the 4th <UNK> focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending <UNK> threat br br from the <UNK> to the <UNK> there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the <UNK> and <UNK> attacks on earth after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg 1 in a place of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> conflicts br br the <UNK> season is probably the most mixed one it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned but the last episodes feature some great <UNK> moments br br the <UNK> and <UNK> travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack <UNK> they are both good <UNK> although the first few episodes of the <UNK> season are a little weak because they seem to be about little more than sg 1 and human <UNK> losing battle after battle to the <UNK> br br basically after season 7 exploration was pushed to the background which in many ways was a shame because of the potential and mystery each planet episode presented on the other hand it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were br br even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest the feeling i have is that it could go on the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very <UNK> and would have been most welcome but ultimately things are as they are br br in the end because of the fact that i enjoyed everything it's a little hard to find that it ends the big picture however the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg 1
<START> this movie is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen from the very first scene i knew it would be a smash crash it starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission as it turns out the people in it were possessed by some random zombies well some years later some college kids are pulling some <UNK> prank horrible acting goes from <UNK> to the head jock things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non <UNK> manner with <UNK> over <UNK> and over doing the whole eager to be popular role what really took the cake with this one is the final battle absolutely horrible special effects with the guns for example guns making a noise with no <UNK> flash and vice versa this is accompanied by stop animation zombies why they move in stop motion is a mystery cheesy music and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere br br overall this movie is crap just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place
<START> watchable little semi <UNK> but hardly captivating still two or three funny moments what <UNK> me is how <UNK> and morally highly questionable <UNK> is she plays an <UNK> a leg problem yet she not only isn't the ugly <UNK> whom men <UNK> but she is even a man eater and we are supposed to feel for her oh poor little <UNK> with her leg problem poor little <UNK> she is constantly getting passes from men and even <UNK> them without so much as <UNK> at one occasion she even has a <UNK> one night affair with a blond stud and then she tells her newly found french girlfriend quite non <UNK> that it took him time to get an <UNK> makes us viewers wonder why she is so leg conscious if every guy wants to <UNK> her well almost every guy the only guy who really <UNK> her after seeing her leg wrapped up in metal is the guy working on the <UNK> but otherwise she seems to be doing just fine with men no <UNK> no lack of success with men and she throws them away like toys the way she dumped carradine was ridiculous poor little <UNK> girl i don't think so and yet we are meant to believe that this woman has a major confidence problem hence the scene in which she <UNK> to start playing the <UNK> for a solo concert and somehow manages to throw the notes on the ground out of <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the movie shows little or nothing that would suggest that she has confidence problems so this <UNK> scene is absurd and doesn't fit into the bigger picture i was also surprised how quickly and eagerly <UNK> makes friends with a french woman who is <UNK> a married guy on the surface the movie would appear to be a sentimental story of one crippled woman's struggle for acceptance or something like that but it's nothing like that at all the writer clearly shifts between this type of movie and a screw anything that moves it's the 80s kind of movie very confusing br br as far as her leg it's not like she has a big fat purple balloon growing on her <UNK> muscle she only has a normal looking metal <UNK> attached to the lower part of her leg so i really don't understand why the makers of the film try to make it seem as if she is a female <UNK> or something at the beginning of the film it's not like she has a twin head growing out of her neck though <UNK> is hardly a major catch kind of <UNK> but nothing special quite average br br but what the hell is carradine doing playing some kind of a relatively smooth guy <UNK> with <UNK> and her pal this guy was in revenge of the <UNK> but i guess it's the same thing with the <UNK> in the movies as it is with the <UNK> in politics no matter how ugly unable or dumb all the doors are open for a career in movies and politics respectively br br down with <UNK> br br if you want to read bogus <UNK> about the <UNK> and other hollywood <UNK> and morons contact me by e mail
<START> this movie makes me want to fall in love all over again i am <UNK> my next daughter <UNK> just so that someone who sings like <UNK> blue eyes can <UNK> her one day and feel the <UNK> i felt hearing it sung and it wasn't even to me i give it a 9 10
<START> my personal feeling is that you cannot divorce this movie from its political historical <UNK> like so many american reviewers tend to do this is not about growing up on main street usa it is about growing up in <UNK> at a time when it was torn between the east and the west just like the guys are torn between esther and everybody else and esther is torn between the <UNK> joe and the guys there is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under <UNK> i feel the movie is under rated and it is too bad we have lost the director movies like this make freedom feel more important it is not just another eastern european coming of age film it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom
<START> possible spoilers there is only one reason why i saw this movie and that was because i have a massive crush on richard <UNK> i don't know that much about humor there were some part that were funny like the <UNK> and ken spoof and the dealers and the president skit mind you this is sometimes raunchy dare i say crude it was at times funny but it could have been better probably if they spent more time in the humor and less time getting women <UNK> the movie would had been funnier some skits just make you want to gag and cringe others skits make you laugh and oddly enough think sadly this movie is dated if you have a mad crush on richard <UNK> so worth it it's worth checking it out and seeing chevy chase
<START> while it does crack the odd good joke the humour is generally quite dry with members of the <UNK> frequently pulling faces or <UNK> to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes br br unlike what an other comment says i don't think this is the best <UNK> have ever made its really dry and sarcastic sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren't really that good overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre its not as good as <UNK> <UNK> or dave <UNK> stuff i find benny hill funnier
<START> this is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its <UNK> minute running time it has all the right ingredients a mystery corpse a weary middle aged cop <UNK> walter <UNK> and his rookie sidekick <UNK> john miles a shadowy killer on the loose and even love interest for the <UNK> in the shape of a female <UNK> mary patricia wright who helps solve the crime there's also a terrific shoot out finale which takes place in a stone <UNK> yard br br watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where lt <UNK> refers to the dead woman as <UNK> <UNK> before the <UNK> reveals that she had a <UNK> confusing huh also later when <UNK> is chasing the killer across the back <UNK> he is suddenly shown going in the wrong direction at one point no wonder he didn't catch him
<START> <UNK> virtual reality the potential of computers communication with the past the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a <UNK> society and the fascinating <UNK> byron <UNK> portrayed by the fascinating <UNK> <UNK> this film should have been great but it is lousy terrible if you consider the potential the acting aside from <UNK> <UNK> and karen black <UNK> from tolerable to atrocious the plot construction is awkward to say the least the modern day <UNK> is a dull one note character but half the movie is spent setting up her character and then when <UNK> finally appears it is to <UNK> the events of her life not to present an engaging story <UNK> almost pulls this off though you never fully get to know her as a real person just an icon from a <UNK> <UNK> history paper br br the digital effects such as a digital dog and bird are lousy and distracting considering it was 1997 and not 1985 and finally the script is just bad bad often pretentious dialog especially the fights between the <UNK> and her boyfriend which made me <UNK> cold and distant characters and zero attempt to create a sense of wonder the <UNK> successfully contacts a person in the past astonishing but it hardly seems to surprise anyone and her boyfriend says well be careful although we're given no clue then or later why it might be dangerous and it never seems to actually be dangerous br br also despite being about computers and <UNK> <UNK> and her love of <UNK> it is clear no one involved with the script had any knowledge of <UNK> or computers any references to these subjects come across as complete <UNK> <UNK> that defies any suspension of disbelief br br one scene towards the end of the movie is quite good a <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> expressing her sadness at the <UNK> of life but her joy in that life poignant passionate and insightful it seems to be dropped in from another movie br br so i am disappointed in this movie because it is a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult film if you find the subject matter interesting you might want to rent it but be <UNK> see orlando for another much much better examination of gender roles in history with a great <UNK> <UNK> performance br br spoiler question br br at the end of the movie <UNK> asks that her memories not be <UNK> in what i thought was the best scene in the movie but then the modern day <UNK> seems to do it anyway <UNK> the memories into her little girl hence the title of the movie am i correct that the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wishes without even struggling over it or is this another confusing plot point that i'm <UNK>
<START> i'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie i saw it at <UNK> and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny i felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience but honestly the plot to this movie needed major <UNK> it didn't even make sense one second the characters question what exactly it is that they're <UNK> the next scene they're hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it also the ending just took the cake i'm not going to spoil the magnificent conclusion but it pretty much <UNK> right in with the rest of the horrible plot script see this movie for comedy if you must
<START> first things first edison <UNK> did a fantastic believable job as a <UNK> hit man born and <UNK> in the <UNK> and a <UNK> ring where he <UNK> his craft of savage <UNK> in order to survive living on the <UNK> of kill or be killed in a role that had little dialogue or at least a few lines in <UNK> <UNK> his performance is compelling probably what should have been in the jet li vehicle danny the dog where a man is <UNK> for the sole purpose of fighting and on someone else's <UNK> br br like danny the dog the much talked about bare <UNK> fight sequences are not choreographed <UNK> but rather designed as normal brutal <UNK> where everything goes this probably brought a sense of realism and <UNK> when you see the characters slug it out at each other's throats in defending their own lives while taking it away from others it's a grim gritty and dark movie both literally and <UNK> and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production br br edison plays a hired gun from cambodia who becomes a fugitive in hong kong on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry leading the chase is the team led by cheung <UNK> <UNK> who has to <UNK> with maverick member inspector <UNK> sam lee who's inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father so begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the <UNK> looking side of hong kong br br the story itself works on multiple levels especially in the character studies of the hit man and the cop on opposite sides of the law we see within each character not the black and white but the shades of grey with the hit man we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl <UNK> <UNK> bringing about a sense of maturity <UNK> and revealing a heart of gold the cop with questionable tactics and attitudes makes you wonder how one would <UNK> when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done there are many interesting moments of moral questioning on how anti hero despicable <UNK> are adopted you'll ask what makes a man and what makes a beast and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances do we have that dark inner streak in all of us <UNK> from man to dog and dog to man dog bite dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag especially on its tender moments and it suffered too from not knowing when to end if i should pick a favourite scene then it must be the one in the market food centre extremely well controlled and delivered a suspenseful edge of your seat moment listen out for the musical score too and you're not dreaming if you hear <UNK> of dogs br br highly recommended especially if you think that you've seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre
<START> <UNK> presents itself as a wall to wall <UNK> of screaming <UNK> overwrought hysterical <UNK> who are all <UNK> by regret guilt and pain <UNK> anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess br br a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were i just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long <UNK> into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused br br i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre <UNK> that open the film the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a <UNK> <UNK> pulling our strings would <UNK> at but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening <UNK> display i kept waiting for some form of <UNK> <UNK> to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek <UNK> throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a <UNK> of anderson <UNK> who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testament br br i will say that the music by <UNK> mann was great and i'll be looking for the soundtrack cd in short a good movie to look at and listen to the music that is if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been
<START> i hate this movie it is a horrid movie sean <UNK> character is completely unsympathetic her performance is wooden at best the storyline is completely predictable and completely uninteresting i would never recommend this film to anyone it is one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune to see
<START> this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre slasher movies but it's surely a damn bad movie br br the holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's poor production values and stupid plot i mean the sub genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac <UNK> teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far there is absolutely no <UNK> in the events or nothing else to add br br the <UNK> are more than boring the gore is minimal and so does the mystery br br this is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video <UNK> label br br i am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash
<START> fast paced and funny satire about that original reality tv the soap opera the script by playwright robert <UNK> is packed with one liners and ridiculous situations the best of them is the climax a live broadcast that quickly <UNK> into bad <UNK> and a brain transplant <UNK> <UNK> murdering of his lines due to not wearing his glasses is hilarious her brain will <UNK> explore within the next few houses the brilliant cast is on the same page as kline sally field elizabeth <UNK> cathy <UNK> robert downey jr whoopi goldberg <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> marshall and kathy <UNK> are all perfect it is a treat to see a cast click like it does in this movie this is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks br br p s the score by alan <UNK> is an added bonus it fits the soap opera with it's flamboyant and melodramatic air
<START> the only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is underused in the movie within the movie as usual tom <UNK> is good too otherwise it's c p the <UNK> doesn't even exist how does he magically change the letters on the theatre <UNK> to spell out the <UNK> lame
<START> it's great how this movie pulls you along i had honest laughs don't care that it's low budget cause the thing works for me to be honest my wife didn't really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film she did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string these characters who's lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world just keep going and be who you are dreams are what you make of them in watching this movie a second and third time i realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through what can i say i like my fun with some complexity anyway liked it hope to see more
<START> don't watch this serbian documentary and serbian propaganda look out for this documentary and you will see facts and truth http imdb com title <UNK> br br the death of <UNK> documentary series of five episodes is a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> account of the extended mass bloodshed which marked the end of the old federal <UNK> and <UNK> almost the entire first half of the 1990's it includes a huge wealth of news footage and interviews with involved parties both <UNK> and otherwise the only real improvement which could be made to this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the <UNK> since the program was made this was indeed done in the late 1990's for a repeat showing on bbc television but the addition of some even more recent events would help to complete this admirably detailed and <UNK> piece of work perhaps another whole episode might be <UNK> the very <UNK> title of this documentary was made all the more appropriate by the eventual <UNK> of the term <UNK> by the now named federal republic of <UNK> and <UNK> a much <UNK> and <UNK> admission of that which occurred years before br br not fiction like in <UNK> the <UNK> war 1999
<START> i think anyway is a kick ass movie really tom <UNK> spent like years making it and it shows every scene is polished has a meaning i guess most agree on that one thing many people tend to criticize is the lack of story i'm afraid that that's an effect of us being overwhelmed with traditional storytelling all the time i mean what you can achieve with a book you can't achieve with a movie what you can achieve with a movie you cannot achieve it by just telling it to a buddy the problem is that we're so used to movies series to be just a filmed version of a story a visual recording of events just like when you watch the news that we expect every movie to have this epic characteristics a strong storyline with a lot of unusual events and i stress the idea of unusual events most people see on tv in the news in movies series very unusual things once in a lifetime situations and here in anyway there are unusual events but not in the same hollywood big explosion kind of way guy gets fired couple back together car gets stolen and of course very usual things and that's strong just being able to appreciate all of that that universe that's art and i agree that especially what can only be achieved in movies that atmosphere created by the score and the photography is put central but not like in traditional visual movies visual blockbusters such as the matrix it serves the characters and remains deeply human i mean in every shot you feel the love that tom <UNK> has for <UNK> and urban lifestyle and he has no point with this movie like to learn us something and he has no big story to tell with incredible scenario twists he just shows everyday people with everyday lives he shows a city all with their good and bad sides and says this is us that's our city that's life let's enjoy it so basically anyway is not only that super <UNK> movie it also has a much stronger message it's not explicit maybe even not intended than most movies how really intend to pass a message one <UNK> now we'll have to wait five years to see the next <UNK> <UNK> and everyone will expect so much of it
<START> first i was caught totally off guard by the film's initial <UNK> and then i became totally enchanted with the unfolding story and <UNK> with the brilliant directing the characters were all fully developed not bigger than life but just like the people we live among anywhere we are in the world in sweden in turkey or in america all completely believable human beings with <UNK> and <UNK> hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful film it shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind every action to bring out the whole theme clear and bright and that shows the brilliance of the director <UNK> thanks to kay <UNK> and the wonderful cast for this superb treat
<START> sidney <UNK> is having trouble maintaining jobs at various <UNK> mills mainly because of his <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric one that never gets dirty never <UNK> or wears out when <UNK> eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the <UNK> workers who will lose their jobs and the owners who will lose money since one mill has the <UNK> rights so <UNK> in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in england the film is ideal and only ealing could have made it so <UNK> performance and a great supporting cast such as <UNK> <UNK> and parker and <UNK> direction make the film a delight but the real hero is the story itself a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama romance and suspense rating 8
<START> i saw the capsule comment said great acting in my opinion these are two great actors giving horrible performances and with zero chemistry with one another for a great director in his all time worst effort robert de niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time jane <UNK> performance <UNK> <UNK> all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character mostly because the character is so poorly written <UNK> like would be too swift an <UNK> for this film's excruciating pacing although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of <UNK> <UNK> watching it is a true <UNK> i give it 1 out of 10 truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that i have ever seen
<START> this is without a doubt the most offensive chick flick i have seen in years if not ever the writing characterizations are so <UNK> with stereotypes that the film <UNK> on parody before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster we were subjected to the following themes having a baby will solve all of your problems performer types are miserable <UNK> musicians can't be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle what a waste of a talented cast some great looking sets costumes when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life she'll end up <UNK> alone i felt <UNK> i can't believe this movie made it to theatrical release it's the sort of fare one expects from those women's cable channels that i always pass right by when channel surfing i am female and over 35 so i should be part of this film's target audience but boy does evening miss its target
<START> the film was shot at movie <UNK> just off route <UNK> near lone <UNK> california north of the road to <UNK> <UNK> you can still find <UNK> of <UNK> and iron <UNK> <UNK> across the rocks where the sets were built and you'll recognize the area from any randolph scott movie br br i won't bother with the plot since i'm sure it's covered elsewhere the movie stars three <UNK> fairbanks <UNK> who must have learned a good deal from his dad grant an <UNK> in his youth and <UNK> a professional boxer from south africa their physical skills are all on display br br not a moment of this movie is to be taken seriously it's about <UNK> a <UNK> in india <UNK> our english word thug i can't go through all the <UNK> of this movie but probably ought to point out that the director george stevens was a <UNK> with a background in laurel and hardy movies see his choreography of the fight scenes and went on to the infinitely long <UNK> of <UNK> and the diary of anne frank <UNK> rose and fell <UNK> <UNK> came and went while liz taylor and monty <UNK> <UNK> in a place in the sun here in his comic mode he excels br br this is a story of male bonding and it would be easy too easy to read <UNK> into it as many people do with howard <UNK> or hatred of women but it isn't that at all sometimes things portrayed on screen don't deserve too much in the way of <UNK> attention men will form bonds by working together in a way that women do not women share secrets read deborah <UNK> <UNK> idea of an anti feminist well when you think about it that's what evolution should have produced for most of human history about nine <UNK> of it <UNK> have been hunters and <UNK> and the men tend to hunt and the women to gather hunting is more effective as a team enterprise men who were not very good at bonding were <UNK> out leaving men who have a lot of team spirit and grant fairbanks and <UNK> have got it in <UNK> br br sorry to <UNK> on about evolution but i'm an <UNK> and it is an <UNK> disease did i ever tell you about the horse in <UNK> <UNK> that slipped on the <UNK> and fell in the <UNK> with me you've got to watch the <UNK> br br joan fontaine is lovely really only got to know her in her later years and wondered why she was in so many movies i lived in <UNK> california where her sister olivia <UNK> grew up and went to a convent school pretty place br br if you miss this adventurous lively <UNK> <UNK> of the british <UNK> at its height you should never forgive yourself it's so famous that it's <UNK> in the peter sellers movie the party yes the <UNK> got to know
<START> <UNK> has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the <UNK> realm of things even the idea of the universe being full of various different <UNK> of vampire all with different attributes many of which the characters have yet to find out about is kind of cool as well as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire i'm not sure how the makers meant for that to work given the nature of vampires who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i don't know as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of <UNK> <UNK> and vampires movies with a dash of aliens br br the action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative particularly of <UNK> but passable they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick including some of the comical blood <UNK> variety there is a lot of character stuff most of which is tedious coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny immature <UNK> primarily cowboy dude and asian woman there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors don't play it too badly but it mostly slows things down a nice try at <UNK> the characters out but people don't watch a movie called <UNK> for character development and drama the acting is actually okay michael <UNK> <UNK> it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot the space <UNK> aren't too bad for what is clearly a low budget work the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential the way things are set up <UNK> really does seem like the pilot for a tv series character dynamics introduced the world introduced but not explored etc br br the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable the scene where our heroes <UNK> a talking <UNK> puppet <UNK> type creature hilarious the sex scene wtf indeed the credit and michael <UNK> as <UNK> the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie it is painful to listen to and only <UNK> from what is only average at best br br basically an okay watch is you're up for something cheesy even if it is just for the <UNK> scene
<START> keanu reeves stars as a friend of a popular high school student who suddenly commits suicide he and his friends go through emotional turmoil and share their reactions to this horrible incident good acting by reeves and a young jennifer <UNK> but on the whole is a little too much 4 of 10
<START> the producers of this film offer to pay funeral <UNK> for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie they should have offered <UNK> <UNK> for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker a young couple moves into a house where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived extremely boring and very predictable in the end i ended up not caring about anyone in this movie br br avoid this one at all costs
<START> my first child was born the year this program came out and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter when the cd came out i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families it <UNK> becomes their favorite christmas album i recently found several dvd's made on dvd r from video tapes probably for sale on ebay the one i bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years there are some songs on the show that were not on the album and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever
<START> i only watched this film from beginning to end because i promised a friend i would it lacks even unintentional entertainment value that many bad films have it may be the worst film i have ever seen i'm surprised a <UNK> put their name on it
<START> wow i just finally managed after several attempts to finish watching this god awful movie only to learn that rick sloane and his production team have completed a straight to video sequel this year br br of all movies reviewed by mst3k and they truly dig from the bottom of the barrel screening the <UNK> bad <UNK> ' <UNK> ' 'the incredibly strange ' and the lesser know disasters like <UNK> ' <UNK> nightmare ' and <UNK> <UNK> ' this certainly has to be the absolute biggest pile of garbage they'd ever shown which makes it perfect for <UNK> very simple the movie is about a bunch of <UNK> like <UNK> on the loose <UNK> people's desires for fame fortune <UNK> and of course sex in ways that end up with people getting killed but this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous a test of <UNK> for example is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools the writing is so forced such as the <UNK> described scene of a <UNK> hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it if only she turned her head a quarter to the left and this isn't the first time in the movie this happens and the story is so rarely given attention hence the mst3k riff about a law in the future where films have to be made by filmmakers that you actually root for the <UNK> puppets to kill off everyone on screen worst movie ever
<START> while the <UNK> chemistry between ryan and robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie the supporting cast including matthau <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the hilarious trio of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> is an additional plus matthau shines as einstein <UNK> is perfect as <UNK> <UNK> fiancé and <UNK> line about <UNK> <UNK> is as has been noted one of the highlights of the film the speech that robbins delivers at his first appearance in public is sheer poetry kudos to the writers for handling this <UNK> with wit and <UNK> i also thought that <UNK> curtis was wonderful as <UNK> this might be considered something of a chick movie but i think everyone will get a kick out of it eight very solid points
<START> four porn stars <UNK> through the irish woods sounds like a film to watch we have ginger <UNK> allen <UNK> <UNK> taylor hayes and jenna jameson all together in one film are you <UNK> your lips well the mutant creatures who resulted from centuries of <UNK> were certainly <UNK> their lips as they <UNK> on the <UNK> of their victims br br yes there was some flesh exposed far too little considering the cast but it was soon ripped open to expose dinner for these creatures there was definitely some action that probably has not been seen before and more than one person lost their head in the situation br br unfortunately director christian <UNK> did not show much promise and i am not likely to watch his later efforts
<START> the point of <UNK> original novel indeed the point of the whole story is that things take place because of a carefully <UNK> sense of <UNK> the goal is survival within a particular kind of life style the novel is full of <UNK> the only relationship that rings emotionally true is that between <UNK> and his daughter campbell and that's only touched upon that aside everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity power money or self <UNK> br br <UNK> was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of new york city over the head his response was a denial after all he lived in new york himself and <UNK> to a neighborhood improvement <UNK> and other admirable <UNK> exactly the <UNK> one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked new <UNK> <UNK> has a <UNK> in american studies from <UNK> and is no <UNK> those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable nobody was any good and <UNK> mccoy wound up broke a professional <UNK> for social justice the movie throws all of that away and <UNK> a moral frame on the story that simply doesn't fit <UNK> did his <UNK> the novel was <UNK> in reality every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable <UNK> might have made a great cultural <UNK> he knows how to get inside a system and record its details br br yes any of us might have found ourselves as <UNK> and his mistress do stuck in the south <UNK> threatened by a couple of black kids and making a <UNK> after <UNK> into one of them that scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid br br but after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message however <UNK> the message is br br <UNK> might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his <UNK> expensive <UNK> take out a shotgun and start shooting into the ceiling with it as he does in the <UNK> in what's supposed to be a funny scene ceiling <UNK> falls all over the party guests and they <UNK> away <UNK> it simply would not have happened the movie has left the <UNK> <UNK> detailed reality in the dust <UNK> sensibility the work he put into capturing the real has been lost what we get instead is a <UNK> fantastic and silly scene that doesn't do anything except wake the audience up similar empty scenes follow screaming out for <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie also fails because it <UNK> a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral <UNK> here we see don juan in hell at the opera we get <UNK> on redemption from a poet with aids we see a lot of guilt in <UNK> a black judge who <UNK> from the <UNK> and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again a reporter who feels sorry for <UNK> after turning him into a <UNK> <UNK> and a happy ending in which <UNK> gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin the scene sits on the movie like a <UNK> cap on a circus <UNK> head br br the movie not only makes points that are already trite and unoriginal it <UNK> them as if the audience were incapable of absorbing any subtleties br br it's not the acting or the direction that's poor the film's not bad in those respects and the photography is pretty good too including two rather spectacular shots the <UNK> of the <UNK> building and the landing of the <UNK> it's the script that is thoroughly <UNK> br br the first half of the movie roughly is okay in conception and execution it keeps some of the little details from the novel <UNK> and <UNK> dog is named marshall who the hell would name a dog marshall it loses its focus almost completely in the second half and on the whole is barely worth watching br br <UNK> cynical redneck right <UNK> may be offensive to a lot of people but he's got the <UNK> to lay his <UNK> out alas the writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thus blew the chance to make a fascinating study of new <UNK>
<START> this is a decent <UNK> but the guy who wrote the screenplay seems to be a bit in the dark as to what exactly makes a zombie movie cool no it isn't cgi bugs and <UNK> companies actually i'm not sure whether it was a <UNK> company i saw it without subtitles so i had to guess what they're talking about anyway my point was instead of wasting your time <UNK> some dumb ass bug why not throw in more zombies and more action 2 3 of the 20 minutes consist of news <UNK> bugs some guys yelling about something and to makes matters worse more boring most of the deaths occur off screen i realize that's all too common for no budget movies but then there were some very impressive effects well kind a of which left me wondering why did the director or screenwriter whatever chose to focus on how the <UNK> started it's a short <UNK> gonna care anyway
<START> this movie let me down decidedly hard it was a great concept that was ruined with a horrible script the story just didn't flow and was disjointed at best there were so many elements to this story that were not explained or were forced into place with out any real thought elements like the love story could have been expanded on a bit more and the <UNK> need to be written in better the whole main character growing up thing needed more about the training he was receiving and less standing around everyone likes a good little guy <UNK> story and this showed promise but with the scripting failures wasn't to be while it did have some <UNK> in the final battle sequence it was lackluster due to a lack of choreography this made for a <UNK> boring watch br br it could have been so good
<START> the only remarkable fact is the participation of <UNK> kinski who plays a priest don't ask me why he does it a bad bad movie overall br br
<START> one of the five worst movies i have ever watched and i'm not <UNK> in fact i recommend watching it so you can get the same feeling of <UNK> as you might by watching <UNK> br br out of 400 votes the movie gets a user rating of 5 3 10 but there is a <UNK> number of voters who gave it a 10 10 probably due to the message of the movie nuclear weapons are the <UNK> of mankind chuck <UNK> is an all star little league <UNK> who gives up baseball because there are nuclear weapons soon amazing grace smith is an all star boston <UNK> who is inspired by <UNK> story and gives up basketball soon all sports <UNK> from the professional level to college to high school to little league <UNK> in a world wide protest later all the children of the world go on a silence strike this <UNK> the president of the united states to meet with the soviet <UNK> who in time agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next little league season the movie ends with chuck about to throw out the first pitch with the president telling his new best friend chuck not to worry about striking out every <UNK> as he hasn't thrown a baseball in a year br br somewhere along the line a <UNK> underworld boss kills amazing grace when the president finds out he is told that the fbi can <UNK> the killer but will never be able to prove it so the president calls the underworld boss but it's one a m i don't care get him on the line and tell him that he is to <UNK> from all company boards that he sits on and sell all <UNK> that he has and to not get out of line again br br honestly this movie was so crappy that i couldn't turn it off it was on television from 2 30 am to 4 00 am and i watched it all i wasn't turned off by the anti nuclear weapons propaganda i was turned off by the implausible break down of all organized sports i don't even understand why amazing grace smith was killed and with all these famous <UNK> becoming <UNK> friends why the father was constantly upset with his son taking a <UNK> stand and there was the cliché moment near the end when dad tells chuck i never told you this but i'm proud of you cue hug
<START> imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something 50 times worse br br got that br br ok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever <UNK> is the single worst movie i've ever seen there were a few cheap laughs very few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funny br br the only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's no surprise why
<START> this kind of inspirational <UNK> is enough to make you sick it <UNK> its sentiments like the biggest <UNK> on earth it <UNK> from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it the big finish is swimming in <UNK> <UNK> that must supposed to work like <UNK> <UNK> on a dead car i guess you'd need such <UNK> to feel if you're stupid enough to watch a film as simple minded and sappy as this streep <UNK> and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it's just that a display switched on and off like a light because i can't for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film even though it's based on a true story and an inspirational one at that i'm sure the set up execution and performances play like a third rate tv movie or half witted high school drama
<START> br br superb film with no actual spoken dialogue which enhances the level of suspense the whole approach gives a completely different twist to a war film br br well worth watching again if only it could be found i saw it perhaps 20 or so years ago fantastic
<START> <UNK> a little bit <UNK> could be a children's film it's a very clever concept touches upon some interesting <UNK> themes and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think of what goes against everything more than literally nothing nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives all that's left is what they don't hate and a big empty white space it's hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot it focuses on pretty much one subject but that's prime vincenzo natali territory if you've seen <UNK> you know already that he tends to like that type of situation the nothing in this movie is apparently <UNK> space but natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic if only because there's literally nothing else and nowhere else to go the actors sell it although you can tell these guys are friends anyway two actors from <UNK> return here worth and kazan but are entirely different characters they change throughout the story and while they're not the strongest actors in the world they're at least believable br br the reason i say this could be a children's film under the right <UNK> is because aside from a few f bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be <UNK> easily by kids so i find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore especially considering there isn't very much of it this could've gotten a pg rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue there is very little <UNK> about this film but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it i only say that's a shame because not because i support censorship but because that may have been the only thing <UNK> this movie from having wider exposure br br at any rate this is a reasonably entertaining film albeit with a few dragged out scenes but for literally being about nothing and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film
<START> this was an absolutely terrible movie don't be <UNK> in by christopher walken or michael <UNK> both are great actors but this must simply be their worst role in history even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece the most pathetic scenes were those when the <UNK> rebels were making their cases for <UNK> maria <UNK> <UNK> appeared phony and her pseudo love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning i am disappointed that there are movies like this ruining actor's like christopher <UNK> good name i could barely sit through it
<START> what an amazingly funny and original show the cast starting with the hysterical julie brown <UNK> <UNK> got a gun is just perfect add amy hill all american girl grandma kim who plays a lesbian who is always arguing with her partner and business partner asian restaurant <UNK> don t run i have laughed harder during this show than any other i have ever seen including <UNK> one of my all time favorite shows if you like movies like naked gun and airplane you will love this series one of the best moments of the show is cindy williams playing herself when she <UNK> <UNK> at the dry <UNK> <UNK> finds a picture of cindy williams in her coat the picture is of cindy williams doing an <UNK> act with a <UNK> pin upside down it is awesome to see an actress like cindy williams being able to play herself like this soap opera like with many surprise twists during its short run i can only hope that this will someday be released on dvd with special many bonus special features funniest series i have ever seen
<START> sorry this movie is just a cheap tv production i saw very much promotion material and expect a <UNK> movie like <UNK> what i was presented was a low budget movie like <UNK> or <UNK> on tv no atmosphere very boring more then worse fight scenes some good ideas not more i hope i will get the chance to make a movie like this and then i show how to do such a movie br br my asian <UNK> <UNK> the warrior <UNK> shaolin soccer battle royal versus etc br br sorry for my bad english
<START> while the idea is more original than most sci fi movies the execution is as usual lacking while the practical mummy effects are not bad and the gun nut character is over the top giggle inducing the only real draw is to see <UNK> <UNK> and adam baldwin reunited on the small screen i suspect that was the idea all along they do the best they can with what they have but the must see moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when <UNK> character <UNK> some tomb <UNK> style shorts not high brow cinema i know but you can't deny true beauty when you see it and adam baldwin once again <UNK> it up as the guy you love to hate if you just want to watch a couple of your favorite <UNK> characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you if you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere
<START> definitely needed a little work in season 2 such as the virus between max and logan and <UNK> white along with his ancient super cult during season two however the only thing that kept me watching was to see if max and logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus <UNK> max very good drama in season two but of course like all tv shows if there's something a little wrong with it the <UNK> company takes it off the air i was seriously hoping for a third and final season season 2 leaves you hanging unless you read the books by max allan collins then you will know what happens br br dark angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again since jessica <UNK> <UNK> sky <UNK> after the show if that would be the case then there should be a movie to complete it just like the show <UNK> which of course fox canceled as well
<START> i've seen all kinds of hamlet s br br kenneth branagh's was most ambitious mel <UNK> was quick and to the point laurence <UNK> was the best hands down but now we come to <UNK> <UNK> take on the <UNK> br br for one this is a dubbed version of a german tv production of william shakespeare's <UNK> <UNK> but if there's a slower more plodding more <UNK> and worse staged version out there somewhere it must have been acted at grade school level br br having seen it on mst3k helps with mike and the robots taking jolly good <UNK> at the old boy <UNK> the <UNK> of black and white tv shakespeare and the wisdom of germans acting out an english play and making it look like an <UNK> bergman reject br br of course the best parts are the <UNK> <UNK> best lines i'm gonna <UNK> the great <UNK> i don't think so <UNK> meet the beatles hey dad will you help me with my science project and my personal favorite during a party <UNK> <UNK> leaving germany <UNK> br br but then there's <UNK> playing shakespeare's greatest character much like a department store <UNK> would only not as <UNK> no doubt he's a great actor but here he comes off about as well as paul newman in the silver <UNK> ever see that one you gotta watch these two on a double bill br br in the end this is one instance where it's true that you're much better off to just read the book at least the book isn't dubbed by <UNK> <UNK> br br one star only for this hamlet ten stars naturally for the mst3k version br br good night not so sweet prince
<START> i was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a bernard <UNK> story this is basically a story of possible redemption racial bias and the <UNK> of life based on <UNK> br br a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling <UNK> and his <UNK> ill wife if morris <UNK> zero mostel will only believe in the angel <UNK> his wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> will recover the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that <UNK> is an angel br br when he believes it <UNK> <UNK> but in the end he has doubts and <UNK> suffers <UNK> it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying <UNK> speaks to morris br br jan <UNK> who successfully directed miss <UNK> in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in <UNK> the shop on main street directs this film as well <UNK> is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces she keeps calling for <UNK> their daughter who <UNK> them by marrying out of the jewish religion for most of the film she does not realize the <UNK> appearance in her apartment br br the scene in the <UNK> is muddled and the scene where the <UNK> girl friend confronts <UNK> in their apartment is memorable but all too brief br br we don't know why <UNK> is in danger and why he has died br br those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation
<START> robert mitchum stars as clint <UNK> in this short but tough western man with the gun <UNK> is a professional town <UNK> as in when a town needs someone to save itself he is the one who is brought in to do it <UNK> latest gig comes by as an accident <UNK> into town looking for his former <UNK> he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster but many <UNK> begin to <UNK> the day they hired <UNK> as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very <UNK> suddenly high <UNK> drifter seems less original br br man with the gun starts off as an average western tough guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses what starts off as forgettable and run of the mill ends up dark and character centered the entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable mitchum is his usual excellent self here in man with the gun not one of his very best performances mitchum still has his classic and effective tough guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action packed meaningful and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park man with the gun is a nice mitchum western and is easily worth one's time
<START> note to horror fans the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting br br i watched this because br br the premise sounded slightly promising it's not it's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low budget slasher films that weren't good either br br the promise of naked forest <UNK> sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful it's not it's so not the amateur cinematography makes sure the fallen angels are about as sexy as the average homeless person br br the name tom <UNK> has a long history in the horror genre he's the king of low budget special effects and lower budget acting come to think of it <UNK> should have been a reason not to watch this movie it's not that he's bad but he's almost always in bad movies his only good role was in from <UNK> till dawn and he's been <UNK> that at horror conventions ever since br br but let's focus on the positive forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie br br everything else is a negative obviously the writer is <UNK> to originality the script is terrible that's all a given after the first 10 minutes but the clueless pacing the way the director treats plot and characterization as a <UNK> he thinks no one cares about anyway and the excruciatingly long and boring driving walking and nature sequences no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution show a complete lack of <UNK> for film and storytelling in general br br this is another good example of the number one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad if it's written and directed by the same person expect garbage
<START> one of a <UNK> of slashers that appeared in the early eighties pranks is notable only for an early performance by daphne <UNK> the sure thing the fly 2 her character dies fairly early on and the rest of the film is totally forgettable br br during their christmas break a group of students <UNK> to clear a condemned college building of its furniture a crazy killer however throws a <UNK> in the works by <UNK> <UNK> off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome ways br br <UNK> every stalk <UNK> slash cliché in the book director jeffrey <UNK> delivers a tedious and <UNK> horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed so that i could get on with watching something more worthwhile the majority of the deaths which let's face it is why we generally watch this kind of film are brief and not that gory the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor there is one notably bloody <UNK> <UNK> film could've done with more br br at the last minute the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending but this really is one for slasher <UNK> only
<START> a wonderful and gritty war film that focuses on the inner torment of <UNK> marine al <UNK> although it is tough and unpleasant it is in the end heroic <UNK> triumph over <UNK> and depression the battle scene was superb but one bone to pick no matter how many 50 bullets they fired i never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the <UNK> it hurt the realism but i can live with it fine performance by <UNK> parker again as his girl friend
<START> let's cut to the chase this movie is <UNK> pornography <UNK> for the masses under a name that the studio is <UNK> every last penny out of the american pie <UNK> period br br the whole plot and that shouldn't imply that there's a whole lot to go around serves as a vehicle to show the audience more boobs and sex scenes br br if you're a <UNK> guy and you're too <UNK> to purchase actual pornography then this is the movie for you otherwise the movie doesn't have much to offer at all br br the acting is sub par the character development is virtually non existent and the story is a nonsensical <UNK> of nudity <UNK> drinking and pranks none of which are particularly memorable br br go buy real porn if that's what you want to see and if not go watch a good movie animal house kids or even the original american pie are all great cinematic works and all of them contain heavy alcohol use and nudity br br it's not how much it's how you use it
<START> i expected this to be a lot better i love tim <UNK> work so i was really excited to see these online short films well they weren't at all what i had expected br br i don't really know what exactly it is i don't like i guess they're just sort of dull the sound bothers me and most of the characters although i loved roy the toxic boy and <UNK> br br the match girl episode probably <UNK> me the most although it was pretty funny br br i also don't like the way some of the characters die like how match girl basically set the gas station on fire or how the girl who stares died in general <UNK> death was amusing surprisingly death by a car <UNK> very original that made me laugh so hard br br there are some things that aren't appropriate for kids just some language and gore that's about all i have to say 3 10
<START> really br br i am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here br br this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is one big pathetic grainy cliché i would have laughed out loud and a lot but was on a date with an ex military guy i could not hide my other response boredom yes i think my date a flat line good old boy liked it that's not a compliment i know an actor wants to work fine for the others but ralph come on br br it was a painful <UNK> from ralph i vote a 2 only because ralph looked so stunning but i must <UNK> ralph how could you and why br br i'm going to go watch the end of the affair to <UNK> and recover now <UNK>
<START> i just saw this movie on tv br br i've lost my dad when i was young and this movie surely did touch me br br i can feel the lost that the little girl <UNK> felt br br the feeling of wanting to see her father again br br wanting to talk to him br br or at least given the chance to say goodbye br br and i'm so touched with the letter that was wrote back to her br br saying that her father read her letter and sent it back to someone to <UNK> her and buy her a present because there isn't a shop in heaven br br it just lets me feel that <UNK> do exist
<START> okay this movie fine like i said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch it's about two boys mac and sam who are great friends and work as fashion <UNK> and the laughing time starts when mac akshay kumar starts dating with 3 air <UNK> at the same time leaving his wife suspicious sam <UNK> fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely but mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air <UNK> there's <UNK> <UNK> at every step of the movie songs rock but somethings lacking the <UNK> not up to the mark and deserves an award its nice but not all that excellent some people laughed till their <UNK> <UNK> but it didn't deserve that many laughs but of course everyone's opinion is different so if you wanna watch the movie you're welcome to do so
<START> a film that is so much a 30's <UNK> film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their <UNK> unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object br br <UNK> was one of the quintessential <UNK> house directors working with tight economy and great <UNK> whilst creating quality working methods that were very much the <UNK> of a director at <UNK> a studio that was one of the big five <UNK> in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres br br even though we have a setting of the upper classes on long island there is the generic <UNK> style <UNK> here with a narrative that could have been torn from the <UNK> another example is the when the <UNK> comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that they're not the <UNK> gives the film a more working mans down to earth feel for these were the audiences that <UNK> were <UNK> in the great depression ironically columbia and universal were the two <UNK> under these five <UNK> until the 50's when their involvement in television changed their <UNK> they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent <UNK> has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editing br br thank heavens there is no <UNK> love interest sub plot so the fun can just keep rolling along
<START> i hired out hybrid on the weekend what a disappointment a stupid lame attempt at a <UNK> movie the guy they got for the lead was totally weak and when running he did a lot looked like he was eating those <UNK> <UNK> with his <UNK> the wolf contacts he wore were great though i feel the actor relied on them too much as there was nothing menacing about his acting at all the wise native american indian chick has to be one of the most <UNK> hard faced <UNK> ever seen talk about a sour cow she <UNK> about once for the entire film and i think that is because she had sex the sex scene was lame too they may as well have shown blowing <UNK> if you can dig that br br last of all and this is a big pet hate of mine on the cover and the dvd menu the losers <UNK> drew in cool sharp teeth on the guy they were nowhere to be seen in the film
<START> i agree totally with the last <UNK> this could be the worst movie ever made i too had to fast forward through most of this movie michael madsen must have done this movie as a favor to someone the picture quality is grainy all the way through and what little plot there is is just plain stupid i give this movie a 1 out of 10 if i could give it a lower score i would don't waste your time on this movie or you'll regret it
<START> the haunted world of edward d wood jr is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as <UNK> or glenda bride of the monster and of course plan 9 from outer space this exquisite film far <UNK> where other documentaries such as look back in <UNK> and the plan 9 companion failed it rounds up his surviving <UNK> many of whom have passed away since filming and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of <UNK> hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director down to the haunting music this documentary is an absolute must see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day the entire two hours of the film lovingly and <UNK> pieces together <UNK> life and <UNK> death for the viewer best watched at 3 am while wearing an <UNK> <UNK>
<START> br br not only do alien <UNK> look exactly like <UNK> <UNK> human woman and not only are alien <UNK> able to perfectly speak english with an australian accent they also call their stars by the same names our <UNK> <UNK> have given them br br and <UNK> all that off all alien life knows just how mean evil <UNK> and destructive us humans are and they're quite willing to tell us just how bad that is br br if you ever have the chance to see this movie don't well unless you suffer from insomnia or the choices are this movie or <UNK> surgery without <UNK> br br this movie tries to get a moral <UNK> point across but only succeeds in making you yawn and pray it ends soon
<START> europa <UNK> is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago this film is truly unique and a work of genius the <UNK> and the editing are brilliant and combined with the narrative <UNK> of alienation used in the film creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience br br the participation of barbara <UNK> and eddie <UNK> in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed max von <UNK> provides his great voice as the narrator br br a one of a kind movie four stars highest rating
<START> must confess to having seen a few <UNK> in my time but this one is up there with the worst of them plot <UNK> to follow sex and violence thrown in to <UNK> and distract from the really poorly put together film br br i can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two sadly in my case i have the dvd it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time
<START> movie industry is <UNK> business because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life too that's the very original <UNK> of this feeble attempt at making an <UNK> film about film and indeed no better proof of the <UNK> <UNK> than seeing <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> trapped in this <UNK> the insight consists of talking heads <UNK> off <UNK> like should i make a studio movie that pays a lot or should i make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self do the latter please or our relationship is not only professional it's private as well it's a rather complex situation to handle isn't it yes it is my dear between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees hotel <UNK> and american movie posters no sign of non american film presence on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sessions are inevitable making the 100 minutes of the film feel like ages jenny <UNK> is spectacularly unconvincing in <UNK> her own presence in the frame
<START> i waited for this movie to play in great anticipation assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie the christmas box based on the book by richard paul evans i sent out many <UNK> to friends and family asking them to please watch this show hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my new life after seeing this movie i was so disappointed as a mother who lost her only child in november 2003 and really knowing the pain i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child it was very unrealistic from start to stop i had a few calls after the movie each call the same that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back what a bunch of bull it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark i guess that's hollywood
<START> a charming little film set in the uk about the reunion of a wwii all girl almost swing band a fine cast of <UNK> bring lighthearted perspectives on life to this fun tale with an award winning performance by <UNK> and <UNK> always great <UNK> time well spent and a fun watch for all
<START> alas poor hamlet i knew him dear reader and let me tell <UNK> this version sucks i don't know who of all people put up the money for this <UNK> but i hope that they're proud of themselves they took the classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable this version is quite literally so bad that not even the presence of a great <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> in the title role can save it this movie's only redeeming quality is that it made great fodder for mst3k mike <UNK> and crow had a lot of fun with this one br br but either way i'm sure that shakespeare had he been alive when they made this would not have wanted his name associated with it this hamlet is not even so bad that's it good it's just plain bad absolutely dreadful
<START> there are some films that every horror fan owes himself or herself to see and <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aka the red queen kills seven times 1972 is definitely one of them with <UNK> and gothic tales being my two favorite sub genres in horror i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and even though my expectations were high this masterpiece <UNK> my greatest hopes <UNK> earlier giallo the night evelyn came out of the grave 1971 was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror but it couldn't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite the red queen kills seven times is hands down one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements the red queen delivers everything one could hope for in either sub genre an inventive and incredibly compelling plot spine chilling suspense a <UNK> uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere <UNK> lush colors stylish murders a brilliant score and not least a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara <UNK> this film simply is one of the most outstanding <UNK> of elegant beauty and pure terror br br the film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany as little girls kitty <UNK> and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting legend has it that a <UNK> red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people <UNK> years later kitty barbara <UNK> has become a successful fashion photographer suddenly people begin to get murdered director <UNK> had already proved his incredible talent for style atmosphere and colorful creepiness with the night evelyn came out of the grave and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem the red queen kills seven times is a feast for the eyes indeed and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plot wise the haunting painting in the <UNK> castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the <UNK> the red lady or red queen as she is called in the english title is arguably the most <UNK> figure ever in a giallo the spine chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own br br a sexy female cast is always appreciated especially in a giallo and this one is a prime example for that the ravishing barbara <UNK> one of my favorite actresses must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen and she is a great actress too <UNK> presence has <UNK> up many italian flicks among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cult masterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year 1972 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 9 lucio <UNK> giallo highlight don't torture a <UNK> and this unforgettable gem apart from the wonderful miss <UNK> the film's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the night evelyn came out of the grave and other <UNK> who are not afraid to bare it for the camera br br as the whole film the murders are stylish and extremely elegant yet frightening and macabre and some of them are quite gory bruno <UNK> mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets and makes the film's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting the plot is <UNK> convoluted and full of red herrings the tension level <UNK> with each passing minute the red queen begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second overall this is one of the films that i cannot find enough words of praise for the red queen kills seven times is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest <UNK> ever made and a top <UNK> for every fan of horror and or italian cinema to see 10 10
<START> this is a small film few characters theatrical and yet it says something about ireland that you won't find elsewhere this film is ireland in all it's <UNK> it's sadness it's self <UNK> the boys master doyle <UNK> <UNK> the cannon senator <UNK> daughter <UNK> and above all <UNK> i know them i'm in the pub with them or <UNK> to pray with them they are our sad history and they are our present
<START> this is a beautiful rich and very well executed film with a rich and meaningful story basically it tells how an old master story <UNK> needs to find a male heir to carry on his craft but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male dominated world the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must <UNK> with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and <UNK> traditional notions br br the story is fun emotional and complex the exploration of the characters their lives and emotions is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all the film expertly conveys the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir and <UNK> shows how he and the kid handle the situation there is also humour sometimes quite subtle at appropriate points the film also <UNK> the good and bad of traditional chinese culture creating further interest and depth to the film br br the directing acting and scenery are all outstanding added to the other strengths this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling real characters as a result the film evokes strong empathy for and feelings about the characters br br some have claimed that the ending <UNK> the film but i do not necessarily agree perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small
<START> just as its a mad mad mad mad world is at the top of my list for all time greatest comedies ever made this one is at the very bottom of course i could be wrong not having seen saving silverman in other words it's a lame lame lame lame comedy br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> i see quite a few positive reviews on this board trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following i see the usual <UNK> i guess this movie is just not for the easily offended this movie is not shakespeare etc guess what neither was road trip and i laughed my a off during that movie there's a way to make a crude tasteless comedy and deliver laughs and there's a way to just make it crude and tasteless whipped tries to be <UNK> without the wit or intelligence it seems to have been written through the <UNK> eyes of a 14 year old boy for god's sake the characters in this movie are supposed to be white collar <UNK> citizens and they talk like some of the idiots i knew in <UNK> year of high school the dialogue is laced more like drowned with four letter words you would think that people of their status would have some degree of intelligence and a more extensive <UNK> just watch a <UNK> <UNK> film and you'll see the difference not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish if you know any successful white collar <UNK> who speak like the characters in this movie please let me know and introduce me to them their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at <UNK> there is absolutely no insight into relationships sex or anything it's just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremely and don't take the word extremely for granted because i mean it with all my heart crude gags these are gags with no substance gags that are meant more for <UNK> than laughs the scene at the end between amanda <UNK> and her girlfriends was totally un called for and totally unconvincing there are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by straight men and play out wonderfully this scene involves a <UNK> of sexual <UNK> and gestures it involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a woman's mouth it was one of those <UNK> written by a guy scenes i wasn't believing it for a second br br whipped is purely a sick male fantasy that's as flat as it is annoying i got very few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy and those were probably a result of desperation when you're not laughing for a long period of time you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things so i wouldn't mark that down as a positive
<START> here is one the entire family will enjoy even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales shelley duvall <UNK> herself with this unique imaginative take on nearly all of the popular fairy tales of childhood the scripts offer new twists on the age old <UNK> we grew up on and they feature a handful of stars in each episode cinderella is no exception to <UNK> standard and in my opinion it's one of the top five of the series <UNK> by jennifer <UNK> remember her from <UNK> and she's still in hollywood today making a movie here and there in the title role jean <UNK> as the fairy <UNK> with a southern accent and eve <UNK> as the <UNK> of wicked <UNK> edie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> day off and jane <UNK> make for a hilarious duo as the <UNK> matthew <UNK> is an <UNK> prince henry you'll all keep coming back for this one
<START> loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the 1 it deserved for that matter loyalty to mr falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to <UNK> even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just plain the <UNK> excuse for a made for tv columbo film ever i'm glad i watched it on tv for free would have hated to have <UNK> up the bucks for a print
<START> the peculiar charisma of martin <UNK> brings a certain believability to his character of the frustrated artist he <UNK> his dialog with an odd sense of realism making the <UNK> marcel a convincing individual the character manages to come across as a real person and not so much a typical b movie villain br br the story line is nothing to write home about and many scenes are dull what makes it work is the strange chemistry between <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> philosophical character is <UNK> with <UNK> low key <UNK> approach the character of the <UNK> isn't developed much beyond a basic monster level but <UNK> suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his back story br br this movie was on shock theater a lot when i was a kid so i have a certain nostalgic <UNK> for it it's worth seeing once anyway for those who enjoy forties horror movies
<START> full house in my opinion is an absolute abc classic i'm not sure if i've never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it one of my favorite episodes is where jesse john <UNK> and rebecca <UNK> <UNK> get married if you want to know how what made it so funny you'd have to have seen it for yourself it was a two <UNK> so you'd have to have seen both parts another one of my favorite episodes is where jesse stephanie jodie <UNK> and michelle mary kate ashley olsen get locked in a gas station on <UNK> birthday you'd also have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened i have many other ones that i like too everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen in <UNK> now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> cutting to the chase this is one of the most amazing most intense film i've seen in a long time the first movie in years that left me absolutely <UNK> i could barely feel my way out of the theatre i was so overwhelmed br br i've been staring at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find some way to describe the power of this film and just failing <UNK> any one aspect of it the documentary style video diary format the <UNK> portrayal of the events the force of the characters just seems to <UNK> it all some may find it laughable that any killer could be <UNK> as normal but then not all killers are raving <UNK> <UNK> at the mouth many are quite regular <UNK> people they're just <UNK> differently br br and that's perhaps the most chilling thought of all
<START> of course by any normal standard of film criticism soldier is a very poor film indeed kurt russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made <UNK> after being <UNK> by a bunch of really super soldiers at a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that looks a bit like a <UNK> contest without the crash <UNK> br br abandoned on a junk planet he's <UNK> by a community of <UNK> space hippies that teach him about <UNK> family life and um breasts kurt doesn't talk much finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away kurt gets angry and kills everyone a planet gets <UNK> the end br br unless the academy start a new category for best explosion soldier is not going to win any awards however as ludicrous as it is it remains an enjoyable experience the military <UNK> is the coolest since aliens the <UNK> especially and at 90 minutes long it doesn't <UNK> its welcome please note that the below mark is only a guide knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and <UNK> one more if you don't like <UNK> br br 7 out of 10
<START> i'm a fan of the series and have read all 7 books i wanted to see this just to see how it was done all i can say is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it its pretty bad and will turn you off reading them not to be mean but lucy is so ugly it <UNK> from the movie was she the directors daughter seriously i'm sure the <UNK> in the movie were jealous of her teeth she had an <UNK> that would put any <UNK> to shame the movie just loses so much in translation <UNK> books don't translate as easily as the <UNK> lotr books or even harry potter br br one thing they did right <UNK> very well done although the other human actors with painted faces <UNK> wolf look silly <UNK> was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around i guess its like that old horse <UNK> 2 people inside also i would be curious what kids think of this movie maybe they would enjoy it but as for adults safe bet they wont even if a <UNK> fan
<START> i found the dvd version of this movie at a <UNK> sale the basic premise is an affair between a teacher coach a student the acting is weak and the plot razor thin br br this movie had all the depth and plot development of an adult film
<START> a bloody maniac with <UNK> <UNK> rapes a woman he's been shot by two policemen and then he is <UNK> from the grave because of some sort of satanic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by an evil <UNK> the hunting of women continues by this zombie demon the sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the maniac dead again but only with the help of the police this will come true br br a bloody <UNK> minute mess horny zombies doll babies s m <UNK> and twisted policemen <UNK> <UNK> who seek <UNK> in front of jesus christ and three text screens at the end of the film explaining us what finally happened to the policeman who survived yes we ought to know two decent <UNK> shots can't save the situation i've seen worst horror flicks but this one was pretty bad too recommended only for the die very hard fans of the genre
<START> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> is one of the best films i ever saw a <UNK> with very deep <UNK> on the fate of <UNK> shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a god <UNK> serbian <UNK> just before the start of the world war ii i saw it in a small movie theater in russia where the film had had a very limited distribution and i had no chance to come across it ever since it is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now i searched for a vhs or dvd copy of it many times and alas could find none i would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy
<START> when this play was first shown by the bbc over 30 years ago it would have been something quite different for the time so <UNK> some people would have found it quite scary and may well have been impressed with the special effects br br looking at the play in this day and age it doesn't seem to be all that scary anymore even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired br br would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel i don't think so but if you watch this play again you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel rushes straight through the red light maybe that's how it was in dickens time br br you will also notice that the <UNK> that leads down to the <UNK> box is very <UNK> and in a poor state surely there would have been a series of proper steps with <UNK> for the <UNK> to climb up or down into the cutting i can't help but notice things like that br br i will not take anything away from the acting both <UNK> elliott <UNK> and bernard lloyd the <UNK> gave wonderful performances br br i am not at all sure what is going on i mean was the ghost the <UNK> or what does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story well maybe i am the only one that don't br br to sum up br br the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout with great character it suffers from not being that scary these days and a little if not very confusing in places and has some rather unusual <UNK> <UNK> br br thanks for reading my review
<START> errol flynn is gentleman jim in this 1942 film about boxer jim corbett known as the man who beat john l sullivan directed with a light hand by <UNK> good friend <UNK> walsh the film also stars <UNK> smith jack carson alan hale sr william <UNK> and ward bond flynn plays an ambitious <UNK> young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is <UNK> by the <UNK> olympic club in san francisco in the late <UNK> though good natured the fact that he is a <UNK> <UNK> and a social <UNK> builds <UNK> in olympic club members most of them can't wait to see him lose a fight and they bet against him despite this he rises to fame even working as an actor finally he gets the chance he's been waiting for a match with the world champion john l sullivan ward bond sullivan demands a 10 000 <UNK> to <UNK> that corbett will appear to fight for the 25 000 purse corbett and his manager <UNK> despair of getting the money however help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual br br this is a very entertaining film and jim corbett is an excellent role for flynn who himself was a professional fighter at one time he has the requisite charm good looks and <UNK> for the role <UNK> smith plays victoria <UNK> his romantic interest who insists that she hates him in real life she doesn't seem to have existed corbett was married to <UNK> lake morris from <UNK> to <UNK> br br the focus of the film is on corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing corbett used scientific techniques and <UNK> and is thought of as the man who made <UNK> an art form in the film corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents it is believed that he wore down john l sullivan this way br br good film to catch flynn at the height of his too short time as a superstar
<START> this movie was absolutely pathetic a pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers <UNK> over bikini babes at times i felt like i was watching an episode of <UNK> and <UNK> i couldn't even sit through the whole movie <UNK> <UNK> disappoints and <UNK> <UNK> is not impressive at all <UNK> <UNK> was not bad the only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on <UNK> <UNK> and his obsession of <UNK> it was pretty hilarious the songs <UNK> <UNK> and its <UNK> version were really good you can always count on <UNK> lip <UNK> and lip <UNK> a <UNK> all in all it seems <UNK> doesn't have a good script from the <UNK> to back him up this time
<START> the real irony is this joe <UNK> was a top notch comedian in other situations away from the stooges he had a definite track record for being very funny and clever moe and larry and <UNK> had actually known him or at least of him for many years and liked his work so what on earth was going on when he joined the <UNK> as the third <UNK> obviously nothing in most of these late <UNK> era shorts more often than not the boys are <UNK> against each other or joe against the other two and this is not accurate <UNK> <UNK> one for all all for one every man for himself to quote curly from restless knights one thing about a good comedy team laurel hardy <UNK> <UNK> the marx brothers no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or slap each other around when the <UNK> are actually down they stick together and come to each other's aid in this particular one none of that happens it's almost like watching a dog fight as one tries to cheat the others or be mean and nasty and not for comedic effect either one might assume that there was something behind the scenes going on here art <UNK> life maybe there really was hence why <UNK> did not stay very long with moe and larry just look at the history of the other teams and tell me i'm wrong
<START> doctor <UNK> is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar but is totally worthwhile it really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s which is why i'd have loved to see follow up movies but judging by the rest of full <UNK> <UNK> there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience unfortunately thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience which is unfortunate because without <UNK> this could have been a harry potter style <UNK> that kids would have eaten up both jeffrey combs and <UNK> <UNK> are great i wasn't sure if ms <UNK> hadn't <UNK> off an a list picture onto this film she was very believable no seriously anyway it's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license dr strange because i think this could have been a total kiddie <UNK>
<START> this movie was so ridiculous i never even finished watching it i actually thought someone had made their own version and dubbed it onto the dvd from the movie store this movie made me sick not because it was gory but because i wasted 2 50 on it it looks like my brother and i went into a house and made the movie ourselves and edited <UNK> footage into it i am so <UNK> off even the btk killer deserves more credit than that it was not even accurate i mean come on the cow head was obviously made out of play <UNK> or bubble <UNK> <UNK> i cant even get all the words out to explain it do not watch this movie
<START> people don't seem to be giving <UNK> enough credit where its due a few issues have been overlooked which are key to understanding the <UNK> experience br br the year for the year it was made in 1984 <UNK> features some of the most stunning effects i've ever seen as a person who watches a lot of early 80's animation <UNK> is unique in it's use of what appears to be computer generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive <UNK> battle against the <UNK> cutter <UNK> in the laser <UNK> can be taken as an excellent example of this every time i watch that i have to keep repeating to myself that it was 1984 when it was made br br the soundtrack <UNK> has one of the most insane <UNK> that i've heard and this mad hysterical beat <UNK> every corner of the film <UNK> borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and managed to somewhat deal with the first one the need to fill in every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine while the music is <UNK> well and <UNK> scenes such as the motorcycle battle in the <UNK> factory on <UNK> the heroine theme fails due to the sheer annoyance value of chris it's interesting to note that the constant music <UNK> my attempts at noise <UNK> when i was <UNK> <UNK> over from <UNK> tape to digital format since there wasn't a single second of silence available to use as a reference point br br western influences <UNK> sounds like helmet and has roughly the same voice as darth vader <UNK> <UNK> has the same <UNK> as the princess of <UNK> and her name sounds <UNK> similar to <UNK> <UNK> of transformers takes over han <UNK> role by flying the ship and having some technical expertise <UNK> a definite improvement on <UNK> the lens a nice <UNK> copy of the force that comes across less as a chance to <UNK> christianity at the audience than in the original <UNK> while the force relied on belief far more than concentration the lens is a pure concentration tool <UNK> anyone could <UNK> the lens the lens is far more limited than the force being purely a <UNK> offensive weapon br br technology the <UNK> alliance have interesting <UNK> <UNK> ships they look like <UNK> only with red uniforms instead of white the idea of a <UNK> weapon was nice if only it had been developed the <UNK> alliance looked like <UNK> or whatever it was called that 60's series where they were battling the <UNK> there weren't enough ship to ship battles for me this is much improved upon in the second <UNK> film br br finally a note on <UNK> this character is a unique and very interesting character design who fortunately continues on to the second film br br
<START> the worst and chock full of people who really ought to know better the cast have six oscars between them it's set in <UNK> africa it was made in 1979 and is about the slave trade it's <UNK> scripted and acted michael caine peter ustinov and william <UNK> reach a career low in this one and completely lacks excitement never mind any moral focus it's also <UNK> plotted you don't for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do under these circumstances richard <UNK> directs but you get the impression it was over the <UNK> this is as bad as it gets
<START> i first came across <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> accidentally one or two years ago while tv surfing prior to that i'd never watched any korean films before in my whole life so <UNK> was really the first korean film i've ever watched and what a delightful surprise i was thoroughly amused from the beginning to end and had a great time laughing its comic style is quite different from those of the hong kong comic films which i've been to used to all my life and hence tired of as well breathing fresh air into my <UNK> film viewing experience i thought <UNK> quite a few scenes and tricks in <UNK> that are pretty hilarious witty and original too br br i watched <UNK> the second time a few days ago and having watched it once already the surprise comic effect on me kind of <UNK> that has however by no means affected <UNK> my opinion of the film instead something else came through this time it moved me the story about how two young seemingly <UNK> <UNK> utterly <UNK> get thrown together and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without realizing the feelings themselves reminds me of the long gone high school days to me <UNK> wan and <UNK> <UNK> are actually <UNK> as they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them a quality that <UNK> them from people like say <UNK> <UNK> sassy girlfriend br br the film is divided into two distinct parts the 1st part deals with the <UNK> between <UNK> wan and <UNK> <UNK> and is more violent and faster in pace after <UNK> <UNK> gets a pass in his final examination and <UNK> wan dances the in <UNK> <UNK> opinion provocative dance things start to change the pace slows down and <UNK> <UNK> suddenly realizes he cares for <UNK> wan more than he could ever imagine so the 2nd part deals with the development of their mutual feelings leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang boss br br just one last comment i find this to be a bit unbelievable the fact that a 21 year old self <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would feel embarrassed being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his <UNK> is just a little odd i guess that shows that <UNK> <UNK> is just a boy pure at heart and isn't really what his appearance seems btw <UNK> san woo <UNK> <UNK> does have a sexy body and perfect figure br br <UNK> is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite films of all time
<START> i like cheap <UNK> better it doesn't last as long ralph <UNK> convict character <UNK> tells this to barbara <UNK> helen character after he gets a <UNK> of the <UNK> that she picked out w her husband in <UNK> this line <UNK> me up and also seemed like a metaphor for this film that cheap is better than expensive because a cheap <UNK> loving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run i agree with some of the other comments posted about <UNK> attraction to <UNK> even though her narration states that she wants <UNK> to be put away she did seem attracted to his fiery nature and that passion he <UNK> up in her wouldn't likely wash away with the tide
<START> it happened with assault on <UNK> 13 in 2005 it happened with the lost boys in 2008 and now it's happened with another classic from the 80's <UNK> why oh why oh why won't hollywood ever learn leave them alone they can't be remade they suck we all hate them br br those of you who haven't seen the original 1983 version with matthew <UNK> ally <UNK> go rent buy it now the <UNK> may look dated the special effects are not new millennium but it still beats this rubbish hands down br br for those of us who lived through the 80's when <UNK> was sexy the internet was something mysterious and your <UNK> came as a 8 <UNK> variety well we now possess the wisdom to avoid this film like a <UNK> war br br never before has a nice game of chess seemed the better option
<START> well then i just watched an crap load of movies all with varying degrees of quality i wasn't too sure about which one i wanted to review first then it hit me like a sack a rats <UNK> warn people about <UNK> this monstrosity stars nobody and is painfully dull to sit through and it's about mutant rats killing people yeah real <UNK> original food of the gods or <UNK> anyone those were better than this and that doesn't say much br br possible spoiler okay here's the story <UNK> laboratory the scientist and his <UNK> assistant are <UNK> on rats and their laboratory is in a crappy neighborhood and crappy building and the <UNK> <UNK> moronic friends show up drunk and everyone becomes food for the crazed rats and just about everybody dies and oh yeah there's one giant rat that looks crappy but it gets killed the end there all in once sentence spoiler you say <UNK> i beg to <UNK> the second we all realize that there's a giant rat we all know it's gonna die eventually end spoiler br br here's the breakdown br br the good br br well i watched it for free but for everyone else hmmm no there's nothing good here br br didn't hurt it didn't help br br um well the gore was decent very average cinematography br br cg rats not as bad as they could've been in some shots br br the bad br br and in other shots the cg rats were <UNK> cheap looking look if your film has a low budget maybe you shouldn't rely on cg lesson to take to heart br br the acting is extremely poor br br the characters are beyond uninteresting we have a <UNK> mash of clichés and none of them are even done that well br br <UNK> br br been done before plenty of times br br stupid story just stupid br br giant rat looks like fat man in poorly conceived bear costume that was kind of funny but not funny enough to give this film any worth br br retarded unrealistic and boring dialog br br all the college student rat <UNK> people are drinking <UNK> from huge plastic milk <UNK> and yet they don't appear to be drunk for anything longer than a few seconds way to stick with continuity guys br br the ugly br br this film is bad simply terrible worse than you might imagine it's not even laughably bad like for instance scarecrow 2002 or house of the dead now those movies are crap you can enjoy even if they do make you <UNK> br br memorable scene br br the lame action movie ending complete with <UNK> heroes and explosion because it didn't feel at all like the rest of this monstrosity but still sucked br br acting 2 10 story 1 10 atmosphere 2 10 cinematography 4 10 character development 0 10 special effects make up 4 10 nudity sexuality 1 10 i was <UNK> to my son occasionally during the film so i may have missed it but was supposedly in there violence gore 4 10 dialogue 2 10 music 1 10 average for the time writing 1 10 direction 2 10 br br cheesiness 7 10 <UNK> 9 10 br br overall 1 10 br br watch it only if you love rat and <UNK> based horror films wait check that don't watch it it's crap br br www <UNK> com
<START> i had high hopes for this film because i thought clean <UNK> <UNK> first feature was absolutely terrific the most <UNK> cinematic low budget film i'd ever seen br br but much of claire <UNK> is utterly pointless and flat scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix without much thought for narrative or character br br is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not hard to tell why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle why do we have to see her <UNK> her hair to what is virtually the exact same color why does claire accept some <UNK> and not others the filmmaker doesn't seem to know br br it feels as if everything is improvised though i understand this wasn't the case and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a <UNK> documentary br br after the screening i saw <UNK> <UNK> his lack of narrative choices by <UNK> film narrative as politically conservative it sounded like learned <UNK> i think it was a cop out br br i am <UNK> that the maker of a film as exciting as clean <UNK> would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old political cliches
<START> even though this movie is quite old no matter how many times i watch it it still makes me laugh br br one particular quote in the movie stands out br br when danny joe <UNK> pulls up to the d <UNK> office parks in a disabled spot <UNK> partner says br br can't park here it's for the handicapped br br danny replies i am handicapped i'm psychotic br br that is one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you watch it'll make you chuckle br br johnny dangerously stands in my top 5 comedy spoof movies of all time br br as an added bonus it also includes the legendary actor peter boyle in the cast so watch this movie like myself many others who have watched it you'll be hooked
<START> panic is a <UNK> little gem of a film you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize with great pleasure that henry <UNK> is a much better writer director than that br br the film builds slowly with one quietly devastating scene after another all <UNK> perfectly by william h macy donald sutherland <UNK> campbell <UNK> <UNK> john ritter and the most remarkable child actor i've seen in a long time david <UNK> as <UNK> son who delivers his lines as if they're completely <UNK> thoughts being created in his mind rich and rewarding this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled
<START> god zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as tarzan and probably had about as many actors in the title role br br this serial is one of my own personal favourites and as previously stated it is one of the top 5 sound serials oddly enough this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939 by the time of this production in <UNK> zorro was really well known as a pulp literary and movie character the film opens up with a little foot note about the history of the <UNK> struggle for freedom from rule by a european <UNK> namely spain the story invites comparison with the american revolutionary war br br the story concentrates its attention to the mythical <UNK> of san <UNK> and its <UNK> it is being addressed by <UNK> <UNK> on their gold <UNK> relation to the new republic of mexico gold <UNK> must get thru to mexico city br br don francisco uncle to diego vega states that he has organized a group of <UNK> to act as a protective force for the gold <UNK> a thug from the don del <UNK> mob stages an <UNK> to himself and challenges don francisco to a duel with swords don <UNK> getting run through br br suddenly the dark clad masked <UNK> appears to sword fight and after <UNK> the trademark <UNK> on the face of the bad guy he <UNK> him to the <UNK> don francisco declares with his dying breath to his ward <UNK> william <UNK> that zorro is his nephew from the city of los angeles he also attempts to tell of the true identity of don del <UNK> but <UNK> before <UNK> statement br br there is a big reception for diego at don <UNK> <UNK> where diego disappoints <UNK> also ward of don francisco with his <UNK> act a <UNK> she declares br br later diego and <UNK> slip away to join up with a meeting of the <UNK> when they ask who will lead us with don francisco now dead <UNK> declares zorro we are <UNK> fighting legion well there is a big battle with the legion now all clad on gray with masks and <UNK> protecting the gold train then zorro seems trapped at a man made <UNK> intended for the <UNK> when well you know cliffhanger end of chapter one br br wow that was a lot of writing for one chapter but like most other serials the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to be laid to set up the story line let's just let it suffice to say that there are 11 more good well made action filled chapters following br br <UNK> fighting legion has all of the elements that made for top cliffhanger action we have an unknown evil leader who is <UNK> trouble between different groups there is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of <UNK> del <UNK> we had soldiers <UNK> whites hostile indians and the legion br br in short it's safe to say that there is everything one could want and then some in this serial and incidentally they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any mexican accents br br as to just what is there here that makes <UNK> stand out from the rest what makes it different or unique well br br first of all it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and <UNK> the drama and action on the screen the opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the <UNK> in chapter one this is probably the only time that such a highly <UNK> <UNK> appears in serial sound track br br and yet there is one more feature that really sets the fighting legion saga out in front from all others that is the film not only has a heroic musical theme but it also sports lyrics yes the <UNK> sing we hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters it really works well and adds to the feelings we get from the viewing br br when the serial was first shown on our local television circa 1955 all of the gang immediately recognized the voice of reed hadley as <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> squad the tv series mr hadley had a very distinctive deep voice he also handled the role very well his costume and especially the <UNK> mask looked very good and was probably very <UNK> br br there is a small slip up a sort of minor <UNK> occurs by having <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> young addressing the san <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> was about 18 years old at this time <UNK> and though he was later perhaps the greatest single figure in <UNK> history he surely hadn't achieved such <UNK> yet his inclusion in story probably was to cash in on the release of warner <UNK> <UNK> that year which starred paul muni in the title role br br this is not only my pick as a top 5 sound serial but also my favourite zorro film br br we are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year what with gone with the wind mr smith goes to washington the <UNK> <UNK> the wizard of oz of mice and men one million b c <UNK> we want our mummy all counted among the <UNK> that year br br once again <UNK> did not <UNK> to any national importance until around <UNK> about 25 years later also the political sub <UNK> are referred to as <UNK> in the story in <UNK> they are called <UNK> just as we are called the united states of america so too south of the border they call their <UNK> the united states of mexico br br reed hadley was prominent in some very <UNK> pictures in which his richly toned voice is exploited to good effect watch listen for his narration in the house on <UNK> street 1945 and <UNK> diary 1945
<START> my left foot in my opinion is a great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and <UNK> the performances were <UNK> the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect i thought that christy daniel day lewis was a very talented man although i couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time in addition when he threw a <UNK> i got a little scared also it's just so sad that he suffered from cerebral <UNK> in conclusion if you are a die hard fan of daniel day lewis or like <UNK> i highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and <UNK> you're in for a real treat and a good time so don't miss this one
<START> a hit at the time but now better <UNK> as an australian cult film the humour is broad <UNK> and in the final scene where a bbc studio fire is <UNK> by <UNK> on it crude contains just about every cliche about the traditional australian <UNK> to 'the old <UNK> and every cliche about those <UNK> stuck up <UNK> <UNK> brits would be acceptable to the british because of its strong cast of well known actors and to <UNK> of that generation who can <UNK> the humour americans forget it the language and jokes are in the australian <UNK> of english and as such will be <UNK>
<START> at first i hadn't read the novel so far and i hadn't hear anything about the author yet but as i casually saw this movie i was totally captive by the story already as the jewish <UNK> primary said that he knows no one who have a bad conscience about the war except from howard w campbell junior was such amazing objective and <UNK> from simply <UNK> the war terrific and the <UNK> story about the most effective spy for the usa in wwii who have lost everything that was important for his life is wonderful emotional <UNK> this is the best story about the <UNK> of humanity i've ever heard about the questions this movie is introducing are in my opinion very important for our society when does someone bear the guilt of something what is guilt who is a hero and who is a <UNK> what is important in our life can you live without paying attention to the political changes is the protagonist guilty or not these questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years this is a must see for everyone who have to think about the <UNK> of war this movie is a must see for everyone who <UNK> what matters in life and what doesn't
<START> i think it took a lot of guts for her to come forward like that it is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that is what helps people most but in her case what she did was remarkable i have been in the mental health field for five years and i think it is great that mental illness is not a terrible word anymore and i believe she helped i always thought she was great and always will i am glad that she wrote this book and that the movie was made she is a remarkable lady and i hope she continues to act she has been through a lot and has faced it i would really love to see her work more with children especially child actors her ordeal should not have happened and i think she would be wonderful as a mentor to young people the movie was so moving to me that i was very touched suffering a <UNK> which brought the <UNK> of my disorder and having <UNK> it is good to know that someone has the courage enough to display her life as she did i believe it helped this nation and people in general realize that there are others like them and that there is help thank you ms duke or anna which ever you prefer
<START> there have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of hollywood cary grant was an angel in the <UNK> wife <UNK> of course the best were the <UNK> movies in the late <UNK> early <UNK> and more recently warren <UNK> heaven can wait 1978 which was a remake of <UNK> here comes mr jordan these were well written funny entertaining comedies all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels br br now comes writer director jeff <UNK> making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable bitchy young woman kate eva longoria parker who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> ashley lake bell who is falling for <UNK> fiancé henry paul rudd one thing that is clear at the outset longoria parker is no <UNK> bennett marion <UNK> in the first two <UNK> films who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are <UNK> br br there is a line right at the beginning when <UNK> sister chloe lindsay sloane tells henry you don't smile that <UNK> described my situation throughout this film br br the main problem with the film is that the script just isn't very funny but it's made worse by longoria <UNK> presence that just <UNK> me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen just to start out with <UNK> her lack of comedic talent she is covered with so much <UNK> makeup who knows what she really looks like kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue she's so <UNK> that the angel who <UNK> her about what her <UNK> is about walks out on her well she actually just fades out so kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is br br chloe wants henry to snap out of the <UNK> into which he has naturally <UNK> after <UNK> death from what i saw of kate he should have felt a wonderful relief so she introduces him to ashley who really doesn't know what she's doing as a <UNK> she is also a <UNK> to make ends meet to see if she can get henry back in touch with kate there's a lot of <UNK> that goes on br br the <UNK> of the film is <UNK> by a b story revolving around <UNK> assistant dan jason <UNK> this is thrown in near the end but the way ashley handles it <UNK> that she's as much of a <UNK> as kate since dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women he deserves whatever he gets br br eventually kate appears to ashley and the fun should begin it doesn't and <UNK> the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny as it is norman z <UNK> <UNK> bennett <UNK> young alan <UNK> and co must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two <UNK> films has <UNK>
<START> this movie supposedly a thriller had about five sub plots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end but it ended up more as a yawn br br the writing was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring george clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym matt damon <UNK> it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a <UNK> br br the worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business oil and the middle east i have seen documentaries provide more excitement watch it only if there's absolutely nothing else to do
<START> the concept was ok but hardly original the acting was plastic but the real spoiler was that there was only one joke and a <UNK> one at that this is a film for <UNK> year olds who have been let out on their own for the first time don't dare to watch it with your kids
<START> i saw the movie before i read the michelle <UNK> book and i enjoyed both the movie more than the book made me come close to tears on several occasions this film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go i encourage as many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible i give it ten stars
<START> this was a typical grade b movie in 1940s hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations why it has a wonderful plot and backed up by nina <UNK> george <UNK> and dame may witty as a female villain of all people br br when a young lady answers an <UNK> for a secretary she certainly gets more than she <UNK> for the only talents her <UNK> are seeking are those which will lead to her demise seems that witty and <UNK> want to pass her off as their daughter in law and wife respectively <UNK> killed his real wife and wants to do <UNK> in as well so that a body can be claimed br br the film deals with how <UNK> tries to get town people to believe her and how she is <UNK> in practically everything she does why don't people believe her
<START> two things haunt you throughout <UNK> the intruder who's the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you're watching the ending is so shocking that for a while you're at a loss for an answer to either of those questions the intruder pops up as different characters different men in different circumstances who don't belong in the scene so they're <UNK> from it kindly or brutally but often without emotional involvement the main character louis is a <UNK> man he's got rough ways some mean job and no heart he needs one and goes after it he has a heart <UNK> and afterwards decides to start a new life can this man succeed in his quest for redemption a guy like that could cut your throat at the drop of a hat you know it but claire denis doesn't encourage you to judge him occasionally there's a young russian woman a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit <UNK> between heaven and earth who does judge him she may even <UNK> him but not denis there's the character played by <UNK> <UNK> who wants no business with him don't touch me she says but denis lets this man be himself films him in his self absorbed quest i don't know if what she films is the heart or the mind but it isn't the traditional plot <UNK> whatever she films you get it in the end you know who's the intruder you know why more or less and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning but was it a movie or a dream
<START> this is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like the corporation and <UNK> 9 11 its commentary is clear and <UNK> as is the breathtaking cinematic style of this well crafted feature the film manages to <UNK> a powerful sense of how <UNK> our world is as we rush toward an <UNK> <UNK> future at lightning speed while showing us the terrifying beauty in our pursuit of progress br br truly a remarkable accomplishment which must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children bravo br br <UNK> this is also the only film of 8 at <UNK> theaters toronto <UNK> a stick on tag which reads to <UNK> group viewings please contact a further testament to the popularity and importance of this gem br br my bet an academy award nomination for best documentary br br <UNK>
<START> i have just finished watching this film in my <UNK> history class it was thrilling and was a brilliant insight to what actually happened to steve biko during the time of the apartheid law how anybody can say that this film was the most boring or dull 2 and a half hours of their lives i don't know because it had me hooked from start to finish it was great how denzel washington portrayed him and showed how he was fighting against the apartheid law and to get equal rights for black people in one part steve biko says to a policeman we are just as weak and human as you are this is to show them that he and all of the other black people in south africa were no different to the whites donald woods inspired me because he <UNK> for what he believed in and did not believe totally in apartheid he and steve biko formed a very strong friendship that <UNK> south africa and went on to <UNK> the world i very much enjoyed this film and strongly recommend this to people it helped me see that racism is not right and that everybody is equal their fate should not be determined by the colour of <UNK> skin n
<START> this film really got off to a great start it had the potential to turn into a really <UNK> romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between <UNK> and tobe in long poetic and <UNK> scenes it really didn't need to be anything more than that and for a moment there i became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake another timeless classic a modern myth perhaps why oh why then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character norton another psycho maybe i'm missing the point but do we really need another film about <UNK> or is this need in hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature <UNK> of a more general <UNK> in the movie industry for a moment there i was going to make a mental note of the director's name now i'm left feeling indifferent at least it should be added in the film's defense that all the actors seemed to <UNK> in their roles also <UNK> rachel wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential
<START> slash flicks come few and far between now a days so when i heard about cut i had high hopes and heard good things about it those good things i heard were all wrong very wrong this flick is bad and i mean bad it's just plain stupid everything about it especially the killer's origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end there is nothing original or outstanding about this flick just another slasher wannabe with those hip self aware movie <UNK> characters i'm so sick of that crap someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood literally
<START> in le million <UNK> <UNK> one of the <UNK> great directors and great <UNK> created a gem of light comedy which for all its <UNK> is a groundbreaking and technically brilliant film which clearly influenced subsequent film makers such as the marx brothers lubitsch and <UNK> the plot a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge <UNK> <UNK> but has to search <UNK> all over town for the missing ticket is basically just a device to support a series of wonderfully witty comic scenes <UNK> in a dream world of the director's imagination br br one of the most impressive things about this film is that though it is set in the middle of paris and includes nothing actually impossible it achieves a <UNK> and involving fairy tale fantasy atmosphere in which it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they talk or that a <UNK> over a stolen jacket should take on the form of a football game another memorable element is that le million includes what may be the funniest opera ever put on film o that blonde <UNK> soprano i laugh ha ha also a delight is the casting <UNK> has assembled a group of amazing <UNK> different character actors each of them <UNK> with deadly <UNK> accuracy a <UNK> french type so that the film seems like a set of <UNK> <UNK> come to life br br the hilarity takes a little while to get rolling and i found the characters not as emotionally engaging as they can be even in a light comedy as they are for instance in many lubitsch films for these reasons i <UNK> from giving it the highest rating but these minor <UNK> shouldn't distract from an enthusiastic recommendation br br should you see it by all means highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential work of cinema or just a fun comedy
<START> this is a family film which to some people is an automatic turn off it seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs gratuitous violence and enough <UNK> to fill the new york phone book this film is none of those it is cliché it is formula but it is also fun it doesn't ask you to think it doesn't demand that you accept the film as reality it simply does what a good film ought to do which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure the cast is good while not excellent as another <UNK> pointed out the john williams sound score was as usual excellent and the fact that a lot of the film was shot in <UNK> at the real space camp made it even more believable br br it was ironic that the original release of the film was <UNK> for some months due to the <UNK> <UNK> disaster which may have played a large part in it's original theatrical opening but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie <UNK> so sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy
<START> i gave it a 2 just because <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> looks <UNK> sexy in this movie br br certainly there is very little logic to this movie but so are most of the sci fi vampire flicks the movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories unfortunately it went too far and made the whole story not just <UNK> but ridiculous br br there is too much gore and too many rip off the body scenes that made me feel sick a good vampire movie should be more sensible that you don't need to see a lot of blood we all know when a vampire jumps on a human he she is going to do what a vampire will do a few <UNK> or screams are all it needs to describe the scene like the one at end when <UNK> tries to sexually <UNK> <UNK> all it needs is a few <UNK> the rest is your imagination anyway it's just my personal taste
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is an earlier work by the <UNK> gifted writer director <UNK> <UNK> with the collaboration of writer <UNK> <UNK> the team that gave us the later <UNK> <UNK> as we come to understand <UNK> manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more <UNK> by allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure <UNK> time now time passed time <UNK> time imagined time alone <UNK> makes his tales more personal involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters' <UNK> it takes a bit of work to key into his method but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film br br mathieu handsome and gifted <UNK> <UNK> is visiting the <UNK> for a holiday a time to allow his mother <UNK> <UNK> to struggle with her <UNK> illness cared for by the <UNK> and wise <UNK> marie <UNK> and accompanied by his sister sarah <UNK> <UNK> their distant father has remained at home for business reasons <UNK> in and out of the first moments of the film are images of mathieu alone looking depressed riding trains speaking to someone in a little <UNK> we are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action br br while <UNK> at the beach mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him and we can feel <UNK> emotions <UNK> with confusion the youth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> follows mathieu and his sister home continuing the mystery of attraction soon <UNK> approaches mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking <UNK> <UNK> public approaches but continues to seek him out for <UNK> the two young men are fully in the <UNK> of being in love and the <UNK> of the physical aspect of this relationship so very necessary to understanding this story is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes yet as the summer wears on mathieu a committed student realizes that <UNK> is a drifter working in a <UNK> stand at a carnival it becomes apparent that <UNK> is the <UNK> partner while mathieu is the <UNK> one in a telling time in <UNK> ruin mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while <UNK> is only interested in the place as a new <UNK> for <UNK> br br mathieu is a complex person <UNK> with his <UNK> ties strained by critical illness and a non present father a fear of his <UNK> sexuality and his <UNK> passion for <UNK> their moments of joy are <UNK> by <UNK> admission of infidelity and <UNK> inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways time passes family changes are made and mathieu <UNK> into depression including a suicide attempt the manner in which mathieu <UNK> with all of these challenges and finds <UNK> strangely enough in one of <UNK> past lovers pierre <UNK> <UNK> brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax br br after viewing the film the feeling of <UNK> with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful <UNK> has given us a film of <UNK> with passion conflicts with <UNK> powers found in love and a quiet film of <UNK> and <UNK> that are <UNK> beautiful the entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative <UNK> is most <UNK> one of the bright lights of film making in french with english subtitles highly recommended grady <UNK>
<START> the movie is bad nothing special just a kid movie with no serious thing in it there is though one reason to watch this for the animal talk some of them are so funny in what they say you just can't stop laughing so if you want to hear a dog in the dog pound saying i'm <UNK> <UNK> or another animal saying you're a dead cat walking or many other funny one liners see it cause there's no other good movie to watch it vote 4 out of 10
<START> assassin <UNK> john <UNK> mission is to <UNK> a mid eastern oil minister whose name happens to be omar <UNK> <UNK> in the country of <UNK> which is run by american interests <UNK> poses as trade show producer to allow him to get to omar br br sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying here it does too much the government politics music war people not generally accepted by society and did i mention war and that is what we have here a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life i am still asking myself why i continued with the dvd also there are so many <UNK> family members in this that john <UNK> appears embarrassed by the family just being there or is that just me br br it used to be that a john <UNK> movie while a little offbeat was in the end rather good not here believe that john <UNK> had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess make of that what you will br br there is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun fire <UNK> and shouting that you really cannot focus or was that the point probably it just takes too long to set up the hit which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes in the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast and chemistry between john <UNK> and marisa <UNK> i don't think so but you know the boy  girl thing <UNK> they needed something to take up more time br br yes for what they were supposed to be offbeat and annoying the performances of duff and kingsley were good but when i saw dan <UNK> character in the beginning of the show sitting on a toilet taking a dump i knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well i was not wrong i am sure some will sing <UNK> of this effort but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so too is a <UNK> br br i now remember why i continued with the dvd i was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself never did br br violence yes sex no nudity no language yes
<START> this film is lame lame lame it takes a lot to bring me to over exaggeration about a movie but this movie <UNK> up my house i haven't even finished the movie yet and i had to stop to comment on how bad this movie is i've never done that as a <UNK> do not spend your money on this film wait until it comes out on a cable channel or something it's barely tv worthy i really hate <UNK> a movie but this movie is trash barely above porn should have and x rating good plot some frontal nudity if that <UNK> your boat but horrible high school level acting don't know how this movie received distribution must have been a <UNK> thing really if you really like watching good movies don't waste you time with this one from one movie lover to another you will be mad at yourself let me say this as well if you've been through something like this perhaps you can relate and it will have some value for you in that case i say watch it you may take something away from it if not just seeing something that's happened to you being acted out by someone else has <UNK> value
<START> i'm not a writer or an critic i'm just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago and i want to thank people that worked on creating this movie it is not the best or the most but it touched my heart why i would like to understand it myself it is easy and accessible it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret about the time wasted on watching it it is about love and caring about the life that we have but we miss it sometimes because of material stuff look at all the time that we have but we miss it why a fu k do we do that we need to live like were dying care about every second and remember if we do good things good things come back to us happiness is real and it has a special taste in new york i love this town and the world the we live in thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes english is my second language
<START> there's an <UNK> <UNK> for basic training movies so it's surprising that this one got so little notice when first released looks likely to have a well deserved second life on dvd vhs br br <UNK> isn't uniformly great by any means there are some terribly cliched characters especially the portrayal of the <UNK> makes you long for the return of lee <UNK> metal <UNK> <UNK> but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get
<START> quick and simple i love this movie br br as some others have mentioned i also am not from the south don't really care for country music and have never worn a cowboy hat i've never drove around in a car with a dead body in my <UNK> either but i love <UNK> this is just great film making shot in a 2 35 aspect ratio and beautifully <UNK> to dvd the vhs was 1 33 full screen and yes a solid 5 1 mix for your viewing pleasure what can you say about this movie br br it's just a great love hate story set in texas with great performances travolta is fantastic next to pulp fiction it's the best thing he's done it's been in my top 5 for 25 years br br check this one out it's a 10
<START> franco <UNK> 1985 six hour italian mini series of <UNK> <UNK> is a very curious beast creating an absolutely convincing ancient roman world shot in matter of fact fashion very few long shots no big <UNK> but playing the drama down so much in favour of <UNK> to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the background br br the shifting structure much of episode one is played out via voice over letters and lack of narrative urgency makes the full six hour version simultaneously demanding and <UNK> and certainly far too often <UNK> but it has something going for it the two main strengths are the characterisation of <UNK> a thankfully dubbed <UNK> forrest whose own voice would almost certainly <UNK> his dialogue as a man whose spent so long looking for an <UNK> angle to survive court life that he's become incapable of experiencing emotion and <UNK> maria <UNK> unique take on <UNK> as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is <UNK> on how his <UNK> will receive it elsewhere max von <UNK> briefly appears in a few episodes being rewarded with the show's most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave rome it's the kind of thing the show could do with more of but it seems all too often to <UNK> every potentially emotional inspiring or exciting moment under it's relentlessly low key direction br br unfortunately <UNK> quinn makes a <UNK> anonymous hero <UNK> in with the walls and coming over less as a roman officer than that quiet slightly <UNK> but <UNK> guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties you know the one who you think is called dave or something like that the <UNK> limitations are very visible once its meet the lions time for the christians and <UNK> battle with the bull is so <UNK> low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly ends br br not a trip i can particularly recommend i'm afraid but if you do <UNK> on it it's one not entirely without its small <UNK>
<START> this is by far one of my favorite of the american pie spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character one of the young <UNK> always seems unrealistic in nature br br for example <UNK> the naked mile you have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity problem and he ends up stopping mid deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend who keep in mind gave him a guilt free pass for the weekend i can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing but let's be realistic most people who are watching these movies aren't particularly searching for a romantic story br br whereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and good old <UNK> <UNK> seems to wake up and smell the <UNK> and as always mr <UNK> lends his perfectly natural <UNK> humor to the <UNK> and scored a <UNK> with this new movie
<START> if you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one latin country with any other latin country the <UNK> prophecy is a good example 1 <UNK> not even in its most violent times has not shown <UNK> or soldiers as much as in this film this showed a country like el <UNK> when civil war since i'm a <UNK> who lives in <UNK> the capital of <UNK> it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here there and everywhere 2 if you have a car in <UNK> and you want or need to be a taxi driver just post a <UNK> with the word taxi on the front glass of your car and you can drive <UNK> in <UNK> streets there are taxi companies but their rates are quite expensive no need of yellow or a black white <UNK> band on the doors of your car well <UNK> in this film have that band <UNK> that you will never see in <UNK> 3 <UNK> people are not <UNK> <UNK> clothing for example when a taxi driver comes out he was wearing a <UNK> cuban shirt a white hat and 40's <UNK> like clark gable not one <UNK> man looks like that please <UNK> is not the <UNK> 4 a scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long <UNK> like the typical <UNK> dresses in latin america take a walk anywhere in <UNK> and you'll never find a woman wearing like that unless you are watching a typical dance 5 cast could've been better i can not deny <UNK> <UNK> is a great actor but he's not a latin actor his father was <UNK> and his mother from puerto rico but he was born in new york and his spanish is not <UNK> it's notorious spanish is not his first language there are dozens of very good latin actors who could've performed as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> general <UNK> was also a bad choice for a latin police officer it was so funny seeing <UNK> and <UNK> in general <UNK> office they looked like two english or american students in a spanish class making their best effort in order to <UNK> spanish <UNK> of course <UNK> <UNK> was better in his spanish a <UNK> officer who announced <UNK> <UNK> spoke a quite funny spanish too there are very good <UNK> actors like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and christian <UNK> just to mention two out of many <UNK> actors who could've performed with excellence 6 i admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license <UNK> cities or even countries but please when creating a name be careful when using a foreign language the town portrayed in this movie should've been called <UNK> and not <UNK> <UNK> is a male name and <UNK> has never been used 7 i disagree one user who says that this movie was filmed on locations in <UNK> not one location is <UNK> although the production has used in excess posters showing <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> as not few american films this one must have used any latin country after all for american producers or directors a latin place is identical to any other latin place 8 in the first scenes when john matthew settle flies to <UNK> he's supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> airport in <UNK> the capital actually believe me it must be any airport in the world but <UNK> airport and of course in <UNK> <UNK> there are no military or police guards 9 when this john takes a room in a <UNK> hotel this one has a fan and obviously has no air <UNK> please this doesn't happen in no hotel in <UNK> and other latin countries unless you get a 1 star hotel 10 the rebels who fight against the government are <UNK> their accent was with no doubt from <UNK> for casting them the producers should've hired <UNK> actors in few words it would've been cheaper filming in <UNK> br br i could go on with more examples out of this film that led me to give it a 1 awful vote but i fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning but dear producers it's not a tragedy there are many worse movies with not few mistakes just let's remember indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull and <UNK> disney's the <UNK> new groove the list of bad films could be endless
<START> the main reason to see this film is warren william who is in top form as the <UNK> campaign manager he is electric constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the <UNK> party in the midst of the biggest disasters william is a great actor i feel he never got his due bette davis as his girlfriend also shines in an under written role personally i found guy <UNK> not quite right as the lame <UNK> candidate that william and the others are trying to <UNK> on the public he seemed more like an empty <UNK> than a person i would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a non character the story itself is implausible silly and clichéd but warren william and bette davis are well worth watching
<START> i saw this movie way back when it premiered br br it was based on the notion that <UNK> children could communicate with <UNK> out messages with someone else merely <UNK> them and <UNK> their hands br br then suddenly these children many of whom weren't even <UNK> the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being <UNK> out they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances but their <UNK> were eyes glued on the keyboard began <UNK> messages of abuse from their parents and other persons sending parents and child <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> left and right br br this whole thing was proved a <UNK> when a third person presented a <UNK> opened it to the child and said <UNK> the picture you <UNK> then as the <UNK> turned the <UNK> to the <UNK> a <UNK> would fall down revealing another different picture br br so while the child may have seen a dog the <UNK> saw something like a boat br br every time every <UNK> time the name of the picture <UNK> was what the <UNK> had observed never what the child was shown br br so who was doing the <UNK> never the child br br this movie further took a disastrous turn with as the australia poster stated the person who <UNK> the child in the movie was in the situation trying to help the child br br had melissa gilbert never put her son in that place he wouldn't have been <UNK> is what the movie says he was better off under her <UNK> br br if i turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets <UNK> instead do you think i'm going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that not likely i think it is a safe bet that all of these <UNK> messages that these kids were <UNK> out that this movie was based on they never accused someone within their operation as took place here br br unfortunately i do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from gilbert as the mother of an <UNK> but other than that the movie really didn't do much br br the worst by far was the child <UNK> at the end to patty duke and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he <UNK> we won this child was <UNK> if you cut my leg off and i take you to court and you are found guilty of <UNK> me assault whatever then that is legal justice but it doesn't bring my leg back br br at best in my condition i will view it as a hollow victory br br whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as <UNK> with the <UNK> alone is further damaged by the <UNK> br br a <UNK> child has enough to <UNK> with from such an experience br br it's utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go <UNK> <UNK> if that person is found guilty in court br br just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here
<START> when this initially aired in 1984 my wife and i taped it on our very first vhs <UNK> i still have that aging tape which i try to watch <UNK> it was the year my first child was born and seeing a christmas carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy times many hours of which were spent with this film playing in the background i finally broke down this year and ordered a dvd which <UNK> me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the movie charles <UNK> story is captured in outstanding fashion here george c scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as scrooge the supporting cast is equally spectacular this is to my mind a flawless production little details add much to the enjoyment the game <UNK> <UNK> nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item i've since re created it with my high school english students as a brief <UNK> from class work honestly i can think of few ways to entertain myself over the holidays i enjoy more than <UNK> in this cbs production which was originally <UNK> by <UNK> incidentally it's fun to watch the old tape with the original <UNK> commercials which show just how much computers have evolved in 21 years amazing how things have changed bottom line a christmas carol is a timeless story and this rendition is a timeless classic enjoy and god bless us every one
<START> this movie is completely ridiculous not only is the plot atrocious but the acting is horrendous the special effects are <UNK> and the entire movie is set in a post apocalyptic desert yet it is by far the most amusing movie ever given <UNK> to be produced it is 101 minutes of laughs due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000 or any el <UNK> there are also other aspects which i will not spoil just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully moronic i highly recommend this movie just because of its utter idiocy i have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature but if a good laugh is what you need watch <UNK> of the year 3000
<START> boris karloff is <UNK> <UNK> a dying lonely old nut who lives in <UNK> mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend don't try to doctor me doctor i'm <UNK> healthy he invites his <UNK> and <UNK> to his home and warns them they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by <UNK> the brain br br spoilers br br <UNK> karloff ends up dying and murderous toys designed by his dead brother start killing off the relatives a mini cannon fires real bullets into a guys face a life sized knight in armor attacks with an axe and a dancing <UNK> stabs people with a knife one guy getting <UNK> makes some hilarious faces at the end <UNK> and her boyfriend find karloff is still alive and hiding out in the <UNK> where steel gates seal off the room he plays the recurring <UNK> theme music sort of a death <UNK> used for the killings the brother's spirit starts talking the whole house will go with me and the mansion goes up in flames br br this senseless mess is too dark boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips

<START> the music and laurence <UNK> <UNK> delivery set the tone perfectly for this outstanding documentary this is still a must see for <UNK> ii buffs <UNK> of the participants of that conflict politicians who think things always go their way when they <UNK> their foreign policy via the deck of an aircraft <UNK> did you hear that george bush and anyone else curious or needing to know the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of some aspect of that conflict the 26 episodes are roughly in <UNK> order but can be seen out of sequence since they are more or less self contained there is bound to be new insight for the new viewer because of the sheer volume presented actual footage of the battles is interspersed with interviews of those involved in the stories many of the interviews are with second line authorities that is support <UNK> to the main characters <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the like you get a real <UNK> taste of what war is all about br br i am <UNK> watching the dvd version of the original television documentary i strongly recommend this over the worn out <UNK> <UNK> vhs offerings available on ebay i paid <UNK> <UNK> for five 2 sided dvd <UNK> this new release includes bonus material and is in full screen mode the <UNK> are easy to follow there is first a choice of which episode you want to view and then after <UNK> that you are given the option of various chapters in the episode or to play the whole episode it is understandable with such a <UNK> presentation there is a tiny amount more of <UNK> in the menu but the impact of what you will see is not <UNK> after 30 years <UNK> after 60 years since the war finished br br i remember watching the first broadcast on the buffalo <UNK> station just before moving from london in 1975 and wishing right from that time that i could have a copy now my wish has finally come true br br see this documentary tell your friends buy a copy for your library remember and honour the sacrifices and challenges overcome by those from america russia britain canada and all the other nations and peoples involved in the final victory what an eye opener
<START> i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie but i had no idea what i was getting myself into br br i started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture br br i finally know what hell is like it's this movie for eternity this movie has no value it didn't even really have a plot there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens br br instead of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest <UNK> with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie br br don't even watch it not even to see how bad it is i beg you if you watch it then it means they win
<START> i always felt that a good film should have a plot this particular film was missing one and i feel that it would have been more effective with a plot this was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever i was anxious for it to finally end however i just noticed that it was only <UNK> minutes long it felt like four hours not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict it's not the worst movie i've seen but i used to say that it was until i saw the fast and the furious so don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action i actually hate most action films out today it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum not much really happens in this movie however the scenery and costumes were nice
<START> i always look forward to this movie when its on tv have to get the dvd i guess the range of different types of people is great it says to me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough my favorite character must be mr <UNK> he is so quirky but so full of emotions it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to <UNK> would make for the perfect sequel if they had but i guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened br br a very simple and innocent story he stays loyal to his wife and daughter br br i haven't seen the hollywood remake not sure if i want to i don't really enjoy jennifer lopez i think richard gere more matches the original than lopez i have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent
<START> this is a very odd film i wasn't really sure what is was about some n london <UNK> find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of <UNK> and somehow makes them all in their own way change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster the film ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite <UNK> almost annoyed at the <UNK> of it all i didn't care about any of the characters none of them get a chance to <UNK> themselves to the viewer br br what was the message am i being dim it was just too odd what happens to runner why does <UNK> shoot the kid that made absolutely no sense pointless can someone help me understand this mess of a film
<START> must have to agree with the other reviewer this has got to be the worst movie let alone western i have ever seen terrible acting dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the <UNK> and oh did i mention a <UNK> pack <UNK> displayed on the back of one of the characters i was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene and the ending the least i can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie completely awful and yes it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable let's remember when shots when a main character dies luckily i saw this on free tv don't waste your time
<START> imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch as soon as i first heard that my attention was locked on the trailer and after the first episode i found my self in love with this show a modern day fairy tale that brings my spirits up and holds my attention throughout the entire show i think the acting and casting is just perfect each character brings something unique to the show that adds to it's perfection even the one time villains manage to <UNK> with a unique sense from the <UNK> man to the guy who can swallow <UNK> they never seem to let me down and the deaths that would normally lead to a depressing moment often end up being purely comical such as an exploding scratch <UNK> book br br even with the large amount of crime shows we have now a days daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest being not just a mystery but a love story comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama all baked into one wonderful pie <UNK> show br br what really shocked me was the fact that it was on abc for years i never had a reason to turn to abc but this brought me back each week with a smile on my face it was as if pushing daisies brought abc back to life for me but just like that after two seasons a few awards a large fan base and positive <UNK> from critics the show has been dropped it seems as though ned has touched abc again and forever killed it for me i will always be a fan of this show though and i recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they watch
<START> i loved this movie it was almost the same as the first cabin by the lake only instead of just killing women he kills men also and the scenes are much more interesting 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing <UNK> last moments before she is thrown to the water and secondly when stanley is visiting allison in his basement right before they head down to the set when she kisses him those scenes for me were very intense and riveting i gave the movie a rating of 8 10 not because the movie was bad but because the filming was bad i mean there were times when you'd notice nothing was wrong like its being shot the way a film is usually shot you wouldn't see the live camera shooting but then very little you would notice the filming mistakes what went wrong
<START> the music of <UNK> <UNK> this film once and a while it is played with original <UNK> e g piano but never full orchestra but often it is re worked with various contemporary <UNK> e g guitar and <UNK> e g jazz piano only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances often flamenco but not always i would guess that there are <UNK> scenes which are not united by a plot not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer in my case about half reached the <UNK> though all the rest were in their own way very fine those that worked for me moved me to <UNK> flesh aesthetic delight indeed the final scene left me <UNK> with joy and in some very magical way it brings you deep into spanish culture if you don't like subtitles don't worry the film is virtually <UNK> though each scene carries a title of an <UNK> piece seeing this very beautiful film <UNK> my complaint that virtually none of the films of <UNK> are available on dvd in the usa i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of carmen a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not here european dvd's won't play on american dvd players this is a scandal
<START> after a dirty shame i never thought that i was going to see another john waters movie that movie was really so bad that i was convinced that all his movies would be like that but when the dvd of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie i decided to give it a try anyway only a couple of days later it was shown on television i taped it out of curiosity and now that i've seen it i can tell you that this pecker sure is a lot better than a dirty shame br br in this movie we see how a young <UNK> from <UNK> becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of new york he's a <UNK> shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a <UNK> when he keeps his very first <UNK> in the shop where he works his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness his photographs are sold for enormous <UNK> but when he sees how his family friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to new york they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him and they do but what they get to see there is a bigger shock than they could ever imagine br br it's not difficult to see why i loved this movie a lot more than a dirty shame the first reason is that this movie has an actual story this movie really has something to say and isn't just intended to shock as many people as possible the fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they don't know what the reality is like isn't just funny it's not that far from the truth either i guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it but apparently we are all supposed to like it the second reason why i liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer i'm not saying that everything that you will see is great but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like edward <UNK> christina <UNK> br br overall this isn't a great movie but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes which never really go too far this is an enjoyable movie it certainly isn't the best comedy ever but i liked it a lot more than a dirty shame i give this movie a 6 5 10
<START> my nose is bent slightly out of shape as i write this i had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared so i assume it was rejected even though it met all the usual <UNK> br br i found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes particularly the performance of <UNK> <UNK> a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as blow and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is also quite good unfortunately everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful melodramatic script there is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an <UNK> nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art br br an actual day trip to the beach at <UNK> would be much less <UNK> than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere anytime
<START> this movie could only <UNK> in the 1970's it's a bizarre action movie set in a small california workers town some sort of mill or plant is closing down so suddenly rampant bad behavior is occurring in the streets the <UNK> are fed up so ben arnold jan michael vincent goes to another town to <UNK> his brother aaron played by kris kristofferson aaron is a vietnam vet who looks and acts a <UNK> balance he hangs out with a bunch of other <UNK> vietnam <UNK> they come into town to clean it up they become <UNK> but underneath their good deeds they are actually running gambling houses asking for protection money etc it takes a while for people to catch on and in a biblical cain and <UNK> showdown vincent has to take on his older brother there's an interesting blue collar sleaze atmosphere to this movie which makes it interesting note the <UNK> fighting scene vincent is almost too <UNK> in this role  he thinks so highly of his brother he cannot <UNK> of him committing the evil deeds he's accused of he finally comes to his senses  his girlfriend victoria principal is brutally shot in the back he himself is beaten up in his home kris kristofferson is <UNK> effective as aaron he <UNK> <UNK> any wrong doing and even gently <UNK> and talks to <UNK> young daughter she refers to him as <UNK> <UNK> even while he's threatening her father's life all the while smiling vincent and kristofferson have good <UNK> chemistry with each other <UNK> peters makes an interesting appearance as a <UNK> girl who <UNK> <UNK> attention this is a good 70's action movie if you can find it it is not available on dvd <UNK>
<START> if you want an <UNK> and reasonably amusing hour or so then it's ok to watch this it's not all that bad really yeah it's got more <UNK> in logic than i care to describe here and might tax the patience of people like myself i have to admit who are inclined to throw things at the tv on occasion but it's funny at least just because it's not always intentionally funny there's no need to let that get you down br br however if you've read the book or any of the other books by <UNK> then you'd probably best avoid it i've read them all and when i first watched this film i <UNK> it i've <UNK> it in detail and at great length on another site in fact the tv plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and <UNK> many faithful and admittedly <UNK> <UNK> fans br br best bit of advice watch this then read the book and only then make your comparisons and submit your judgement
<START> i enjoyed watching <UNK> young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the lds faith i think that a remake of this epic journey across the <UNK> would be <UNK> since many people today are not familiar with the trials and <UNK> faced by the early mormon church it is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people br br as a member of the church the single most disturbing aspect of the film most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much was the portrayal of <UNK> young as one that had <UNK> <UNK> church members into believing he had been called to be <UNK> <UNK> as the prophet although i understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact when in reality both <UNK> and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church <UNK> did not <UNK> <UNK> the saints rather he led them <UNK> by inspiration the point is important for <UNK> because on it <UNK> an important aspect of our faith that god truly speaks to <UNK> today and that <UNK> young like joseph smith was an inspired prophet of god br br whether or not you believe this statement or not just know that the film does not accurately portray what <UNK> himself believed
<START> don't read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of the <UNK> lake monster to be a total surprise br br a <UNK> <UNK> rises from the depths of <UNK> lake to <UNK> havoc on a group of local <UNK> not to mention your fast forward button to call the <UNK> lake monster amateurish is to <UNK> the obvious if you aren't a fan of low budget drive in films you probably wouldn't be looking here in the first place br br the problem with the movie is that when there's no monster action going on it really sucks and goes nowhere the script is very ed wood ish in that it's utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences nothing is too outlandish for the <UNK> lake monster it explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into <UNK> lake <UNK> the water to the point where it <UNK> a dinosaur egg that has apparently been <UNK> at the bottom of the lake for <UNK> even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained <UNK> and <UNK> wouldn't <UNK> the water to such a high <UNK> cause most of the lake to <UNK> other than some token fog in one or two scenes we see no evidence of the water being hot other than a few lines in the script br br the script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> a couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their <UNK> is being <UNK> they decide to rent a boat and head out into <UNK> lake <UNK> do you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity in a sequence that's just plain bizarre a drunk <UNK> a <UNK> store and decides to murder the <UNK> and a <UNK> instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze a car chase ensues and wouldn't ya know it they end up right by the lake <UNK> time for <UNK> yeah it's not hard to figure out and you're so far ahead of the script that you're irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold br br the <UNK> of it all is endearing and i really want to like the <UNK> lake monster i just can't do it there's not enough here to go on and this is more of a movie to put on during a party because you could talk right over it and it wouldn't matter br br the film has a slim list of the things going for it the most important being the dinosaur itself which appears in three forms a shadow puppet a large model head that is dragged <UNK> through the water and a fully realized <UNK> insert that actually looks pretty good there are also a pair of lovable <UNK> in it and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie a downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster and one of our beloved <UNK> so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it why was i so affected by this conclusion was it the <UNK> song played over the closing credits or was i just <UNK> <UNK> for the time that i waste watching films like this
<START> frank sinatra plays a no <UNK> ex soldier and frustrated writer hard living and hard drinking who returns to his <UNK> hometown and <UNK> with his estranged brother arthur kennedy now the town big shot with a <UNK> wife and <UNK> daughter frank gets involved with <UNK> dean martin <UNK> <UNK> shirley <UNK> and has some run ins with the law but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman over <UNK> drama <UNK> on soap opera with a role for <UNK> that is by turns overly <UNK> and embarrassingly sentimental her drunken <UNK> on after you've gone is however the film's highlight and is expertly handled director <UNK> minnelli <UNK> it in straight forward fashion but he's in surprisingly <UNK> spirits and most of the big scenes are flat or dense the picture looks incredibly handsome in widescreen with a nice eye for detail and composition but the story and these characters are stuck in the <UNK> from
<START> such a film of beauty that it's hard to describe maybe it's the absence of superfluous dialogue or maybe it's the absolutely stellar soundtrack or maybe it's just <UNK> <UNK> feet but it's a joy to watch this movie again and again i've never seen another indian movie that comes close to it and few from any country rival its perfection
<START> terrible just terrible probably the worst film i have ever seen and i did see some pretty bad pictures throughout the years the sound sucks so does the quality of the picture the direction the acting etc etc the only good shoots meaning funny because they're so bad are the special effects overall there are about 5 minutes worth of laughs the rest of the flick gives you brain damage
<START> i was fully <UNK> up to see this film i had been waiting a year for it to be <UNK> down here in new zealand i shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt <UNK> worst film there is so much wrong with this film first off some of the acting is great in particular nick <UNK> as 'the <UNK> and the girl with the curly brown hair i can't recall her name but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable especially leo <UNK> he's a veteran of <UNK> films now and he was so brilliant in <UNK> but in <UNK> he <UNK> his lines with such <UNK> as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually the screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student no sorry a high school student one who has never seen a movie before and i couldn't <UNK> <UNK> intentions was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence it sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good <UNK> i'm no <UNK> but i didn't need to see teenage breasts and <UNK> every 5 minutes i still maintain that <UNK> best film is <UNK> day in <UNK> it's fantastic and i don't think he'll ever top it
<START> class of <UNK> br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format <UNK> br br in <UNK> class members from the west point academy are torn apart by the <UNK> of the civil war br br gregory <UNK> ok historical drama makes an obvious point <UNK> men are rendered blind by conflict though the production seems a little stilted despite authentic period detail and a cast of talented <UNK> clive owen <UNK> <UNK> josh lucas andre <UNK> laura <UNK> etc <UNK> by dan <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> who takes up arms in <UNK> of slavery <UNK> him in direct conflict with his former northern friends the movie's emphasis on such a misguided though sympathetic character is particularly brave but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial and <UNK> direction is efficient rather than inspired
<START> like most people i've seen jason <UNK> on tv and i think he's great but i didn't know he had a sister <UNK> <UNK> is simply <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> other woman good music intrigue and a death scene involving <UNK> revenge on an abusive dr that will stay with you for weeks i'll leave it at that kudos
<START> if you are a <UNK> if there is a fire burning into your heart if you'd call home every place on earth but none of them can give you enough if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there see this movie and you'll find out a little but wonderful piece of life sitting next to you
<START> some films are so bad that they're good this is clearly not one of them based on a true story this film was about as true to the story as <UNK> chances of becoming a real boy the acting was terrible the direction was poor and it <UNK> way too fast it was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home br br nor did melissa joan hart ever strike me as a talented actress but then every film she made was pretty low budget anyway like most of her other films she lets down her characters by <UNK> them up too much talking too quickly as if <UNK> up her words is going to make her more dramatic she really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she's talking to a camera when she should be engaging the viewer in her character it pretty much lets down the whole film and any leg that it may have had left to stand on is ruined br br probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end but even that wasn't satisfying enough to <UNK> my loathing for such a bad film br br watch it if your taste in film is <UNK> than a piece of dry <UNK>
<START> even if you <UNK> to the <UNK> jerk anti free trade politics of this movie it is still just the same tired note played again and again and again <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even if you can accept a preacher with <UNK> hair who <UNK> a return to first principles the <UNK> billy is pretty hard to look at as a serious figure the <UNK> <UNK> is the sort who wakes every morning with no <UNK> more <UNK> than to see his own face on tv before he climbs back into bed that night he has a pretty wife i have to admit but it would take tons more than that to save this dreary mess of a movie the interminable bus rides are the worst part with progress shown can you guess by a colored line moving across a map <UNK> you guessed oh well it has the virtue of being short is that the only <UNK> thing i can say <UNK> yep afraid so
<START> had this been the original <UNK> version of tess of the storm country also starring mary pickford i probably would have rated it a lot higher as this sort of extreme melodrama and sentimentality was pretty typical of the teens however by <UNK> this film was already starting to show its age and compared to many of ms <UNK> other films such as daddy <UNK> <UNK> my best girl and <UNK> tess comes up a tad short and not every pickford film merits a 10 even if she was america's sweetheart now this isn't to say that it's a bad film it certainly isn't but i just can't see how so many have given this film a 10 br br the film has a very long and complicated plot especially because most films of the era were shorter a rich old <UNK> builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river at the bottom of the hill are some dirty <UNK> who he hates but who he cannot <UNK> so he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land one ends up in tragedy when his daughter's fiancé is killed in a <UNK> with the <UNK> folks the man accused of the murder is dear old <UNK> father though he is innocent to make things a lot worse the only witness to the real murder won't talk and the dead man had gotten his fiancée pregnant so at this point we have an innocent man in prison waiting to be executed and a pregnant lady afraid to tell her <UNK> father she is in the family way there's a ton more to the film such as the <UNK> son falling in love with mary but it's best you just see the film for yourself br br the film excels in some ways the plot while very complicated is also rather interesting and the cinematography is top notch the very final scene is also pretty cute however there is so much overt sentimentality you can practically cut it with a knife mary is so good and so sweet and so <UNK> at times the viewer might find it all a bit hard to take while it worked great in <UNK> making her the biggest star in the world today it's very dated this is not true of all her films but this one certainly is br br by the way the image entertainment dvd is of decent quality though a few scenes are badly <UNK> something that isn't very surprising considering the age of the film also the only extras included are a brief filmography
<START> steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldn't win by directing special effects epics he was nominated for three of them close encounters of the third kind <UNK> of the lost <UNK> and e t the extra <UNK> so he decided to get very serious by directing the color purple a period film with no special effects spielberg's first serious drama is a remarkable movie but the academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give spielberg any respect the color purple received 11 oscar nominations including best picture but spielberg was unfairly <UNK> when he wasn't nominated for best director it got worse on oscar night when this film didn't win a single oscar it got completely shut out that wasn't right the color purple should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi <UNK> spectacular film debut as <UNK> a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband <UNK> placed by danny glover then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends oprah <UNK> also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as <UNK> one of those <UNK> of <UNK> since i'm from chicago i had already known <UNK> from her talk show which at the time of this <UNK> release hadn't gone <UNK> like goldberg what a film debut margaret <UNK> is terrific as <UNK> <UNK> another friend who also happens to be the mistress of <UNK> rotten husband all three actresses received well deserved oscar nominations for their work here goldberg for best actress <UNK> and <UNK> for best supporting actress set in the south during the first half of the 20th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end it also made me laugh at times too why academy voters were so hard on not <UNK> spielberg for best director is a mystery that still <UNK> me today but spielberg would <UNK> go on to win two oscars years later for <UNK> list and saving private ryan making him one of the best movie directors of all time but he should have gotten nominated for this movie the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like e t to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkable br br out of four
<START> the number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first 9 they don't follow their own rules about spirits where destruction of the body makes the spirit <UNK> this one dropped a second body that body and dean drop about 20 feet from sam but then they are right with sam <UNK> go out in an <UNK> asylum at night and we can still see everything it's night but light is <UNK> through the windows a ghost that died in 1960's is making cell phones calls come on there is no way sam could get a psychiatrist to see him in the same day he makes an <UNK> and the doctor talks to sam like it wasn't his first visit sam and dean knew there were other bodies in the asylum and innocent spirits still lurking and didn't do anything to help them that doesn't seem like a thing the winchester boys would do oh and after <UNK> around on a dirt filled <UNK> and all around a nasty asylum the girls' makeup and hair is perfect and not a <UNK> on her white shirt br br while the <UNK> of this episode had problems the premise was good and a few times i was not <UNK> out but nervous as dean sat reading <UNK> <UNK> i just knew that an object so intensely personal to the ghost would draw it to the person <UNK> it's <UNK> <UNK> didn't appear maybe that is a fault for such an important object or place like <UNK> office should draw the spirit when a living being touches or enters when they separate i want to scream <UNK> how you die always stay together and watch each others backs ' but they don't listen to me o the <UNK> spirit and his special ability was a very nice touch it's prime time show but i do wish the horror of <UNK> <UNK> one of his victims down and using anticipation of torture to creep us out further br br especially because of the lighting goofs i gave this a 4 sudden darkness or the <UNK> of the whole <UNK> lighting as the <UNK> <UNK> is all that more terrifying the lighter coming or the <UNK> <UNK> and instantly a spirit is in their face is shocking i understand the directors wants us to see his scene but then make a mention or obvious connection by <UNK> touching an electric <UNK> and the lights coming on have the characters respond to the fact an asylum with no power suddenly has lights in the one room blue white lights <UNK> as electric <UNK> just like <UNK> finger power br br seriously <UNK> could have done better
<START> i saw this movie today and i have to say it was much much better than i expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it personally i had some prejudice due to the language of it but it did totally change my idea the movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances it was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it this really touched me and as a film which is based on a true story it convinced me a new school psycho <UNK> and a young boy who get known with a new teacher a bit different one than the others and about fighting for the things even if they doesn't seem to work out it showed how little things can make huge changes in many things and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations also i think the actor <UNK> has succeeded perfectly it really felt like you had been some person watching the episodes as an <UNK> when they happened before i spoil this movie with <UNK> i have to admit that there were some things and situations that didn't look and feel realistic like the one where the <UNK> of the school beat <UNK> aka martin in front of the class at the end of the movie he really got beaten badly but the only thing that it caused to him was some blood coming from the nose when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning when <UNK> got some <UNK> well i guess every movie has it own faults have to say that if i someday somewhere find this dvd from the store it's sure thing that i take it with me
<START> this is another fantasy favorite from ralph bakshi after watching it on youtube that is set in the distant past after the ice age it is a <UNK> sword and <UNK> quest between good and evil <UNK> lord of the realm of ice and his mother queen <UNK> has set their sights on conquest of the known world when their <UNK> <UNK> the village of a man named <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> to avenge his people and kill the ice lord meanwhile the sub human <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> capture <UNK> king <UNK> <UNK> daughter princess <UNK> but she manages to escape and eventually meets with <UNK> who promises to <UNK> her back to <UNK> if the sub humans don't find them first br br this movie did very little box office as did most of ralph bakshi's films but has become a cult classic partly for the quality of the art a collaboration between ralph bakshi and the famed fantasy artist frank <UNK> also i have heard that the screenplay was written by <UNK> <UNK> and roy thomas the two men who had done conan comic book stories and the background <UNK> included james <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> novels though admittedly i had never read conan or <UNK> and also the painter thomas <UNK> noted for his artwork for <UNK> music boxes for the <UNK> exchange company besides paintings and like bakshi's films the lord of the rings and american pop this movie was <UNK> but the process works better in this film than in the former br br so overall i think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made and an awesome collaboration between two great minds ralph bakshi and frank <UNK> with plenty of fantasy sexual innuendo and thrilling adventure
<START> i remember watching this movie when i was young but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies i find it and think to myself that is the title this movie is a kind of combination disaster film <UNK> attack film with fewer notable stars in it it is also somewhat boring too as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such the plot has this sort of resort being <UNK> by ants i think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby but do not quote me on that the most memorable <UNK> attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being <UNK> and of course <UNK> attack scene too what else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard <UNK> to breath through in the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants
<START> well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that i signed up for an imdb account just to warn people it is <UNK> awful nothing makes sense in this movie there is way too many subplots for a start josh <UNK> character is an aspiring actor and <UNK> <UNK> as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches <UNK> to hot girls some of whom wait naked in his <UNK> for when he comes back from work add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being <UNK> by the hapless duo harrison ford's character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the internal affairs <UNK> ex wife who happens to run a psychic radio show which ford's character calls from time to time nonsense br br i can't remember the characters names that's how forgettable this is so i'll refer to them as ford and <UNK> br br then there's the dialogue which is brutal i mean cringe inducing stuff here throw in every cliché in the book having a heart to heart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name the duo being <UNK> by internal affairs why <UNK> confronting his <UNK> killer and you've got one hell of a mess br br as i mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is non existent 1 when ford's car is being <UNK> how the hell did the <UNK> guys know where it would be <UNK> were they following him 2 when <UNK> goes to the <UNK> and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene an <UNK> is <UNK> on of the <UNK> bodies there that was lucky 3 when the two are arrested and taken in for questioning ford keeps answering his phone and <UNK> centers himself with a <UNK> pose on the table instead of taking the phone from ford the <UNK> guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before ford does meanwhile the female <UNK> officer in with <UNK> is <UNK> herself all over him then inexplicably the two are released without answering any questions 4 during the car chase <UNK> car is crashing and <UNK> its way around hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again not a scratch 5 when ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at 6 when the two are chasing the bad guy around in <UNK> car ford is trying to close a real estate deal come on 7 the bad guy is the most unconvincing record <UNK> ever his motivation for killing an aspiring group of <UNK> on his label they might leave his label and it's a warning to keep his other groups loyal but hang on how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan 8 why is the <UNK> guy who is investigating ford arrested in the end there is no <UNK> 9 and <UNK> gets to use his acting to capture the bad guy in the end br br i could go on i really could anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because that's all it is there's nothing else to it it's not supposed to be satirical or ironic it's just crap
<START> identical twin sisters mary kate and ashley olsen <UNK> to fame in sitcoms like two of a kind i had never seen them in anything before but i had an idea of what to expect but it was much worse basically the hunter sisters <UNK> mary kate and <UNK> ashley are in rome for a summer <UNK> program but not long after starting their jobs they are immediately fired for a series of <UNK> but the man who owns the company they are working in derek <UNK> julian stone gives them their jobs back and they they do slowly prove themselves useful <UNK> and talented fashion artists and help stop a mean man taking over the company also starring leslie <UNK> as <UNK> derek lee <UNK> as ryan <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> and matt <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> you can tell that this film was made to go straight to video the camera work is completely <UNK> and it doesn't help when you want to admire the sights of rome in fact the background is the only good thing to watch the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities around i knew before watching that they weren't going to interest me in any way their not even that pretty this is awful <UNK> of rubbish film pretty poor
<START> the original animated dark knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals mask of phantasm in its <UNK> there's a lot of style and intelligence in mystery of the batwoman so much more than batman forever or batman and robin br br there's a new crime fighter on the streets of <UNK> she dresses like a bat but she's not a grown up <UNK> and batman is denying any <UNK> with her meanwhile bruce wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work but the penguin <UNK> and the local mob makes things little more complicated br br i didn't have high hopes for this <UNK> since being strongly let down but the weak batman sub zero robin isn't featured so much here but i was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces the clever plot and a <UNK> sense of humor this is definitely a movie no fan of batman should be without keep your ears open for a really catchy song called <UNK> <UNK> which is featured <UNK> through out br br it's a shame the dvd isn't so great don't get me wrong there are some great features the short <UNK> <UNK> is awesome and a very cool <UNK> 5 1 soundtrack but the movie is presented in pan and <UNK> batman mystery of the batwoman was drawn and shot in 1 85 1 but this dvd is presented in 1 33 1 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there is picture cut off on both sides i find this extremely annoying considering mask of phantasm was presented in <UNK> widescreen warner have had to re release literally dozens of movies on dvd because people have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me br br i would give this dvd 5 5 but the lack of <UNK> brings the overall score down to 4 5 it's a shame because widescreen would have completed a great dvd package
<START> wealthy psychiatrist lindsay <UNK> has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it's hopeless to help her patients a young gambling <UNK> client asks her to help him pay off his <UNK> if he truly wants to help him get better here she gets involved with joe <UNK> to reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and <UNK> of <UNK> may very well be the best con movie i've seen david mamet wrote and directed this gem that's full of snappy dialogue great one liners and enough twists to keep you guessing <UNK> the end <UNK> is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and <UNK> tops her as the <UNK> sly con man and with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie the film is in utter control of it's audience and we are loving the con br br out of
<START> paul reiser is one of my favorite people in show business i have read both of his books and think that he is great peter <UNK> can deliver a punch line with the best of them the combination of the two is magic br br this is a story about a family really getting to know each other through a road trip a father and son connect for the first time in their lives in the <UNK> of a family crisis they do all the things that fathers and sons are suppose to do in life they are just doing them much later in life the situations are very funny but have the feeling that they could actually happen to people in real life not <UNK> over the top or cartoonish this is the first time that i watch paul reiser and fully believed every emotion that was portrayed at times his eyes look so sad br br <UNK> movie and great story and plot it has comedy and emotion but an uplifting message olympia <UNK> does a great job also
<START> first lesson that some film makers particularly those inspired by hollywood need to know just <UNK> does not sell i guess tashan when translated will mean style second if you are hell bent on selling style that does not spare you from having a decent story br br tashan has some story which could have <UNK> with some better director but it is not slick for example all three saif kareena and akshay are <UNK> at different points in the story but this setup is not <UNK> to properly there could have been a better mix and match of their <UNK> actions sequences are from the seventies br br <UNK> of the film is awful i think <UNK> <UNK> just sleep walked through this film <UNK> <UNK> have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film why is there a <UNK> song <UNK> <UNK> in tashan why is the cool <UNK> song <UNK> dance <UNK> not on anil kapoor when he is the one who is english crazy br br akshay kumar is the saving grace of the film but he is in his stereotyped self you won't mind missing this film
<START> throw this lame dog a bone <UNK> bad you may watch anyway <UNK> ross <UNK> is an <UNK> bad guy that escapes being <UNK> by an over <UNK> spaceship commander jan michael vincent <UNK> manages to steal a <UNK> that crash lands on earth an <UNK> <UNK> killer is sent to bring back the villain dead or alive john phillip law plays a forest park ranger that <UNK> caution in dealing with these two <UNK> from far far away costumes are outrageous and the script is lacking intelligence vincent surely took the money and ran law shows the only sign of effort so bad it is almost comical also in the cast <UNK> <UNK> p j soles and dawn <UNK>
<START> this is a generally nice film with good story great actors and great songs the cinematography was unfortunately bad one of the film's weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from pretty woman why does it hurt to attempt some originality <UNK> <UNK> anyone br br the film is about a newly married couple raj and <UNK> salman <UNK> <UNK> cannot <UNK> after an accident she had during the previous <UNK> and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother who will carry their child they pick <UNK> a vulgar prostitute played by <UNK> <UNK> the film is not really realistic i mean isn't it easier to adopt and even if they pick a girl does it mean the man has to sleep with her have you heard of <UNK> anyway i guess if the writers had heard of all this the film wouldn't have been made so the concept is apparently intentional br br salman acts very well it's nice to see him playing a serious character but his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman come on it's cheesy and unrealistic <UNK> is just about ok she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by <UNK> <UNK> br br the film belongs to <UNK> who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance she makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally she lives the film <UNK> and makes you love her and admire her at the same time partly because of her role partly because of her <UNK> and positive personality this is one of her career best performances there is no doubt she is more talented than her industry <UNK> she just should do more such roles br br the film's ending only highlights what i said above it is tear <UNK> exciting and very well acted watch it for <UNK> br br 7 10 for the film 10 10 for <UNK>
<START> i remember watching lost missile actually throwing a fit until my brother and several cousins at whose home i was an overnight guest agreed to watch it with me i was from time to time the eric <UNK> of the 1960s sorry guys and being somewhat embarrassed when the <UNK> wave of million degree heat emerged as a plot device even as a second <UNK> i knew that a mere missile just couldn't carry the energy around for that much heat or <UNK> over more than the duration and limited <UNK> of a nuclear <UNK> br br my <UNK> that turkey on loving relatives was a self <UNK> crime br br the film's production values were very good the acting isn't bad apart from the <UNK> of the actor who played <UNK> <UNK> that someone else here mentioned br br but the idea of a missile easy <UNK> the surface of the earth by means of the heat of its <UNK> no br br <UNK> the people at mystery science theater 3000 miss the lost missile anyway br br it's a great classic of unintentional comedy watch it if you want something to drink beer to some weekend
<START> in reviewing this film i can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in july august and september of 1971 in that garden spot of the earth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> take the high ground was not anything like i remember basic training br br but one has to remember at the time this was post korea which ended in a <UNK> but it was a conventional war as we knew them it was not vietnam a jungle <UNK> war where we kept <UNK> <UNK> into an endless pit the draft at that time was an <UNK> but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense br br richard widmark is a veteran of korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas the film is about one of his training <UNK> and the men of the platoon he has to train they're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade br br one thing i will praise take the high ground for is the fact that mgm recognized our army was now an integrated one with the presence of william <UNK> as a black <UNK> in the platoon it was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing br br but i will say that a <UNK> like russ <UNK> would have been <UNK> of his smart mouth from day one richard widmark would have not <UNK> death or becoming a <UNK> in order to give <UNK> <UNK> confidence with a weapon and no way would have he worried so much about robert arthur <UNK> he's have just let the <UNK> deal with him br br of course being shot in and around <UNK> bliss and el <UNK> texas did give take the high ground good authenticity but view it as an army <UNK> film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave <UNK> back in the day br br i do remember the <UNK> <UNK> having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you weren't worried about them getting on your case for something which was 95 of the time but there ain't no way that karl malden would have <UNK> widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the <UNK> both would have realized that would have <UNK> authority something the military just doesn't let happen br br i wish i could have said something better about take the high ground because i certainly like its talented cast it's talented director richard brooks even the silly theme by <UNK> <UNK> and ned washington fresh from their oscar a year before for high <UNK> the film actually got an oscar nomination for best screenplay and story by <UNK> kaufman it must have been for <UNK> vivid imagination
<START> this movie is like real life by which i mean not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so and not much game plan or plot is <UNK> by the frequently invisible cast their <UNK> being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers br br a big bore no big surprise that altman <UNK> this he is a very <UNK> performer yes we all loved <UNK> park but <UNK> a porter anyone kansas city dr t and the women <UNK> but the fact that the raw material is a john <UNK> tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering <UNK> of your <UNK> <UNK> makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film and no it is not so bad it's good br br it's just bad
<START> this is an absolutely incredible film it shows south african racism from the perspective of the victims and <UNK> a feeling of anti racism in everyone who sees it it is the best historic film i have ever seen
<START> i wait for each new episode each re run with anticipation the new look of sci fi created by stargate sg 1 is a wonder that i hope will never end to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me season 9 should be a thrill in itself i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season as i love his dry wit as much as his temper <UNK> in his character as jack o'neill the other characters add their own <UNK> to the show that makes it a winner season after season you <UNK> this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake also you need a bigger role for the <UNK> they are just too cool
<START> i saw this film earlier today and i was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters it didn't feel like a film it felt more like a documentary the part i liked best the leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year old girls i know br br all in all a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films
<START> i <UNK> sometimes you try and try and try to be <UNK> towards all the b thru z grade movies out there but once in a while a particular movie just <UNK> your patience until you want to slap everyone involved bat people which i saw under the title it lives by night is just such a movie you can't watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on night gallery and not one of the better ones either br br the movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to <UNK> into a were bat who drinks human blood actually you'd think if he was turning into a real bat he'd be eating <UNK> by the <UNK> bucket but because this is a cheap lurid horror movie <UNK> the word in spite of the fact that he has grand <UNK> <UNK> at the drop of a hat and black out episodes almost every night his friend and fellow <UNK> dr mustache <UNK> extreme insists that he's just having an <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> shots meanwhile the world's most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and <UNK> of several local girls and one <UNK> also meanwhile the doctor's wife decides that denial is a river in egypt and alternately <UNK> him and <UNK> him to distraction br br it's not so much that the acting is bad you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script even the guy who plays the sheriff okay it is pretty bad but it's bad in a clichéd wooden professional way it's just that everything about the acting the way the scenes are paced the costumes the dialog the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to well slap everyone involved br br i think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky unsettling little cult favorite but br br 1 the director needed to beat michael <UNK> an experienced character actor with a chair until <UNK> agreed to act and not just channel dennis weaver br br 2 he also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole bat bites human who then turns into a bat scenario br br 3 he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his <UNK> instead of <UNK> to man has a <UNK> page from the little golden book of clichéd acting mannerisms br br 4 he needed to <UNK> the whole <UNK> character make her both more intelligent less shrill and <UNK> more <UNK> br br i would never <UNK> watch this film again except with the help of mike and the <UNK> it's bad but it isn't bad in a silly humorous or interesting way still better than battlefield earth or <UNK> though
<START> most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of <UNK> cut off from the <UNK> in which they study and live their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college <UNK> steven <UNK> documentary is a prime example of a <UNK> college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members br br the documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population as is usual the people who scream the most get the most media attention other than its <UNK> of the community in which the film was set the documentary was well made my only <UNK> is that the feelings and <UNK> depicted in the film were attributed to the entire community rather than the few individuals who expressed them br br naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political <UNK> but it is ridiculous to <UNK> an entire community of people in the actions of a few <UNK>
<START> this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children's comic i gave it 2 out of 10 for it's attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make up was good br br this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally usually seen in one of their <UNK> no interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any <UNK> of those people in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the supposedly <UNK> book as for actually learning something that no one knew about the program and wasn't common knowledge well that never happened
<START> at the time i recall being quite <UNK> and amused by this movie i referred to it as the most important movie i'd seen in ten years and found myself <UNK> into people who said similar things br br <UNK> has an unusually <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had into a <UNK> adult world view the two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers hi skip i wish you weren't my brother so i could you br br <UNK> search for herself after returning to la from new york results in the <UNK> trying on of various <UNK> all of which fit poorly for our amusement but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a black <UNK> values system that the real <UNK> of her <UNK> is whether black culture accepts her it's been a while nina <UNK> comes to mind and she has an impressive <UNK> built black lover in the movie a pretty black girl <UNK> the shows and seems to be <UNK> <UNK> faux <UNK> but ultimately rejects her br br just as <UNK> <UNK> themselves lucky to suffer for christ here sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she <UNK> a place as if she <UNK> her <UNK> and her <UNK> it's the only value system <UNK> in the films world outside of <UNK> arty confusion br br for a nation whose chief issues are racism and money it's refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an <UNK> way
<START> with this topic it is so easy to take cheap shots you know the guy with hairy legs trying to look like marilyn monroe not here adrian <UNK> does a superb job of making <UNK> a real person someone you care deeply about and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as <UNK> and <UNK> not only that but as <UNK> he looks hot and the chemistry between him and julie <UNK> is electric these are two characters who feel love for one another and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table even the potentially cheesy sub story line of corporate <UNK> is believable and you find yourself cheering at the end at least i did
<START> it's not like that big mechanical toy says a character early on commenting on jaws well blood surf would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the jaws series in other words the digital special effects of this movie are terrible acting and directing are not much better either they seem more suited to a <UNK> or a bubble <UNK> commercial than to a horror movie the attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre but for the audience too saying you liked this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap further destroying the poor horror genre 1 2
<START> for those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and around the valley <UNK> we not forget the tedious days of road <UNK> and film making as a reminder to those that live here locales include <UNK> creek <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> big <UNK> etc the bank was the <UNK> <UNK> chase scenes included moon drive off <UNK> <UNK> empire grade <UNK> and <UNK> 1 br br production jeffrey jones was the most <UNK> matt <UNK> was above us all even back then as far as the film goes a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot but who cares at this level a nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast and valley scenery br br additional notes <UNK> bar <UNK> <UNK> in the film original name of the film was welcome to <UNK> the old <UNK> parking lot was the town square the backyard shots were off of <UNK> street in <UNK> creek turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days
<START> why because for one reason there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than ann <UNK> singing bye bye <UNK> at the opening she <UNK> it again at the ending too in a different mood both wonderful rent it and see even if that's all of it that you watch you'll agree i'm sure br br everything about the original was so excellent it just didn't need a remake sorry jason and vanessa gave commendable performances as well as <UNK> and <UNK> in fact all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their <UNK> ' but it's like trying to improve on casablanca it just can't be done it's even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake and it just falls short through no fault of the actors
<START> sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one you can only stand about 5 minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you <UNK> back into blockbuster and demand your money back i will now look at michael clarke <UNK> with <UNK> why he <UNK> his name to this <UNK>
<START> a typical romp through cheech and <UNK> reality which includes drugs singing more drugs cars and driving even more drugs pee wee aliens <UNK> <UNK> stand up comedy surprisingly more drugs and space coke it is not as coherent or plausible as up in smoke but it still is incredibly funny without becoming as strange as nice dreams there are some classic scenes which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work also funny is <UNK> song mexican americans and <UNK> follow up song another notable scene is the <UNK> office scene with jones human noise machine from the police academy series and the old laughing man all in all this is a great follow up to up in smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not br br celluloid <UNK>
<START> in the opening scenes of this movie a man shot <UNK> through his hotel room into another man's bathroom and blew out all the lights this must have been very <UNK> for 1936 but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film robin hood did not make an appearance as far as i could see however bette davis <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of august <UNK> was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in hollywood <UNK> never stopped <UNK> or being very sexy with her <UNK> and so called swim suit on her <UNK> with george brent johnny jones the spiral <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even <UNK> marriage to johnny in a <UNK> wheel upside down and even got a black eye davis and brent made a great couple one suppose to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter off stage davis and brent were having a real <UNK> love affair which is good reason why there was sparks when these two appeared in this film if you liked bette davis and george brent this is the film for you
<START> did you ever wonder how far one movie could go br br <UNK> relentlessly explores the world of the extreme with harry russo br br harry is an <UNK> writer killer and drug addict <UNK> who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and insanity driven by the demonic voices of his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> harry begins his killing spree br br from director ron <UNK> comes the 1st installment of the <UNK> story ever to be filmed br br the only other movie i have seen similar to this would happen to be the 2nd installment entitled <UNK> <UNK> br br this is a really low budget film and will not be for everyone but if you are looking for something disturbing different and horrific then this would make a fine choice br br do not expect anything like modern day horror such as scream br br viewer <UNK> is advised
<START> this film is so unbelievable the whole premise is <UNK> the fact that a serial killer vampire or otherwise could fly around <UNK> and kill as many people as the film implies is laughable the vampire himself would not look out of place in a bela lugosi film most of the acting is so wooden the actors should be treated for dry <UNK> i <UNK> the day when someone makes a decent film from a steven king novel with the exception possibly of stand by me this film suffers from what most stephen king films do lack of money used for the special effects poor actors appalling characterisation and dialogue this film is cheap tacky and fails in everything it tries to do
<START> <UNK> killers 1 outta 5 stars maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed cool if you had never ever seen a good ninja movie cheesy '80s music cheesy dialogue cheesy acting and way beyond cheesy martial arts sequences the coolest scene is at the beginning with an aged chuck <UNK> playing golf on a beach several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and <UNK> i won't spoil it for you if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you'll thank me the story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen <UNK> or something a bunch of dim <UNK> <UNK> heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because only a ninja can fight a ninja or something like that strange these guys don't seem to fight any better after their training than before oh well the movie does move along pretty <UNK> the fight scenes may not be great but they are <UNK> and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles
<START> in this movie joe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a basketball joe <UNK> br br and being consistent the rest of the script is equally not believable br br <UNK> is a funny guy which saves this film from sinking <UNK> the absolute back of the <UNK> but the other roles were pretty bad the father was a greedy businessman who <UNK> money more than people which wasn't even well played instead of the man being an <UNK> villain he seemed more like an amoral <UNK> <UNK> to make money at all costs then there's the token piece that is assigned to <UNK> as a girlfriend or something i don't even remember she was that forgettable br br anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this <UNK> film or at least one of those millions of media <UNK> who can't critique <UNK> you know the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6 br br stay away far away and shame on comedy central where i saw this film they usually pick better
<START> picture bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what it must have been like for japanese men brought to hawaii at the turn of the 19th century to work in the sugar <UNK> fields most came planning to return to their <UNK> but few were ever able to do so equally <UNK> portrayed is the fate of japanese women some as young as fifteen or sixteen who were sent as promised brides to men they knew only through photographs that often were 10 or 15 years out of date or were of some other younger man they too worked long hard hours in the fields while fighting <UNK> and to <UNK> their dignity br br director <UNK> portrayal of one picture <UNK> courage and <UNK> struggling to survive in a strange land and alien society under great physical <UNK> is ultimately inspirational and uplifting a story of moral and cultural survival there is a <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> of character and landscape in picture bride that captures the <UNK> beauty as well as violent <UNK> of colonial hawaii this is a film that is emotionally intellectually and artistically rewarding
<START> ok so it's not a masterpiece like the godfather but it doesn't have to be the only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times if it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times it has accomplished its purpose i laughed out loud and left with a smile i feel like i got my <UNK> worth
<START> not to be confused with the british black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994 but this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher br br the plot goes 4 <UNK> girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in florida but they're plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman and when he realizes that he was seen well let's just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff br br shallow grave in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80's especially the late 80's which was when the slashers kinda went downhill this was one of the few that didn't and this movie should be more well known it's a pity it isn't this is one film that actually <UNK> stereotypes just try guessing who the final girl is going to be i got it totally wrong the principle cast are all likable and it's one of those movies that you kinda hope they all get away which of course they don't this coupled with the <UNK> of the film's first half an hour <UNK> in a good way with some flashes of real <UNK> the second murder provides a real <UNK> and some unexpected <UNK> even though this isn't a high budget thriller i didn't expect the topless scene where a woman is <UNK> with her own <UNK> accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast in a film from this late in the 80's br br there are one or two bad things about this movie well not bad just minor like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which doesn't go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the deputy inability to follow logic there aren't any sharp <UNK> in shallow grave but to my mind at least it's a slasher flick through and through the scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the <UNK> sheriff are tense and exciting br br all in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile slasher with great performances from all four of the main girls and that psycho sheriff
<START> this is pretty much the first jason scott lee film i've seen i say pretty much because i have also seen soldier in which he plays the villain but from what i've heard it's not considered a jason scott lee film this however is and if this is any indication of the quality of such films i won't be seeing any of the others lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist as the lead he's awful he gets in a fight with random no name characters every few minutes of the film probably because the script writer couldn't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film the villain is the only character with even a hint of personality and aside from the fact that he's <UNK> insane he barely seems like a villain at all the majority of the film is basically lee chasing the villain through time or maybe it's the other way around i can't say for sure and i definitely wouldn't watch it again to make sure the effects are not completely horrible but it's close the title comes from the popular idea of using a time machine to go and kill hitler somehow the film <UNK> up that interesting idea as well the plot is too complicated for its own good the pacing is poor i can't think of one positive thing to say about this film i really can't it's simply too formulaic and pointless if only i had a time machine so i could go back and prevent this film from ever being made no never mind i just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible listen to the negative reviewers avoid this turkey i recommend this to fans of lee and no one else if you're looking for a quality film well this isn't it that's for sure 1 10
<START> i don't watch much porn but i love porn stars and i love gory movies so when i heard about a porn star gore movie i was really excited of course that was years ago and when i heard about all the trouble with making and finishing the movie i never thought i'd actually get to see it but i did and i'm not ashamed to admit i loved it even with all its flaws br br first the flaws the story is set in ireland and is called <UNK> but the story it seemed to want to tell is about the <UNK> <UNK> clan from scotland so why not just set it there and skip the third grade report about <UNK> irish immigrants halloween also it breaks its own rules by stating that you're safe on the <UNK> but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere it's never clear how many cannibals we're dealing with there's a big stone castle that's obviously ancient yet no one's noticed it before the self conscious horror film references are annoying and so are the characters the heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she never met the ending makes no sense br br so what works the gore sure i would have liked more but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that wasn't afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie two murders are <UNK> over the top and taylor hayes has a nice disgusting scene the two wild murders are even given extended shots on the dvd i've always been of the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and evil breed <UNK> that
<START> i rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed and of course sir anthony hopkins br br if jackson <UNK> teamed up with david lynch and timothy <UNK> to make a movie this would be the end result i don't think i've seen a movie like it that made an <UNK> trip look like an episode of <UNK> street br br it's a bunch of set pieces where the characters flash in and out of reality or various realities and the film doesn't <UNK> into anything until the last 5 minutes where all of a sudden it makes sense i wrote a <UNK> review on my movie review <UNK> that essentially gives everything away and i won't do that here it's a well acted piece of cinema and the soundtrack was written by sir anthony hopkins and let me say this if there's one redeeming feature to this film it's the music it fits perfectly some of the dialogue is unbelievably good and unbelievably bad all at the same time br br i enjoyed parts of this movie i truly did and once you get to the end of it you'll actually figure out what's truly going on it's unfortunate that you have to <UNK> through 2 hours of crazy to get to a <UNK> point which <UNK> the effect of the entire movie br br i give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film isn't the acting it's everything
<START> as much as i dislike saying <UNK> <UNK> in response to other comments it's completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless <UNK> that <UNK> the following 90 br br having been banned somewhere doesn't make a film watchable just because it doesn't resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible br br worse yet in addition to no discernible plot other than there are lots of <UNK> places in russia and many people even very old women drink lots of <UNK> a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i'm in to my second package of <UNK> br br as for spoilers well the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn't write one if i tried br br don't waste your time or money and don't confuse this with good russian cinema
<START> advertised by channel seven in australia as the <UNK> story this miniseries <UNK> itself in the first five minutes by <UNK> over the titular character's childhood and <UNK> in less time than a good director will use to set up a single event this <UNK> and self censorship for the fear of <UNK> anyone <UNK> the series and is ultimately responsible for its failure br br robert <UNK> puts in a <UNK> performance as the most hated man of the <UNK> century but he is <UNK> by two things the lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his northern uk <UNK> shining <UNK> through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal apparently <UNK> the fact that hitler was raised in a catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of <UNK> and their <UNK> by having <UNK> <UNK> the most ridiculous lines about <UNK> is quite okay well here's a clue for the writers any person familiar with <UNK> mythology will tell you that <UNK> is about the <UNK> of honour and might in battle two things that the nazis quickly <UNK> in favour of rat cunning and <UNK> until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason hitler has never been <UNK> from the catholic church is because it would require the <UNK> <UNK> that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period of the world's history has to teach us br br so now that we've managed to insult <UNK> and the citizens of <UNK> countries in this <UNK> you'd think the series would stop there but it doesn't <UNK> <UNK> listing in the opening credits was particularly <UNK> raising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it <UNK> transparent that more footage of hitler's early days were shot but not included because of a typical <UNK> state fear of <UNK> someone it is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into <UNK> character do not feature him at all br br until we learn to stop sugar <UNK> the truth and realise that the <UNK> of germany was mostly <UNK> to hitler's views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal with the fact that <UNK> of democracy yes germany was a democracy pre hitler can occur anywhere we are doomed that's the one thing this mini series got right in portraying unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make hitler's religious beliefs appear those of a much more <UNK> people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter david <UNK> show had it <UNK> when they ran short satirical segments about the series they really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star that's how badly it was written br br all in all this politically correct farce of a bio <UNK> is worth no points but i gave it two because robert <UNK> definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works
<START> this is probably the best horror film made since ed wood died br br i can't spoil the ending because i have absolutely no idea what happened i'll try my best though there are some kind of lesbian vampires but they keep <UNK> bodies so any character might or might not be the character you're supposed to think it is or it might be a lesbian vampire br br sound confusing it's not as confusing as you might think since none of the characters make any sense to begin with there's no plot no character development and random people show up speak a few lines and then disappear never to be heard from again there are also zombies who are possibly the enemies of the vampires but there's also a dream within a dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital so maybe none of this actually happened and it's all the main character's <UNK> br br the upside both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly the special effects are simply mind <UNK> i particularly liked the incredibly slow awkward fight sequences everyone has a really silly canadian accent which adds to the general level of hilarity br br well worth the price of rental we laughed until we cried
<START> this movie was terrible i thought with all the some what decent actors it would be better don't waste your time eva longoria parker was awful she should stick to desperate <UNK> paul rudd is becoming a b actor the mess he made in the movie i could never be your woman was the epitome of what i'm saying and lake bell she was cute but definitely in need of some more acting lessons watch just like heaven with reese <UNK> it was a tad better or any other ghost movie you will be grateful to not have wasted your precious time ps i love you is also a good from beyond the grave romance time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listen to the people who have already seen it
<START> this film has all the <UNK> of too many <UNK> spoiling the <UNK> based on <UNK> <UNK> autobiography it seems like the powers that be couldn't leave well enough alone they couldn't decide if this was to be <UNK> story or <UNK> story and also how much they should soft <UNK> <UNK> story it turned out to be so a film that could have been a story about two fascinating fitzgerald and notorious ms graham personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959 clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing however and this saved the film for me kerr has never looked <UNK> and peck is as always a very handsome man they truly make a beautiful mature couple and i only wish they had better material to work with there is one scene that does work scott goes after <UNK> while in a drunken state and to see these two normally <UNK> stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs other than that the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other <UNK> produced <UNK> of the 1950 <UNK> place the best of everything
<START> the original exploitation classic though far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people is remade with scifi elements added the cats can't get enough and when the flesh <UNK> food runs out the cats turn on their owners poorly put together on almost every level this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually play movie theaters in the early 1970's updated with alien cat and dog races battling for supremacy director ted <UNK> is a hack but is so lovable a person i generally like the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and commentary tracks that you can pretty much excuse the garbage he mostly turned out <UNK> wanted to make films and he didn't care how they turned out so long as he was producing something more power to him but i wish he wouldn't subject us to his home movies
<START> atlantis is a new and right step for a disney feature it's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like atlantis i didn't have any expectations for this film but after watching it i don't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews even in my country the reviewers weren't positive br br atlantis is not a perfect movie but still one of disney's greatest even i doubt that this film ever will get disney classic reputation well that's another case it's funny to think that this sci fi movie was directed by the same directors as beauty and the beast and <UNK> so kirk wise and gary <UNK> are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation he he i'm just kidding br br well enough nonsense atlantis is a watchable <UNK> and very enjoyable film even this film it's a pg rated action feature it's also suitable for kids in my opinion parents who mean the opposite don't kill me for writing this he he br br the story is a little predictable but it doesn't ruin the movie the comic book inspired animation it's suitable for the film and <UNK> a departure from the usual disney style it's colorful dark and detailed the deep <UNK> sequences are pretty impressive the film is also funny sometimes even i more <UNK> than laugh through the movie spoilers the characters of this film are also very likable but unfortunately there isn't enough screen time to get to know everybody so some characters are left behind spoilers br br the score of james <UNK> howard is absolutely great it's daring and exotic spoiler the most impressive about this film is how they're making the <UNK> language sound very natural ethnic and authentic it's really awesome spoilers over br br the script is tight and well written but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story but luckily there are not so much of them br br so do you're self a favor don't listen to the reviewers and watch atlantis cause it's waiting for you
<START> i came at this film with high expectations i was aware of <UNK> work and 'the <UNK> and was interested in an adaptation i first wanted to switch off after ten minutes but felt that it would be unfair there was a representation of a storm but where in your mind do you <UNK> a small boy <UNK> over a toy boat it is symbolic of what i continued another ten minutes my finger <UNK> over the <UNK> button somewhere something would capture my interest this is not shakespeare it is not cinema there is a time and place for it but i will not waste my time and there is no place for it in my studies of shakespeare after twenty five minutes i gave up and that was the end i then read all the comments on this website and the <UNK> of the film is only matched by its <UNK> <UNK> a painting then put it in a <UNK> <UNK> a ballet keep it on the stage <UNK> shakespeare can be done intelligently and the plays were performed to mass audiences they were accessible and this version helps put a <UNK> between shakespeare and the general population at large and i do not think that the <UNK> would be happy with that
<START> the story is about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is professional marriage witness in short he acts as a witness for couples in marriage <UNK> office and <UNK> <UNK> ali khan who ran away from her home at <UNK> to get married to her love interest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the story starts with <UNK> waiting at the marriage <UNK> office for <UNK> to show up but for some reason he does not show up so <UNK> comes in the picture here who had approached <UNK> with the intention of <UNK> <UNK> 200 for his witness job and he ends up helping her by providing shelter to her <UNK> grows on his side by working in a bank as an agent <UNK> <UNK> falls in love with <UNK> and she too falls in love with him or kind of love both agree for the marriage and <UNK> comes back in the picture unexpected circumstances happen actually i should say expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then <UNK> br br actually the movie story is bit different than the movies we see and i do not think so it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie freak like me and love to watch something different then you will definitely like the movie the movie is just an innocent love story <UNK> very well by the characters of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ali khan the characters are so natural that you feel as if things are happening to the guy next door the background music of the film also plays a very good role it is just too good the way <UNK> is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling br br so let's cut it out and sum it up br br story a very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience br br music well as it was <UNK> <UNK> creation so i did not expect much but still i liked couple of songs of the movie including the <UNK> br br acting <UNK> <UNK> was the most impressive very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs <UNK> ali khan she is a doll a very cute doll i must say again very innocent and natural acting and these both actors perfectly fit into their characters apart from these two <UNK> <UNK> needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones other actors did their job well br br stars i would also give it 3 5 stars out of 5 you will enjoy the movie if watched in the theatre i would recommend watching it in theatre if you are a movie freak and accept <UNK> stories otherwise wait for the dvd to arrive the movie will definitely won't be liked by the masses and the business it can do is from word of mouth publicity
<START> well i have to say that i have waited for it to come br br i won't try to spoil it and quite a few people have really brilliantly spoken of the pilot on the other hand i'm not quite sure to understand the <UNK> who claim themselves to be bsg fans and not like the pilot br br what the <UNK> did they expect the background is setting 50 years before bsg we are there o assist at the birth of the <UNK> see the life of the <UNK> family has we already knew some of it from bsg get a deeper explanation of the <UNK> population and its perception of the other <UNK> and potentially the origins of the gods belief of the human and the unique god belief of the <UNK> br br i do not expect the same <UNK> of special effect or space opera as the in the previous series i make the difference between the two although i know that caprica will <UNK> bsg br br this is <UNK> of promising start i believe as well that this will put pressure for the scenarios to be as good as bsg i expect a lot from the following but i have no reasons to doubts that we will learn a lot more br br watching the dvd's deleted scene also gives more material for your brain to chew on br br looking forward to january <UNK>
<START> i stumbled across this act i by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago this <UNK> even what the cover label on the tape mentioned it amazed me it <UNK> me it shocked me i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later i happened to think about it again then went and bought both acts they were even better than i had experienced at first br br my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime <UNK> tanks and heavy <UNK> it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it certainly has not been shown as such br br i don't think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the <UNK> version of this but regarding the story there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be <UNK>
<START> there's something about every hammer movie i see that really takes me into a new fantasy world in the world of hammer movies anything can happen guardian of the <UNK> is one of those types of movies it adventures deep into the occult and <UNK> to bring a different type of horror fantasy all in all an unforgettable movie 7 5 10
<START> wow why would anybody make a sequel to an already <UNK> film half past dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be <UNK> has no clue of what it wants to be it just exists on screen for reasons i cant explain spoiler the whole movie is this <UNK> played by <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> pound gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold <UNK> buried in the jail a riot breaks out between rival inmates one of them gets shot by a guy named cortez and cortez plans his escape during a <UNK> visit <UNK> fiancée and <UNK> played by bill goldberg daughter get kidnapped by cortez and are held in an execution room burke reluctantly befriends <UNK> and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that cortez has their loved ones br br opinion this is the most unnecessary sequel since universal soldier the return the script is terrible the acting is horrendous the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature look i know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do nobody in this movie believes in the characters they play nobody in this movie can be taken seriously as an actor <UNK> should be ashamed of himself his character <UNK> is pretty much a <UNK> <UNK> puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting <UNK> up by burke or the other inmates bill goldberg spends most of his time <UNK> throughout the movie as if he had to take a <UNK> pretty huge dump the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie <UNK> is pretty boring even when action is happening don't let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent it stinks and is a prime reason why people despise <UNK>
<START> election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by <UNK> to br br to <UNK> casted simon <UNK> and tony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> and big d as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of <UNK> for ho sing society a 100 year old trial society br br while <UNK> is a man who keeps his cool at all times big d is not only <UNK> but also thinks that he is on top of everything <UNK> was chosen as the next <UNK> for 2 years to have the total control of the gang the newly elected <UNK> must be passed down with a dragon <UNK> which represents power and authority big d was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next <UNK> after paying a handsome figure of <UNK> to the <UNK> members he ordered his man to get the <UNK> before it falls onto the hands of <UNK> br br while big d is getting the <UNK> <UNK> has other plans for him br br this is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed <UNK> to puts the greed of the human beings in the movie where bloodshed is <UNK> used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one however no single bullet is used hardly any <UNK> are involved in election it's the battle of the wits that makes election stands out of the rest br br apart from maggie <UNK> the only actress in election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie <UNK> rules the whole movie louis <UNK> and nick cheung who was seen in <UNK> previous film are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script it makes the only hk movie to represent cannes <UNK> festival 2005 br br election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie
<START> the movie that shoots scenes of a <UNK> <UNK> tour br br remember no one from this movie except for michael <UNK> who <UNK> out extreme pain as <UNK> in five the hard way he's the really annoying sheriff who i did applaud when he practices <UNK> on our <UNK> doctor probably the most laughs you will have is with dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out of nowhere could mrs <UNK> be anymore wooden seriously if you took a 4 foot branch stuck it in a hot <UNK> you wouldn't be able to notice a difference the dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll br br watch it as a late night movie <UNK> but don't go out of your way
<START> what is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance to the original film no point this is why the prom night sequels are so embarrassingly bad br br the original film <UNK> a group of children hiding a dark secret that eventually get them all killed bar one in a brutal act of revenge can someone please explain to me what a dead prom queen to be rising from the grave to steel the crown has to do with the first movie then prom night 2 had continuous plot holes that left the audience constantly wondering how did that happen and why should that happen but in the end i guess you could call it one of those movies that is so bad you end up laughing yourself through it
<START> somebody <UNK> the difficult task of <UNK> sports with romance in reality sports and romance go together like oil and water so to successfully put the two together on screen well that is about the equivalent of splitting the <UNK> i never thought it could be done i will be the first to say that in general i don't like romantic comedies but i do like sports and most movies about sports this movie was a pretty good mix of the two being a baseball fan i could really appreciate the comedic ordeal with ben <UNK> jimmy <UNK> being a <UNK> boston <UNK> fan anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the babe that plagued the <UNK> for <UNK> years and they know just how nuts about baseball a lot of <UNK> fans are the <UNK> brothers did a great job capturing that and it made for good comedy this was a very good movie that could appeal to many
<START> loaded with fine actors i expected much more from <UNK> than was delivered the plot is extremely contrived and manipulative the many flashbacks only add to the confusion believability flies out the window and with the ending becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous i would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie plots to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid <UNK> because you will be very frustrated maybe i am just not hip enough to get it but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the ending <UNK> the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the entire movie made no sense <UNK>
<START> eric <UNK> delivers an extraordinary performance as joel garcia a successful young novelist who winds up <UNK> and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a <UNK> accident while learning to cope and <UNK> with the gravity of his new limited physical condition joel befriends slick fast talking charming <UNK> raymond an amazing wesley snipes and <UNK> <UNK> racist biker <UNK> a terrific william forsythe who feels threatened by the diverse multi ethnic array of fellow patients he's forced to share a room with joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving but married girlfriend anna <UNK> played by helen hunt but he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own br br this remarkable movie's key triumph is its <UNK> stubborn <UNK> to neither <UNK> nor <UNK> the <UNK> of what these men are going through directors neil <UNK> who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script and micheal <UNK> relate the story with exceptional taste wit and warmth specifically addressing with <UNK> <UNK> and matter of <UNK> how being handicapped <UNK> <UNK> one's lifestyle including and especially your sex life this point is most <UNK> made in a striking sequence when joel and anna try and fail to make love in a motel room besides the expected <UNK> the film further provides a surprising <UNK> of <UNK> funny raw <UNK> humor that's <UNK> by the <UNK> sequence with joel and <UNK> making a secret <UNK> expedition to a strip club the uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus <UNK> snipes forsythe and hunt are all outstanding with stand out supporting turns by grace zabriskie as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mother and <UNK> <UNK> and william allen young as compassionate hospital <UNK> despite the grim subject matter the film ultimately proves to be a very moving positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and <UNK> of the human spirit a simply wonderful little gem of a drama
<START> i picked this film up based on the plot summary and <UNK> quotes on the back of the box i'm not big into foreign films and didn't know what to expect i don't really care for subtitles either but i absolutely loved it it has a simple lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life i found myself laughing out loud repeatedly i'd recommend this picture to anyone even those who <UNK> foreign films with subtitles this one makes it worth the effort
<START> prince stars as 'the <UNK> in this semi <UNK> film of a talented but <UNK> young musician who has a less then stellar home life true the acting leaves a tad to be desired <UNK> morris day and especially clarence williams who are both pitch perfect but the movie is still great and among the best to come out of the 1980s it has the best soundtrack of any movie of the last 50 years at least highly <UNK> lines and the <UNK> scene is hilarious plus <UNK> is just simply stunning on an unrelated not when i saw prince in concert in 2004 he blew down the stadium he is an expert <UNK> and it was one of the best <UNK> that i've experienced br br my grade a br br dvd extras disc 1 commentary with director albert <UNK> producer robert <UNK> director of photography donald <UNK> theatrical trailer trailers for under the <UNK> moon and <UNK> bridge disc 2 a 12 minute <UNK> on the first <UNK> club purple rain <UNK> pass a half hour <UNK> on the movie which i'll review later on it's page <UNK> <UNK> and revolution the impact and influence of purple rain 10 minute <UNK> 30 minutes of <UNK> premiere footage when mtv didn't suck <UNK> balls 5 prince music videos let's go crazy take me with you when <UNK> cry i would die 4 u baby i'm a star and purple rain 2 videos by the time jungle love and the bird and a music video for sex <UNK> by <UNK> 6 br br eye candy <UNK> shows her fine ass <UNK>
<START> not many movies were made about the lighter than air <UNK> aspect of <UNK> but this is one of them and it's damn good just a fun film to watch br br most of the movie takes place at the navy <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> playing the role wallace <UNK> plays a likable but <UNK> like senior chief ned <UNK> an <UNK> pilot whose tall tales have gotten so frequent nobody really believes him half the fun is near the end of the movie when events start proving that most of his more outlandish tales are actually true br br set during wwii the main plot centers around bachelor <UNK> <UNK> a local widow only to end up having a father son relationship with the <UNK> crippled son jess told he would never walk without <UNK> by doctors chief <UNK> pulls some strings and a navy flight surgeon helps in <UNK> the <UNK> crippled leg jess goes on to join the navy to become a flight officer flying <UNK> back at <UNK> and facing a whole new set of challenges br br a very well done movie albeit not without some corny hollywood dialogue <UNK> past the technical <UNK> and <UNK> apparent inability to march in step otherwise this movie gets good <UNK> for technical accuracy and gives a rare look into the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the cash register scene an exchange between <UNK> and <UNK> future love interest cathy is an absolute hoot
<START> lars von <UNK> europa is an extremely good film <UNK> that von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with europa to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list i also think it is perhaps the scariest the most gothic and complete film around all right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever
<START> the scene where sally field and whoopi goldberg go to the mall to revive <UNK> <UNK> spirits is enough reason alone to enjoy this movie but wait there's more this is a <UNK> good <UNK> of daytime tv movie stars on the way down and up and the horrors of love robert downey jr shows the lighter side of his genius and cathy <UNK> is splendid the dialogue is witty and the physical humor done with <UNK> skill this is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting directing and writing
<START> a lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in leon then other parts felt like some other movie i don't know which but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie it was kind of nice to watch but it would have been fantastic if the story would have been more original the theme little girl bad assassin from leon is just <UNK> a little the opening scenes are really good it is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen in the movies my biggest problem was to remember which parts was from leon <UNK> and if they where from the french or american version if you have not seen leon then this is a good movie if you liked this movie then i can recommend leon br br best regards rick
<START> nothing in this movie is funny i thought the premise giving a human the <UNK> of a randy ram was interesting and should provide for some laughs wrong there is simply nothing funny about the movie for example the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a <UNK> yard is not funny it borders on <UNK> they are <UNK> around with <UNK> in this film on one level and it just <UNK> funny br br we all know that dogs will eat anything anywhere anytime the main character doing this with everything everywhere <UNK> is also not funny it becomes a cliche br br rob schneider is i guess acceptable in the role by this i mean that he's not a bad actor but with rotten material it's difficult to comment on quality however <UNK> <UNK> the other half of the human romantic leads does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too seems embarrassed by the whole thing as well she should be she seems to be acting in some kind of <UNK> detached from all the other actors in the movie br br see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless dull repetitive material
<START> the good thing about this that's at least fresh almost no movies about dance music and the club scene if even made hit the cinemas and it <UNK> lots of energy too from the music to the portrayal of <UNK> br br but the main problem is that it can't decide what it wants to be although it definitely likes to be a <UNK> in the line of this is spinal tap the makers also realized they wouldn't want to play <UNK> however it fails grossly on the jokes because it's not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped and it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes so why not edit it down to 75 the production department and cinematography still try to save the day e g paul's home br br in a strange way and unexpectedly so it's all gone pete <UNK> works much better as a simple drama in the line of almost famous especially the scenes with <UNK> <UNK> offer some acting power br br conclusion it's a mess it somewhat entertains at a basic level but you better spend a night in your favorite club
<START> i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films so when i saw <UNK> for 5 50 at <UNK> i purchased it although mildly amusing the film never really hits it a <UNK> some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose br br then of course there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as i'm concerned i don't think this scene added to the movie at all i don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson written by some <UNK> burn out especially br br in the end although i'm glad to possess another hawn movie i'm not sure it was really worth the money i paid for it
<START> on the surface show me the money should have at least finished a full season you had the always entertaining william shatner as your host surrounded by a <UNK> dozen of beautiful <UNK> models <UNK> called the million dollar dancers you had <UNK> contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia and you had big money so what went wrong br br the format of this game was the failure a good game show needs at least two of three things very simple rules exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to play along at home the best most enduring ones have all three br br unfortunately <UNK> had none br br the rules for this game were among the most complex of any prime time game show in history let me try to explain how the game worked as briefly as possible br br a contestant began with a single word or short phrase followed by the choice letters a b c subtle plug for the network each letter was connected to a separate question all starting with that word or phrase once a contestant chose one of the letters they could either answer that question or pass and <UNK> a second letter if they passed they got to view the next question and had the same option however if they passed the second question they were required to answer the third option br br after they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct they then had to <UNK> one of the 13 dancers on stage each with a different amount of money in a <UNK> by their side they revealed their dollar amount ranging from 20 000 to 250 000 and depending on if the contestant answered right or answered wrong that amount would be added to or <UNK> from their pot br br still with me so far in addition there was one dancer who held something known as the killer card if you selected the dancer with the killer card and you had gotten your question right you were safe and the game continued if however you were incorrect you had one final question to answer if you got that final question wrong you were out of the game if you got it right then the game continued br br there was no <UNK> no walking away with the money earned until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you couldn't earn enough money to get back out got it okay br br the biggest problem as i saw it was a complete lack of tension because of the design of the game a contestant could pass questions they knew they didn't know and answer many questions they did know making the pressure even less then they could still find a low dollar amount even after <UNK> missing a question which meant there still wasn't any drama and the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still have a chance to win was a big mistake and the pacing of the questions was deadly slow often the questions were so obvious it was ridiculous to try to create tension as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers br br the pacing the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working despite <UNK> <UNK> talents
<START> i own this movie i bought it for 3 99 at a fairly major video <UNK> in order to do some indie type movie research since i had just finished my own feature and was editing it now when i feel down about my skills as a first time director i just sit down with a plate of <UNK> and severed within minutes i feel great br br i hate to down talk another filmmaker so i'll just use <UNK> criticism 1 find good actors take the time it really helps 2 when shooting video over light your scenes and <UNK> in the computer later on in post 3 closeups are better for video 4 when an actor enters a scene wait a bit before br br having them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking 5 never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it damn well worth the 3 99 br br the true horror would be getting the reviews severed has here on imdb and you have to give these guys credit they did get distributed
<START> an adult realistic cruel dark story like a second part of les <UNK> <UNK> the wild <UNK> plenty of beauty and sadness <UNK> and <UNK> shadows and little sparks of hope a man searching for a warm companion a better life a sincere attitude
<START> this is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had <UNK> years ago it <UNK> a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be <UNK> br br clothes and music might have changed over time but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up to <UNK> and especially this movie does the job pretty well of course it is cheesy at times but very touching as well br br jodie <UNK> performance is striking and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies br br don't miss this one
<START> this is part one of a short animation clip showing the history of the matrix the war between man and machine that resulted in the eventual creation of the matrix the animation is part japanese anime part contemporary american animation and is very well made considering the excellent directors behind the movie it shows the initial development of <UNK> and the exploitation of the machines by man until the day they <UNK>
<START> after <UNK> introduction to sound in clarence <UNK> anna christie jacques <UNK> made a german version of the movie where all of the cast except for garbo were different while the american version is still more available in the usa and most of the american viewers have primarily seen this version the <UNK> anna christie is more likely to be viewed in europe as i have seen both films i feel the right to compare the two closely <UNK> productions is jacques <UNK> film different is it better than clarence <UNK> br br in this analysis i would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common they have identical sets very similar scripts and the same <UNK> presented scenes here you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life here you also have the humorous though a bit shorter sequence in the amusement park however when <UNK> garbo herself i address the first difference she does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking the viewer concentrates more on her acting than on the way she speaks which occurred most probably to 1931 viewers garbo was very good in american film and she is also very good here yet to me she seems even more genuine in the german version it is noticeable that garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much the effort that was <UNK> created by the sensation garbo talks her german is not very well <UNK> yet no one cares everything is perfectly understood therefore i can easily say the same i did in my american version comment <UNK> greta garbo br br yet the film <UNK> in one very important issue the rest of the cast here comes the question which portrayal seems more captivating which one is better for sure the differences are filled with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> friend does not do the equally great job as marie <UNK> in the role of <UNK> <UNK> she is not bad she is different sometimes overacts from today's perspective but is no longer that genuine in the role as marie <UNK> who still <UNK> us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time some people even claim that <UNK> was better than garbo in the film and that opinion though appears to be questionable of course carries some truth theo shall is more sympathetic as matt than charles <UNK> but when applied to him this is not the matter of performance so much as the <UNK> of looks br br who shines in the german anna christie who is really worth greatest attention is hans <UNK> in the role of chris <UNK> <UNK> father george f marion vs hans <UNK> is like a day vs night difference <UNK> portrays a real alcohol addict a man with hopes with fears who <UNK> the care of his daughter the scene of <UNK> first meeting with her father is truly magnificent the opening moment of <UNK> conversation with <UNK> is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance <UNK> is the chris whom you like who you sometimes laugh at whom you sympathize with who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic sailor in your mind great br br if you have seen the american anna christie and have a chance to get the german version i would highly recommend to you this movie because it's a slightly different look at the story a nice and accurate way to compare a fine <UNK> to clarence <UNK> movie and foremost a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance hans <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> hans <UNK>
<START> imagine that in adapting a james bond novel into a movie the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid friendly or if a television producer told chris rock he couldn't <UNK> so that his <UNK> could be rated pg in the same way the director of the movie something wicked this way comes took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences this created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book in trying to make the story of something wicked this way comes easier for children to follow the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone and good always <UNK> over evil this is apparent in <UNK> character transformation charles <UNK> rescue of jim and the <UNK> defeat br br <UNK> transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie the scene in which the dust witch visits <UNK> house in a balloon has been cut from the film instead a green <UNK> follows jim and will home and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her <UNK> the balloon attack shows us that will has begun to <UNK> his fear of doing things on his own he gets on top of a <UNK> roof and tears the balloon with a bow <UNK> the witch sorry dad he thought and sat up smiling this time it's me out alone will decides as he <UNK> to face her <UNK> <UNK> this scene from the movie <UNK> us from understanding that will is becoming more <UNK> the film shows us many examples of will being afraid to follow jim but never growing curious like his friend in the book will has both a good quiet side and an evil daring side like his jim in the movie each boy only has one mode of thought which destroys <UNK> theme of both good and evil being present in each person br br in the book will saves jim because of their friendship but in the movie charles <UNK> saves jim to <UNK> <UNK> father will pulls jim off the <UNK> in <UNK> novel because he doesn't want his best friend to grow up without him it is the good in will the fact that he cares about his friend that saves jim from the evil curse of the carnival on the <UNK> jim <UNK> his other hand free to trail on the wind the one part of him the small white separate part that still remembered their friendship <UNK> this shows that there was good left inside of jim which has the potential to still defeat evil but when charles <UNK> saves jim in the movie he does it to <UNK> the debt he owes <UNK> father who saved will when he was a little boy by changing the motivation for saving jim the filmmakers have ruined <UNK> original idea that it takes good to win against evil br br in the end of the movie the carnival is defeated by a <UNK> and lightning instead of smiles and laughter when the book ends mr dark turns himself into a little boy and charles <UNK> smiles and laughs at him so much that he can't stand it and <UNK> in <UNK> world evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love his message is that good will always <UNK> over evil but only if that goodness is expressed <UNK> good to evil seems evil says charles <UNK> as he holds the dying mr dark so i will do only good to you jed i'll simply hold you and watch you poison yourself <UNK> in the movie mr dark is the only one left on the <UNK> when lightning hits it and he dies by <UNK> the weapon of laughter and smiles the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil as if lightning only strikes those who are bad this takes away the major theme of <UNK> book which is that doing good toward others <UNK> off evil br br good may always triumph over evil but trying to make movies more kid friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on in the movie something wicked this way comes will does not <UNK> <UNK> friendship does not save jim and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival as a result the filmmakers have left out too many of <UNK> main points the process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established in the case of this story <UNK> frightening world of <UNK> forces of good and evil has been reduced to a <UNK> simpler version of itself
<START> so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film and you might be thinking to yourself huh there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december 30 funny thing is most of these rave reviews sound like they're coming from the same person or at best a small <UNK> group of open house <UNK> the truth my friends is that this film is truly unwatchable just because it's independent doesn't mean it gets a free pass if you're going to make a musical whether on film or on stage whether on broadway or at the local community <UNK> you should probably make sure that a your actors can sing b your actors can dance c you have decent sound equipment d you have a well written score and e you have lyrics that are witty and charming even anthony <UNK> can't save this one it's one of those unfortunate movie going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved
<START> a number of factors make it easy for me to state that i still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made despite some of the acting outdated dialogue etc br br first there is the scale of imagination in describing the <UNK> a <UNK> race native to the planet now all dead who were 1 million years more advanced than earth humans us and their technology particularly the 8 000 <UNK> mile machine br br second there is the music and sound effects which are <UNK> from each other it creates an eerie <UNK> feeling unlike 2001 which had traditional classical music br br third its monster is not only the most powerful and deadly ever <UNK> it's also based on real science and doesn't break the laws of physics and <UNK> br br finally and most importantly forbidden planet is the only movie ever made that attempts and more incredibly succeeds in making an honest intelligent and mercilessly logical statement on the limits or ceiling of human or any other <UNK> <UNK> development no matter how long we survive as a species br br in other words it <UNK> our inevitable destiny
<START> when a movie shocks you with it's disturbing brooding atmosphere and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat masterpiece of a film although with most modern movies extremely enjoyable as some are those that really shock you into focus are the strongest and are the ones that are most <UNK> acclaimed and mostly stick with you for a life time i say proudly that i am a fan of movies that <UNK> not just horror movies but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding movies like breakdown and the missing that send a chill down your spine making you think holy crap that could happen to me and visually <UNK> you are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie because i am only 21 i did not grow up with actors like burt <UNK> jon voight and ned beatty albeit i am familiar with them i didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors as opposed to actors now like <UNK> <UNK> and justin long i must say after the long hype and witnessing deliverance for the first time i was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies burt <UNK> plays lewis the macho self <UNK> leader of a group of four friends on a <UNK> trip down a <UNK> river before a <UNK> is made filling the whole wilderness in water <UNK> character is an experienced <UNK> sort of no nonsense and filled with <UNK> witnessing him portray the tough guy made me think differently about him as an actor as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician the dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough <UNK> to be proved as a strong and even <UNK> leader <UNK> cox and ned beatty play as the <UNK> <UNK> drew and bob respectively joining in for the fun of a <UNK> trip the actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was jon voight once again i have only seen him as an older actor however unlike <UNK> i have quite liked <UNK> acting and i don't regard <UNK> when i say that for example the national treasure movies voight plays ed whom like lewis is experienced in <UNK> but is seen as a more reserved character a reluctant hero leader and definitely lacks <UNK> <UNK> the film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they <UNK> the <UNK> and camp along the <UNK> you immediately get a creepy vibe from the <UNK> characters we are introduced to like the <UNK> kid who plays the infamous <UNK> <UNK> at the start of the film with <UNK> <UNK> character drew and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene as with all atmospheric movies from this moment on dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form the <UNK> trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and <UNK> odds for survival the film's <UNK> do not let up and i back that comment up with the scene in which ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a <UNK> bow as ed falls on to one of his <UNK> and notices his enemy approaching him <UNK> his rifle only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting i have seen in a film in <UNK> up deliverance is one film who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date remains one of the best films in cinematic history
<START> have to admit this version <UNK> shakespeare <UNK> none can act except the nurse who was my <UNK> juliet had good skills as a teen but she can't give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her she's worse doing the scene when she is <UNK> drinking the sleeping <UNK> god stop whining i would have <UNK> it in her mouth to shut her up anthony andrews <UNK> considering his other great movies <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scarlet <UNK> he's quite a shocker in this one and don't get me started on romeo <UNK> it's still good to see if you're on the hunt to see every romeo and juliet ever made in the history of film olivia and <UNK> version is still the best followed by leslie <UNK> version and then the current leo and <UNK>
<START> mad <UNK> <UNK> is back along with his sad sack <UNK> marie and that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so are babe and red doc and big mac and even the scenery chewing <UNK> <UNK> the only thing missing is a good reason for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> high <UNK> 14 years later without <UNK> a line or a frame and doing so with talent <UNK> a <UNK> or two down the ladder from that in the original instead of walsh we get stuart <UNK> for <UNK> bogart we get jack palance for <UNK> <UNK> shelley winters and so on down through the credits the only change is that this time instead of black and white it's in <UNK> sadly there are those who would count this an improvement br br i died a thousand times may be unnecessary  and inferior  but at least it's not a travesty the story still works on its own <UNK> terms <UNK> palance fresh out of the pen near chicago drives west to <UNK> a big job <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr  knocking over a post mountain resort en route he almost <UNK> with a family of <UNK> when he's smitten with their <UNK> the <UNK> holds even when he discovers she's lame arriving at the <UNK> where the rest of gang holes up he finds amateurish <UNK> at one <UNK> throats as well as winters who throws herself at him as does the <UNK> <UNK> time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel palance to <UNK> <UNK> offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl's <UNK> a gesture that <UNK> then the <UNK> strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath on the <UNK> palance moves higher into the cold <UNK> br br it's an absorbing enough story competently executed that lacks the <UNK> walsh and his cast brought to it in 1941 the year <UNK> with this role and that of sam spade in the <UNK> <UNK> became a star and one last <UNK> note those mountains do look gorgeous in color br br
<START> <UNK> you <UNK> how could you do this to me i can't believe it this movie is actually worse than the first one i went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along oh god where do i even begin the plot sucked the voice acting sucked the animation sucked the ending really sucked if you liked this movie you suck too and to <UNK> who said this was the greatest movie ever you are a tool plain and simple this isn't a movie for anyone but crack <UNK> ten year olds with game boys who think <UNK> is god i'm still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie and then there was <UNK> adventure don't even get me started on that horrible mess of a film it is in all truth one of the most boring experiences of my entire life don't go watch this at any costs br br bottom line go out find every copy of this movie that you can and burn it burn them all and then proceed to rent a good movie like aliens or <UNK> for <UNK> or even back to the future
<START> <UNK> <UNK> who co directed the flop <UNK> to <UNK> made his debut in this film br br the film was ahead of it's times in a way though it has a story not to different and it came closest to <UNK> which released 1 week before and luckily this was better and did a better business br br the movie starts off well <UNK> guilt is well shown at the start though the scene with <UNK> <UNK> is too crude vulgar br br the scenes between <UNK> and <UNK> are well handled and the twist in the tale where <UNK> confronts <UNK> is brilliant br br the pace moves fast and the viewer is kept on the edge but the second girlfriend track of <UNK> isn't fully convincing br br also the cop track seems half baked br br the finale is too <UNK> too br br direction by <UNK> <UNK> is good music is a winner all songs were <UNK> camera work was stunning br br <UNK> played his naughty streak very well this was the role that gave him stardom and though he kept playing such roles and got annoying in this film he was superb <UNK> too was good in his role for once he did a nice job and one of his only good performance and he looked good too <UNK> was brilliant in her role <UNK> in the second half but her <UNK> delivery was at times not up to the mark sadly rarely she showed such potential in other films raj <UNK> is okay
<START> when i first saw this film in cinema 11 years ago i loved it i still think the directing and cinematography are excellent as is the music but it's really the script that has over the time started to bother me more and more i find emma <UNK> writing self absorbed and <UNK> to the original book she has reduced <UNK> to a side character a second <UNK> to her much too old much too severe <UNK> she in the movie is given many sort of <UNK> <UNK> and often they appear to be there just to show off thompson herself br br i do understand her cutting off several characters from the book but leaving out the one scene where <UNK> in the book is redeemed for someone who red and <UNK> the book long before the movie those are the things always difficult to <UNK> br br as for the actors i love kate <UNK> as <UNK> she is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up <UNK> without too much sentimentality alan <UNK> is great a bit old perhaps but he plays the role beautifully and elizabeth <UNK> she is absolutely fantastic as always
<START> ok ok it might be hard to put the entirety of a man's life in one film <UNK> therefore <UNK> focus on one or two significant parts in the <UNK> life now byron was a my week beats your year fellow which makes <UNK> parts that are representative even harder furthermore just as <UNK> poetry is <UNK> from his life the man's life itself must be seen as a whole <UNK> parts out is not only not showing the whole picture it's showing a different picture altogether br br now in short my review comes down to this supposedly byron was indeed the my week beats your year prototype a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime true he had <UNK> and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in but in the end this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we'd all want to lead no well i did not at any moment want to live the life depicted in this film so it gets 3 not for being so badly done which direction wise it more or less was but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot br br some more detail well to over <UNK> things a byron bio should have two distinct episodes 1 post first europe trip england and his rise to fame marriage 2 his life abroad now the important thing is that the second part should be at least as important as the first not only was it a lot longer but the most significant change in byron took place then furthermore it's where he created his best works don juan the vision of judgement etc all the stuff that makes him really unique in english literature br br instead in this film a <UNK> life never comes across as even remotely entertaining b it only gets worse after he leaves england they did two good jobs first they started at his return of his europe trip though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue second they chose an angle and they chose his incestuous love for <UNK> who is rather perfectly cast the problem with this last thing is that they never let it go true byron remained strongly attached to <UNK> for the rest of his life but especially as he was such a mood swing person the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life br br anyway the first part of the tv film should have ended with him leaving england there's no doubt about that the thing is once abroad a life of <UNK> began with the infamous <UNK> period but in italy byron also discovered a new life both for his poetry inspired by italian comedy already in <UNK> and for himself when he found the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and moved to <UNK> afterwards at the request of <UNK> with <UNK> to <UNK> in other words he was also <UNK> his mind and life opened up and not only in the <UNK> sense while <UNK> closed further as it fell into the <UNK> pull of the victorian age true freedom was <UNK> less but this bitter sweet freedom tastes sour in this film we see a lonely bored <UNK> getting older br br i mean hell byron never thought much about his poetry except when he finally found his own voice in don juan apart from poetic and romantic developments his relationship with <UNK> and the down break should have been more documented also it is in italy in <UNK> that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas this is important as it shows that the <UNK> romantic and ultimately <UNK> language and person of <UNK> harold is changing into the more planted in life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of don juan life and work are one true still a bit naive but it's what got him to <UNK> and the whole thing came full circle in <UNK> where <UNK> revolutionary spirit further <UNK> the spark <UNK> wasn't the bored <UNK> suddenly looking for some action it was the insights in italy the <UNK> stirring him into action it can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient style battle excitement while the rest of europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and <UNK> but it wasn't just that there was a true inspiration behind it meanwhile byron wrote massive amounts of don juan true his end is a bit sad but it's not like he's worn out that is the essence of <UNK> life he may have had some strong emotional <UNK> 2 <UNK> and <UNK> but every time he managed to <UNK> himself truly meaning that he wasn't <UNK> at the end of his life no he'd made a physical and mental journey that at the time few people were prepared to make br br i wonder why is it that so often the second period in <UNK> life is overlooked because it had less obvious conflicts as the man was finally coming to his own in focusing our attention on the frustrated england years <UNK> with <UNK> we show ourselves to be not much better than the english <UNK> at the time which byron so <UNK> and which despite the fact that he had no choice he willingly <UNK> in <UNK> to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic <UNK> language poet and <UNK> from a self obsessed <UNK> to a passionate man moving <UNK> with a cause
<START> after seeing the trailer for evening you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved i mean they even got rocky <UNK> own brad barry <UNK> to show the world he is still acting and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie while not entirely true the film is pretty much <UNK> nicely in the trailer and that isn't necessarily a bad thing this is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her <UNK> one that got away her daughters hear her <UNK> about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and harris killed buddy soon plays out no matter what happens though the film is not about these people and what they do good or bad it is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life what may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to ever happen br br the story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature our filmmakers here decide to tell the story by <UNK> between the present ann on her <UNK> <UNK> ann <UNK> by combining the present with the past in her mind and the past ann meeting harris at her best friend's wedding there are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit <UNK> and boring but overall it is handled better than at first thought it's not as though <UNK> life now is uninteresting it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned while i grant that the parallels to the past help <UNK> the problems for <UNK> children currently i was still a bit too <UNK> in the wedding to care as much as i maybe should have there are some nice moments though for instance the crash that <UNK> ann from <UNK> being <UNK> later on and the <UNK> dreams which bridge both worlds together br br it is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid these performances are completely riveting to the point where you get a bit angry when our time period has changed and we must wait to find out what happens next no matter how annoying i find claire <UNK> angry sad crying face that exists in every role she plays the girl is good at what she does i find myself warming to her talents more and more lately and this one just <UNK> that <UNK> patrick wilson is always great in whatever i've seen him in you must give him credit for picking some really fantastic roles and never doing much more than one film a year from angels in america to last year's little children the guy will soon blow up but hopefully he will stay true to the craft and not cash in heck even <UNK> <UNK> is good as the younger version of her real life mother meryl streep who surprisingly is in the film very little she is still rough around the edges but she was wonderful at expressing the emotional turmoil her character goes through on her wedding day the real revelation though is hugh <UNK> i feel i've seen him in many things but in fact it seems only in king arthur <UNK> literally steals every scene he is in and the way in which his role of buddy is <UNK> by love alcohol life is <UNK> in his facial expressions throughout without his performance the flashback sequences could have fallen into the somewhat forgettable category as the rest of the film and made the experience as a whole much worse br br while not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table you may be able to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together but you can't argue that the acting isn't worth sticking around for maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see however when it is all put together there may also be something coming out of it that couldn't have been achieved without all the other story threads either way the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it
<START> julie waters is outstanding and adrian <UNK> a revelation in a very warm very real and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications gender <UNK> and <UNK> cause in a young <UNK> life at the heart of this movie is the very real truth that you must accept yourself before you can hope for others to accept you
<START> the movie is just plain fun maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of the ramones around the time the film was made i've watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny at the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with <UNK> of some classes is just as timeless br br and the film has some gem lines scenes references to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life let me assure you i've been out of high school for <UNK> some years and it's not following me the famous static line i'm getting some static not as much as you're going to get as principal <UNK> approaches the school board member who is so <UNK> he's attended by <UNK> the nazi hall <UNK> love for a body search principal <UNK> <UNK> i give you the final solution and burning the ramones records note records were what came before <UNK> and of course joey <UNK> noting things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by <UNK> asking do your parents know you're ramones br br just one piece of advice don't look up where the stars are now joey <UNK> sadly died young <UNK> young who was a major <UNK> in the film today reminds us we all age <UNK> soles career never advanced as we might have expected <UNK> <UNK> as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles and does anyone know what happened to dj don steele br br so watch and enjoy don't think just have fun
<START> the feel of this movie was amazing adam <UNK> performance was very inspiring as he played a very <UNK> and fragile character he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role his character was really interesting i can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as sandler made me for someone who plays primarily comedy roles he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and <UNK> i especially loved the scene in which adam and <UNK> characters <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> around the city i <UNK> with the moment because it seemed like don was witnessing one thing adam does to get away from it all with his video games music and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past riding his <UNK> with his <UNK> on seemed like an escape from his thoughts this movie is definitely worth the watch
<START> i love john <UNK> in anything he's in the one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more <UNK> been been titled please do not watch this movie called zombie death house the 1000 dollar shock insurance <UNK> is dear fred <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> way of making you spend 14 dollars on a filmed dump <UNK> out by a major 70's cheese legend ray being the front man at <UNK> ray by the way makes charles band look <UNK> than <UNK> <UNK> on a ford <UNK> just plain bad now the both of them and boring besides it's great that ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it's public <UNK> like the rest of the dollar video <UNK> but in the case of zombie death house the word zombie <UNK> <UNK> to add <UNK> and interest on the part of f o r the only way to do service to this tripe is to release it on the dollar market for the curious collector and fans of <UNK> if you wanna see real <UNK> pick up black christmas nightmare on elm street or the <UNK>
<START> rock star john norman howard kris kristofferson turns <UNK> singer esther hoffman barbra streisand into an overnight singing star <UNK> star rises while john's goes into decline thanks to drugs and alcohol after about two hours john does the self destructive red <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> crack up on a desert highway thing the best thing about this movie is the music especially the song <UNK> barbra streisand sings well but you can't take her seriously as an up and coming star when she is already a star the very first time she appears singing in a back alley bar she looks like an established singing star who is <UNK> for the night not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career she is too confident too professional her apartment looks like a page out of apartment living not some hole in the wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live br br kris kristofferson handles the self centered out of control rock star role like well like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn't have much acting talent the direction is tepid the story is slow and dull br br but the worst thing about this movie is not the acting or the lame direction or the slow story it's the hair after staring at <UNK> and <UNK> awful 70's <UNK> for 2 hours your eyes hurt
<START> i liked the movie first of all because it told an interesting story but the story as told in the movie felt like it was <UNK> from a much longer story since the book is over 400 pages that makes sense it <UNK> a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s in a fictional south american country also a lot to fit into the time available i think it would have been much better as a six hour mini series than it turned out as a <UNK> minute movie br br even though it's rushed the story doesn't skip so much that it gets confusing what is told is told fairly well one fault is that <UNK> supernatural powers appear <UNK> either they should have appeared more <UNK> through the course of the movie or they should have been left out two more faults which could be spoilers <UNK> eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly and <UNK> curse seems to wear off even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure forever br br the acting is excellent glenn close as the tormented <UNK> <UNK> is outstanding jeremy <UNK> as the brutal self made rich man is also excellent meryl streep as the main character clara is great although she's often even better than she was in this movie there were many well performed smaller roles too the biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a <UNK> coach each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent
<START> review may contain spoilers br br predictable campy bad special effects it has a tv movie feeling to it the idea of the un as being taken over by satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible the premise is interesting but its <UNK> falls <UNK> short if you want to <UNK> people to christianity with a film like this at least make it a quality one i was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck can't say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago and there isn't really much to say about this film other than skip it
<START> a very strong movie bruce is good and brad also br br as i think there are two cities missed in the <UNK> list from the list bruce remembered br br that means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job br br well <UNK> property seems to me work in this movie however i do believe in back to the future theory of <UNK> <UNK> br br so bruce could save the world but not his world br br in the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself br br and i do believe there is no problem in that here i disagree with dr brown from back br br but the story <UNK> 12 monkeys has its own beauty <UNK> of all these theories of one world or many or <UNK> one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor his girlfriend was just lost br br a sequence of events which may lead her to believe that he is from the future the bullet well it might be some mistake some <UNK> br br well i like this movie has to buy a dvd br br best
<START> i am terribly sorry i know that <UNK> still is called one of the greatest directors in post war germany and that most of his films are considered master pieces but when i see <UNK> <UNK> today in 2004 i wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie the acting is simply terrible <UNK> <UNK> is all the smiling like an idiot the <UNK> between nazi <UNK> and <UNK> are ridiculous the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for real art but for me this movie is simply bad cheap compare this to <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and tell me again that <UNK> <UNK> is a good movie
<START> this is my favorite movie ever i have watched it at least 10 times and i cry every time my family begs me not to watch it so i wont have a crying fit i think i love that it is a true story written by antwone himself just as much as i love the movie the acting is top notch and the actors were perfect for their role denzel washington is one of my favorite actors but this is my favorite movie he has done so far i took care of a little boy who was also born in jail he was the most precious little boy i had ever met he has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years i saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and i am so happy he is safe and loved and i am so happy <UNK> happy and found his family br br i would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family i just cant say enough good things about it
<START> first off if you're planning on watching this make sure to watch the uncut version although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were <UNK> with due to censorship it makes a huge difference this film is about a young woman played by barbara stanwyck who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father when her father suddenly passes away she is able to go out into the world on her own after reading about <UNK> <UNK> on life she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love throughout the movie she becomes increasingly <UNK> and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all overall baby face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film while no sexual acts are <UNK> shown on screen it is very obvious what is happening off camera br br i enjoyed watching this film very much and i believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it especially with the films shock value i did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts but i think that about most movies the first time is see them actually i think that almost all movies i've seen made from the early 30's had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didn't quite flow right this was probably just the craft of film making wasn't quite <UNK> yet  it would take just a few more years compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30's film and i think you'll see what i mean br br once again i'm very glad i was able to watch the original cut it really does make a big difference also any john wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an <UNK> role
<START> one of the worst films i have ever seen how to define worst i would prefer having both eye balls <UNK> out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again somehow one hit wonder <UNK> manages a film that simultaneously <UNK> elvis fans mary kay <UNK> las vegas gays fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be <UNK> ed how elvis <UNK> <UNK> could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be the only good elvis <UNK> <UNK> is a dead one is beyond me the worst part of this mess and that takes some work is the <UNK> script in 1958 <UNK> words and songs that he would speak perform in the 1970's are <UNK> worst special effect that oscar would go to the moron who decided that <UNK> grave potentially the most photographed recognizable grave in the world resembles a <UNK> with a gold record glued <UNK> and is <UNK> in the middle of a park somewhere potentially this film's biggest audience would be elvis fans however the rampant stupidity <UNK> gave elvis a <UNK> <UNK> not fbi <UNK> and i could go on and on actually <UNK> that conventional wisdom ugh i used the word wisdom to describe this stupid movie this is truly a horrible horrible film
<START> so one person says this movie is a beautiful delicate exploration of west german life after world war ii and the other says former nazis living in bombed out buildings and the movie is <UNK> <UNK> and the first sits there <UNK> takes another <UNK> of coffee i can't explain just see it
<START> this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen again i made the mistake of buying the movie because the <UNK> on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too after buying this and the movie <UNK> which i reviewed on here as well i have learned my lesson i love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm this supposedly takes place in the woods of texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard the production was probably the worst i ever seen the actors were absolutely the worst the story didn't have anything to do with what the back cover said i even tried to sell it to f y e and some other mom and pop store that buys used dvds and neither would take it thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was i have seen some bad movies before <UNK> 2 for example but this definitely takes the cake i didn't think there was a worse movie than <UNK> 2 boy was i wrong do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what i am about to do
<START> one of the first of the best musicals anchors aweigh features several memorable musical sequences such as kelly dancing with jerry the mouse kelly dancing with 7 year old sharon <UNK> sinatra singing with jose iturbi playing piano kathryn grayson singing with iturbi <UNK> and much more the technicolor is perfect with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath through transparent keys and grayson singing seen through the <UNK> of another camera the plot is thin but you get involved from kelly's sinatra's enthusiasm <UNK> on leave they have to take home a runaway boy dean <UNK> and sinatra falls for his aunt to set him up with the aunt grayson kelly suggests that sinatra can get her an audition with jose iturbi but sinatra's young and naive in this one and in his own sung words falls in love too fast while they're trying to contact iturbi who's never available he starts to fall for another girl barbara <UNK> but kelly's now falling love with grayson anchors aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live action cartoon sequence with tom and jerry but there's a lot more here that's worth a look i'm giving it nine stars because while it's not quite as good as the best musicals <UNK> in the rain the music man <UNK> it is one of the first of their class of technicolor big productions perhaps meet me in st louis was the first and better than most others
<START> i saw this film numerous times in the late 60's early 70's whenever it <UNK> it's head like a <UNK> with <UNK> every november december as a saturday <UNK> kiddie show it was always stiff competition for the <UNK> that almost wasn't <UNK> can i say christmas perhaps the greatest most iconic christmas season film of all time but that's another review br br at the time i <UNK> that the on screen <UNK> of santa claus was almost pink and white so much had the color of the <UNK> torn <UNK> changed color br br the film is kinda creepy i thought so then and still do actually i was highly entertained then as i still am it's amusing in a <UNK> <UNK> sort of way by the way the image quality looks much better on the dvd i have now than it did in the theater circa 1969 <UNK> br br if you are expecting maybe the lost <UNK> bass christmas special forget it if you want fellini does christmas read on br br by nature the dubbing on these foreign films the original version here was in spanish always makes them seem surreal this adds to the films inherent <UNK> it is also pretty scary in that a <UNK> demon as described in the original us trailer spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids evil one particularly nightmarish scene has a young <UNK> key boy wishing he had parents for christmas suddenly the <UNK> a family emerges out of giant christmas presents of the mind until he realizes he's just <UNK> see this christmas lovers and if you're a <UNK> save your <UNK> this film will make you think you're <UNK> without drugs
<START> i've seen this movie when i was traveling in brazil i found it difficult to really understand brazilian culture and society because it has so many <UNK> and class differences to see this movie in <UNK> <UNK> itself was a revelation it shows something of the everyday life of many <UNK> on the other side it is sometimes a little bit over <UNK> and that's the only negative comment i have on this film it's sometimes too much too much sex too many murders and too much cynicism for one film the director could film some things a bit more subtle it would make the film more effective br br despite this i liked the movie and the way the story <UNK> itself the characters are complex and very much like real life people not pretty american actors and actresses with a lot of <UNK> but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time that makes the film realistic even when the story is not that convincing
<START> this is just the best movie of all times sorry hollywood i've seen it in early 70's as soon as it appeared on the <UNK> tv and i loved it immediately i was 14 then 25 years later i bought it on a video tape and a few months ago it finally appeared on a dvd here in <UNK> i live with this movie 35 years already and so do all my friends and my family my son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time and he loved it immediately too and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only hollywood movies and not speaking or understanding russian at all what makes this masterpiece of <UNK> so special it's difficult to say as it is difficult to describe what the beauty is but the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time i can't remember any other such movie no matter how many millions it cost or how great the cast was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> loves you
<START> i had seen this movie long time back but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me br br a wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of australian <UNK> who tried to sink some japanese ships at the <UNK> harbor during the height of ww2 br br these <UNK> are caught in plain clothes and they are considered to be spies by the japanese <UNK> but something happens that hasn't been explored much in any hollywood ww2 movie that i have seen br br a close and friendly bonding develops between the <UNK> and the <UNK> they begin to respect each other while the captain of the captured australian soldiers become the best of friends with a senior japanese prison guard this is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really <UNK> your heart br br soon one day as the two friends are <UNK> the aussie captain learns that some other <UNK> are going to be tried and executed for the sinking of the <UNK> ships in the <UNK> harbor br br he mentions that it was his team and not some other's that had sunk the ships to his japanese friend and upon hearing this the japanese guard tells him to keep quiet as it might lead to his whole group getting executed but the captain remains <UNK> on <UNK> this to the japanese authorities br br finally the japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most <UNK> way that is according to their rules this is the highest honor <UNK> to the captured warriors in japan br br this is the most awesome part of the film where the aussie soldiers are awaiting their <UNK> death and the tense <UNK> of the friendly japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why did his aussie friend confess being guilty br br i won't give away the ending here but it is more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears br br all in all an excellent underrated movie that possibly didn't get the recognition that it deserved <UNK> get one copy today and be <UNK>
<START> as someone who has never <UNK> adam sandler in terms of talent as is done to him and many comic actors like him i walked in to reign over me expecting a great film not simply because of his presence in the movie but because i thought that it looked very good overall even someone who already thought that sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that i was surprised at how fantastic he is in it he will make you <UNK> especially in his <UNK> sudden and unexpected monologue what's amazing about his role is that it's a character it's hard to say we've seen before we've seen many emotionally <UNK> characters many mentally retarded people many <UNK> many passionate self centered artists but <UNK> charlie <UNK> is none of these he may have a taste of each of them in some ways but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual it's a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be <UNK> every which way by someone whose problems mindset and <UNK> are completely different from most characters like him br br don cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level he is every man he is the most normal possible person in the world so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his either or at least any that are played the way he plays alan johnson whose name is even found on the <UNK> line cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny <UNK> smart and stupid the way so many normal people are br br the rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who've hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colorful roles <UNK> <UNK> smith is the overly <UNK> upper middle class wife donald sutherland is the <UNK> but surprising judge robert <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> father in law br br mike <UNK> script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its <UNK> it's much more subtle than say <UNK> and has a much more close to home ideal br br the camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style this film struck me as sort of a <UNK> to the kitchen sink style of the 1970s cinematography was grainy and <UNK> but that was its charm it wasn't about <UNK> us to the camera itself and the <UNK> that would've <UNK> its stories with such br br the music which plays a major role in the film and its title is very powerful near the beginning you feel like you're in for another about <UNK> or little miss sunshine sort of soundtrack but you soon realize you're in for more than that in fact the film is packed with lots of music that <UNK> a lot of the most emotional scenes br br reign over me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself it goes to show that even the director of <UNK> is capable of wonders
<START> this <UNK> from roman polanski clearly shows where his <UNK> lay at the time he made it polanski himself plays a <UNK> man who <UNK> a <UNK> apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide he becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it to the point that he's dressing in drag and <UNK> events the way they might have <UNK> the movie's unsettling to a point and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that polanski excels at but it comes off too much as a rehash of rosemary's baby and <UNK> two other better polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments br br but as for the <UNK> unless i'm reading too much into the film i have to believe that this was <UNK> reaction to the feelings of <UNK> he felt at being labeled a sexual <UNK> and <UNK> from america not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself br br grade b
<START> the good i liked this movie because it was the first horror movie i've seen in a long time that actually scared me the acting wasn't too bad and the <UNK> killer was believable and disturbing br br the bad the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak there just wasn't much to it the ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting i do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore br br overall a good scare but a bad story br br out of
<START> the lady in <UNK> is a <UNK> course on social <UNK> of the late 60's the writing not the acting is at center stage did i say pure camp prepare to be offended if you are female or gay broad and dame are standard terms and gay <UNK> and bashing are represented for what they were in the day camp wise most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors the action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see dan <UNK> play a tough guy who likes bashing <UNK> and <UNK> kazan and <UNK> <UNK> are at the <UNK> peak of their careers amazing to note they were both 28 years old and mr sinatra was <UNK> the musical score wait was there a score well you get the point watch it with friends who want a good laugh it's full of them
<START> frank mccarthy who produced the academy award winning <UNK> film <UNK> follows it up with a strong tribute to another of america's fighting <UNK> douglas macarthur gregory peck gives a strong characterization of the man his genius as well as his <UNK> with macarthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they <UNK> br br the whole story of douglas macarthur would be a six hour film or a tv mini series it would cover him from his days on frontier <UNK> with his family to his time at west point where he still has the highest <UNK> average ever achieved by a <UNK> it would talk about his service in the <UNK> as a young officer his legend building bravery on the <UNK> of world war i in france it would also have to tell about him firing on the bonus <UNK> of world war i veterans in 1932 probably putting the final <UNK> on any chances president herbert hoover had of getting re elected during <UNK> last years he and hoover had <UNK> <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> in new york city that must have been a subject they avoided br br this film concentrates on the years 1941 to <UNK> and it is told in flashback the film opens with macarthur addressing the student body in <UNK> as he speaks the words of the famous duty honor country speech <UNK> mind goes back to world war ii and his desperate struggle against the <UNK> japanese on the island of <UNK> and the fields of <UNK> on <UNK> the film takes him through his struggle to win back the <UNK> the <UNK> of japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by president truman br br macarthur as a film would not work at all if it wasn't for the portrayals of dan <UNK> and ed <UNK> as <UNK> franklin d <UNK> and harry s truman respectively it's the part of the film i enjoyed the best seeing macarthur and his relations with both these men br br <UNK> by <UNK> captures the <UNK> <UNK> and exceptionally <UNK> man that was our <UNK> president <UNK> was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and <UNK> sometimes he liked scheming a little too much for its own sake but he was the master politician of the last century note how he deals with macarthur both as a battlefield commander and potential rival at the same time br br truman by <UNK> is as people remember him a blunt spoken man of the people who disliked <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> of course it's in the history books how truman <UNK> macarthur in 1951 for <UNK> macarthur was <UNK> no doubt about it br br yet i could write a whole <UNK> on the truman macarthur relations along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis i've always felt that <UNK> would have dealt with the whole matter in a far better way had he still been president then br br macarthur was also <UNK> <UNK> and gregory peck captures some of that <UNK> in some of the <UNK> that made him as much a legend as <UNK> on the battlefield listen to peck at the japanese surrender at <UNK> farewell to the nation before the joint session of <UNK> and of course his speech to the <UNK> in <UNK> watch the <UNK> and see if you don't agree
<START> this was a superb episode one of the best of both seasons down right horror for a change with a story that is way way above the average <UNK> episodes if there is such a thing a man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving his <UNK> worked <UNK> didn't she is burned beyond recognition great makeup btw and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin <UNK> but even in a coma she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology and when she does die for a few minutes her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit carnage of course ensues and also some extremely gory killings and also some extremely sexy scenes what more could you ask for you might ask well not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on most viewers faces i just loved rob <UNK> wrong turn direction too he has a great knack for horror excellent episode this is one i'm buying for sure
<START> here be spoilers br br the government has continued to develop the <UNK> program now called <UNK> the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before however the government is <UNK> the project <UNK> and the <UNK> that is in the middle of all feel threatened so he takes steps to ensure his own safety he <UNK> and controls the <UNK> and start to run mayhem the only one who can stop them is <UNK> van damme br br this movie is about one thing choreographed fighting the story is bad and is soon drowned in all fights whatever happens and wherever they go they fight unfortunately for this movie it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is <UNK> normally you're pretty sure the hero will win but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal <UNK> not where one is <UNK> and can't lose then the fights just become a tool to stretch time you wait until the final fight when <UNK> miraculously finds a way to beat his <UNK> <UNK> to further lower my opinion a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are well there aren't really that lot of them because the characters are most men there are at least one woman <UNK> though but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a <UNK> once the female leads get by with this but we also pass through a strip club to use a computer no less with much more <UNK> women these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent minded male audience br br so in conclusion boring fights no more no less well maybe less br br 2 10
<START> matthew <UNK> is a mysterious man waiting for agent wesley doyle powers <UNK> in his fbi office he claims to have information about a serial killer chased by fbi when agent doyle arrives in the office he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother agent doyle <UNK> some evidence and the man tells the story of his life since his childhood they were a simple family of three his widow father <UNK> bill paxton his brother and himself one night his father <UNK> the two brothers and tells them that an angel of god had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons what happens next is one of the most scary movie i have ever seen br br i watched this movie four months ago on vhs and yesterday i watched again now on dvd although being a low budget movie the screenplay is sharp with no flaw the cast is outstanding but i would like to highlight the performance of matt <UNK> as the young <UNK> it is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager the direction of bill paxton is remarkable there is no explicit violence in this horror movie a great debut behind the camera i regret the brazilian title of this movie 'a <UNK> do <UNK> the devil's <UNK> if at least it were 'the god's <UNK> it might be acceptable but calling this movie as 'the devil's <UNK> is indeed ridiculous brent <UNK> the screenwriter did not deserve such a lack of respect from the brazilian <UNK> this film is highly recommended my vote is eight br br title brazil a <UNK> do <UNK> the devil's hand
<START> having looked at some of the other comments here i have a main complaint with this presentation br br the two primary characters are attractive in their own ways the beautiful victim and the handsome obviously extremely off center blue collar protagonist if just short of totally deranged take turns beating the hell out of each other sort of like a <UNK> <UNK> scenario br br this is all right and this is of course mainly a turning the tables story however my <UNK> complaint is that i believe the director got caught up in his desire to display <UNK> well known and obvious physical attributes beginning with her being <UNK> clad in a thin <UNK> and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect while immensely pleasing to the eyes these distract from the <UNK> level of the drama br br her roommates i'm certain give performances as written and directed however their respective <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> don't ring true based upon <UNK> previous experience with this guy the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be <UNK> what has occurred br br but this is a film and story compelling as much in spite of as because of the director's work
<START> the longer this film went on and it seemed to <UNK> go on for ever the more annoyed i became as quite frankly what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense how on earth do people get to make films like this or indeed receive <UNK> for such rubbish don't be fooled by the relatively high ratings on imdb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time and in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold america can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the usa has such an obscene and fatal <UNK> <UNK> br br anyhow br br the lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an urban <UNK> he comes across a family with two spoiled brat children a teenage girl and boy taken care of by a strict single parent father who can barely cope the cowboy is <UNK> by the teenage girl or vice versa and the <UNK> boy is seemingly taken in by the <UNK> of the loser br br the cowboy spends the whole time in a state of <UNK> and depression a total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living and then commits a <UNK> on his family as he is too lazy to make money <UNK> br br ask yourself br br who wants to watch either a sad failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish or indeed view a poor family who are in effect not much better than white trash br br this film is pointless drivel br br it only saves itself from getting the lowest mark possible by some half listen able music br br 2 10
<START> the movie is basically a boring string of appalling clichés which do not offer a real cross cultural insight the middle eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way there obviously are mud brick <UNK> dirt tracks in the middle of the desert women clad in black <UNK> and belly dancers i wonder how <UNK> and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture the personality of the two main characters is very clumsily <UNK> and many situations are hardly credible br br the original idea might have been interesting but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight you should skip this movie
<START> a film written and directed by neil young <UNK> is little more than an <UNK> minute music video set to a <UNK> or so of the <UNK> works in <UNK> of dialogue the film relies exclusively on <UNK> lyrics which are heavily laced with <UNK> commentary to tell the story while actors act out the scenes br br given the hammy performances and the shoddy <UNK> of the picture the effect is the equivalent of young blowing up some of his own home movies and releasing them for public <UNK> although there is allegedly a story running through the film we really have no idea what is going on thanks mainly to the <UNK> look of the film the lack of dialogue and the amateurish <UNK> of the acting all we get for <UNK> seven minutes is a bunch of aging hippies <UNK> <UNK> through an incoherent narrative while <UNK> songs play endlessly on the soundtrack the whole thing turns into a tedious exercise in self <UNK> <UNK> gives off hollywood low budget movie making a bad name
<START> i rented this movie for a few laughs i had never seen the snl skit but with hits like tommy boy and <UNK> world it couldn't have been that bad could it the answer it was this movie hardly was a means of relaxing after a hard day at work i just kept waiting for a <UNK> and a funny part but there wasn't any the highlight was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and thats just about it

<START> there should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like resident evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible re was a survival horror game and a damn effective one at that yet paul <UNK> anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along alone in the dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as resident evil so of course there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie instead alone in the dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies br br the plot despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter is the largest of many problems with the movie the movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of <UNK> text that may or may not be important as after a minute passes the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them then there's something about an <UNK> some <UNK> an ancient tribe some <UNK> and some demons all of which get so <UNK> together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on characters move in and out of the plot like candy some having huge build ups for meaningless deaths basically what i can understand is that some demons got released and edward <UNK> slater has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his <UNK> which has failed on him he finds an <UNK> involving the demons and brings it to an ex girlfriend <UNK> reid who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason then out of nowhere all hell breaks loose and the pair end up with a military team led by some <UNK> commander <UNK> who apparently has a mutual hatred for <UNK> br br it's all ridiculous and the reason i don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and <UNK> but it leaves no room for anyone to really care instead i highly recommend that if you must see this film bring a <UNK> ball or something to <UNK> yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion br br the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little right too bad this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made with enough quick cuts to <UNK> a coop of <UNK> considering that this is based on a horror game not an action game it is especially annoying br br the first action scene involving a man chasing <UNK> from a taxi is among the worst i have ever had to witness and the rest isn't all that great either the demons look somewhat cool though the fact that they turn into <UNK> when killed takes away all that effect scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the <UNK> fire as the only source of light and the camera <UNK> and <UNK> faster than the head of a crack addict it's all the kind of <UNK> inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night br br the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on the same is true of <UNK> who gets a <UNK> role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot reid is pretty much exactly what she should be background sex appeal as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning br br in all this is the type of movie that <UNK> me about future video game movies if they keep ruining the spirit like this it's only a matter of time before <UNK> <UNK> is killing middle <UNK> with an <UNK> <UNK> and tommy <UNK> is fighting a <UNK> of aliens unlike resident evil however this one doesn't deserve a second chance as i don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is it's bland uninteresting and <UNK> this is the movie equivalent of <UNK> it's all thrown together nothing really fits and in the end you're just glad it's over br br total 4

<START> beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made yet <UNK> an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and <UNK> awful sound track in the first 15 minutes and to be honest that's all you need to see combine to create something that is hilariously side splitting br br the opening scene in <UNK> is just about as <UNK> as cinematography gets as <UNK> up <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> past your eyes to <UNK> dialogue before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad the credits roll and the action struggles to life br br and aside from the double headed <UNK> giant <UNK> that <UNK> our heroes you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time pure genius br br the sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that i've only ever seen one copy so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely perhaps i own the only copy in existence br br

<START> the movie starts out with a bunch of dead men walking <UNK> sitting in individual cells waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the <UNK> chair br br then our hero who is called <UNK> is taken to the chair he's <UNK> and then he's still alive <UNK> he is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool either we <UNK> you until we've made sure you're actually dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you our hero says yes to option 2 and then the actual story <UNK> br br he wakes up in a different sort of cell very high tech and very big where he finds another cell mate who also managed to survive the electric boogie ride a voice in the <UNK> tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish as long as it happens within that room sounds a little suspicious but the two men accept what else can they do br br what these two men do not know is that they have been set together so they can <UNK> an inner urge to kill within them basically the unknown scientists in the background p s them off until they decide that they should kill each other sounds weird indeed but there's a greater purpose to all of this this is the part which should not be revealed and so it shall remain <UNK> br br but fear not it is the unknown that <UNK> the viewer to watch more of this pseudo action movie <UNK> it has an entirely different approach to the question how long time can you stand being with a man who's an s o b and would you kill him to obtain freedom br br the first hour is basically trying to <UNK> your interest it <UNK> up without you actually knowing it then it becomes a roller coaster ride with wild matrix like action fight scenes with a touch of <UNK> to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon br br the movie is indeed very special so special that normal cinemas won't view it under normal circumstances however the story is fascinating the music is fantastic and the actors do their bit some more than others to make the movie truly unique br br if you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it watch it and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge <UNK> of cash br br
<START> in the <UNK> we're not all that familiar with arthur <UNK> so i nearly <UNK> this film which had its tcm preview recently on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in ghost train which i expected to be thoroughly annoying instead i was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing <UNK> the physical aspects of <UNK> comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if charlie chaplin and woody allen had a baby there is no comparing him to bud <UNK> or any of the other usual <UNK> of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre one can feel moreover the thread connecting <UNK> to british comedy 30 years later at least it is clear from an american point of view that he has more in common with the monty python <UNK> than with any of his counterparts over here as for the rest of the film the more movies you've seen the more likely you'll guess at the ending but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance
<START> <UNK> adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre to compare this confused motion picture with the inspired <UNK> and quality of stephen <UNK> films is a mistake br br firstly the fight scenes are nothing new all that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of <UNK> zhang tony <UNK> and jackie chan fights in intelligent motion pictures need logic there seems no point serving blows that have no <UNK> effect as in the matrix sequels br br the attractive female lead so <UNK> <UNK> captivated the screen but she never convincingly <UNK> the physical demands of the role as <UNK> zhang had done so easily in house of flying <UNK> having a martial arts background serves well in kung fu movies to cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake see <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> unless you are a very talented director which as <UNK> proves <UNK> wan <UNK> is not
<START> fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who <UNK> gets the power of god and <UNK> havoc carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting the story is <UNK> to the extreme but the cast including morgan freeman as god is great and makes the film worth catching grade b
<START> i thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well it was really fun and i thought the actors was brilliant i think it is a crime for anyone to say that is was bad because it looked the right time i find it really annoying when people say that it wasn't historically correct because it is supposed to be a saturday night entertainment show not a boring history documentary so i think the costumes and settings were just right a brilliant start and i am going to love what will come next i have spoken to many people at my school and they love the show we all think that it is brilliant entertainment and it has great stories to go with it
<START> watching truth about love is this a double <UNK> about the star is like <UNK> in white noise or <UNK> water sounds to help you sleep you put it in the dvd <UNK> because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a <UNK> day and it works for that for that purpose being a british romantic comedy it is a bit more br br the story is a rather simple one about a wife alice jennifer love <UNK> married to an increasingly distant husband sam <UNK> <UNK> who has put their love life on hold due to the <UNK> of his busy law practice his partner <UNK> <UNK> scott is fond of both sam and alice but has a longtime attraction to alice that goes beyond friendship alice pals with her sister <UNK> kate miles a free love <UNK> who encourages alice to have affairs on <UNK> day after a drinking <UNK> with her sister alice <UNK> a card to sam signed <UNK> as a test to see if sam responds testing his <UNK> at the same time <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> seed <UNK> to alice on which he has <UNK> a suggestive love not both have ex post <UNK> regrets sam in fact is spending time with a lover <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and is indeed cheating on alice alice <UNK> <UNK> with sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet sam in disguise as <UNK> to test his <UNK> the entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly <UNK> and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth and how that results in the various <UNK> is the surprise of sorts of the <UNK> script br br british comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting perhaps had director john <UNK> elected to cast a british actress as alice instead of <UNK> a phony accent on jennifer love <UNK> the result may have been improved but in the end this story by peter <UNK> <UNK> between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages one terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is <UNK> there are some nice scenes of london and a few moments of passable humor but in the end this little film is truly best <UNK> as background music white noise grady <UNK>
<START> okay guys we know why we watch film like the invisible maniac just look at the cover man t and a all over the place with a lot more t than a but shouldn't there be a story to go with it br br c'mon i can hear you say this is just girls <UNK> naked who needs a story br br well if this were called the naked <UNK> i wouldn't have a problem but since these guys are <UNK> from the invisible man they need to have a bit of story <UNK> you know to keep your mind busy br br however all they can <UNK> up is how this crazy doctor creates an <UNK> serum and when he cracks uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers and when you see the smarmy looking teenagers he goes after you'll be grateful br br one star for the t and a but there's a little too much gore for you skin fans so proceed with caution br br <UNK> yes it's that <UNK>

<START> this is an atrocious movie two demented young women seduce and torture a middle aged man there's not much to give away in regards to a plot or a spoiler i would only comment that the ending is nearly the most preposterous part of the flick much of the film involves locke and camp <UNK> <UNK> all the while <UNK> <UNK> at the camera add to this a soundtrack that repeats again and again including a <UNK> song about dear old dad that suggests an incestuous quality the viewer never really sees the music is annoying at first then ends up <UNK> the viewer to a torture worse than that depicted on the screen the theme here is of youth run amok understandable as a reaction to the '60s but done with little imagination or style avoid it
<START> yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere this lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it once again we have an attractive <UNK> hero who supposedly can't get any woman to be interested in him yeah right and we're also presented with the <UNK> <UNK> gay friend who is actually a fat <UNK> ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive even i didn't find him appealing and i'm a fat ugly old gay man but thankfully not <UNK> whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script and truly awful direction mr <UNK> should be banned from <UNK> but then he's no different than the countless other <UNK> working in <UNK>

<START> the secret fury in many ways a run of the mill romantic suspense drama directed by mel <UNK> boasts top notch principals in <UNK> and ryan it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end when <UNK> <UNK> suspension of disbelief as so often it does in this genre but for some viewers the film's highlight will be the portrayal of <UNK> <UNK> by vivian vance the immortal <UNK> <UNK> on i love lucy oddly vance had very few film roles her true home was broadway where among other <UNK> she <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> here she contributes a winning turn as a <UNK> <UNK> to play a minor part in a <UNK> scheme watch her half <UNK> trying to wave away the smoke when she's <UNK> a <UNK> cigarette in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> room a <UNK> for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty
<START> absolutely dreadful mexican film supposedly based on a short story by edgar allan poe about a <UNK> wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works etc when our hero <UNK> is given the grand show by dr <UNK> head of the asylum we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific such as men hanging around long in a <UNK> and comedic such as our hero being <UNK> upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both a human man dressed as a chicken yes that's right a chicken that <UNK> around the ground for chicken feed the scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film but at least for me it was the film's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining ah that is indeed the real horror that is dr <UNK> and his legion of name changes and that brings me to this <UNK> fact about the film which is most films that <UNK> multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem yes this is obvious but some have distribution problems and others of which this is one have numerous title changes so that someone might <UNK> buy the same garbage more than once this is definitely garbage it has very little going for it the only performer worth having a look at is <UNK> <UNK> as the head of the asylum he is one huge <UNK> of ham as he laughs <UNK> <UNK> orders <UNK> with sword in hand and <UNK> the chicken i got so tired of hearing him talk about the <UNK> system as his means to cure the mentally sick what a bunch of <UNK> hey a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word it won't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting cinematic chicken scratch
<START> i went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because i liked bruce dern in silent running and family plot to this day sorry jack nicholson it is still the <UNK> movie i've ever seen it just went on and on with no discernible point and then it just ended the lights came up and i watched everyone looking around in confusion had the <UNK> missed a reel i've never had the urge to find out all i remember about the movie is that it was a non drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach the most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally <UNK> audience <UNK> fortunately this was just an exception for jack bruce and karen black
<START> this movie is not very good in fact it is the worst elvis movie i have seen it has very little plot mostly <UNK> beer drinking and fighting burgess meredith and thomas <UNK> are wasted i don't know why they did this movie you could say elvis was wasted as well he is much much better in follow that dream
<START> firstly i have heard great things about this film not least among the retro vintage scene and the <UNK> lovers who absolutely love bettie page and it did not disappoint shot in very clean black and white with colour added for key scenes the film gives a documentary feel to the early life and career of bettie page br br there are many things i did not know about page firstly there was the gang rape later on there is her early attempts at developing an acting career and then <UNK> pictures firstly with a camera club <UNK> with men who can't get enough of her and later with the <UNK> paula and irving who despite their taking of bondage and fetish photos come across as extremely pleasant and friendly people if only modern pornography producers were like that perhaps better porn would be a consequence for the most part the film is neither a <UNK> against the <UNK> of pornography but an attempt to show the kind of environment that existed in the 1950s for those producing fetish and nude pictures of women this environment was extremely <UNK> perhaps in a good way because it meant that there was none of the <UNK> effect that we have today when it comes to pornography it also appeared to be much less harsh page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and doesn't appear to be <UNK> by it in many of her photos she is seen tied up and <UNK> and trying to hold a conversation <UNK> a whip with a <UNK> thus exciting the <UNK> taking her pictures and seen in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bondage movies which look quite tame compared with the hardcore stuff we have now br br page never became an actress and instead deserted <UNK> when she was in her thirties for <UNK> <UNK> her belief in god and jesus never goes away even when bound and <UNK> she still insists that she has been given a <UNK> by god to do <UNK> <UNK> seeing this film i am more <UNK> about page and in awe at her modesty beliefs and <UNK> she is one of a kind compared with the <UNK> <UNK> clone <UNK> we have today and someone who can actually say <UNK> is life after <UNK>
<START> there's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every tarzan movie that followed it including the <UNK> and boring 1980s piece <UNK> once the viewer gets past the first three scenes which are admittedly dull tarzan and his mate takes off like a shot offering non stop action humor and romance maureen <UNK> is charming and beautiful as jane and walks off with the movie <UNK> is solid as well highly recommended
<START> any movie that has nude scenes of karen allen and i'm still so bored i walk out that is a stinker br br karen gets stuck in paris and befriends a <UNK> handsome french man with whom she is having sex soon of course he's married but <UNK> why should that be a problem what could be an interesting clash of cultures is believe it or not just dull i walked out br br maybe the movie got a lot better after i left but it would have had to have gotten a lot better to make up for a rotten beginning br br my advice if you find yourself in this run do not walk for the exit save your time and your energy most <UNK> save your money it's a shame the production company didn't save its money
<START> it was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words yet very naive on the corporate world the justice department would catch more of the big <UNK> giants if they did such naive things to win the real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting yet every bit as sinister i seriously doubt any <UNK> would actually kill someone directly even the <UNK> is more <UNK> these days in the real world they do kill people with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc this movie must have been developed by some garage <UNK> i think and the studios didn't know the difference they just wanted something to capitalize on the <UNK> <UNK> case in the news
<START> i was <UNK> a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at wal mart earlier in the week all three children actually got physically ill while watching it i'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate or something they all had picked up from school but really it could have been this film absolutely disgusting how any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me fortunately i turned off the film when i noticed the children were not <UNK> and acting strangely for any parents out there i strongly advise you to <UNK> from letting young children view this movie
<START> early film directed by d w griffith it features a <UNK> happy king arthur v johnson and his queen marion leonard but wait when the king leaves the scene his queen makes music with the <UNK> <UNK> henry b <UNK> when the king discovers the lovers he decides to <UNK> a horrific edgar allen poe type revenge it's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them although the actors are trying to look alternately <UNK> the lovers and quiet the <UNK> <UNK> the sets make the sealed room look very staged the performances are okay and the story is easy to follow br br the sealed room 9 2 <UNK> d w griffith arthur v johnson henry b <UNK> marion leonard
<START> this movie is not good the first one almost sucked but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching this one has nothing there's zero scare zero tension or suspense this isn't really a horror movie most of the kills don't show anything there's no gore to speak of this could almost be a tv except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence the acting is not very good either and don't get me started on the dialogue as for the surprise ending surprise there isn't one i suppose it could have been worse although i don't see how but then again it is less than 80 minutes long so i guess that's a good thing although it felt a lot longer apparently this is the cut version of the film i found it for a very cheap price but it still not worth it if you want the uncut more graphic version check out the anchor bay edition anyway this version of <UNK> camp ii unhappy <UNK> gets a big fat 1 10 from me p s if you watch this movie you will probably be a bored and unhappy <UNK> if you are a real fan you might want to pick up anchor <UNK> <UNK> camp with survival <UNK> three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and with special features
<START> ha without a doubt <UNK> the evil one here i don't know why but for some reason little kids in horror movies tend to come across as little butt <UNK> and since they're kids they won't die because they're annoying well except for asylum of terror but those are few and far between br br anyway onto the movie can't find this movie on dvd sure you can all you have to do is buy the chilling classics dvd pack not only do you get <UNK> on dvd for 15 but you also get <UNK> other movies what a bargain <UNK> ok i'm done advertising for these cheesy movies let's just say this movie ain't worth the 15 bucks on its own br br so we have a <UNK> scientist yeah cause all <UNK> scientists look as handsome as this guy playing peter he's trying to come up with a serum to stop <UNK> of the body the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project so he tries it on himself but because this is a horror movie he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly 3 4 of the movie br br to pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son and she was never married <UNK> but of course tommy is one of the most irritating characters no i take it back he is the most irritating character far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over <UNK> work and <UNK> over him while he's in the hospital that's right even as an old <UNK> you can still be the villain br br so we see peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes he's the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal however at the end he ends up de <UNK> into a lizard yeah i know don't ask the ending really doesn't make any sense and if you're hoping for any really good payoff you're not going to get it br br this isn't a horrible movie it's just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list you're not in for a <UNK> but you're also not in for a great movie just sit back relax and eat a lot of <UNK> food because this movie isn't going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soon br br <UNK> gets 4 plastic lizard heads out of 10
<START> such energy and <UNK> you just can't go wrong with busby <UNK> films and this certainly must be his best of course the choreography is wonderful but also the banter between cagney and blondell is so colorful and such a delight don't miss this one
<START> one of the <UNK> wedding movies you'll see <UNK> too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters the ethnic stereotypes are like a <UNK> <UNK> joke except they just <UNK> in the least bit funny here molly <UNK> well what else needs to be said give you a clue to the silliness she destroys a 10 000 wedding dress because it just won't be me makes it into this <UNK> with <UNK> and puts on a top hat and everyone smiles <UNK> at her <UNK> rather than <UNK> her neck its a <UNK> a cast too check out how heavy ally <UNK> is <UNK>
<START> an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly watch as gene sings acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations some purely <UNK> others pure corn one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before <UNK> in the rain he is <UNK> one of the all time <UNK> it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films especially in kelly's characters the only main difference being that one is based in paris the other in l a br br some have said that leslie <UNK> acting was less than pure perhaps <UNK> <UNK> who was originally intended for the role could have done better however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly oscar <UNK> short role in this film gave it just what it needed someone who doesn't look like gene kelly filling the role as the <UNK> isn't an easy task yet <UNK> did it with as much class as any other lead br br the song and dance routines are all perfection even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without seeing that there really wasn't much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you'd spent four hours with them ingenious br br i would have to rate this film up with <UNK> since it is very similar in story and song <UNK> would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performance br br full recommendation br br 8 10 stars
<START> there is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by joe <UNK> that goes something like this the man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right that is a highly <UNK> statement referring to self <UNK> and belief in an individual which in this movie stand true even after road <UNK> and family trouble stand in the way br br october sky is about a young man who believes in himself named homer <UNK> growing up in a strict traditional family in the 1950's homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a <UNK> all of his friends quentin roy and <UNK> all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's homer is not <UNK> about that future br br one night while everyone stares at the sky a russian space craft called <UNK> passes <UNK> this is something new for homer and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming from this point on his look at life will never be the same br br first he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an <UNK> <UNK> at what he says his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual his friends however think that this idea may have some potential after all quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing br br when the four friends start to test model rockets and blow a white <UNK> fence to <UNK> then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them they're forced to end their progresses br br the performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish all of the actors give performances as if this is the real <UNK> <UNK> here standing out in all of the glory laura dern as miss <UNK> this very well may be academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released br br the characters are also extremely well developed not only to the filmmakers give clear apparent reason why homer is interested in the subject but they also explain to the audience how they are <UNK> in their <UNK> of <UNK> we clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs especially the father who is bent over on <UNK> tradition br br the film unfortunately loses some of its momentum at mid point because of a silly recycled romantic sub plot involving <UNK> love interest and how his brother stole her from him this type of this is becoming so awfully common in high school movies not that this film is aimed at high <UNK> the actors stare at each other <UNK> like the are in a <UNK> i put up with it without complaining in <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> but i have had just about enough this br br but that is just a minor complaint with an authentic looking time period cinematography worth an oscar and clips of the real life homer and friends at the end whom all hit it big with their dreams especially homer this is the first great film of 1999 br br
<START> this is a typical low budget 1970's mess it's supposed to be a <UNK> about a crew hunting bigfoot through the pacific <UNK> every character is a stereotype from the native american to the cynical cowboy the acting and narration are a complete joke if you're hoping to see a lot of bigfoot footage keep hoping there won't be much and what there is you could do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder it would look better than this movie br br it's not that i don't like 1970's low <UNK> fare i do it's that this is such a mess of bad acting bad characters lousy story and no thrills that you just can't enjoy it it does not fit into the so bad it's good category nor can you get a laugh out of how bad it is without the help of <UNK> <UNK> it's mostly a lot of boring footage of the people camping <UNK> riding horses and watching wild life there is a bigfoot attack which is completely stupid supposedly our friend sasquatch is throwing rocks down on the <UNK> from above while they fire their <UNK> back at him by that point you are rooting heavily for bigfoot to drops some rocks on the <UNK> heads and stop the whole thing
<START> i'm feeling a little protective of this film because it was my introduction to the u n c l e <UNK> the year was 1972 and i t v ran all eight features in one <UNK> run followed by re runs of 'the <UNK> starring tony curtis and roger moore on saturday <UNK> 'the karate <UNK> was chosen to open the season it <UNK> with a cool action sequence as solo and <UNK> sports car got attacked by a <UNK> of <UNK> mini <UNK> i was a fan for life from that moment on br br after the main credits nice to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of <UNK> down action footage we go to the laboratory of dr simon true jim <UNK> <UNK> of a new formula to <UNK> gold from <UNK> <UNK> wife amanda joan crawford has been having an affair with <UNK> agent randolph herbert <UNK> a ruthless fellow indeed he kills both the doctor and his wife before hunting for the formula true has prepared for the event he has divided it into five segments each written on a photograph of himself and sent it to his five daughters all of whom are scattered throughout the world br br solo and <UNK> set out to get the formula first leading to a string of episodes in different locations and cameos from the likes of telly <UNK> as a tight <UNK> italian count terry thomas and <UNK> <UNK> one of dr <UNK> daughters sandy kim <UNK> <UNK> the u n c l e boys on their global quest br br having assembled the formula <UNK> turns up and makes them hand it over before <UNK> them off to their secret base at the north pole br br of all the u n c l e feature films this is the one i feel should have been produced specially for the cinema it hurts by being a television product albeit even one more slightly expensive than usual no location filming was done and the various segments come across as repetitive usually culminating in a <UNK> between u n c l e and <UNK> of the cast joan crawford is <UNK> hammy in her small role and <UNK> <UNK> badly miscast as a sugar daddy as a london bobby terry thomas is as delightful as ever and herbert <UNK> good as the chief villain kim <UNK> <UNK> though as <UNK> she should have been told to stay at home br br what is surprising about this is that it manages to be more amusing and entertaining than many official cinema releases of the time including <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and 'the <UNK> i'd love to know how solo and company escaped from <UNK> h q after <UNK> death though
<START> sorry but every time i see a film <UNK> a woman sucker punches a man and the man does nothing but <UNK> the film <UNK> all credibility so the new female <UNK> immediately <UNK> the plot before it even got off the ground no pun intended <UNK> <UNK> was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero type than the new age <UNK> <UNK> whose overacting will probably be <UNK> <UNK> as a compelling exciting must see ground breaking performance by the politically correct new speak of today's review copy <UNK> but in essence it is just a tired old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a <UNK> the biggest cliché on screens today i may give this series one more shot but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in as james hilton once <UNK> a story please just give me a story
<START> i really liked this movie of course the idea is pretty much out there the federal government <UNK> to have a tracking device <UNK> into the jaw of an small time thief to lure a more dangerous thief computer <UNK> out of hiding but alvin sanders the man who the <UNK> have <UNK> to be <UNK> with the device is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good <UNK> but passive or one dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem <UNK> worth a watch
<START> i've always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film although the acting may not be superb the fight scenes are fantastic i also enjoyed seeing <UNK> mills perform along side him in my opinion the norris brothers have <UNK> themselves to be fine <UNK> and this was yet another fine production i hope you take the time to view this movie
<START> after seeing <UNK> a <UNK> in <UNK> at the release party i thought it was a very enjoyable film br br i had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos eric roberts in particular were a scream i haven't heard word about actual release date although i've heard it's close br br the story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations the script is smooth and <UNK> the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh this film has won at least one award from each of the film festivals it's been in which is around 10 15 or so br br i highly recommend <UNK> a <UNK>
<START> what a horrible movie i cannot believe i wasted 90 mins of my life watching this re make please tell me why <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> starred in this film <UNK> <UNK> is great in e r and <UNK> <UNK> probably didn't know what he was doing i feel terrible for them the music background i must say did not fit at <UNK> with the story and it's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film i hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was could ever <UNK> such a great classic film this film should not have been made in the first place an advice to everyone who has seen it please tell me that i'm right because i couldn't possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy it br br <UNK> 10 out of 10
<START> i had to register for imdb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie is my cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this not the worst acting i've ever seen but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes it leaves a bit to be desired there wasn't a single <UNK> moment in the movie with the exception of when they were watching the movie <UNK> on the tv all around it seems like it could've been a good story rolling the credits and saying that <UNK> <UNK> was in it was a bit of a loss as i didn't recognize her right away and her scene was already over before i could've said <UNK> yeah there she <UNK> i'm so glad i saw this in a hotel and didn't pay for it as i'd be real <UNK> if i had <UNK> a <UNK> to see this i normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie but this one is an exception it's so bad that it's not even that amusing so good it's bad it's just plain bad
<START> young mr lincoln is a poetic beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most <UNK> figures in american history henry fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about it is perhaps the actors best performance watch how he <UNK> stops a <UNK> mob alice brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer woman most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom and there lies the only negative thing i can say about this movie most of the characters from judge to <UNK> are given so many <UNK> <UNK> lines that <UNK> from the serious trial that is on hand but i'm quite used to this because the humor is a ford trademark supporting parts by ward bond and donald meek are very good
<START> if you want to be cynical and <UNK> you could point out that the opening where a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> wounded on the 2nd of may 1945 is somewhat unlikely since german air <UNK> were as lively as <UNK> hitler on that day but this isn't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and i guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the <UNK> in fact you'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect beauty and soul of powell and <UNK> masterpiece the scenes of heaven are painfully <UNK> when viewed today again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made <UNK> <UNK> command lost <UNK> 000 men during the war the same number that america lost in <UNK> but during a shorter period and a far far smaller pool of active <UNK> there's no <UNK> in a fox hole and i doubt if you'd lost a relative during the conflict you'd view material <UNK> as being a sensible thing when <UNK> <UNK> young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly <UNK> at this scene as they remembered much missed <UNK> who didn't survive the war also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939 45 there seems to be very few people from germany passing through the <UNK> gates it's obvious nazis don't go to heaven br br the plot itself where dashing young pilot peter carter arguing for his life in front of a <UNK> court wouldn't have had much appeal to me if it wasn't for the subtext you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and <UNK> film that <UNK> the end of the british empire as it's replaced by american ambitions there's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of american history and culture one is the ethnic mix of america even today many <UNK> think that the usa is <UNK> composed of white <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when in fact only <UNK> of americans are white european the film rightly contains a scene where a <UNK> of different races confess i am an american as peter is judged by abraham <UNK> an <UNK> who was the first revolutionary killed by british forces in the american war of independence as for the special relationship between britain and america what special relationship powell and <UNK> know their history when it comes to britain and america they obviously know their future too br br so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present it's strange beautiful poignant and clever but most of all it's a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and <UNK> around a british soldier killed in iraq
<START> i haven't seen this movie in a while so i'm afraid i can't be very specific about details it did have some interesting points ralph bakshi's attempt at an animated adaptation of j r r <UNK> masterpiece was a very ambitious project so ambitious in fact that it went <UNK> at some point during the production therefore not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy with sort of a <UNK> of a hint of a sequel that was never made the film itself seems less than finished it seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed but whether or not it's intentional is hard to say the whole thing seems <UNK> made and <UNK> especially the <UNK> and the <UNK> another problem of course is the huge gaps in the plot bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie and he somehow hoped to <UNK> a book and a half in little more than two hours the new trilogy by peter jackson does it in about twice that time far too many important bits were left out and i don't refer only to tom <UNK> which i think was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie and of course the ending which is completely sudden and out of place i'm not even sure if bakshi originally intended to end the film there or if he even had any idea where he's going to end it br br the characters well most of them were okay the <UNK> don't look so bad except for the gay sam did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character if you're a <UNK> fanatic like me watch this movie though i'm not too sure about buying it what special features does the dvd version have anyway but know in advance that you're not going to watch a real <UNK> of the rings <UNK> but not much more than a historical curiosity which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the beatles carried on with their plan i actually think a psychedelic lotr could have been quite cool the idea was to cast george as <UNK> paul as <UNK> <UNK> as sam and john as <UNK> if you didn't read the book or didn't like it much or don't like animation films or don't want to see a half finished movie stay away
<START> excellent documentary ostensibly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two west coast retro <UNK> bands the dandy warhols and the brian <UNK> massacre what it actually turns out to be is a portrait of a borderline psychopath anton <UNK> and his tortured relationship with the rest of the world interestingly for a music documentary there is hardly any music what there is <UNK> of songs more often than not <UNK> by the performers is incidental rather than central although the protagonists are musicians the story is not about music but rather about a particularly american version of a british myth of a cartoon lifestyle ie one where nobody has to take responsibility for behaving like spoiled <UNK> on a full time basis <UNK> drugs violence grossly dysfunctional attitudes <UNK> on a truly epic scale all of this is <UNK> or positively encouraged because it <UNK> to some <UNK> held idea about what <UNK> is about as a film this is a first class documentary but it raises more questions than it answers for example why is <UNK> music so conservative for someone so wild and outrageous and he is wild and outrageous his music never seems to have progressed beyond the most obvious <UNK> of his 60s <UNK> the stones <UNK> etc for someone who claims to be able to play 80 <UNK> he has never bothered to learn to play any one of them beyond the most <UNK> level similarly the dandy warhols burning ambition is based on a vision of <UNK> which is astonishingly <UNK> in 1969 nothing wrong with <UNK> of course but surely there's more to musical life than <UNK> acting out a cartoon from the late 60s why don't they take some risks with their music in the way that their role models did because one suspects this is not about music music is just an <UNK> a prop or an excuse to lead completely dysfunctional and irresponsible lives but why in the dandy warhols case the answer is obvious to make lots of money and be famous big deal anton <UNK> case is more interesting he is obviously very talented but every time he is given an opportunity to reach a wider audience he <UNK> it usually in the most dramatic way possible he is terrified of success and at the same time deeply <UNK> anyone else who has it especially his former friends the dandy warhols fascinating movie highly recommended
<START> i feel like i've just watched a snuff film a beautifully acted taut engrossing and horrible thing a two hour <UNK> of <UNK> in the most basic and all <UNK> sense of the word sexual violence and torture rape <UNK> incest corruption live burial and abuse abuse abuse no redemption whatsoever and i was entertained i couldn't stop watching what does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so <UNK> that eventually real snuff films will be the norm and i'm neither <UNK> nor <UNK> i don't try to hide from the existence of darkness and i definitely have not led a <UNK> life but i am ashamed of myself and i'm sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subject matter <UNK> the way my own tribe does it doesn't have to be <UNK> but does it have to <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is not porn it was not meant to be porn and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn br br now that that issue was <UNK> out i can say i thoroughly recommend this film as it's issues are still widely available it's funny the acting is great and it raises serious curious questions br br i can't fully understand why this film was so <UNK> probably this is why i plan to never visit the us lena is the true <UNK> of the modern riot <UNK> movement confusion curiosity and wit are her main attributes she is occasionally angry but aren't we all
<START> oh brother the only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total bomb from me is because it's at least historically noteworthy as the first three stooges film when they weren't yet on their own and were still <UNK> with that painfully unfunny ted <UNK> but even as a longtime stooges fan i'd have to say that young moe larry and curly are badly used here as three zany assistant <UNK> to mr <UNK> <UNK> boss janitor they're not featured <UNK> through the movie and their silly on and off again <UNK> paint them more like zany <UNK> cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing br br most of this <UNK> deals with jack pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who <UNK> baron <UNK> here's a good example of the level of humor i object on what grounds coffee grounds his sidekick is none other than a young jimmy <UNK> but even the <UNK> himself is a bore
<START> this film is definitely a product of its times and seen in any other context it is an incredibly stupid movie heck even seen in its proper context it's pretty bad mostly this is due to a silly plot and very self indulgent direction by the famed italian director <UNK> antonioni in this case he tried to <UNK> a very artsy style film with an anti establishment hippie film and only succeeded in producing a bomb of <UNK> proportions br br the film begins with a rap session where a lot of with it students sit around saying such <UNK> as power to the people and complaining about the man considering most of these hippies have parents sending them to college it seemed a bit silly for these <UNK> kids to be complaining so <UNK> and shouting revolutionary <UNK> a bit later violence between the students and the establishment pigs breaks out and a cop is killed our hero mark may or may not have done it but he is forced to run to avoid <UNK> instead of heading to mexico or canada he does what only a total moron would do steals an airplane and flies it to the <UNK> desert there he meets a <UNK> chick and they then sit around <UNK> for hours then they have sex in one of the <UNK> sex scenes in cinema history as they <UNK> about in the dust suddenly other couples appear from no where and there is a huge orgy scene while you see a bit of skin <UNK> an r rating it's not as explicit as it could have been in fact it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just <UNK> the mind and of course when they are finished the many many other couples <UNK> into thin air br br oddly later the couple paint the plane with some help and it looks a lot like a peter max creation despite <UNK> the look of the plane the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary when the girl finds out she goes into a semi <UNK> state and the movie ends with her seemingly imagining the destruction of her own fascist pig parents and all the evil that they stand for such as hard work and responsibility instead of one simple explosion you see the same enormous house explode about 8 times then inexplicably you see <UNK> <UNK> and other things explode in slow motion while dumb it is rather cool to watch sort of like when david <UNK> blows things up or <UNK> things on his show br br aside from a dopey plot the film suffers from a strong need for a single likable character as well as extensive editing at least 15 minutes could easily be removed to speed things up a bit especially since there really isn't all that much plot or dialog the bottom line is that this is an incredibly dumb film and i was not surprised to see it listed in the fifty worst films book by harry <UNK> it's a well deserved addition to this <UNK> of crap for such a famed director to spend so much money to produce such a <UNK> film is a crime br br two final observations if you like laughing at silly hippie movies also try watching the trial of billy jack also in a case of art imitating life the lead mark <UNK> acted out his character in real life he died at age 27 in prison a few years after <UNK> in an act of revolution in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent person <UNK> hippies
<START> this is one of those movies that you happen across when you're channel surfing on a saturday afternoon and you get drawn into it and end up watching the whole thing i thought that it was well acted and it really made me feel for the characters though it's a bit slow moving focusing more on the relationships between bonnie and clyde and their family members it never got boring we don't really see too much of all the <UNK> that they were so legendary for and instead most of the <UNK> take place when they're <UNK> by the police i thought <UNK> <UNK> who played bonnie really did a good job with her character going from a nice country girl to a cold blooded killer is a challenging thing to portray and i enjoyed the subtlety she brought to the role br br overall an above average effort especially considering it was a made for tv movie
<START> then you must see this film to understand the reality having read the book ms duke is now an <UNK> for those <UNK> with <UNK> disorder <UNK> labeled manic depression br br it is hard to believe that in this day and age people still critique others with emotional problems or those who seek psychiatric help <UNK> and <UNK> thinking still exists and this is unfortunate br br in this film the audience sees the pain and suffering ms duke had been through especially as a child many of us may remember her from the teenage patty duke show she was a household name in america by age 15 br br you learn of her exploitation by the <UNK> well played by howard <UNK> as she was growing up in the 1950's the <UNK> was in full force however we see as she advances in her career yet the illness becomes worse she goes through <UNK> of substance abuse and <UNK> even marries someone whom she <UNK> the next week and she has several conflicts and <UNK> with her children and elderly mother all these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy and <UNK> br br a recent <UNK> released by <UNK> national alliance on mental illness recorded that a majority of us adults fail to recognize most of the classic <UNK> of <UNK> disorder it also was released that one in five <UNK> to the <UNK> believed that people could control their illness without <UNK> if they wanted to <UNK> magazine winter 2006 if you watch this film you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not pull herself up by her <UNK> and get well until she was educated about her disorder and received proper treatment thank you ms duke for being an <UNK> against ignorance and prejudice
<START> this is one of <UNK> best films that is him without opera buddies sammo hung and <UNK> <UNK> it has one of the best <UNK> in any action film and it <UNK> on in that way with jackie showing some high quality stunts the only <UNK> is that in the middle it gets a bit slow but it shows up for a frantic last 25 mins in the film and the end credits show what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film <UNK> happy
<START> and i have seen some bad ones br br i have nothing good to say about this movie the acting is poor by jennifer <UNK> as to be expected <UNK> hannah does an ok job but nothing close to being able to save this movie br br the biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak though based on a good premise that the writer <UNK> to the stupid heroine trick to create a contrived suspense when all <UNK> hannah would have to do is hide she runs out in front of her <UNK> the hospital scene is absurd without exposing too much of what passes for a plot i think it would be difficult for a bloody <UNK> woman to carry a pregnant from a hospital without being noticed lame very lame br br save yourself some time and pick out another flick
<START> i <UNK> a long time ago to never ever watch a movie that has anyone who ever was a regular cast member of saturday night live i didn't rent corky <UNK> but i was forced by my <UNK> good manners to watch it for half an hour then my good manners failed stupid not funny tedious not hilarious bad not good that in a nutshell is all i can say for this video
<START> after beau <UNK> everybody was waiting for claire denis to make a follow up masterpiece that never arrived now it has denis makes a quantum leap in this film an orgy of gorgeous cinematography <UNK> editing and <UNK> obscure narrative events that feels strange and acts even stranger there's a <UNK> plot derived partly from the jean luc nancy book of the same name about a mature man in need of a heart transplant and who seeks a <UNK> son he abandoned long ago but mostly it's an exploration of the idea of <UNK> personal and cultural it takes a couple of viewings to fully comprehend and has pacing problems close to the end but it's still more advanced and gripping than anything else i've seen this year miss it at your peril
<START> i've never been impressed by <UNK> anyway and final justice which i hadn't seen prior to its mst3k airing proves to be no exception it's not that the character is any less likeable than mitchell it's just that there's less that <UNK> call me <UNK> to dislike br br in fact one suspects that mitchell and final justice were all schemes of a revenge seeking agent of joe <UNK> trying to get the star killed by inducing a heart attack br br joe don must have found a new agent since he's now <UNK> to comic relief in james bond movies the problem is it's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there and his serious characters in his action movies like this one br br as for the plot <UNK> what plot they repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you'll think you were watching <UNK> day 2 presumably the fact they keep using the same scene of <UNK> getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort <UNK> yeah whatever br br on the plus side the <UNK> scenery is pretty gorgeous so that kicked it up to a 2 for me one suspects this flick set <UNK> <UNK> back a couple of decades though
<START> season after season the players or characters in this show appear to be people who you'd absolutely love to hate is this show <UNK> to be that or were they chosen for the same each episode <UNK> one single person specifically and he ends up getting killed off you enjoy seeing them get screwed although its totally wrong and sick you enjoy seeing them <UNK> others getting screwed themselves playing dirty getting it back escaping and finally getting kicked out by <UNK> the amount of tears also seems to be increasing by the season br br the <UNK> which attempt to compensate for past <UNK> and suffering are also heavily reduced in the newer seasons its like you get to meet <UNK> <UNK> lecture you about <UNK> like who freaking cares the characters are so <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> that you wonder if they're paid actors the only sane one gets to win br br watch with caution and maintain a conscience those are your fellow human beings in the firing line
<START> plague <UNK> femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in new orleans by director <UNK> kazan kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes br br a man entering the country <UNK> is killed after a card game it turns out he has a form of <UNK> plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an <UNK> all those who have had contact city and health officials <UNK> a plan of <UNK> rather than alert the community for fear the <UNK> will flee the city and spread the disease a detective and an <UNK> up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> styles br br streets raises a huge <UNK> question about the <UNK> right to know as the medical officer <UNK> for a media <UNK> thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community regardless of outcome you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film's protagonist br br richard widmark as dr clint reed and paul douglas as detective warren display short <UNK> and <UNK> respect for each other in their search for the killers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> wife has some good moments with widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of <UNK> more than comic relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim <UNK> of the new orleans <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by cinematographer joe <UNK> zero mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and <UNK> but at times sympathetic walter jack palance as the <UNK> <UNK> black death is simply outstanding with riveting intensity palance <UNK> every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well in addition he displays a <UNK> <UNK> that allows for a more suspenseful continuity especially in the film's powerful final <UNK> moments br br panic in the streets is probably <UNK> best non brando film it's tension filled <UNK> well paced and edited it's <UNK> on locale setting lends a sense of <UNK> reality that allows kazan the <UNK> to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with panic he succeeds with <UNK>
<START> if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it br br great camp
<START> my wife and i started to watch this movie with anticipation it looked warm and touching it started out well but soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while it got so bad that we turned it off the movie was poorly acted and honesty we couldn't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman you lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting <UNK> singing and cleaning i would have had her committed and of course like most movies and t v series made in hollywood we have to throw it a token gay character this movie was boring i was expecting more from diane keaton
<START> i was at first disgusted with director sun woo <UNK> because i had felt that he cheated me <UNK> had the potential to create a strong deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element i couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which <UNK> both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best  yet this film remained in my mind for days after i viewed it what stayed with me wasn't the story it wasn't the characters nor was it the apparent pornographic nature of the film but the transition that <UNK> demonstrated between y and j if you watch this film carefully you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship eager to jump into the unknown but not quite certain the next step as they continue to meet exploring new <UNK> of pleasure they continually jump between the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> initially explores the idea that j is the one that in control of the situation then <UNK> the <UNK> happens when j becomes obsessed with y it is a very small change and due to the graphic content of this film it can easily be missed but it is there it becomes apparently clear near the end when j cannot live with y as their <UNK> become less frequent and j attempts to become a part of normal society this was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes but alas it was the only element of this film worth viewing br br i will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic because there are human elements at the core of this film as underdeveloped as they are they are there it is a film about a <UNK> of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers what happens behind closed doors is never known  or so we should believe while the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit director <UNK> tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best <UNK> their <UNK> for each other's flesh this is fun at first but again <UNK> repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting this leads me to the biggest issue that i had with this film <UNK> had a great story with <UNK> but where he failed outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side was that he took scenes repeated them time and again without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters where was <UNK> going with this movie did he want the sex to tell the stories or did he believe the characters would he failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about y and j that we could care less how they resolve themselves the ending seems almost random at best as <UNK> attempts to create a final resolution for our two absolute <UNK> of this film i have to give <UNK> some credit for trying but not much he attempted to create some sub stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking but they just couldn't <UNK> well together <UNK> brother and <UNK> wife were those plot points but again due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element these stronger sub stories became un <UNK> and down right dull maybe it was just how i viewed this film but outside of the sexual scenes nothing else worked together we knew nothing about j and y and that is why <UNK> failed br br finally i would like to say that this film could have <UNK> from having a strong score or a <UNK> remote music genre element to it to bring us the viewers closer to the emotions being felt by j and y from what i can remember and i am trying to push this film far from my mind i don't remember any musical undertones <UNK> may have been a stronger film if <UNK> either stylized it with music or done something to <UNK> towards our character's beings while i understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have <UNK> a stronger desire for more technically this was a poor film obviously an independent film in nature it felt more like director <UNK> was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature i didn't see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above i just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough this was no larry clark production this was sub par and definitely needed some further technical <UNK> to develop it stronger than the final release br br overall i think i could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that i did enjoy but i felt this film was rushed repetitive and played too much towards the <UNK> instead of breaking them the obvious <UNK> of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are <UNK> to how the title of this film was conceived our characters were <UNK> our story was underdeveloped and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between y and j into something more symbolic than sex to me <UNK> was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic  and it failed miserably this was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make br br grade out of
<START> this film was a waste of time even rented on dvd if super <UNK> camera shots get any faster than this we might as well pay twenty bucks to get in the <UNK> get popcorn and watch the <UNK> spin jet li is so much better than this one can only hope that he won't be making deals anytime soon to make another cliche ridden film like the one br br if there's one film you should avoid this is the one
<START> how could i best express my feelings about this movie hideous a headache lack of coherent writing plain stupidity try all of the above for this travesty and that just for the direction br br story well i guess there is a story two dumb <UNK> look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course they are mistaken for a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sarcasm and are <UNK> by two <UNK> one thinks taking him out means a date and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of and of course the turtle <UNK> for the <UNK> turtle that they build with the casino <UNK> br br sounds likes all this could be funny guess again they try to make it funny but its not filming sequences aren't well done i've seen better filming in hong kong movies visuals are average for a late 80s film but the problem is that its a 2007 movie br br not worth my time to ever watch this again it still doesn't beat danny <UNK> out movie from the early 80s as the worst movie of all time but then again that film is in a class of its own f
<START> gregory <UNK> brilliant portrayal of douglas macarthur from the battle of <UNK> in the <UNK> at the start of the pacific war largely through to his <UNK> as un commander during the korean war offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities certainly the most controversial american general of the second world war and possibly ever macarthur is presented here as a man of massive <UNK> he claims that soldiers above all <UNK> for peace yet he obviously <UNK> in war he consistently <UNK> any political ambitions yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the president of the united states he shows great respect for other cultures particularly in the <UNK> and japan and yet is completely out of touch with his own country all these things are held in balance throughout this movie and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man although one is left with no doubt that macarthur sincerely and <UNK> loved his country and especially the army he devoted his life to br br <UNK> performance was as i said brilliant to the point actually of <UNK> virtually everyone else in the film which is perhaps appropriate given who he was portraying with the possible exception of ed <UNK> i though he offered a compelling look at harry truman and his attitude to macarthur sarcastic repeatedly referring to macarthur as his <UNK> angry frustrated and finally completely fed up with this general who simply won't respect his authority as president <UNK> <UNK> was also intriguing as <UNK> wife jean devoted to her husband whom she herself referred to as general although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one i very much enjoyed this movie although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about <UNK> early life i have always <UNK> at <UNK> reaction to <UNK> being elected president he'll make a fine president he was the best damn clerk i ever had which seems to sum up what macarthur thought the role of the president should be especially to his military <UNK> during wartime well worth watching 8 10
<START> jim carrey shines in this beautiful movie this is now one of my favorite movies i read all about the making and i thought it was incredible how the did it i can't wait till this comes out on dvd i saw this in theaters so many times i can't even count how times i've seen it
<START> probably new <UNK> worst movie ever made br br the jokes they are not funny used from other movies just plain corny the acting is bad even though there is a great cast br br the story is uninteresting boring has more cheese then pizza <UNK> cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting has been do 1 000 times before br br i watched this when it came on tv but was so boring could only stand 30 minutes of it br br this movie sucks br br do not watch it br br watch paint dry instead
<START> this is the last time i rent a video without checking in at the imdb reviews the <UNK> is directed by steven soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful <UNK> with ewan <UNK> and directed such trash as out of sight with the anti talented jennifer lopez <UNK> <UNK> is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film there is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story filming and just plain common sense this film does everything wrong what were they thinking
<START> i missed the beginning of this film which might account for why i disliked it so much on the other hand i've studied the fall of the roman republic for years so i know the story then again that might also be the reason why i disliked this film br br the film has more historical inaccuracies than extras though it's so inaccurate that i don't think they made an attempt for it to be correct in which case it can be forgiven the odd thing is that they sometimes go to great <UNK> to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing like throwing in <UNK> marriage to <UNK> and then pushing it aside two scenes later why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and <UNK> is never even seen and like calling <UNK> by his actual name marcus <UNK> in some scenes and by his strange english name mark <UNK> in other scenes br br though historical inaccuracies aside the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn't for the leading lady there isn't an ounce of dignity in her she's hysterical <UNK> and completely lacking control of herself instead of being a clever and composed queen <UNK> turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of <UNK> 95 of that comes from the poor acting but 5 is also from poor script writing far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script sometimes you weren't watching <UNK> and <UNK> you were watching immature versions of dawson and joey from <UNK> creek br br if you want to watch something about this period watch anything but this
<START> this movie is a should be classic it's not perfect certainly the pacing while perfect for the stage is in movie form slow as a <UNK> with <UNK> knees jean <UNK> is <UNK> to be too sweet and too gentle she fully shows enough acting talent skill and craft to convincingly play the clever passionate and confident joan but unfortunately the director missed the point of the character george bernard shaw is my favorite playwright in no other play has his dialog been more sharp nor the lines more musical however <UNK> this film requires that you look at it as a lawyer this movie is a case and the viewer is the judge that is how this picture is to be enjoyed 7 10
<START> who are these they the actors the filmmakers certainly couldn't be the audience this is among the most air <UNK> productions in existence it's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to <UNK> too much fun nobody is getting any actual work done and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch br br ritter <UNK> glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of <UNK> of the <UNK> bogdanovich the scenes with the <UNK> ms <UNK> are sweet but have an embarrassing look guys i'm dating the prom queen feel to them ben <UNK> sports his usual <UNK> got <UNK> grin in a <UNK> attempt to elevate the <UNK> plot which requires him to pursue audrey hepburn with all the interest of a <UNK> at an insomnia clinic in the meantime the budding <UNK> respective children <UNK> alert <UNK> daughters <UNK> cute and pick up some fairly disturbing <UNK> on <UNK> while <UNK> their parents ms hepburn drawing on her dignity manages to rise above the proceedings but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself ostensibly everybody looks great but so what it's a movie and we can expect that much if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of <UNK> br br oh and it has to be mentioned that <UNK> camp thoroughly <UNK> even apart from her singing which while competent is wholly unconvincing the country and western numbers are woefully <UNK> with the standards on the soundtrack surely this is not what gershwin who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived had in mind his stage musicals of the <UNK> may have been slight but at least they were long on charm they all laughed tries to coast on its good intentions but nobody least of all peter bogdanovich has the good sense to put on the <UNK> br br due in no small part to the tragic death of dorothy <UNK> this movie has a special place in the heart of mr bogdanovich he even bought it back from its producers then distributed it on his own and went <UNK> when it didn't prove popular his rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of hollywood stories so there's no joy in <UNK> the film there is real emotional investment in ms <UNK> scenes but laughed is a faint echo of the last picture show paper moon or what's up doc following daisy miller and at long last love it was a <UNK> <UNK> of the phase from which p b has never emerged br br all in all though the movie is harmless only a waste of rental i want to watch people having a good time i'll go to the park on a sunny day for <UNK> expressions of joy and love i'll stick to ernest lubitsch and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive at best special effects all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years severed ranks among the worst i've ever seen i'm never sure who the protagonists are all i know is that the killer uses a <UNK> <UNK> as seen in the dance floor murder scene all in all i don't really like the movie because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable the rest is a <UNK> of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion which i can't remember anyway
<START> i have 2 words for you sean bean he is the only worthwhile presence in this film but even so don't see this movie even though he is good as the main villain you don't want to waste your time br br i didn't care about the characters except the little boy and in fact i didn't really care if the star crossed lovers ended up together or died the movie did not make me care or believe that these people cared about each other at all i have read a lot of classic novels after seeing the movies and this movie made me not even want to read the book the story seems so boring but i may go ahead and read it to try to redeem the story in my head br br stay away from <UNK> <UNK> the actress who played <UNK> was also in sense and sensibility and she was much better in that watch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a e has great movies of novels like pride and prejudice or miniseries like the <UNK> saga check them out don't bother with <UNK> <UNK>
<START> shallow grave begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho i'm <UNK> toward rip off after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better almost to the point of being original bad acting and amateurish directing <UNK> down a fairly interesting little story but the film already surpasses many in the <UNK> comes down south to get killed by a bunch of <UNK> genre because it is actually shot in the south br br a group of college girls head to <UNK> <UNK> for summer vacation and are <UNK> in georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road note to <UNK> stay on the highway when you go to florida sue ellen lisa <UNK> has to pee so she heads into the woods when she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff tony march <UNK> his mistress merry <UNK> to death note to <UNK> do not wander off into the woods when in the south not because you might witness a murder but you may run across a marijuana plantation this is the point where the story not the movie actually comes close to being good br br while tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech his sheriff dean becomes a creepy <UNK> of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic a southern deputy as i've seen since <UNK> <UNK> deputy steve <UNK> in house of 1000 corpses br br a few scenes in the movie are worth the mention the girls stop at a <UNK> in south <UNK> and display their racism when a big black guy <UNK> them out sue ellen runs into a <UNK> to hide behind some <UNK> <UNK> and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the <UNK> with her br br and in the strangest scene sheriff dean makes like he's about to rape patty carol <UNK> and tells her to take off her clothes dean has turned the radio up to <UNK> out the noise of what he's about to do the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible his <UNK> is about how <UNK> is saved by the blood of jesus christ i feel sorry for this <UNK> flock <UNK> was in the old testament a few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven
<START> everyone knows about this <UNK> <UNK> event what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were they showed their life for about a year throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do and that gives me the chills cause i felt guilty to be <UNK> by their comments and i just thought cal was a sweet guy even though i knew what was gonna happen you know even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off of course i was i got to like them they were wicked maybe but i felt like they were really normal guys that they didn't really realize it but i knew they were br br that's imo the main force of this movie it makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we won't even notice it this movie as good as it was made me feel bad and that's why i can't go to sleep right now there's still this little feeling in my stomach <UNK>
<START> darius goes west is the touching story of a brave teen <UNK> with <UNK> muscular <UNK> and his personal quest to see the pacific ocean he receives help and <UNK> from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest br br the story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this <UNK> disease br br anyone who thinks young people are self centered and <UNK> will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head it is the power of the young people and their engagement with <UNK> plight that is very compelling in this documentary
<START> 1st watched 5 17 2002 3 out of 10 <UNK> <UNK> andre <UNK> fairly lame account of the titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much <UNK> event the <UNK> of the disaster is not bad but the drama around it is at some times silly badly acted and way too soap opera like the story is very much the same as the most recent oscar winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what james cameron was competing against <UNK> in his recreation
<START> although it has been 2 years i still remember the complete waste that <UNK> the entire plot of the movie unfortunately i came across this movie after my friends and i selected it while <UNK> through the new releases at blockbuster we decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable although it has been quite some time since i viewed the movie i still remember the lack of plot seriously there is no true plot and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie if you are in the video store and this film catches your eye walk on and find a better movie if you did end up seeing this movie i understand your pain
<START> yeah that about sums it up this movie was horrifying two minutes in i wanted to <UNK> my eyes out this has been praised as an innovative lds comedy but it's not even good for members of that church i don't think any human being should be so <UNK> as to watch a movie of this low quality br br first of all you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie it seems as if the horribly drab <UNK> trite plot was thrown together by two crazy <UNK> somehow <UNK> with the gift for coherent at least semi coherent thought then there's the acting which is dismal from everybody involved even the cameos fail to <UNK> anything up br br and let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue <UNK> hideous gags and a lot of mormon in jokes that anyone in their right mind lds or not should consider purely stupid this has to be one of the worst films i've ever seen
<START> <UNK> is one of those films that the expression slow as <UNK> must have been invented for too many endless and repetitive sequences how many times do we see robertson walking down the stairs slowly because he can hear someone playing the piano it is almost redeemed at the end by a surprising twist which unfortunately is followed by a second twist that succeeds only in leaving a bad taste in our mouths not a very enjoyable film
<START> sandra <UNK> is quite a character and certainly one of the funniest women on earth she began as a stand up <UNK> in the 1970s but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in <UNK> underrated masterpiece the king of comedy her film career never quite took off though she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures such as dallas doll 1994 or dinner rush 2000 but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself br br without you i'm nothing is undoubtedly her best effort it's an adaptation of her smash hit off broadway show which made her a superstar  and <UNK> best friend for about four years in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes sandra turns from nina <UNK> to diana ross talks about her childhood andy <UNK> and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt <UNK> prince or <UNK> director john <UNK> got sandra to do a 90 minute tour de force performance that's both sexy and uniquely funny if you are a <UNK> fan you can't miss out this film it's a tribute as well to her weird beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a <UNK> and it has influenced filmmakers in their work  <UNK> and the angry inch for instance would look a lot different if without you i'm nothing didn't exist
<START> comment like my comment is necessary we are talking about all time masterpiece for all seasons and all generations this is only type of movies that i still have patience to watch in this like in other disney's movies is some kind of magic all characters are in some way alive and real so it's easy to understand message even if you don't understand language like i didn't understood when i first watched movie because i was about six years old maybe my english is not so good but i learned what i know mostly from this kind of movies and this is one more great dimension of this kind of movies which in present time are rare but there is a one big shame in my country is now impossible to watch this or any other disney's movie we don't have <UNK> so our children are disabled to enjoy and learn from this kind of movies so we will watch this movie again once upon a dream or
<START> i'm a great admirer of <UNK> <UNK> but the screen writing of this movie just did not work for me the story jumps around oddly i've since learned that the film is missing a section and characters appear and disappear with irritating <UNK> some of the <UNK> are overly <UNK> e g why you're not a child anymore cut back to picture for a long slow beat you're a woman yes we got it the first time but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that never appear let's hear <UNK> and his blond <UNK> argument please the plot which involves incestuous desires <UNK> if not technically was disturbing to the point that it was hard to watch to the writer's credit this issue was treated as a problem and a may december match is not portrayed as the right and good <UNK> of some mary pickford films e g daddy long legs <UNK> gives a good performance as usual but i think he has been better directed in the past he <UNK> it a few times here imho i did enjoy the clown sequences and was very impressed at the stunts loretta young was charming though astonishingly young the film has its moments but so far it's my least favorite <UNK> picture
<START> i found the storyline in this movie to be very interesting best of all it left out the usual sex and violence they're getting old inserted in many movies the movie was well done in its flashbacks to days gone by in that area of the <UNK> the acting was also superb
<START> i have seen this movie many many times and i will never get tired of it it is a classic in every sense of the word the movie is hysterically funny and yet quite touching all at the same time for those of you who are not a fan of subtitles or of foreign film in general open your mind this is a great movie for the <UNK> because the story is so entertaining don't get me wrong it is 100 japanese and that is what makes it work but everyone will get something out of it even if it is just a great laugh at one of the main characters called mr <UNK> one of the funniest characters i have ever seen br br i can't even think of this movie without smiling i love it and i think most people will too
<START> what i expected a rather lame overly stereotypical portrayal of a sports mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly <UNK> support for his favorite sports team br br what i got an even handed story where both guy and gal end up <UNK> to themselves and each other that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share br br sounds sappy but with the <UNK> humor and terrific performances this story works barrymore is classic barrymore that perfect blend of sweet strong and adorable we expect that from her and she delivered br br but fallon is the nice surprise in this film he brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life like caring about kids and his girlfriend fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection he can be caring you just ran across the field for me and in the same breath be <UNK> <UNK> by his love for the red sox how did the grass feel kinda <UNK> at the same time <UNK> portrayal made the movie hopefully this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for fallon something beyond the over the top <UNK> humor typical of snl <UNK> i e will ferrell br br in short a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs female characters rose above that <UNK> and provided <UNK> spot on humorous lines most delivered with brilliant subtlety by fallon br br hey i saw this with my wife not a baseball fan and she loved it as much as i did it's neither a guy flick nor a chick flick it's a terrific make you laugh flick go see it
<START> stuck in a hotel in <UNK> i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning first <UNK> <UNK> brought a <UNK> to my throat then the sight of a tiger <UNK> which my grandfather my father and i have all <UNK> produced a slight <UNK> around the eyes and then <UNK> name hooked me completely i was <UNK> by this film <UNK> performance again the subject matter and yes what a debt we owe how various matters were addressed and dealt with the flying sequences my father flew <UNK> <UNK> too the story and as another <UNK> pointed out <UNK> <UNK> of high flight i won't spoil the film for anyone but separated from my wife by 4 000 odd miles as an ex army officer who was <UNK> in a couple of wars and as private pilot i admit to crying <UNK> a couple of times buy it rent it <UNK> it beg borrow or steal it but watch it br br ps did i spy a <UNK> <UNK> in yellow training colours on the ground looked like a twin engine aircraft with a twin <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i really like this show i can readily see how it achieved cult status it's original and thought provoking for some reason though i have never felt the kind of <UNK> from it that i could have it doesn't pack the kind of open door winter chill that was to be had from such an awesome premise each time i watch an episode i find myself <UNK> and pushing for it to answer some <UNK> <UNK> question br br before continuing let me <UNK> this by saying that what follows is my opinion and my opinion only different <UNK> for different folks br br i would have liked to have seen more scenes in american gothic that were shot at night there's too much daylight in this show and i think it had a tendency to <UNK> the suspense we're not afraid of the daylight after all we're concerned about what's in the shadows the devil isn't always in the details what we're not seeing is often the most frightening br br second and this is the one that's probably going to lead to <UNK> and <UNK> gary cole is a tremendously talented actor a character actor i've followed his career from the brady bunch films on which is why it pains me to say that he was probably miscast as lucas buck he's almost too <UNK> too likable to be <UNK> of evil even by biblical standards lucas buck is a <UNK> he's heroin he's <UNK> in a kitchen laboratory next to a <UNK> of drain o you keep going back even though you know the end will be madness and death he should be like the ultimate <UNK> shark he's a maker of book but also of <UNK> <UNK> sure you've got the money and before long you're also going to have broken fingers a severed hand a decapitated head and eventually a damned soul turning to buck is an act of desperation and whenever he's around there should be some immediate <UNK> <UNK> with interest <UNK> daily in the air br br it's all <UNK> all strings attached and by the time you realize that you'll also know that it's too late br br which leads me to three they showed buck a little too often he's in most of the scenes in fact which may have caused him to lose his edge the sheriff would be like the next door mythology he's the <UNK> <UNK> many would know <UNK> him but only an unfortunate few would really know him he'd be the stuff of flashbacks and <UNK> conversations and the perfect person to deliver this plot exposition would have been the deputy character that nick <UNK> portrayed br br four the show could be very self <UNK> to a fault some might say and this is <UNK> by the <UNK> of meet me at the fishing hole in the series pilot i think we've already established that what cassidy and <UNK> were shooting for was the anti andy taylor we probably didn't need the concept delivered to us via fed ex i gathered that within the first five minutes so for me the piano on the head was unnecessary br br these remarks are all about what for me would have made a good show great i also understand that the producers had their own unique style and that there were many hands in the soup in their <UNK> quest for <UNK> programming the network played a definite role in the demise of this series br br the least these jerk off suits could have done was to air the episodes in order br br get real br br either way it's a <UNK> loss to both genre fans and casual viewers alike
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> boring this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction <UNK> genie francis aka general <UNK> laura has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad there is ben kingsley an academy award winning actor in this stinker and a few others decent actors you have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie the music dramatically goes up and down like it's a major dramatic story even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow the effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated all of the actors speak in a <UNK> voice and have no realism to their dialogue i could go on and on on how this is a bad movie at least with battlefield earth it's so bad it's funny but this is just b o r i n g avoid unless you want to be <UNK> to sleep
<START> a broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent tom wood and <UNK> gross are forced to live in a self <UNK> facility run by an eccentric and <UNK> manager ron <UNK> whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is <UNK> the city the costume killer so named because after <UNK> his victims with <UNK> he dresses them in silly costumes they convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of <UNK> wannabe film makers john <UNK> joe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and discover that the art of movie making can be murder br br there is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows <UNK> is the studio wanted a lighter dark comedy our loss and the actors who all do fine jobs and deserve better as this has the <UNK> of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute br br if you're a ron <UNK> fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance his comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions he wasn't kidding when he said on the <UNK> movie commentary that he needed an <UNK> when he gets into jerry lewis mode he's just simply fun to watch in this one br br david dukes also shines in a two <UNK> but pivotal role
<START> paul was totally ripped off by someone at paramount who made dave it's the same story not as funny though br br paul related to me this morning about the scene were sammy davis sings the new national <UNK> of <UNK> he arrived in brazil after a long flight from vegas three planes car ride to the set etc he was beat he could hardly stand had to use a <UNK> he was staying in a trailer about the size of my bathroom br br he didn't know he could do it then he saw the crowd of <UNK> extras paid 7 bucks he came to life and they shot that scene for two hours he was magnificent then nearly <UNK> br br paul is a great guy though very liberal a real talent
<START> giant <UNK> <UNK> in japanese what was in that drink a terrible movie but laughable i love the invisible samurai <UNK> running around drink much beer before you see this movie
<START> i used to watch <UNK> every weekend when i was about 10 it was on right after bay city <UNK> i saw it come on to family channel one day and taped it for my then three year old daughter i'd forgotten all the things i'd loved as a child the magic <UNK> the zoom <UNK> <UNK> makeup br br this show is decidedly low tech the mayor is surely a <UNK> to mayor <UNK> and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying <UNK> eyes but kids love this stuff they would way way rather watch a guy work a <UNK> puppet than sit in front of high tech computer animation there is mild slapstick but no adult themes such as sex or people dying and kids accept <UNK> schemes kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought <UNK> was flying <UNK> the music is old but you really get used to it and my daughter really loved it she used to sing different is hard different is lonely in the car my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months and it's still one of her favourites br br i see that a new <UNK> 2000 is in the works i really hope they try to keep the old <UNK> and don't do anything like computer <UNK> characters etc i think a whole new generation would love <UNK>
<START> diary of sex addict is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual <UNK> probably a movie marketing <UNK> this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it bottom line diary would have us believe that our sex addict character has the dumbest wife in the world a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their <UNK> for him at his <UNK> and no job in spite of being a <UNK> at the best this flick could have been good drama at the worst cheap <UNK> diary isn't either and nowhere in between this one's for the <UNK> d
<START> the men can <UNK> over <UNK> if they like or her <UNK> she gave her name to a <UNK> terms for breasts in french but the ladies have an even <UNK> <UNK> in the divine gerard <UNK> who is not only beautiful but can act don't be <UNK> if your version has no subtitles because in this simple dashing story of love and war in which all is fair they are not needed all you need know is that at the beginning of the film <UNK> reads <UNK> palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king thereafter the story is quite plain from the <UNK> gestures and the running jumping and <UNK> br br on the minus side the <UNK> of the story and the heavy handed <UNK> of the tone become somewhat <UNK> and it is annoying that the french apparently consider themselves too superior to hollywood to bother even attempting the <UNK> of its exciting stunts and of course the non french <UNK> misses the occasional bit of <UNK> la la such as <UNK> girl i must tell you that my heart belongs to <UNK> <UNK> my dear what made you think i was interested in that <UNK>
<START> a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small <UNK> town leading to all kinds of complications cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky <UNK> hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can't escape the title town hopper does what he does best playing a psycho known as <UNK> from dallas the real hit man walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast the script by brothers john and rick <UNK> contains delicious twists and turns and john's direction creates a terrific neo noir atmosphere witty and very entertaining it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up
