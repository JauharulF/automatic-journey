<START> and that's why hard to rate br br from the adult point of view hmm student point of view i must say i fell nearly asleep here sure there is some laughing scene all the credit takes here eddie but that can't save the disney type of script and whole movie that's why br br 2 out of 10
<START> this movie is the best horror movie bar none i love how stanley just <UNK> the women into the lake i have been a fan of judd <UNK> work for many years and he blew me away its a blend of horror and drama and romance not so much comedy his evil yet charming look captured me right then and there that look in his eyes i will never forget there's something about him i cant describe
<START> the <UNK> show is good probably not in the same level than <UNK> teen <UNK> or space ghost coast to coast but definitely it have many brilliant moments basically it follows the life of <UNK> and <UNK> that have normal lives and go to the school living in a neighborhood on the style of the 50 <UNK> the humor and the animation of this show it's very much as <UNK> teen <UNK> and in one episode you could see <UNK> with bizarre situations and strange characters but it is good it have funny parts some of the songs are great others not very much but i like this show the funniest character is the father of <UNK> that is a human nobody knows why
<START> there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years the <UNK> road was one of them i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again my favorite parts were the fact that br br 1 jesus was blond br br 2 the last <UNK> was a huge meal br br 3 he liked playing with the children br br 4 his death was for all people and for all time br br the movie may not have been <UNK> sound or high quality acting but it touched my heart at that time besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture if it ever comes out on dvd i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons
<START> once in the life is a very good movie however it's not good for everybody due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations the movie manages to represent in an <UNK> believable way the life in nyc <UNK> where drug problems are important this depiction is in turn used as the <UNK> for a most thoughtful and suspenseful drama backed up by powerful dialogs however i had a hard time understanding some of them because english is not my mother tongue on video it's ok there is a little <UNK> sometimes but i think it fits quite well to the general <UNK> fishburne gave to the movie which gives matter for <UNK> more than just being a good style exercise notably in the time action management the characters even though not simple are easy to relate to and actors do a fine job at <UNK> them by the way i much enjoyed the soundtrack b <UNK> if you're not too <UNK> you should enjoy seeing that movie once twice three times i rated the movie 9 10
<START> i was very excited about this film when i first saw the previews normally i see a preview this good and i buy the film outright something told me to you know watch it first i'm glad i did <UNK> knightley ruined all future films for me with this role in the 2nd pirates movie when it came out i went to see it all i saw was domino harvey and i hated her more for it i think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for domino br br domino who who is domino harvey i still don't really know or care i don't know who she was in real life or who she was in this film i didn't care about her character and even <UNK> getting <UNK> naked didn't make it worth the movie the direction was definitely lacking the writing was trite and shallow the editing was horrible i don't mind the style so much as the poor <UNK> of it there's a place for it good examples of choppy mtv style colorful editing not sure if there's an official name would be fight club just off the top of my head even enemy of the state had a semi similar editing style at parts it was used <UNK> and wasn't used as a <UNK> i mean this is the same guy who directed top gun and <UNK> tide tony scott please give me my time back br br i understand there are many people who liked this movie i guess the idea that you'll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair <UNK> frankly i hate it
<START> i won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide it unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life as she <UNK> her investigation and the information <UNK> it leads <UNK> to a devastating conclusion the film is expertly paced and the acting especially by <UNK> sharon as <UNK> the blind woman is excellent israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully <UNK> with other foreign films though few have found a large audience in the u s
<START> revolt of the zombies 2 outta 5 stars no this is not a long lost <UNK> to the classic george a romero zombie flicks this is a low budget <UNK> from 1936 that probably seemed very cool to audiences of the time but seems awfully routine these days there is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a <UNK> of approaching zombie soldiers and a close up of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them the effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 i'm sure it had audiences <UNK> the story concerns the search for the secret of mind control ostensibly to create an <UNK> zombie army but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves the movie is barely an hour long but moves at a <UNK> pace so it seems feature length believe me there really isn't much to recommend it you may get some amusement from the <UNK> studio shots of the star <UNK> through a swamp the ending is interesting so i'd say the movie is worth seeing at least once more than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap 4 movies on 1 dvd <UNK> at wal mart for five bucks hey it's well worth the money
<START> this is a excellent start to the film career of mickey rooney his talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him the car and truck chase is exciting for the <UNK> era this start of the andy hardy series is an american treasure in my book spring <UNK> performance is excellent as usual please mr rooney or owners of the film rights take a chance and get this produced on dvd i think it would be a winner
<START> i would have given it a one instead of a two but i suppose it could have been worse i guess the acting isn't all that bad but the plot lacks anything even remotely close to interesting it is a terrible movie terrible complete waste of time i strongly suggest you do not watch this movie
<START> i was looking forward to seeing amanda <UNK> in another good role after recently renting the whole nine <UNK> easily worth the rental by the way but this wasn't it br br i remembered that the trailer for whipped was somewhat funny and the plot about three <UNK> new <UNK> twenty somethings all falling for and getting manipulated by the charming ms <UNK> was worth a shot so i convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me this review is my <UNK> br br in the first act we have the three lead <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> in a diner what should have been funny or at least telling comes out rather pathetic was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of this br br and while i don't mind movies that are <UNK> vulgar i kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the <UNK> talk <UNK> about sexual and <UNK> details they do this every week at the same diner you would think someone would complain oh wait i forgot two other <UNK> do notice in one scene but this is just a setup for a punchline everyone else in the diner is deaf br br the second act has the three <UNK> all falling for <UNK> and then developing brain <UNK> failing to ask each other or her about what's really happening between the four of them and i kept asking myself as the <UNK> keep acting like they have been what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date does she start out with brain <UNK> i kept hoping for <UNK> character the married buddy to become something more than simply the annoying <UNK> bag in this act his role is clearly to <UNK> advice on being married but why do they even bother to talk to him when they won't talk to each other and his advice <UNK> br br the third act <UNK> what plot there is but by this time i was looking at my watch my friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and i had to agree the scene that explains all was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list oh okay that's why brad had that happen and jonathan says this and br br what laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing even the <UNK> during the credits weren't very funny ultimately i was left with nothing except a desire to warn people away from this movie br br rating 3
<START> trying to cash in on the success of deal or no deal and 1 versus 100 comes this lame excuse for entertainment show me the money in which 12 sexy <UNK> <UNK> out in shiny red hooker <UNK> a contestant is given the beginning of a phrase such as which team lost with three choices a b or c each which <UNK> the phrase the contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices the host william shatner at his obnoxious <UNK> asks the contestant if he wants to lock into the answer and when the contestant says yes he picks a <UNK> to whom he yells show me the money she opens a <UNK> that has an amount and if his answer was right he adds that amount to his <UNK> if he was wrong the amount is <UNK> so <UNK> it is possible for a contestant on this dreary <UNK> to actually wind up <UNK> shatner money there is also a killer card and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile <UNK> but he has answered properly nothing happens if he's answered wrong the game goes into sudden death and has to answer another question if he gets that one wrong he leaves with nothing br br before going to commercials shatner yells let's dance and shatner the contestant and the 12 dancers shake <UNK> at the end of the show shatner asks the ladies for a last dance and they all shake it some more br br i give this show 6 episodes at the very most at which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door it could've been worse they could've somehow <UNK> cuba gooding jr to be the host although i bet he's a better dancer than <UNK> ' as they call him these days br br 7 <UNK> guess what i was wrong it lasted for only 5 episodes there is hope for the world
<START> an entertaining and <UNK> film non stop has drawn deserving comparisons with run lola run the film quickly develops into a chase sequence during which the viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and <UNK> sequences the chase serves not as as a fast paced climax but as a journey that makes up the majority of the film during the run we see the characters grow and <UNK> forget about their dreary lives about the macho roles they've bought into and eventually forgetting about why they started running in the first place much like fighting provided a clarity for the characters in fight club running provides this film's characters with a means to step away from the false values that we all allow society to create for us their running serves as way to truly taste life from an <UNK> perspective and all three find some level of clarity and joy in the process br br my appreciation and enjoyment only <UNK> slightly in the ending of the film where instead of learning from their experience the characters seem to <UNK> to acting out those false macho roles i thought they had escaped from through their journey br br still the only true problem with this film is that it wasn't distributed outside japan sooner
<START> as an ex teacher i must confess to cringing through many scenes <UNK> i continued to watch to the end i wonder why boredom perhaps br br the initial opening scenes struck me as incredibly <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the plot too although there were some good ideas the plight of a relief teacher for example were not concentrated enough in any one direction for 3 d development br br not one of mr <UNK> <UNK> moments as to young mr <UNK> does he speak that way in every movie br br plot and acting complaints aside the hair styles alone were a nostalgic if nauseating trip br br
<START> john ford is one of the most influential and best remembered american filmmakers in the history of film his name usually associated with the western film genre however john ford's arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the irish fight for independence in the early 1920s <UNK> the informer br br times are tough on many in ireland and the burnt out gypo nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation and the walls are closing in gypo is big but he is not the <UNK> <UNK> on the tree has a warm heart but a short <UNK> and never seems to really think things all the way through but he is not a criminal or a self centered pig walking the streets starving with no where to live the <UNK> gypo nolan finds the prime lady in his life katie <UNK> on the streets <UNK> herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the united states if he only had the 20 pounds to pay for it as luck would have it his friend frankie is back in town with a 20 pound price over his head and gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of <UNK> <UNK> gypo with the new 20 pounds of blood money earned finds this <UNK> night particularly <UNK> as guilt <UNK> all over him and the ira <UNK> all their resources to find <UNK> informer br br victor mclaglen portrays the fallen gypo nolan and definitely deserved the best actor oscar he was awarded for this film his <UNK> stupid and tender turns give the character dimension and mclaglen is only second to dudley moore's character arthur bach from the 1981 film arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk <UNK> <UNK> performance as katie <UNK> is also excellent but she and mclaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress preston foster is especially miscast as an ira head mainly because he is most obviously not irish and j m <UNK> borders on irritating throughout his role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film's only poor point br br often overshadowed by some of ford's better known westerns like the <UNK> or the man who shot liberty <UNK> the informer is easily one of john ford's best films if not his very best beginning what would be a long career of oscar nominations and wins for john ford the informer won four oscars including one for him for best director in 1936 ford and <UNK> use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story <UNK> walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring <UNK> of the street <UNK> each shadow constantly reminding him of his dark deed ford's command of this technique was amazing to watch if the informer was made 10 years later thus making the genre <UNK> it would probably be considered one of the best films noir of all time but that does not <UNK> it from being remembered as an excellent classic film
<START> spoilers i'm always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews it was awful the script and voice acting alone ruined it gabriel and grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game you almost pray for their deaths and worst of all there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in the beast within br br the lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing if you're expecting some kind of anne rice style vampire story forget it this <UNK> story has very little to do with vampires you won't even see any till about the very end and even then you won't get to fight them br br the story has radical and pretty much <UNK> views of christianity i'm amazed it got off the drawing board i'm not even christian and i found it offensive mostly the story centers around a search for the holy grail and buried treasure the kidnapping of a royal baby which should have been the focus really gets pushed aside there is no sense of urgency for gabriel to find the baby in fact he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time <UNK> br br the graphics are pretty bad the characters move about at a <UNK> pace even on the best of systems they are <UNK> and outdated and it's hard to go from the <UNK> of the beast within to this horrible game engine for blood of the sacred br br the relationship between gabriel and grace takes an awful turn too i really don't know why it was so horribly rushed but they do sleep together and it's not fun gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend <UNK> how he thinks of grace as more of a sister and he doesn't think she's the one for him and he seems really <UNK> out that they slept together but he's so unlikeable throughout the game that you almost don't even care at that point his dialogue was the worst in the game and he was constantly making stupid sexual <UNK> at anything female the entire game by the end of the game grace leaves him with what appears to be a dear john letter i guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players were br br i found the story to be annoying and boring i was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires and i was expecting to get to see and fight vampires maybe even have gabriel or grace turn into one but no instead the story focused on the author's <UNK> vision of christianity what a shame here they had the elements for a great adventure and instead we got this br br for me the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end we do get a few action style <UNK> at the end but it wasn't worth suffering through the entire game to get to them br br i can't really recommend this game i had gotten it back when it came out years ago and i hated the game engine so much that i <UNK> it for years i only recently <UNK> it off to see what i'd been missing and now i'm very sorry that i did my favorite characters were ruined i hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series and i hope they get it right next time it would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment
<START> to get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track not only the music but the way all sounds help to <UNK> the imagery how beautifully the opening scene leading to the <UNK> of gino <UNK> the theme of moral ambiguity note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside <UNK> marriage don't expect to find much here of the political life of italy in 1943 that's not what this is about on the other hand if you are <UNK> to the music of images and sounds you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo realism by the end of the film we there are moments antonioni like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places this is one of my favorite visconti films
<START> the film lacks style i mean original style everything looks copied including action first appearances in the movie songs dialog delivery etc etc yes there the goof ups were original like in the beginning a car is shown with number up number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number <UNK> that was one in many goof ups of the movie anything good in the movie yes for kareena fans if there are any kareena in bikini for akshay fans his dialogs and action stunts thats it nothing else so watch it on your own risk and don't blame the director or actors director is already insane and actors i pity them
<START> i first caught the movie on its first run on hbo in probably 1981 and being 15 years old i thought the movie was hilarious i remember not seeing the alfred e <UNK> depictions shown in the theatrical trailers when mad magazine <UNK> the movie and abruptly <UNK> half way through with apologies from <UNK> usual gang for <UNK> themselves to satire such a piece of crap i just assumed they were <UNK> fun at themselves which i'm sure they were but to seriously find them and ron <UNK> so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits i was quite surprised surely there are many worse movies to be associated with watching the movie on video now at age <UNK> with the mad references restored i still get a kick out of it and being a ron <UNK> fan hot rock where's <UNK> i think it's his crown jewel of performances say it <UNK>
<START> this movie looks like it was made for tv for years i waited for some movie to be made about <UNK> carter because i loved to see him box at the old <UNK> and to see this movie was very disappointing i have alot of respect for mr washington but he was awful and boring there is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song
<START> this was one of the best war movies i've seen because it focuses on the characters more then the actual war all of the cast do an excellent job and because most of them are relative <UNK> it makes everything seem more believable the camera footage is great is so was the pacing and editing this movie will actually get to you and causes the audience to care for the <UNK>
<START> when i learned of sir alec <UNK> death this was the first of his many films i thought of re seeing what a wonderful <UNK> commentary the film provides even after all these years and guinness helps to <UNK> the charm into every frame his eyes and face are as <UNK> as that white suit he wears both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites
<START> this film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2 3 of the journey sadly the film ends up being too <UNK> ' while i know some of the plot <UNK> are standard of <UNK> <UNK> films i got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a <UNK> and i lost interest br br the filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on we formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant <UNK> br br in the end there is too much going on and it <UNK> greatly from what could've been an enjoyable piece of <UNK> here's what's concerning joe <UNK> harrison ford at the end of the film br br 1 his real estate deals 2 his affair with a radio psychic 3 he's being <UNK> by internal affairs 4 the homicide investigation br br if you add in <UNK> concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father's death now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that i hardly have time to break my <UNK> and give a crap about what just happen the impressive <UNK> <UNK> cannot overcome the bad filmmaking br br as if a ridiculous chase sequence wasn't bad enough one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour wasn't bad enough joe <UNK> fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the <UNK> with a gun all these extra <UNK> plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught we already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot lines and eye candy of the chases have <UNK> us beyond all <UNK> br br while i could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story i won't this could've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its <UNK> and it turned into a redundant waste of time harrison ford and josh <UNK> actually did rather well and a small appearance by <UNK> knight is worth noting sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable br br while this will probably be better than the likes of the hulk and lara <UNK> ii that still doesn't make this film good i once heard that harrison ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money i'm not sure if that's true or not what is true is that to get great box office you don't need a great movie or a great actor this film has neither in its lead roles my advice to harrison ford would be to stick to indiana jones because at least you can still run
<START> i hated this movie it was absolutely horrible poor poor pitiful acting real real real stupid criminals that weren't even the least bit funny unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good all the <UNK> traps are weak pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck didn't go above 20 bucks a week this movie is absolutely lousy it's not worth even renting in fact don't even watch it on t v go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two i barely give this 1 star out of 10 just trust me when i say if you liked the first two and you are not a complete stupid person you will not like this movie do not watch this movie
<START> this should be required viewing for all young people this is documentary at its best from the haunting music and terrific narration by olivier to its <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the world at war is unforgettable and <UNK> for anyone who wants to know about <UNK> sorry experience at the <UNK> of the 20th century
<START> ira <UNK> deathtrap is one of those mystery films in the tradition of sleuth that would be very easy to spoil given any real examination of the plot of the film therefore i will be brief in saying it concerns a play one man who is a famous mystery playwright another man who is a promising writer the <UNK> wife who is much younger and <UNK> than the role should have been and one german psychic along for the ride director sidney lumet no stranger to film is quite good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs to <UNK> on the dialog is quick fresh and witty michael caine excels in roles like these christopher reeve is <UNK> and actually grows on you the more you see him act irene worth stands out as the funny psychic how about <UNK> cannon love how lumet <UNK> her <UNK> in those real tight fitting pants and had her wear possibly the <UNK> tops around but she is terribly miscast in this role a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive but why <UNK> with an obvious attempt to <UNK> its male viewers when nothing will change it now deathtrap is funny sophisticated witty and classy the mystery has some glaring flaws which do detract somewhat and i was not wholly satisfied with the ending but watching caine and reeve under <UNK> direction with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was enough to <UNK> my interest and keep it captive the entire length of the film
<START> i got to see this film at a preview and was <UNK> by it it's not the typical romantic comedy i can't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it the laughs aren't gags here they're observations laughs of recognition little shocks of oh my god i thought i was the only one who felt that way i won't give away the plot which is more than just guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend the whole family plays a part in the relationship here probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since while you were sleeping br br steve carell goes much deeper than he's gone before and for the first time i really liked him the cast is amazing a list of veteran theater actors whom i've loved in other roles but they blend to make a convincing family <UNK> <UNK> is lovely as the mother juliette <UNK> is <UNK> and hilarious who knew she was funny and even the <UNK> <UNK> cook gives a warm quiet touching performance the <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack is a wonderful addition and i'll buy the cd the second it's available br br don't miss this one
<START> the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been <UNK> by <UNK> have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud <UNK> in the video sequence and the actual <UNK> records on the day br br this would seem to <UNK> the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the <UNK> window br br i am waiting for bart <UNK> to now claim that the historical weather data has been <UNK> by <UNK> though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every <UNK> newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problem br br ah a response trying to <UNK> this movie by referring to <UNK> weather data i'd say is a charming but weak and <UNK> argument what about the rest of the footage and <UNK> in the movie a certain wise man once said something about <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with <UNK> evidence against the claim once made by u s government that the moon missions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say you'll see things a bit different than before br br first off weather data doesn't come from <UNK> it comes for met <UNK> around the world second the weather data <UNK> a major claim in the film third far from being packed with <UNK> evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly <UNK> <UNK> thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public <UNK> and the bits <UNK> edited out <UNK> his claims
<START> there is a lot to like here the actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly <UNK> likable family however for that reason the film does not ring true we see leo who apparently just learned of his hiv positive <UNK> essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself as well the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what leo his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him the young actor who plays <UNK> brother marcel is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast unfortunately the <UNK> could not decide <UNK> they wanted an insightful <UNK> on the effects of hiv on a <UNK> appealing family or what the <UNK> hiv is on the victim so it only hints at both while this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers
<START> ok i am not a professional movie critic but come on a true story br br they are <UNK> under another store to get underneath the bank and stumble across a tomb at tomb with a <UNK> which goes directly under the bank br br ok i'll play along br br but then they get into the bank and decide to go to sleep yeah i am sure with all the <UNK> <UNK> through them they are going to just fall asleep br br this blows the whole picture how lame br br glad i didn't have to pay to watch this one
<START> it takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so wretched <UNK> disgusting and repulsive but make it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the <UNK> of personal cinematic <UNK> <UNK> glover in all of his out there antics and <UNK> truly made something that is unique in a world that has become <UNK> <UNK> this film seems to <UNK> the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively <UNK> everyone br br right off the bat the film takes on a rather distant <UNK> if there really is a model at all and initially <UNK> it with the likes of shirley temple in front of a <UNK> and naked women <UNK> a man with cerebral <UNK> it's rather shocking stuff but if you had the opportunity for the q a sessions after the <UNK> it clearly opens up a bag of worms that leaves you wondering whether this is art or just the lowest common <UNK> in either <UNK> you sense the <UNK> that this film will ultimately cause it will never be accepted not even by the supposed <UNK> of the world who <UNK> speak about the human condition you may not like it but it is certainly something worth watching
<START> this movie was based on actual fact i sincerely hope not br br we get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at 2 guys who only got <UNK> <UNK> that's a great idea aim for the armor excuse me but how about those big fat <UNK> heads or their legs for crying out loud or were there invisible tanks protecting them were they from <UNK> did i miss something here br br this movie started out decent enough but after 20 minutes of shoot out it really takes a turn to <UNK> br br and that documentary style didn't work for me either but thats just something one finds likable or not br br highly unbelievable stuff which makes it hard to see it through <UNK> the end br br 3 10 for the fine editing
<START> the zombie chronicles br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 <UNK> view 3 d br br sound format <UNK> br br whilst searching for a literal ghost town in the middle of nowhere a young reporter emmy smith picks up a <UNK> <UNK> joseph <UNK> who tells her two stories involving flesh eating zombies <UNK> to haunt the area br br an absolute waste of time <UNK> from the outset by <UNK> painfully amateurish performance in a key role worse still the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by brad sykes previously responsible for the likes of camp blood 1999 this isn't a <UNK> movie in the sense that ed <UNK> movies are <UNK> he at least believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts despite a lack of talent <UNK> home made movies are in fact <UNK> boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue and most viewers will feel <UNK> angry and cheated by such unimaginative badly conceived junk the 3 d format is utterly wasted here
<START> while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic i have to admit that i don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do as a consequence of that i haven't seen many of the exorcist rip offs and if <UNK> is anything to go by i'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it in fairness to the other exorcist rip offs this is often considered one of the worst and so maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start it's not hard to guess what the plot will be basically it's the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit which happens to be the spirit of her dead father the village priest is then called in to perform the <UNK> like many spanish horror films this one stars paul naschy who is pretty much the best thing about the film <UNK> was directed by juan <UNK> who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo 'the killer wore <UNK> i haven't seen any of his other films but on the basis of these two i believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points there's not a lot of good things i can say about the film itself it mostly just <UNK> along and the <UNK> scene isn't worth waiting for i certainly don't recommend it
<START> possible spoilers br br although there was some good acting particularly chloe <UNK> and <UNK> mitchell in the comedy half this simply was not an engaging film the <UNK> between the comedy part and the tragedy part were awkward or sometimes not obvious this viewer was initially confused by the fact that the supporting cast <UNK> in the two <UNK> i thought with the way things were laid out in the opening scene that the people surrounding melinda would be the same people just <UNK> differently more of a he said she said premise however what we have is two totally different stories and two totally different women both of whom happen to be played by <UNK> mitchell br br the two <UNK> in the opening scene the comedian and the <UNK> supposedly take the same premise and go from there but the two stories are only <UNK> related they do little to support the topic of discussion which is that almost anything can be looked at as either comedy or tragedy nice cast but a disappointing film
<START> a few days ago i watched a documentary called the fifty worst movies of all time and this is where i first heard of the incredible melting man being a lover of <UNK> films i am making it a point to try to find some of the films from the documentary not just including the incredible melting man in fact melting man is the first bad film i have seen since then and i must say i am rather disappointed while it truly is a bad film it comes nowhere near close enough to make inclusion on this list br br now before seeing the documentary i have enjoyed bad films ever since i read the book the fifty worst movies of all time by harry <UNK> despite the same title the book came out long long before the documentary and the makers of the documentary never credited <UNK> with the concept from the <UNK> book i have seen about 35 of the 50 films but have come to an <UNK> the rest of the films just aren't available on vhs or dvd so i thought i'd try the film by the same name br br the reason i was most disappointed with the incredible melting man was that there were a few good elements to the film first the melting guy special effects were generally really cool and disgusting it's obvious that a professional the famous rich baker was involved in making this look realistic however i should also point out that there were also more than a few cheap and cheesy effects as well such as the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran around after his left arm was cut off you could see it cleverly hidden under his clothes as for the story it's just stupid a group of <UNK> miraculously <UNK> the rings of <UNK> without being crushed then they comment about how beautiful the sun is as we see closeups of it this is odd since <UNK> is so far from it it should not look this way it should be a large <UNK> regardless immediately the scene changes and we're told that one of the surviving <UNK> is in a hospital what happened between the last scene and this one yep it's anyone's guess well soon after the survivor escapes and <UNK> in a murderous rampage as his entire body <UNK> br br now considering they have a psycho running about who looks like a melting <UNK> you'd think the government would pull out all stops to find and stop him right wrong a general <UNK> one lone doctor to find him no army no police just some dopey doctor even after bodies begin <UNK> up at no point do the doctor or general do anything to <UNK> a meaningful search or get <UNK> br br now given the stupidity of the film you also wouldn't be surprised to find the following br br when the melting dude is running around near the doctor's house the doctor gives his wife a powerful <UNK> and leaves her in the house br br when a cute old couple is driving late at night they naturally stop in an <UNK> to pick fruit and are killed br br when a lady sees melting dude she <UNK> the door to protect herself this would be smart if she didn't have the back door of the house next to her instead of just leaving the house and escaping she just waits br br when a photographer and his model are taking <UNK> the guy grabs his assistant and <UNK> off her top why well to give the audience a cheap thrill and make it a rated r flick br br when the melting dude is finally located and the sheriff has a clear shot at him the doctor stops him even though by now the monster had killed about a half dozen people br br so as you can see the film <UNK> with stupid plot elements it is a very bad film but given the occasionally good special effects it just wasn't a horrible film like i'd hoped sure it's good for a laugh but no where near plan 9 from outer space in badness and never should have been included on anyone's worst film list
<START> serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all <UNK> through the power of the mind instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains the mad doc creates some zombies out of <UNK> and has some problems there is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you <UNK> with the characters the mad doctor's nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy the results are not good this is a class c film with ok acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors there isn't much zombie action in this one and the effects while adequate are nothing special you can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes watch out for some nudity and bad language
<START> i went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it it lacked authenticity and believability some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad <UNK> perhaps this is typical of woody allen excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard it wasn't even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself the acting reminded me of <UNK> acting where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes they are corny but if you don't take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the actors not the characters if you're looking for a random movie and you like woody allen i'd definitely recommend it
<START> this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i feel greatly touched by the theme the movie <UNK> to convey one sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that history repeats itself life is what it is shown in the movie when people are young they seem not to understand their parents their own <UNK> people have every excuse for not sharing the <UNK> time with their children until too late people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just <UNK> to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves so that when life has to end some day people should not feel sorry or <UNK> since they have kept their words and there is always hope a new life the actors and actresses are fantastic they have understood the director's intention perfectly the movie's charm lies in to me the effect of bringing a <UNK> and splendid <UNK> of cheers and tears to the audience
<START> what the hell of a d movie was that bad acting bad special effects and the worst dialogues storyline i ever came across the only cool thing here was <UNK> who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop however the rest of the film is awful and boring it's not even so bad you can laugh about it just plain crap and whoever <UNK> this to the evil dead series might as well compare tomb <UNK> to indiana jones well ok at least there was angelina jolie in tomb <UNK> 1 out of 10
<START> fear of a black hat is everything the much weaker <UNK> 4 should have been rusty <UNK> satirical eye is ruthless as he <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> every aspect of hip hop <UNK> and culture does <UNK> resemble spinal tap yes a bit is it derivative of spinal tap no not really the aim is more focused the satire is better focused and to be honest it's funnier
<START> at last a decent british comedy that isn't <UNK> around some <UNK> bank robbers or <UNK> off from a tv series john <UNK> film is a <UNK> tale of discovery dressed in biker gear the three protagonists are gentle fools with a <UNK> for failure and each at a turning point in their lives giving a sensitive emotional trio of sub plots to <UNK> the <UNK> comedy together the chemistry between the three <UNK> is <UNK> and makes for a touching <UNK> with hilarious dialogue and some classic comedic moments it feels part <UNK> and i part american werewolf in london and part <UNK> but only because of the bike gangs and phil daniels in fact phil <UNK> lovable rogue reminds you of danny the dealer in <UNK> and i with his <UNK> approach and scientific commitment to drugs this is a great film particularly for those who've <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> in the past who will relate to many moments in the film a personal favourite is the brilliant scene in the <UNK> corner shop buying <UNK> while <UNK> on <UNK> this gentle comedy will warm the <UNK> of your heart and have you laughing out loud and you don't have to ride <UNK> or even like them to enjoy it but it'll add to it if you do brilliant
<START> i love bad movies not only because they often are as entertaining as <UNK> <UNK> films like pirates of the <UNK> series and other hollywood pathos but they often are far better than those films and that's the reason why i love italian rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s and that's the reason why i especially love this movie the <UNK> the company br br director <UNK> <UNK> has made some actually very good movies like house on the edge of the park and also his atlantis <UNK> and live like a cop die like a man are enjoyable action movies but this is really bad the <UNK> is so idiotic movie peter and david paul as the barbarian brothers <UNK> and gore are very funny because of their lack of charisma and acting skills but if they can't act they yell and scream every time they do something important in one scene people try to hang the barbarian brothers and they escape very extraordinary way br br bad acting bad special effects very stupid story bad direction actually everything is bad in this movie i can't describe how much i laughed when i watched this first time the <UNK> the company is camp classic everybody should see once if you thought plan 9 from outer space is fun camp this will be a real killer
<START> i loved anchorman the legend of ron <UNK> and hoped this would be just as funny but alas it wasn't some bits are excellent though i thought the sports guy <UNK> kind <UNK> his love for ron <UNK> in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious everyone is ignoring him and he just gets <UNK> and <UNK> and finally kisses <UNK> which doesn't get acknowledged either but on the whole the story doesn't <UNK> it's a noble attempt however to salvage the <UNK> bits from the first movie including an entire plot about some pretty <UNK> would be domestic terrorists called the alarm clock <UNK> <UNK> of saturday night live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines but basically this <UNK> plot line has good reason to be <UNK> in the first movie the extras on this <UNK> are pretty good with the best two being the filmed <UNK> featuring lots of <UNK> comedy and the faux commentary with will ferrell and an <UNK> producer who ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way shape or form turns out he's just a guy who walked in the side door of the recording studio and <UNK> to be a producer it's some pretty funny stuff though and goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes
<START> i was never so bored in my life hours of pretentious self obsessed heroin addicted basket cases <UNK> around whining about their problems it's like watching <UNK> <UNK> even the sex scenes will <UNK> a serious case of <UNK> if you have insomnia rent this
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two <UNK> the impossible planet and was slightly worried that the second part wouldn't hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two <UNK> of the past 2 who series but thankfully my fears were <UNK> as i found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the <UNK> whom have become the devil's <UNK> there is also a bit of <UNK> on the doctor's part in the episode that i quite enjoyed needless to say it was a good solid doctor who story might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers though br br my grade b
<START> this overrated short lived series a <UNK> two seasons is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar i am not quite sure what they mean by ground breaking and original when they <UNK> all over lynch and his silly little tv <UNK> what exactly is their <UNK> of what is original sure compared to the bill <UNK> show or hill street blues it's original definitely next to law order <UNK> <UNK> originality left and right br br fans of <UNK> often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers weren't smart enough open enough for the show's supposed weirdness its alleged wild <UNK> or whatever as a fan of weirdness myself i have to correct that <UNK> there is nothing too off the wall about <UNK> it is a merely watchable rather silly <UNK> that goes around in circles spinning <UNK> in every corner but or because of it ultimately going nowhere the supposed weirdness is always forced the characters don't behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an idiotic way half the time there's a difference br br whenever i watch the weird dream sequence in living in oblivion in which the dwarf <UNK> the director <UNK> for <UNK> to the tired old let's use a midget in a dream scene cliché i think of lynch you want weird <UNK> is weird in fact it's beyond weird it's basically abstract you want a unique tv show watch the prisoner you want a strange looking cast <UNK> and <UNK> films offer that <UNK> looks like an overly <UNK> tv crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models the cast gives <UNK> a plastic look <UNK> <UNK> en <UNK> br br in fact one of the producers of <UNK> said that lynch was looking for unique faces for the series unique faces like lara flynn <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like those <UNK> faced <UNK> straight out of men's <UNK> or gay magazines don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast especially with <UNK> like <UNK> the way madonna would look if she were 1000 times <UNK> but then don't go around saying you're making a weird show with weird looking people and i have never understood lynch's misguided fascination with kyle <UNK> i should get a <UNK> for bothering to spell his name right he is not unlikable but lacks charisma seeming a little too bland and polished his character's laughable <UNK> were not at all interesting merely one of lynch's many attempts to force the weirdness trying hard to live up to his reputation him having completely lost his edge but that time everything lynch made post elephant man was very much sub par compared to his first two movies what followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on lynch's relatively small but <UNK> fan base to keep him in the public eye by <UNK> meanings into his badly put together stories that don't hold any water on closer <UNK> in other words lynch is every intellectual <UNK> darling br br so laura <UNK> was killed by her dad he was obsessed by the devil or some such nonsense that's the best this great mind could come up with you've got b movie horror films that end with more originality br br lynch is neither bright nor hard working enough to come up with a terrific story br br go to http <UNK> com <UNK> and check out my tv cinema 150 worst cases of <UNK> list
<START> with all thats going on in the world sometimes we need an escape curly sue is just that not a complicated plot or deep meaning however it is not devoid of substance there is more than furious action or heart <UNK> dramas there are the charming little shows you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy with your date try it you may like it more than you think the little girl is really smart and cute the dad and the girl go thru some slapstick routines when a jealous boyfriend steps in trouble <UNK> for curly and the life <UNK> known may be torn <UNK> fred thompson and kelly lynch play good roles as the upper <UNK> and alison porter and james belushi are a interesting fable like duo portraying street wise homeless <UNK> their worlds <UNK> and comedy ensues
<START> <UNK> some people take life far too seriously watch this film for what it is sit back relax and have a giggle the film does not take itself seriously so neither should we if you like james belushi you will like this film if he is not your cup of tea give it a miss br br i like james belushi so i liked this film so simple isn't it
<START> after seeing this film i feel like i know just a little bit more about the usa david lynch is <UNK> with shock value and weird for weirdness sake and indeed these elements are not missing from the straight story however it is in a light that i have not witnessed from lynch before we begin with a simple family living a quiet life but end up with an array of <UNK> interesting characters with depth in their lives that cannot be apparent from their introduction especially moving was the bar scene with two wwii veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how it still affected their current lives and emotions if you are looking for wild at heart or <UNK> don't look here but if you are looking for real people with real stories this is the film for you
<START> i saw this as a child in the late eighties and i must say galaxy express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time if you've never understood the appeal of anime discovering this film may be your golden ticket to <UNK> town br br the story is as delicate and poetic as <UNK> scott's blade runner the cell animation while somewhat traditional possesses a vivid style that <UNK> portrays <UNK> <UNK> great talent for character design and visual storytelling br br this is one of those unique children's films like star wars the dark crystal and the wizard of oz that completely <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own terms br br i highly recommend this film
<START> this wasn't funny in 1972 it's not funny now br br unlike a lot of other people i'm not bashing the film because it is incredibly sexist i quote enjoyed that bit or rather i enjoyed the reaction it <UNK> in annoying pc people i'm bashing it because it is poorly written and acted br br the only really memorable character is <UNK> which british people 25 years old will <UNK> immediately since he was a favourite with <UNK> for a long time br br avoid br br
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this movie but it is nothing new br br everyone here is <UNK> it with other war movies this movie has been <UNK> its not a war movie any more than one flew over the <UNK> nest is a asylum movie or cool hand luke is a prison movie this is a movie about <UNK> <UNK> self confidence and the costs of that personality type br br the plot is the same as one flew over the <UNK> nest and cool hand luke its in good company and it holds its own its these movies it should be held up against and compared not apocalypse now or platoon br br eric
<START> delightful minor film <UNK> comedy and detective romance and drama genres as <UNK> as lt kenny williams melvyn douglas <UNK> his devotion to his girl <UNK> <UNK> joan blondell and his duty to the force as an ace detective br br this <UNK> <UNK> may not appeal to all viewers today but in its day it had something to offer every member of the movie going family and the resolution to the rather tired feeling versus duty plot is original and refreshing and well worth the wait br br the amazing mr williams contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history and its bright comic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> melvyn douglas delivers some of the best lines i'd walk down main street in a turkish <UNK> before i'd let any woman control my life and the <UNK> joan blondell lets her <UNK> fly with typical <UNK> good grief you look like my aunt <UNK> ' br br the crime solving here is standard fare although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life br br from today's <UNK> point the amazing mr williams is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined <UNK> all the more <UNK> for its seemingly rigid boundaries while much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the <UNK> at times it is both subtle and <UNK> playing out not only in some of the <UNK> details of the film but in the battle of genres that reaches its <UNK> in the final scene
<START> a story of amazing <UNK> kills the psychic over and over again the characters and plot are completely uninteresting as is <UNK> mad camera work which is usually a redeeming factor in his films and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found it's padded out to an <UNK> degree by the end you won't be <UNK> with excitement but stricken with boredom and like me maybe an <UNK> urge to fall asleep jennifer <UNK> performance deserves <UNK> in a better movie fulci <UNK> beware there's just not much going on in the psychic br br 3 10
<START> i decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for oscar this year i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie but ended up bored and disappointed first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in shaky hands camera mode is really annoying br br i guess the main reason for making such a movie and <UNK> it for oscar is this br br american military machine people who makes money on war <UNK> need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by <UNK> up something sort of patriotic br br why these heroic efforts of director and the main character to inspire the audience with an idea of loving war like a drug oh please come on what a bore br br watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall
<START> ok when i saw the previews for this movie i thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group i was with now living in america especially during this election i see some very <UNK> things but i have to say these previews were towards the top of list i don't see how so many people could be scared by this movie i only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one the whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me as for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of i thought they were comical at best oh and the <UNK> <UNK> where did that come from and why the worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird <UNK> how does that scare someone i can make that noise easily now don't get me wrong i have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but i didn't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad
<START> <UNK> the host due to <UNK> in the han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage the youngest member of the park family is <UNK> by the beast and it is up to the rest of her family to find her before she becomes the <UNK> latest meal br br firstly i love monster movies mutated bears over sized <UNK> packs of <UNK> <UNK> dragons the whole lot creature features are my favourite kind of horror film so i really wanted to like the host but it wasn't to be br br there were three major problems with it br br the first can be seen with a quick look at it's imdb page br br genre action comedy drama fantasy horror sci fi thriller br br too many damned genres it took itself too seriously to be a comedy and yet was too light hearted to have any real message though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement anti <UNK> anti american or anti government the drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing <UNK> mash with all the other styles br br secondly after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film the central family wander about looking for one of their own while the <UNK> of korea and america apparently do nothing and that's it they just wander about occasionally hitting one another presumably for a bit of comedy relief this lack of action made my attention wander and apparently it did the same for the director as whole plot threads go <UNK> a mystery plague invented by the evil americans is completely forgotten about and is never resolved br br and lastly the film is clumsily political it paints the americans as being stupid and evil but gives us no american characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain the opening scene has the most obvious stupid american vs wise korean moment with a korean <UNK> assistant asking his boss the <UNK> not to pour <UNK> into the han river the american <UNK> all but <UNK> <UNK> as he orders the assistant to carry on as well as being racist it's lazy film making and there is no excuse for that br br on the plus side the monster is good kind of a mix of the <UNK> and deep rising some of the movement effects are quite cool and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun there are also some nice shots in the film some of which remind me strangely of the way <UNK> was filmed <UNK> cameras out of focus shots etc there is also a nice scene at the end where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food <UNK> it's night time and snow is falling the street <UNK> is giving out a cold light but the food <UNK> has a warm glow coming from it br br overall i was really disappointed by this film i'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick and instead i get some pseudo political horror comedy <UNK> looking at the comments on imdb i can't help but think that if this had been a us production it would have been <UNK> just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good there have been some great movies out of korea in recent years the vengeance trilogy and <UNK> for example but this certainly isn't one of them br br for once i'm in favour of a remake <UNK> up the directing improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film as it is it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time
<START> i've read countless of <UNK> about this game being so similar to max payne when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird <UNK> like game with a desire to rip off the max payne style not just bullet time so when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is and how different from max payne yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game style this game is non stop action a mix between a <UNK> up and a <UNK> up so much fun as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of <UNK> is not near to the greatness of max payne the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same but if you want a bit more of that bullet time you should definitely own this game
<START> there's not a drop of sunshine in the sunshine boys which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simon's sole ironic moment simon who adapted the script from his play which goes uncredited <UNK> old age with irrational behavior and worse clumsy <UNK> mean spirited irrational behavior walter matthau is <UNK> on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into <UNK> with former comedy partner george burns for a television special it's said they were a team for <UNK> years which begs the question how long did vaudeville last anyway burns who won a supporting oscar has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in after which time matthau has already <UNK> the material to hell and back the <UNK> the movie gets the less tolerable and watchable it is director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of neil simon's screenplays here ross sets up gags like a <UNK> amateur <UNK> away at <UNK> routines which fail to pay off such as semi incoherent matthau showing up at a <UNK> garage to audition for a tv commercial at this point matthau was still too young for this role and he over <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character to nuance his <UNK> to give the sunshine boys some <UNK> yet walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf the picture looks terribly drab and <UNK> along at a <UNK> pace one loses hope for it early on 1 2 from
<START> there's a good reason that walter <UNK> is warning off leslie <UNK> and his crew from the relief ship stuff he dare not dream about br br as doctor edward <UNK> <UNK> is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter anne francis they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the <UNK> br br the records as <UNK> by <UNK> indicate the <UNK> came to a <UNK> ending of unknown origin the <UNK> they left behind is still <UNK> br br maybe <UNK> too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion br br i see all kinds of <UNK> about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956 the terms would change we would now say <UNK> speed instead of hyper drive courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek br br we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying <UNK> like space ship it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey it's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are <UNK> of the future do change br br the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one about mortal beings trying to play god br br you can't write about forbidden planet without commenting on <UNK> the robot this mechanical marvel put together by <UNK> with the knowledge he gained from studying the <UNK> was quite the hit back in the day he got a new <UNK> on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space his scenes with earl <UNK> who plays the cook on the space ship and his <UNK> with <UNK> request for some home spirits are very funny br br <UNK> and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar but lost to the ten <UNK> and the <UNK> of the red sea forbidden <UNK> bad luck to run up against a hollywood <UNK> like cecil b demille br br <UNK> among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic <UNK> of the <UNK> which when you think about it could have been shakespeare's one venture into science fiction br br my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who's sacrifice <UNK> leslie <UNK> to learn exactly what he's dealing with br br never miss this one whenever it's broadcast
<START> this unpleasant film has little to recommend it dolph lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed and there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre <UNK> br br but no motivations are either murky or trite most of the acting is sub par the script creates needless confusion and the director's needless fascination with focusing on gore is distracting br br it's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film
<START> so mary and <UNK> have aged who hasn't i was a teen when mary premiered and a young adult when it left the air yes it was great to see mary and <UNK> together and yes maybe the film didn't sustain the comedy of the original series but there were enough moments that <UNK> the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute example the producer who hires mary and then <UNK> the idea for a new series about old people isn't this typical of the mentality of present day hollywood tv and film bean <UNK> this may not be the mary tyler moore show at its best but it's a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s
<START> if you are going to attempt building tension in a film it is always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total tedium br br unfortunately the butcher brothers haven't <UNK> this yet br br this film sucks unlike the majority of its characters who if you didn't work out they are vampires in the first few minutes then shame on you <UNK> <UNK> up the <UNK> supply of <UNK> one knows where i <UNK> <UNK> types and homosexual <UNK> that <UNK> conveniently and with a fast food <UNK> past their isolated door br br the only tiny bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires come to be vampires in the first place but the rest of it is ludicrous and sloppy br br forced to up sticks as opposed stakes on a regular basis due to their <UNK> for filling their basement with <UNK> corpses they really are none too bright if they fed their victims they could run their own little blood farm and it would cut down on the <UNK> rate thereby allowing them to settle down and get <UNK> br br why the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and the <UNK> gay older brother i am not sure it added zero to the plot which was unfortunate given that there wasn't a great deal of plot to start with and had no shock value at all br br one was never told why the parents had died unless of course that was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks clearly the social worker must have been <UNK> to the family for some reason or other but again it was for the viewer to write their own reason br br the only well rounded character was the youngest brother who emerges looking like <UNK> from the adams family indeed he was way too rounded having the appearance of a child who has inadvertently <UNK> from a weight <UNK> class in to a very bad horror film oh heavens he had never mind dear have another <UNK> with a <UNK> blood centre
<START> i thought the movie was extremely funny and actually very interesting it was raw and honest and felt as if i was really watching the real people not actors it's great entertainment it also painted the people as human on our level not below us it is a very good film
<START> br br i have seen this movie many times at least a dozen but <UNK> not recently however <UNK> in my memory never to leave me is a scene in which mickey rooney killer <UNK> knows that he is to be executed and it's getting close to the moment of truth he dances and cries and laughs he <UNK> from <UNK> to <UNK> and runs the <UNK> of ever emotion never have i seen such a brilliant performance by any actor living or dead past or present it was then i know for sure that mickey rooney yes andy hardy was and is a actor of great genius however i kept it my opinion to myself for years thinking surely i must be alone in this viewpoint about 15 years or so after i saw this film for the last time on television i <UNK> to read the old q a section of the los angeles times the question was <UNK> to lawrence olivier and the question was mr olivier you are considered one of the greatest actors of all time whom then do you consider to be among the greatest actors his answer was peter <UNK> and mickey rooney i was stunned but not surprised i <UNK> <UNK> back to his killer <UNK> and i felt very good for having seen this great ability in him and now having my view supported by another <UNK> work i admired later of course there was bill and many other great moments with <UNK> rooney this film the last mile should be seen by all acting students i frankly cannot remember a great deal about the film after all these years but mr rooney in it will never leave me if anyone out there remembers this film the same as i do i would be interested in hearing from you for this picture <UNK> in my heart alone i gave it a 10 just on the face of his performance
<START> blazing <UNK> it's a fight between two estranged brothers dennis quaid and <UNK> howard both of whom can <UNK> fires mentally they square off over childhood differences with <UNK> love interest debra <UNK> caught in the middle director glenn gordon caron the tv <UNK> kid behind <UNK> <UNK> the darkly <UNK> comedy in vince <UNK> screenplay with a presentation so slick the movie resembles an entry from an over enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million dollar grant it has the <UNK> energy of a big commercial feature but a <UNK> style which brings out nothing from the characters except their <UNK> <UNK> these aren't even characters they're plot functions barely released to theaters the film is a disaster although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good <UNK> is the only stand out in a cast which looks truly <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> this movie makes peter an <UNK> in robin hood costume instead of a human boy in probably not robin hood costume and ignores all the persona features in him that really matter this movie makes wendy a <UNK> idiot and poor captain hook a total clown and of course as every disney cartoon must have a character which has had too many hits in the head they made one of the lost boys that one the only character that has not been <UNK> in this film is <UNK> the only star is for her br br the story itself then the darling parents don't even get the time to notice their kids are gone probably one of the most significant point in the original story and they ruined it also the famous <UNK> scene between peter pan and wendy is a stunning piece of there are no <UNK> and no <UNK> one of the little things that makes the original story such a unique one it's a wonder he even had lost his shadow and she helped him stick it even though to his shoes and it makes no sense to me br br ruining a great story like this just to <UNK> children should be illegal so know now if you haven't known it before this disney version does not have anything significant in common with the original story which is not really a children's story but just a great great story br br this just <UNK> me to no end
<START> loved the original story had very high expectations for the film especially since barker was raving about it in interviews finally saw it and what can i say it was a total mess the directing is all over the place the acting was atrocious the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat empty and completely unnecessary whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast forward slow mo nonsense it was stylish yes but not needed in this film and <UNK> the vibe into some dumb mtv marilyn <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> music video whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal some are just ridiculously laughable the first kill on the japanese girl was hilarious and ted <UNK> death was just <UNK> funny it just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more no explanations were given whatsoever i mean i knew what was happening only as i'd read the story but for people who hadn't it's even more confusing as at times even i didn't know where it was going and what it was trying to do it was going on an insane <UNK> the whole time br br god i really wanted to like this film as i'm a huge fan of <UNK> work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie hell i even enjoyed some of <UNK> movies as fun <UNK> but this film just <UNK> of <UNK> and silliness from start to finish i didn't care about anyone or anything the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source turning it into something else entirely granted it was gory and <UNK> jones played a superb <UNK> but everything else was all over the place more than disappointing <UNK>
<START> i hate to throw out lines like this but in this case i feel like i have to the american remake of the grudge is by far the worst film i have seen in theaters in the last 5 years there i said it and now that i have gotten that out of my system please let me explain why br br when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born the curse <UNK> in that place of death those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury that is the premise of the grudge and i will admit it sounds intriguing unfortunately the filmmakers take it no further those who encounter the curse are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get you want more well too bad some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of the grudge is to scare you the problem is that when there is no plot to speak of creepy images and sounds can only go so far director takashi <UNK> pulling a george <UNK> and <UNK> his own original film s <UNK> attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over it pretty much unfolds like this br br person walks into house br br something flashes by the camera and or a strange sound is heard br br person goes to investigate br br sound starts to get loud br br person sees a ghost br br loud scream and or cat <UNK> br br cut to black br br before the audience is even given a hint of plot this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour the first time was actually somewhat creepy each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on by the time the end of the film rolled around my friend and i were <UNK> wondering if this scene would end with a loud scream and a cut to black we were never proved wrong br br the film has no liner storyline instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience <UNK> i have no problem with non linear storytelling when it is done right the film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason i haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of <UNK> 2 and this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had if you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic and why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious <UNK> when we already know what happened to everyone br br obviously <UNK> the second the american version of the ring made 15 million its first weekend the grudge is nothing but <UNK> imitation disguised as an actual movie the scariest things about the grudge are that it made 40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the scariest movie ever made i wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see the grudge
<START> stack should have received the academy award for this performance period its a crime that he did not amazing how he <UNK> a rich worthless character br br dorothy malone did earn a well deserved academy award for her performance in fact all of the acting in this film is excellent br br the plot begins with a taxi ride then an airplane ride then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will hold your interest throughout you will be entertained br br however this is only a blatant soap opera one dimensional 100 percent <UNK> you might call it the ultimate <UNK> because the acting so thoroughly <UNK> over the material excellently acted well directed but strictly within its soap genre i wouldn't even call it a melodrama such as mildred pierce or imitation of life while not denying the great entertainment value of this film you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter
<START> i remember seeing this movie when i was about 7 and at the time it shocked me i had seen a violent movie before but i never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence this movie not only shows this but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness what this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful crash tried to show how racism was bad and crash actually had a built in anti asian bias and to come at it from a morally superior position grand canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash especially when you compare the endings the ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up while grand canyon simply ends on a quiet note where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too there's no suitable ending no matter how good bad you are there is no ending of a chapter to begin another
<START> as an amateur <UNK> of ww2 nazi germany i couldn't wait for this to come out on dvd i missed it when it was first on in 2003 i don't want to repeat what's already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments about the historical inaccuracies a better job could've been done portraying the charming hitler i also had a small problem with some of the casting choices not so much for their acting but for their appearances peter <UNK> doesn't look much like <UNK> why didn't they make <UNK> as <UNK> wear a wig and my biggest complaint so much has always been made of hitler's striking blue eyes why didn't they make <UNK> wear blue contacts on the plus side i thought the actors who played <UNK> and <UNK> looked pretty good again as long as people watching this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment 1st history 2nd i don't think a lot of harm will be done

<START> it is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film whereas <UNK> lust for <UNK> producer frank <UNK> earlier biography of a controversial american general from the second world war has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments like a previous reviewer i am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other br br one difference between the two films is that <UNK> is more focused <UNK> on a relatively short period at and immediately after the end of the second world war whereas <UNK> covers not only this war but also its <UNK> role in the korean war as well as his period as american <UNK> of occupied japan during the <UNK> br br the main difference however lies in the way the two leaders are played gregory peck <UNK> this film even more than george c scott dominated <UNK> whereas scott had another major star karl malden playing opposite him as general <UNK> none of the other actors in <UNK> are household names at least for their film work scott of course portrayed <UNK> as aggressive and fiery <UNK> a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race not just with the enemy i suspect that in real life general macarthur was as <UNK> an individual as <UNK> but that is not how he appears in this film <UNK> macarthur is of a more <UNK> thoughtful bent comparable to the liberal <UNK> he played in some of his other films at times he even seems to be a man of the political left much of his speech on the occasion of the japanese surrender in 1945 could have been written by a paid up member of <UNK> and his <UNK> for <UNK> japanese society during the american <UNK> have a semi <UNK> air to them in an attempt to show something of <UNK> gift for inspiring <UNK> peck makes him a fine <UNK> but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the <UNK> <UNK> than to any fire in the heart it is as if <UNK> <UNK> from to kill a <UNK> had put on a <UNK> uniform br br whereas scott attempted a <UNK> and <UNK> portrait of <UNK> the criticism has been made that <UNK> attempts to <UNK> over some of its <UNK> less attractive qualities i think that this criticism is a fair one particularly as far as the korean war is concerned the film gives the impression that macarthur was a brilliant general who <UNK> stand up to <UNK> <UNK> ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was <UNK> for his pains when victory was within his grasp many historians of course feel that truman was forced to sack macarthur because the <UNK> conduct was becoming a risk to world peace and had no choice but to accept a <UNK> because <UNK> would not have allowed his chinese allies to be <UNK> even during the korean scenes <UNK> macarthur comes across as more idealistic than his real life original probably was we see little of his <UNK> and <UNK> about political matters truman 's remark he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about <UNK> was said about <UNK> but it could equally well have been applied to <UNK> approach to international <UNK> perhaps the film's attempt to paint out some of <UNK> <UNK> reflects the period in which it was made the late seventies after the twin <UNK> of vietnam and <UNK> was a difficult time for america and a public looking for <UNK> might have welcomed a <UNK> heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation another criticism i would make of the film is that it falls between two <UNK> if it was intended to be a full biography of macarthur something should have been shown of his early life which is not covered at all the first we see of the general is when he is leading the american resistance to the japanese invasion of the <UNK> one theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of general <UNK> father himself a military hero i would have liked to see what sort of man arthur macarthur was and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on korea and on <UNK> clash with truman with equal <UNK> given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches br br it would be wrong however to give the impression that i disliked the film altogether although i may not have agreed with <UNK> interpretation of the main role there is no denying that he played it with his normal <UNK> and seriousness the film as a whole is a good example of a solid <UNK> biopic thoughtful and informative it is a good film but one that could have been a better one 7 10 br br on a <UNK> note the map which macarthur is shown using during the korean war shows the <UNK> the <UNK> between the two korean states that did not come into existence until after the war the pre war <UNK> was the <UNK> parallel also i think that macarthur was referring to the <UNK> of war war may be toxic but it is difficult to listen with <UNK> ear for a <UNK>
<START> the mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80's well with some good performances br br however br br the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where i expect it was intended to be edgy the characters are totally over <UNK> and unbelievable and full of right wing clichés that the script writer probably saw watching a <UNK> documentary on the national front the biggest problem is this movie has no real story it <UNK> all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was br br very disappointing
<START> i kinda liked the film despite it's <UNK> pace but i did not appreciate the comment that canada was referred to as montana north it is definitely not montana north and never will be americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world and that is one reason why stop teaching the kids of the united states of america to think they own the planet such a <UNK> world view is not becoming of one of the world's great nations even in <UNK> i would never refer to the usa as <UNK> <UNK> walt would never put us down so why start now other than that the film was pretty goofy better luck next time
<START> as part of the celebration of the release of casino <UNK> this film with the new bond starring in it was shown from director roger <UNK> <UNK> hill i almost turned it off for being a bit boring but i'm glad i stuck with it basically may anne reid is a single mother of helen anna wilson jones who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend darren daniel craig of course after knowing each other only a few days may and darren have a secret affair and at her age with a 30 something and the new bond anyway they obviously want to keep it a secret but may has regrets and wonders if helen will find out when she does darren gets less <UNK> than may in fact helen asks her <UNK> to hit her also starring peter <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> pair harry <UNK> as harry <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> and johnny <UNK> oliver ford davies as bruce very good
<START> i cant believe some people actually like this yet still call themselves batman fans even going as far as to say it's better than <UNK> which it's not it should be <UNK> for them to use <UNK> name for this piece of crap it's not batman br br the whole premise of the show is <UNK> you cant defeat someone get a bigger weapon to help <UNK> batman isn't all about weapons he uses his <UNK> and <UNK> hook and <UNK> thats it he doesn't come up with some new ingenious tech every time he cant beat someone i don't know where the hell they got the idea for a <UNK> or whatever they have ruined all the villains mr freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell in some <UNK> thing <UNK> is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dumb costume penguin is now a ninja with a 50 <UNK> tall top hat the <UNK> is now called scarface making the <UNK> the whole <UNK> for the character they even got a dumb idea to make him a giant wtf and the two worst character changes are that of the joker and <UNK> they have changed <UNK> to a gothic retro teenage freak and the joker to an <UNK> with <UNK> he looks like a bob <UNK> wannabe they have completely and utterly ruined batman even <UNK> than b r did i wish i could meet the creators and or writers and animators of this show so i could <UNK> them in the head with a metal baseball bat
<START> i saw this movie in the theater and was thoroughly impressed by it then again that was when claire danes was a good actress not the foolish arrogant hollywood <UNK> bitch she is today anyway this film really struck me as one of the more raw realistic beautiful friendship films how far would you really go for your best friend i was moved to tears at the end and still tear up when i watch it now i own it i remember as soon as i left the theater i called my best friend and <UNK> to her how much i loved her this is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you'd do something like that for her
<START> diane and i saw this fabulous film today in <UNK> and we both agreed that of the <UNK> movies it was head and shoulders above the rest i say that because we were <UNK> by the brief five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was love in its many forms br br ostensibly the film took place in the various <UNK> <UNK> thus giving a particular <UNK> to each segment having only been in paris several times i was not <UNK> enough to readily recognize the locations but i am sure europeans and particularly french people could easily recognize the city's locations in any event the viewer is immediately pulled into each story because of their production excellence so these city locations fade into in consequence br br the film moves quickly and the viewer is left absorbing one scenario while the new one is on the screen the stories themselves are not graphic like some pulp hollywood nonsense they are subtle and thought provoking and gentle as with most of life without the media <UNK> that <UNK> so much of life's beauty under the nearest dung heap just to sell sell sell br br go with someone you care for and allow this magical little film to <UNK> you like a <UNK> treatment and when you leave my guess is you will feel <UNK>
<START> i've watched this movie twice now on dvd and both times it didn't fail to impress me with its unique <UNK> attitude it seems more like a depiction of reality than most other hollywood fare especially on a topic that is still <UNK> discussed even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint it doesn't fail to question it and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost not matter what and cruelty is a common <UNK> br br what really makes this movie outstanding is the <UNK> to over <UNK> nowadays truly good movies in a nutshell are few and far apart with mainstream fare being enjoyable if you don't have high expectations but terribly <UNK> spirited i think this movie comes off as a truly good movie without being a masterpiece because it sticks to itself and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it instead of wanting to <UNK> him with effect and emotion to <UNK> out his intelligence this movie is cool <UNK> and generally light handed in its judgement which is good br br the story has its flaws especially <UNK> character comes off <UNK> but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life even by <UNK> taking each next guy still she doesn't come off as weak in fact i think she's one of the stronger characters she's always in control of the relationships with the men just <UNK> and i take it very <UNK> that she's not a <UNK> widow i believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now you could die so easily of even minor <UNK> and <UNK> so the <UNK> of of someone dying while surely causing grief didn't <UNK> people like it does now people didn't seem to build <UNK> about their lost ones like they do now and i like that attitude br br my recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare don't watch if if you want non stop action or heart renting emotion
<START> one thing about hollywood someone has a success and it's always rushed to be copied and another thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home studio br br rock hudson got such <UNK> for his performance in the texas based film giant that universal executives must have thought let's quick get him into another modern texas setting br br similarly robert stack got great reviews for the high and the mighty as the pilot who was cracking under the strain of flying a damaged aircraft that it was natural to give him another crack up role br br both of these ends were achieved in written on the wind before hudson was the big ranch owner now he's the son of a hunting companion of robert <UNK> father who took hudson under his wing in other words the james dean part without the james dean racism from giant br br lauren bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that <UNK> hadley oil company uses hudson likes her but she's <UNK> by <UNK> millions and when he <UNK> a girl he's got the means to really pursue a campaign she marries stack br br and last but not least in the mix we have dorothy malone who's <UNK> amoral sister who has a <UNK> for rock but rock ain't about to get <UNK> up with this wild child br br dorothy malone spent over 10 years in a whole bunch of <UNK> film heroine roles before landing this gem she got a best supporting actress award for her part as <UNK> hadley and it was well deserved br br if you like <UNK> technicolor fifties soap opera than this is the film for you
<START> i'm somewhat of a fan of <UNK> work so i was excited when i found this dvd unfortunately i was very let down it's a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor the animation is very crude no doubt done using <UNK> each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows br br for people who are not familiar with this vein of animation they will probably be somewhat impressed by it however if you've spent much time on <UNK> com like me then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you've seen before many of the popular amateur artists on <UNK> are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd if lynch <UNK> this work to the website then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of <UNK> artists but since i saw this on dvd instead of on <UNK> i give it a 4 10 instead of a 7 10 as i would have otherwise these cartoons are fit for the internet but with a name like david lynch on it i expected better quality both in story and in animation
<START> at first glance it would seem natural to compare where the sidewalk ends with laura both have <UNK> qualities both were directed by otto preminger and both star dana andrews and gene tierney but that's where most of the comparisons end laura dealt with posh sophisticated people with means who just happen to find themselves mixed up in a murder where the sidewalk ends is set in a completely different <UNK> these are people with barely two <UNK> to rub together who are more <UNK> to seeing the <UNK> of society than going to fancy dress parties where the sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their <UNK> or some other weapon small time <UNK> are a dime a dozen and cops <UNK> beat <UNK> out of the crooks getting caught up in a murder investigation seems as natural as breathing br br while i haven't seen his entire body of work based on what i have seen dana andrews gives one of his best performances as the beat down cop <UNK> sgt mark dixon he's the kind of cop who is used to <UNK> up the local <UNK> if it gets him information or a confession one night he goes too far and accidentally kills a man he does his best to cover it up but things get complicated when he falls for the dead man's wife morgan taylor tierney whose father becomes suspect number one in the murder case as <UNK> father means the world to her <UNK> got to do what he can to clear the old man without <UNK> himself br br technically where the sidewalk ends is outstanding besides the terrific performance from andrews the movie features the always delightful tierney she has a quality that can make even the <UNK> of moments seem <UNK> the rest of the cast is just as solid with tom <UNK> as the wrongly accused father being a real standout beyond the acting the direction sets lighting and cinematography are all top notch overall it's an amazingly well made film br br if i have one complaint and admittedly it's a very very minor <UNK> it's that tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings it's a little difficult to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixed up with some of these <UNK> characters it's not really her fault it's just the way tierney comes across she seems a little too beautiful polished and delicate for the part but her gentle kind <UNK> nature add a sense of needed realism to her portrayal
<START> high energy <UNK> walsh classic from 1933 the <UNK> places saloon owner and <UNK> wallace <UNK> against bitter rival and dandy george raft with adopted street kid jackie cooper and good looking faye <UNK> in roles that play in between their big rivalry it's not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about but everyone follows it in the daily <UNK> plenty of <UNK> at the beginning but the characters <UNK> up as the film progresses apart from that is the sheer <UNK> of the scenes in <UNK> saloon the various characters sexy chorus line lots of drinking a perfect creation of a <UNK> of <UNK> not too <UNK> by so called pre code <UNK> and then later come the carrie nations led by carrie nation herself it all creates a very vivid picture of a life that's long gone i don't like to compare <UNK> but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today the film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is <UNK> a must see
<START> real cool smart movie i loved <UNK> colors especially the purple car alice <UNK> is wise and wonderful as stella i liked <UNK> reference to how her face had gotten <UNK> the <UNK> dance scene is brilliant really liked this one
<START> i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and <UNK> <UNK> were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever when i watched valentine i was amazed at how great the story line actually was it kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring but overall it was non stop entertaining and suspenseful it had a mind <UNK> story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't deserve all the crap it gets i recommend this movie to watch anytime but especially on <UNK> day because it's sure to give you a ton of chills oh and don't even pay attention to the trailer or rating please don't
<START> quite a heartwarming little film and not just for the kids john <UNK> is brilliant as always without any hint of inspector morse about him the boy playing william did a good job as well though i didn't find him convincing in every scene i loved the whole feel of the small village and the slower pace of life in those times i also felt the scenes in london where historically accurate as far as i could tell br br it strongly reminded me of a <UNK> film i saw a couple of years ago called mother of mine that film featured a boy being <UNK> from <UNK> to sweden during <UNK> ii the wife of the family taking him in asked for a girl because as it turns out she lost her daughter getting a boy instead she completely ignores him the fact that the boy speaks <UNK> <UNK> matters even further i highly recommend that film to anyone who enjoyed <UNK> mr tom it has the same feel to it
<START> this is the official sequel to the <UNK> sci fi action thriller in the original van damme was among several dead vietnam war vets <UNK> to be the perfect soldiers <UNK> in this one it's i guess about a dozen years later since van damme has a daughter about that age now he's working with the government in a classified <UNK> to train the latest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for some reason as usual something goes wrong the on site super computer named seth like the snake in king <UNK> the same year goes power crazy takes command of the <UNK> and even <UNK> its computer brain into a new super <UNK> body <UNK> white we're <UNK> at the next step in evolution folks most of van <UNK> fights are with one particularly mean <UNK> pro wrestler goldberg who just keeps on <UNK> drop him off a building no good run him down with a truck no go shoot him burn him <UNK> much of the humor is <UNK> to how van damme is now <UNK> and out <UNK> he's even going grey around the edges but though he takes a <UNK> he keeps on <UNK> most sequels of this sort are pretty lame pale <UNK> of the originals and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius it manages to be consistently entertaining especially if you're a pro wrestling fan
<START> night of the living homeless was a fairly strong finish to the first half of season 11 obviously a parody of various zombie movies most notably dawn of the dead this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead as creatures who feed and <UNK> off of spare change rather than brains br br kyle is blamed for the sudden mass <UNK> of homeless people when he out of the goodness of his heart gives a 20 to a homeless man in front of his house more homeless people begin to <UNK> south park until the town is completely <UNK> with them this is a very strong randy <UNK> episode as he assumes the role of the shotgun wielding leader of the adults who take <UNK> on the roof of the park county community center but before randy makes it to the community center he is <UNK> by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming i don't have any change unfortunately the <UNK> end up losing <UNK> <UNK> to the homeless when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town and <UNK> <UNK> away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people then he becomes one of them asking everyone for change br br the boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park and find a man who is a director of homeless studies they find out that the nearby city of <UNK> used to have a similar problem with the homeless so they escape to <UNK> to find out what they did to solve the problem unfortunately homeless people break into the man's house and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself however he fails several times as he shoots himself in the jaw in the eye in the chest in the neck in the shoulder screaming horribly until he finally dies this scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in fantastic <UNK> special two weeks ago br br meanwhile a member of the <UNK> discovers that due to the homeless problem the property values have <UNK> thus the bank has <UNK> on his house making him homeless randy immediately turns on him holding the gun to the man's head when the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out randy pulls the trigger br br in <UNK> the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to south park and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country the boys <UNK> a bus that leads the homeless out of south park and takes them all the way to santa monica california br br the zombie movie parallels and the great randy <UNK> lines make this one definitely re watchable 8 10
<START> like his elder brothers claude <UNK> and jean pierre <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> began to cut his teeth in french cinema with a series of fine thrillers la menace 1977 and <UNK> <UNK> 1979 among others police python <UNK> is a good example of how <UNK> conceived and shot his works at this time of his career they had a splendid cinematography <UNK> screenplays and a sophisticated directing <UNK> for <UNK> sake br br the police <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone he makes the <UNK> of a young woman sylvia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover his superior <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when the latter learns it he kills her in a fit of anger <UNK> has to investigate the murder and all the clues are <UNK> against him br br one could <UNK> that this kind of far fetched story isn't <UNK> from <UNK> and sometimes one can see right through it but <UNK> <UNK> directorial style helps to <UNK> up a <UNK> <UNK> atmosphere the first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however it is crucial for what will follow this key moment <UNK> falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation in spite of <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> daniel <UNK> penned a <UNK> story <UNK> mathieu <UNK> who sometimes expresses his surprise because <UNK> keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation but his superior knows that he usually works alone actually <UNK> has to find solid tricks to <UNK> the waters and so to <UNK> himself eventually the chief idea of the film concerns <UNK> himself he's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible <UNK> it is <UNK> by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won't recognize him when he is brought face to face with them br br the backdrop of this thriller <UNK> is <UNK> enhanced by <UNK> camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its <UNK> charm
<START> i thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends i laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time it was just really touching although not a new concept this was a very well made film
<START> i consider myself to be a bit of a <UNK> when it comes to everything and although the cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than high drama i can be very stuck up about films too br br not all art films however are better than king kong i quite possibly would give kong two stars double this film's <UNK> br br my guess is that people got so excited about this because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in a play for the less <UNK> art buff a film that looks like a play is <UNK> <UNK> br br this film however was useless br br there was hardly any story so it relied on high drama the only drama in this film was whether the cat would drop off the roof or not so deep and meaningful dialogue then no great acting hardly br br to be <UNK> fair some of the scenery was interesting though communist <UNK> city <UNK> <UNK> and the soviet <UNK> still in service
<START> freddy has gone from scary to funny in this <UNK> installment in the nightmare series br br it's been 2 years well actually 11 since this film takes place in 2001 and freddy has killed every last kid on elm street except one john <UNK> <UNK> from part 5 even <UNK> the film gives on hint who he is in which he uses to bring more children to come to elm street not only does freddy gets his wishes but he also gets his daughter back to elm street when she finds out what is happening she and other kids decide to kill freddy once and for all we also get to see some of freddy's eerie backgrounds br br rachel <UNK> who has been <UNK> to the nightmare series for a long time by now many people hate this film but i liked it it tried to bring out what freddy was doing with his <UNK> <UNK> and makes the series more funny than scary so this film is really a <UNK> sore to speak it is not the <UNK> in the series part 2 still holds it br br
<START> i gave this movie a rating of 1 awful the only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a big 0 is ben kingsley who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way br br mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply can't get over the fact that she is even in such a piece br br stupid stupid story and horrible production do not waste your video rental
<START> envy is not as funny as i thought it would initially be but after some of the reviews i read i found it to be much funnier than people was giving it props for now true its not a gag a minute movie like <UNK> or <UNK> but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and christopher walken is as great as ever so the story is about jack <UNK> character <UNK> a <UNK> that makes dog <UNK> disappear <UNK> ben wants no part of it but when the product makes jack black rich ben stiller starts to see the envy its not great by all means and both ben stiller and jack black have funnier and better movies under their belt but if your a fan of either i recommend this as its still a funny flick and i laughed my ass off quite a few times as a big fan of ben stiller id have to say this is a lesser stiller but still great fun give it a watch
<START> firstly i would like to point out that people who have <UNK> this film have made some glaring errors anything that has a rating below 6 10 is clearly utter nonsense br br creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects the actors are highly believable the narrative thought provoking and the horror and <UNK> content extremely disturbing br br there is much <UNK> in this film many questions <UNK> as the audience are revealed to the strange and <UNK> creature that makes <UNK> in the dark rat ridden <UNK> how was <UNK> created and what happened to him br br a fantastic film with a large chill factor a film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 days later the <UNK> dog soldiers and <UNK> br br look forward to more of these fantastic films
<START> contains <UNK> spoilers br br i have seen a number of decent indie horror films such as the <UNK> the boys love mandy lane and cabin fever unfortunately i felt five across the eyes does not fall into this category from start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting <UNK> from a very poor script god only knows why the writer s thought dialogue such as no don't go out there don't go out there she'll get you if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kills you you're dead is of movie quality br br this film displays very little character development and to be honest i couldn't care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of <UNK> college girls who show almost no redeeming <UNK> all they do is cry and <UNK> throughout the entire movie and if the girls aren't crying their arguing when they do <UNK> the topics are completely random about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently <UNK> appropriate subjects when you're being chased by a psychotic killer br br the soundtrack is also abysmal <UNK> corny <UNK> music during both the start and end credits although hearing the credit music knowing the end was <UNK> seemed like heaven br br the camera work is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable i'm guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which <UNK> in the girls' car almost the entire movie i think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible to feel and experience what the girls are going through but due to a very shaky camera grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic it's one thing to make a film <UNK> but it's another to have action on the screen that an audience can't <UNK> because of the poor cinematography br br i understand that five across the eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality there are no redeeming factors to this film bad acting poor scripting shoddy camera work and no story in light off all this i decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief its <UNK> minutes off stupid college girls crying arguing <UNK> running and having random inappropriate conversations however how many times do you get to see girls <UNK> into their hands and throwing the crap onto the <UNK> of a chasing car
<START> i have seen this movie many times and each time i watch it i can't help but be entertained by it gunga din is one of those classic movies made in <UNK> golden years when the actors themselves had to draw the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and man made monsters to carry a scene the <UNK> charisma and <UNK> demonstrated by cary grant victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jr is <UNK> and very entertaining to watch the tongue and cheek attitude in which the three actors play their roles works <UNK> and <UNK> some might consider it corny but i consider it classic <UNK> and acting at its best one must remember when watching this film that europe was involved in a war with germany and audiences went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken away to a place where people were larger than life and did heroic deeds and good would always <UNK> over evil gunga din <UNK> this perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors during their harrowing <UNK> in short its a classic film that <UNK> take itself too seriously and <UNK> want the audience to either
<START> written by a woman and directed by another <UNK> are we in for a feminist ride or what <UNK> your seat <UNK> ladies for we are about to enter a world of mean men and innocent well <UNK> women br br in this <UNK> <UNK> comes across a guy in the <UNK> agency who behaves looks and dresses like a <UNK> and gives her a job with the hope of <UNK> her some time later in his office he even touches her <UNK> the way a <UNK> heavy in a bond movie would a touch a girl just after he's captured her and just before he is ready to kill her alongside with bond some time later the <UNK> <UNK> guy stalks <UNK> in a <UNK> dressing room <UNK> her and even comes close to <UNK> her oh these evil evil men they are all bad don't you know you can't even look for a job nowadays without getting raped right ladies well we'll show 'em in this film there is some kind of a divorced women's club or something headed by a janet leigh who speaks for all women involved in this film when she says that men are all s t she <UNK> about how terrible men are she has been divorced five times now seriously any woman who marries twenty times and then uses that <UNK> as an argument that men are all bad must have realized eventually that the explanation might lie elsewhere or it must occur to her that a she is a bad judge of male character or much more likely b she is the one impossible to live with her ex husbands were probably the victims or if they were indeed a holes then she probably got what she deserved don't the likes of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and liz taylor prove this point show me a likable woman who got married this often and i'll show you a way to reach the planet mars using only roller <UNK> and a ladder <UNK> eventually meets a computer guy who <UNK> her faith in men but hold your horses this guy turns out to be married therefore proving without a doubt that men are indeed all bad were it not of course for a kindly old <UNK> <UNK> around the corner who loves his wife even though she's still dead proving that all men are bad except for kindly old men whose <UNK> don't work and they can't get none anyway so they are forced to abandon a life of a <UNK> and finally give women the respect they deserve even the supporting male characters are all bad the black guy in the <UNK> agency is <UNK> and the guy in the <UNK> is out right rude and <UNK> the bastard <UNK> <UNK>  and what's with this corny corny ending minutes before court time <UNK> <UNK> the claim to any of her husband's money realizing that she is now free and that she can finally do that jump into the swimming pool what's all that about her jump into the pool is then very predictably frame frozen as the credits start to role in while life inspiring i don't need revenge nor my husband's money music starts kicking in her girlfriends are shocked by her <UNK> of money claims but they don't stay shocked for long and soon start kidding each other about what a heart attack <UNK> lawyer will get when he hears about this the <UNK> lawyer is naturally a man an evil evil terrible bad man whose only interest in this world is money ah these men all they care about is money they know nothing of the higher values in life like shopping i am glad we have movies like this they bring the <UNK> closer together but most importantly they teach girls and young women that men are all horny selfish <UNK> chasing <UNK> who will dump you into a world of poverty and misery the first chance they get so girls open your mouths an stick your <UNK> into your <UNK> mouths lesbian power
<START> though the movie may have been true to <UNK> book in that the script was basically word for word <UNK> it failed to capture any of the <UNK> that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this the mythical creatures <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ghosts are drawn in and as in the previous review the green screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow i nearly laughed to death when i saw the <UNK> <UNK> with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth i nearly cried when i heard the <UNK> <UNK> a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically <UNK> as <UNK> and as <UNK> as he possibly could br br all of the acting is tremendously forced especially that of little lucy <UNK> i could only take so much <UNK> desperation and buck teeth in the what felt like <UNK> hours of watching the movie the actress who plays the white witch in all her <UNK> seems that she'd be more at home on stage where a <UNK> voice spread arms and a <UNK> effort at something <UNK> would be more than welcome br br the sets feel claustrophobic whether the scenes are taking place <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> it's as if bbc could only afford to spend 100 on <UNK> a set and so it is very small and all the characters are constantly <UNK> together the white <UNK> castle is a run down rotting countryside english castle filled with <UNK> <UNK> and bad lighting when the <UNK> children are wandering through the woods actually any scene in the woods feels like they are simply wandering around in circles br br the only thing that looks decent in the film is <UNK> but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film's entire budget on building the mechanical <UNK> it looks great when it's standing still and before it starts speaking but once it starts moving you can't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear end in the lion suit br br yes if you are a hardcore <UNK> fan you may want to see this version simply because it <UNK> every word that lewis ever wrote but lewis was certainly no screenwriter and a lot of the dialogue feels <UNK> and awkward when on screen during the scene in which the children are at the <UNK> and getting ready to flee from the wolves mrs <UNK> <UNK> oh just one more thing <UNK> and then we will be ready to go <UNK> by the children's <UNK> cries and <UNK> and <UNK> of no mrs <UNK> please a scene of comic relief so <UNK> they are supposed to be fleeing from <UNK> danger not wondering about whether to pack the <UNK> machine or not <UNK> from the drama that the scene might otherwise have in fact the whole movie is <UNK> with directing faux <UNK> such as these br br i would recommend seeing the new <UNK> disney 2005 the new movie with updated effects spectacular computer animation great timing all around and a gorgeous and scene stealing white witch who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician as opposed to a <UNK> <UNK> captures all of the <UNK> and the <UNK> of the world of <UNK> without <UNK> the least bit from <UNK> original vision i think lucy is a lot <UNK> no buck teeth <UNK> as are the <UNK> and realistically sized and <UNK> bbc edmund has nothing on the divine desperately hungry for acceptance insecure and <UNK> with an <UNK> complex edmund that the new disney version <UNK> br br unless you're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies i would not recommend this film to anyone
<START> okay let's face it this is a god awful movie the plot such as it is is horrible the acting worse but the movie was made for one reason and one reason only like all of those awful mario lanza movies just to hear the voice of the star in this case pavarotti in his prime okay so maybe the lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women but this movie is about hearing <UNK> that alone is worth watching the movie a big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears finds <UNK> and love along the way and <UNK> out a lot of hit numbers too br br i must admit i'm <UNK> on a number of levels i'm italian i'm a big pavarotti fan is there anything about pavarotti that isn't big including his fan base and when i first saw this movie i was going out on my own seeing the height and depth of life's possibilities and in love for the first time so as awful as this movie is the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again br br yes it's corny and awful but the voice is immortal and timeless and the voice is what it's all about so i give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love especially since he is now gone like italian food that you've never tried before try it you may be pleasantly surprised as a <UNK> lover or <UNK> pavarotti <UNK>

<START> but cinderella gets my vote not only for the worst of disney's princess movies but for the worst movie the company made during <UNK> lifetime the music is genuinely pretty and the story deserves to be called classic what fails in this movie are the characters particularly the title character who could only be called the heroine in the <UNK> sense of the term br br after a brief prologue the audience is introduced to cinderella she is waking up in the morning and singing a dream is a wish your heart makes this <UNK> her as an <UNK> and thus deserving of our sympathy unfortunately the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about freedom from her servant role the respect of her step family someone to talk to besides mice and birds in one song cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest dvd cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more <UNK> you go girlfriend in short cinderella is a very bland character she <UNK> accepts her step family's abuse escaping into her <UNK> dreams for relief she only <UNK> herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family for this she is given <UNK> to go the ball if she <UNK> her <UNK> and finds something to wear a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except of course cinderella can anyone see belle or <UNK> being such a <UNK> if cinderella is dull her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless the prince in cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time we are given no indication if he is a good man if he respects cinderella or anything all we know is 1 he is a prince and 2 he dances well heck even the prince from snow white got to sing a romantic song at least not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting it makes cinderella look like either a social <UNK> or an idiot <UNK> her already <UNK> appeal br br perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie's comic relief <UNK> friends the mice granted these characters are amusing even so when the comic relief steals the show from the principals well let's just say your story has some problems br br <UNK> loves to <UNK> all its animated features as masterpieces while many of them are there are some that do not deserve this <UNK> in any way cinderella is a prime example of this fact
<START> this show was fabulous it was intricate and well written and all the characters where likable with out being horribly sweet even jonathan cake the <UNK> boyfriend was likable since our <UNK> are filled with crap like american idol and dancing with the stars it was nice to see a drama that was not too soap opera like it was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next <UNK> it really is annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a little bit and have it thrown out because of some mysterious number that most of us don't even pay attention to some of us are not sheep this show will be missed maybe not by a lot of people but by some pretty loyal fans
<START> i need to be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from <UNK> for example then you will have a great time for it br br or if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time and if you enjoy <UNK> humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the show br br i enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty <UNK> offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respect br br this is a show that has little taste or class it's not recommended for those who are easily offended or <UNK> out br br now these guys need to see a psychologist specially the <UNK> character
<START> warning may contain spoilers br br so who are these mystery men simply put the mystery men are a group of sub heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while <UNK> both their real identities and their super identities the <UNK> bill macy works construction during the day and at night leaves his wife and kids at home while he <UNK> the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique <UNK> fighting style the blue <UNK> hank <UNK> sells <UNK> to <UNK> by day and <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> by night if his mom isn't keeping him busy with the latest <UNK> mr furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay then takes out his frustration on his friends at night <UNK> ill conceived one liners at friend and <UNK> alike and threatening to get really angry leaving everyone to wonder so what ben stiller <UNK> such life into this character you can't help but love him br br these three spend their nights trying to capture that <UNK> of <UNK> they've <UNK> about becoming real super heroes obviously it could happen champion city has captain amazing after all a flying fighting super cop with enough corporate <UNK> on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two greg kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle aged <UNK> trying to <UNK> his fans attention in the twilight of his career br br to bring back that <UNK> <UNK> that might win the <UNK> again c a <UNK> <UNK> frankenstein a <UNK> over the top menace played to chilling perfection by <UNK> rush this lunatic genius has created a <UNK> to <UNK> champion city into a reflection of his own <UNK> and ends up capturing c a within hours of his release from prison this leaves only the mystery men to stop <UNK> evil plan but with such henchmen as the disco boys protecting frankenstein the trio are going to need a little help br br <UNK> <UNK> and after a painful <UNK> party the team <UNK> in with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who initially has the only real talent in the team with her <UNK> <UNK> ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father the invisible boy <UNK> mitchell who claims to turn invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him the <UNK> paul <UNK> granted <UNK> powerful <UNK> by an angry gypsy and the much underused <UNK> wes <UNK> who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind then spends much of the rest of the movie <UNK> inane <UNK> and acting over wise br br this film really is a cross genre romp anyone wanting to <UNK> hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle this is a spoof parody of the superhero genre from the pseudo burton sets recycled endlessly and occasionally <UNK> with more spoof material to the ridiculous costumes the comic book genre gets a pretty good send up but at the same time it is a serious superhero flick as well both at once while not a necessarily unique idea in itself for example this movie is in some ways <UNK> of d c <UNK> short lived inferior five work it is fairly innovative for the big screen it offers the comic book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway then throws in the inevitable wanna <UNK> and we all know if <UNK> were real so would these guys be real if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city you'd see a half dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their <UNK> kicked on a regular basis sure the <UNK> fights pretty well and the blue <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with great accuracy all parts of the super hero world but does that make them genuine super heroes only in their minds br br this movie is also a comedy albeit a dark one inevitable when trying to point out the <UNK> ridiculous nature of super <UNK> one liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of particularly marvelous is the dialogue by <UNK> <UNK> with her <UNK> ball father yet it isn't a comedy in the sense of side splitting laughter or <UNK> memorable jokes it mixes in a dose of drama of discovery and of romance but never really <UNK> fully into any of it br br what really makes mystery men a good film in the end is that it is very engaging the weak lame good guys are eventually justified and for one shining moment really become super heroes justice is served and the movie ends with a scene that <UNK> of realism as much realism as is possible in a world where <UNK> balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise if the viewer stops trying to label the film then the film can be a great romp br br of course no movie is perfect claire <UNK> comes off as bored and <UNK> as mr <UNK> love interest in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad <UNK> dr <UNK> although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the <UNK> home is worth watching alone and the <UNK> are never more than gun <UNK> <UNK> a point of which is made in the film the cinematography is choppy and disjointed such as happens in the average comic book so it is <UNK> the music sometimes <UNK> the scenery and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well br br yet overall this film is incredible you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest br br 8 10 in my opinion
<START> children love dinosaurs it's somewhat part of their culture but they've got the land before time the original at least that movie had heart this this movie is just plain pathetic just because kids love dinosaurs doesn't mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children this movie has no plot the whole premise is stupid and it's more by the numbers stuff not as soul sucking as theodore rex but it's <UNK> away from being a land before time
<START> the sunshine boys was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of neil simon's play about a retired <UNK> team played by walter matthau and george burns who had a very bitter <UNK> and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other richard benjamin appears as <UNK> nephew a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simon's better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau burns and benjamin burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this but i think matthau walks away with this film with his <UNK> hilarious performance as willy clark matthau was nominated for best actor but didn't stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the <UNK> nest however in another year this was an oscar worthy performance matthau <UNK> the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance the scene where he is <UNK> for a <UNK> chip commercial and can't get the name of the product right is a classic the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to <UNK> chemistry between matthau and burns
<START> paris je t'aime is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love a film so complex that it almost defies <UNK> and reviewing ask a large group of people their impressions of life in paris and the result would be something akin to this film tied together by each of the <UNK> or <UNK> of the city the film <UNK> love in all forms native folk in their <UNK> <UNK> and tourists <UNK> with the great city approximately twenty writers and directors each with about five minutes of screen time include olivier <UNK> the <UNK> brothers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wes craven <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> depardieu christopher doyle vincenzo natali alexander payne walter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and gus van <UNK> among others less well known the stories <UNK> from hilarious to humorous to touching to tragic to banal to tender br br in one story a young frenchman <UNK> <UNK> is attracted to a young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out his heart in french to a <UNK> who speaks only english in another a separated husband and wife gena rowlands and ben <UNK> meet in the latin quarter to <UNK> divorce proceedings while another couple in <UNK> <UNK> emily <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> approach marriage without connection until the spirit of <UNK> oscar <UNK> <UNK> steve <UNK> in <UNK> confronts <UNK> in a subway with his bag of tourist <UNK> in <UNK> sergio <UNK> in love with mistress <UNK> <UNK> is ready to divorce his wife miranda richardson until she <UNK> she has <UNK> <UNK> juliette <UNK> confronts agony about her son's fantasies and loss in place des <UNK> with the help of a mythical cowboy willem <UNK> sara <UNK> and nick nolte and <UNK> <UNK> display a keen tale of mistaken ideas in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and bob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a strange relationship in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays a young blind man to actress natalie portman in learning how to see in <UNK> saint denis vampire love between <UNK> wood and <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> de la madeleine maggie <UNK> is an ex <UNK> actress <UNK> out on drugs in <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is a visiting tourist letter <UNK> trying desperately to speak the french she has studied for her life's trip in a <UNK> hilarious <UNK> <UNK> br br the final few minutes of the film tries to tie together as many of the stories as <UNK> but this only works on superficial levels the film is long and there are no bridges between the many stories a factor that can tire the audience due to lack of time to <UNK> all of the action but it is in the end a richly detailed homage to a great city and supplies the viewer with many vignettes to re visit like a <UNK> of a time in paris it is a film worth seeing multiple times grady <UNK>
<START> before george clooney directed sam <UNK> in his directorial debut <UNK> of a dangerous mind they starred together in this movie george clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer along with steven soderbergh which shows that they really believed in this project in potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project that is in the same line with movie remakes such as <UNK> eleven and the italian job but somehow this movie is only <UNK> successful or at least it isn't as good as it could had been br br the movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie the fact that they are being played doesn't change much to this even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying or anything like that at all br br it's of course due to the writing that the characters aren't used to their full potential i can only assume that the original italian movie i <UNK> <UNK> works out much better than this movie does the movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling br br nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity it's an harmless little caper movie in which you simply shouldn't to worry much about the story in that regard welcome to <UNK> is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose well br br it's a movie that you won't regret watching once you've finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing br br 7 10
<START> i loved this movie i am biased seeing as i am a huge disney fan but i really enjoyed myself the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going this is a bit of a departure for disney they don't spend quite as much time on character development my husband pointed this out and there are no musical numbers it is strictly action adventure i thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves disney be they young or old
<START> i am wanting to make a holmes with doors pun but i can't quite string it all together suitably <UNK> and over edited wonderland gives kilmer a role that channels <UNK> at the same time but how <UNK> is this film about the famous 14 <UNK> australian crime films flash it all the time and skip the graphic violence instead as someone famous said once about us cinema double standards kiss a breast and it's an x stab it and its an action pg 13 wonderland is 14 minutes too long too and at the end the <UNK> spiral we were all glad to escape the cinema how many films called wonderland are we going to get there must be six in the last decade the <UNK> violence and muted color sets the seedy tone but the <UNK> <UNK> gets tiresome as if we are <UNK> at their <UNK> all the time taking a few <UNK> form the doors and taxi driver it all becomes forgettable the next day
<START> i hadn't seen this film in probably 35 years so when i recently noticed that it was going to be on television cable again for the first time in a very long time it is not available on video i made sure i didn't miss it and unlike so many other films that seem to lose their <UNK> when finally viewed again i found the visual images from the pride of the marines were as vivid and effective as i first remembered what makes this movie so special anyway br br everything based on the true story of al <UNK> and his fellow marine machine gun <UNK> ordeal at the battle of the <UNK> river on <UNK> in november 1942 the screenplay stays 95 true to the book upon which it was based al <UNK> marine by roger <UNK> varying only enough to meet the time <UNK> of a motion picture this is not a typical war movie where the action is central and indeed the war scene is a brief 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film but it is a memorable 10 minutes filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle and is devoid of the mock <UNK> or <UNK> that usually <UNK> the genre in a way probably ahead of its time the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark ugly brutal nature of battle and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war this film isn't about <UNK> war i can't imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and wanting to <UNK> in the service not right away anyway br br what this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle and how damaged men can learn to re claim their lives there's an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this and i feel that's another reason why the film was so so well received it was exceptionally well written there's a dream sequence done in <UNK> negative film that seems almost experimental and the acting is strong too led by john garfield garfield was perfect for the role because his natural <UNK> and <UNK> were nearly the same and garfield met <UNK> and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role actors don't do that much anymore but added to the <UNK> it's just another reason why this movie succeeds in telling such a difficult unattractive story
<START> i saw this film a while ago on a video cd br br i will 1st mention the good points br br the movie at first at least tries to appear that it is not biased like not showing one character as black and the other as white both main characters are friends and co exist very well in an country and economy that is not <UNK> while at the same time not failing their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport sport rifle shooting as <UNK> not as <UNK> br br but after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a <UNK> in the road the audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other that for some unknown reason <UNK> is now on a path to conflict sure the script adds in tv footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in english but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war began br br the history the 1990 <UNK> the people who caused the war are not mentioned the movie tries to place the blame with <UNK> who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the <UNK> <UNK> 2nd largest party <UNK> according to the <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> was to have the <UNK> in 1992 but there was a coup in january the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> action party <UNK> total control and held a <UNK> <UNK> in march in which it <UNK> itself the law in <UNK> and announced <UNK> br br the history of the <UNK> begins with <UNK> muslim <UNK> <UNK> a man <UNK> absent from <UNK> he was a student of <UNK> in ww2 he even wrote his own <UNK> <UNK> in which he stated it is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or <UNK> between 'the <UNK> <UNK> and non <UNK> social and political <UNK> br br in 1990 he lost the <UNK> <UNK> to pro <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> muslim that worked with christian <UNK> during the civil war and who treated his supporters like brothers <UNK> was prevented from taking power by <UNK> who lost the <UNK> but <UNK> the seat of power br br the events from above are missing from the movie but they are the factual events that lead to the war br br there were problems with props too <UNK> soldiers in the movie were wearing soviet ww2 <UNK> which they did not use also the one soldier was holding an m 1944 ww2 rifle only used by <UNK> not <UNK> br br the director and script writers had a chance but they chose to re write history
<START> yes i know i'm one of the few people longing to <UNK> this movie into the dust of oblivion so let me me tell you why i feel this way in truth had it been <UNK> as a zombie film or the like i might have enjoyed it but right now i'm totally speechless br br spoiler though i'm not sure what's to spoil let's start with the first huge flaw if i did not know that the movie is called darkness the vampire version and had i not seen some sequences where some individuals seem to be sucking blood i would not have seen the connection with vampires i mean <UNK> give me a break br br second bad point what's with the metal it appears that all young people but mainly those so called vampires are into various kinds of metal judging mainly by their shirts don't get me wrong i've been into the more extreme forms of music for almost 15 years but nobody 's going to scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in iron maiden of all bands t shirts running around pretending to be vampires pathetic is the only only word that i could use here br br third weakness the actors wait a minute what actors you mean the director's wooden friends words would be a waste here br br yes alright the movie is very gory but what difference does that make it would have been a strong point and something to enjoy if the <UNK> director had not chosen to create an artificial vampire topic in this movie i wanted to see vampires but was treated to some stupid looking kids i would have loved to use my baseball bat on the film makers should simply have <UNK> the movie saying cheap b grade horror with no plot but a lot of gore br br this movie is <UNK> against the whole concept of <UNK> and it makes me sick
<START> this film illustrates the worst part of surviving war the memories for many soldiers men and women alike returning home can be the beginning of real problems i am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from wwii for one of my <UNK> the war was never over he survived the d day invasion something akin to the first 20 minutes of saving private ryan for him the memories not only <UNK> but tortured him he became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins his sons jump ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war in a different country the result is the same when i saw this at the <UNK> <UNK> i was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change the idealistic young men and women are not <UNK> the emotional torment of what happened in iraq and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe or have been told is right br br the tag line from the vietnam war film platoon says it all the first <UNK> of war is innocence
<START> the first thing i thought after watching mystery men was how could this movie be so <UNK> i found this movie so adorable and funny that it's status as a bomb defies logic well i hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit and you can count me <UNK> it's fans br br simply put and without giving too much away this movie does for comic books what the princess bride did for fairy tales and who framed roger rabbit did for classic cartoons that should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing <UNK> it was unfortunately signed to this is one of those cases like the iron giant where the studio had no clue what it had on it's hands rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little offbeat you won't listen to the <UNK> in the same light ever again
<START> it <UNK> bad but it <UNK> good it is just entertaining br br as a comedy which it is supposed to be it's dreadful not many laughs at all as every joke in the movie has been done a million times before br br it's a shame as all the actors in the film are great usually but none of them really do much and the ending sucks
<START> i think this movie is well done and realistic i you are used to watching hollywood action movies and use that as a standard to rate this movie you are bound to be disappointed this movie is much closer to real life than 95 of what hollywood can produce and that is what lifts it above the average action movie i have no experience with swedish military whatsoever and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act but as i have seen the making of extra i'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes this is a movie i will recommend for others to watch high quality realistic story and movie
<START> for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding <UNK> <UNK> when he is travelling with a <UNK> and when he is sitting in business <UNK> the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies funny situations again and again and again it is to predictable it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing anything br br i like felix <UNK> as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it's audience br br
<START> i was treated to a viewing of cracker bag last night before a preview screening of disney's holes i don't know who decided to show it but i'm so very glad they did cracker bag is an absolute gem a <UNK> of australia in the early 80s as seen through a child's eye the conversations between eddie and her brother were hilarious and as with the rest of the film so true to life each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my own childhood being the same age as the director probably helps a little and the audio <UNK> the feeling i only hope i get to see cracker bag again some day
<START> the <UNK> connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when <UNK> <UNK> one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young <UNK> <UNK> who is a british exchange student although in the previous film olivia <UNK> st john's foreign speech pattern is not explained it's explained here <UNK> is her cousin what's <UNK> still doing in school i guess she just likes hanging around <UNK> high even though now she's a <UNK> br br <UNK> a smart kid so of course the hood types led by adrian <UNK> have him labeled as a nerd and that's especially bad when <UNK> girl friend decides she likes <UNK> but being a nerd just isn't going to cut it br br that's when <UNK> decides to put on a modern day zorro act he gets a <UNK> <UNK> and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of <UNK> to hide his face if getting michelle <UNK> is not in the cards <UNK> won't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he's <UNK> br br grease 2 introduced michelle <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed if you saw the first grease film a much better film than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out br br in addition to <UNK> eve <UNK> sid <UNK> and <UNK> goodman all <UNK> members from the original grease return in their roles the music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original br br it's not that grease 2 is bad it's just not all that great
<START> i admit to having been a fan of the original stage production i never saw the movie version until very lately on cable and watched it with anticipation to see my memories brought alive again because i <UNK> the original show imagine my <UNK> br br this has to be the worst translation of a broadway show to film ever made they changed the story they changed the songs they lost the soul i was expecting a trip down memory lane singing to the extraordinarily touching music and the mirror at the ballet and hello twelve hello thirteen not not only did they <UNK> the music to an almost <UNK> point but they messed up the storyline adding songs and exterior <UNK> hello cassie and michael douglas not present in the original and <UNK> drama where it wasn't necessary the original had enough pathos on its own if you were a fan of the original broadway show don't bother i'm sorry i wasted my time and <UNK> my memories watching this tripe
<START> i saw <UNK> last night at the <UNK> film festival and it was one huge disappointment disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful the <UNK> of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and being a fan sounds <UNK> i'm not of <UNK> <UNK> flicks of the 70's i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out my conclusion let's stick to the classics yes the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat the actors unconvincing even dawson is empty some would say that it's a right depiction of the college world in the us that the <UNK> of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie <UNK> just like the scene where dawson gets raped it seriously lacks intensity i wasn't expecting anything <UNK> style but still aren't we suppose to feel compassion for her i didn't not for a minute she was so lame all the way and i read that the photography was impressive well it is good indeed but nothing ground breaking either i must admit that the screening at the festival wasn't so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie i couldn't help thinking 'i feel like watching <UNK> <UNK> again lol more seriously the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american canadian border in lynch's <UNK> peaks fire walk with <UNK> the crude red and blue lighting the heavy bass music the general <UNK> <UNK> atmosphere no i just couldn't get into this movie too bad
<START> if you seen rodney <UNK> previous movies and performances you'll <UNK> several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck written like a sitcom this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable <UNK> throughout from the self help doctor played by the <UNK> sexy as chopped <UNK> molly shannon to the <UNK> fat and therefore <UNK> john <UNK> the 5 wives themselves are likeable enough and if this had been done as a pilot for an action adventure series it might have worked instead it comes off like a male fantasy that's trying hard not to be politically incorrect
<START> just recently i've been <UNK> over and <UNK> this movie so much that i almost had to see it well having just seen it today the 5 8 rating is completely understandable i think that if you <UNK> something so much that it becomes a dire need it turns out not to be worth it br br sure the hills have eyes 2 has its moments it has a very cool and well developed storyline that ties in well with the actual product itself but the whole thing is so self <UNK> that it becomes so hard to follow and if it weren't for wes craven's production on this film it wouldn't be anything to do with the original remake br br but the whole thing makes you go is this supposed to be horror or comedy because there are lots of ridiculous randomly placed jump moments and stupid one liners i e there's a hand in the sh er or you <UNK> er i'll kill you all damn sons of b <UNK> and the acting god don't even remind me how bad it was br br storyline this part contains spoilers beware the movie begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby <UNK> la la and then the screen fades to black with the movie's title appearing and a monologue then we go to this office where there are randomly placed war veteran <UNK> we find that this is for this one scientist keeping track of people looking for mutants the box to keep track of audio <UNK> is gone and everyone dies after that tone setting opening you'd expect more br br then we go to this one team of military <UNK> training in <UNK> as the captain <UNK> them a good job at stupidity their last day of training is in new mexico the desert where the family in the last <UNK> had stayed because they were stuck while in training things go ultimately wrong people die and do i need to tell you any more because right now i have the attention span of a <UNK> just forcing myself to sit here and type this br br the thing that's wrong with <UNK> is that it just <UNK> work no flashbacks here and the ending is pretty safe but with a twist a stupid one that is i'm pretty sure the ultra super director's cut with a <UNK> cover and a ticket to the hills have eyes 3 will showcase all of it's alternate endings but at this point i'm not sure if i care br br so by all means if you loved the first <UNK> so much it's almost a sin not to see this then by all means see it but if else then avoid at all costs it's for your own good br br 3 10
<START> this should be my kind of movie even if it sucked it still should have been right up my alley hell i like <UNK> and allan <UNK> movies i have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien demon adventure movies let's go over why i decided to watch this in the first place br br 1 horror sci fi almost always <UNK> me 2 i'm a big fan of <UNK> and this movie does involve a rare treasure 3 super natural enemies with quality fx 4 christian slater and <UNK> i generally enjoy 5 tara reid is hot br br so this movie had potential at least in the cheese horror section of the video store but boy did it suck ass the only redeeming aspects are slater and <UNK> and not everyone finds them as entertaining as i do i mean let's face it both are melodramatic but now on to some of the many faults br br tara reid even though the movie as a whole is worse <UNK> performance is truly awful we're not just talking bad i'm talking about <UNK> tara reid for worst performance of the year i don't know if she is capable of acting but playing the museum <UNK> is simply out of her league completely watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn i mean this isn't just bad it is laughably bad oh and for those of you curious she doesn't get naked only down to a <UNK> in a silly totally unnecessary love scene br br even with <UNK> performance perhaps the movie could have worked but the plot is what <UNK> and the plot seems written by a 10 year old i hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in real time br br the storyline jumps back and forth from <UNK> childhood at an <UNK> where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened he has <UNK> of course in his adult life slater was <UNK> by some unit <UNK> a <UNK> military force that apparently <UNK> evil or something slater had to leave because he was too rebellious i guess you never really know unless it was in one of those voice overs i <UNK> out during the movie starts with slater hunting <UNK> <UNK> his latest piece after some <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> force <UNK> in selling rare <UNK> i may have the exact quote wrong but you get the idea br br there is an evil doctor that wants to <UNK> some <UNK> on earth no reason given experiments on children super demon alien human <UNK> <UNK> bullets the demon things can't stand <UNK> and of course slater and <UNK> to try to save everyone br br jesus i can't even being to <UNK> through the clichéd elements the script badly needed <UNK> to narrow the focus and provide some depth i mean why is this evil scientist so damn evil oh right humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race i guess he's infected how did that happen oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself how the hell did that happen why and where did he get the super slugs oh yes they use the old sci fi stand by of <UNK> aliens demons which <UNK> with the spine of their host of course slater is like blade half super slug powered but his slug didn't fully <UNK> due to an <UNK> shock thank god oh and the people with these <UNK> <UNK> have no idea they're half alien demon and act as good members of the community until some secret <UNK> is given <UNK> they turn killer zombies yeah we get zombies br br so lots of crap that could be entertaining but none of it is br br also the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle br br not the very worst thing you'll see but a truly bad movie
<START> i'm not sure if carpenter is looking to raise questions on abortion and make the really heavy handed and obvious point that a woman should be allowed an abortion if satan is the father but it drags on and on ron <UNK> is laughable the baby is really stupid looking basically a <UNK> with a baby head <UNK> on it you can pretty much see the material on the satan costume what a mess this episode has about five minutes of story and <UNK> minutes of tedium very very bad and the ending is just ridiculous after learning his baby is dead does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge bloody gory <UNK> no he just puts his head down and <UNK> out of the room terrible
<START> this film is one of the best shorts i've ever seen and as i make it a point to be at all the major film festivals i've seen a lot especially of what the industry considers the best i'm not a fan of <UNK> his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me his only decent performance being in lost so i generally try to avoid his films i did however happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely <UNK> this director really knows what she's doing of course you are going to get the <UNK> or just ignorant people who don't understand what <UNK> a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it but luckily from what i've seen they are in the minority when it comes to this gem br br let's not deny that the film was working on no budget and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work because that's certainly true the production value is very low but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school pretend for a moment that the budget doesn't matter if you take away a bit of the acting the sound quality which actually wasn't the fault of the filmmaker i saw this at a festival and the sound was fine i guarantee whoever made the dvd itself screwed up and the fact it was shot on mini <UNK> then what are you left with the story the visual composition and the soul of the film which are <UNK> flawless br br <UNK> can tell a story that much is clear she can write substance heavy engaging scripts better than most people in hollywood create a shot list that perfectly <UNK> that story and bring it to life in a fascinating creative way that were this higher budget might have won awards give it more experienced actors better sound post production and <UNK> instead of mini <UNK> and even the <UNK> couldn't complain this girl is incredible and keeping in mind that <UNK> was made a good few years ago she's done some amazing work since the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that and i can't wait to see the higher budget stuff she's done 9 10 stars this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker
<START> no redeeming features this film is rubbish its jokes don't begin to be funny the humour for children is pathetic and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky <UNK> to the whole miserable package sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next i couldn't enjoy the film at all although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again unlike with monsters inc finding <UNK> jungle book lion king etc which all get frequent <UNK> for <UNK>
<START> this movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply <UNK> a beautiful novel is terribly <UNK> in this film many changes have been made to the storyline presumably to <UNK> the <UNK> but what results is simply confusing the acting can't possibly overcome the script which <UNK> the characters' motives for their behavior plus the <UNK> to english does not work when everyone refers to the <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> horrible please please please read the gorgeous novel in spanish if possible don't see this film it will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience
<START> the <UNK> stars pierce brosnan as a burned out assassin he's james bond gone to seed in too tight <UNK> clothes gold chains and an ugly <UNK> our struggling assassin julian noble is in mexico trying to regain his nerve staying at the same hotel is a likable down on his luck businessman danny wright greg kinnear also trying to regain his <UNK> danny is desperate to close a deal and return to his wife in denver hope davis with good news br br noble and wright unexpectedly become friends wright convinces noble to reveal certain techniques which he demonstrates at a <UNK> noble is eventually targeted by his <UNK> and shows up in denver br br writer and director richard shepard did the q a after this delightful movie at the austin film festival shepard was also down on his luck after suffering the loss of his agent and <UNK> of recent scripts he decided to write a story no one would buy and create a character no one would want to play then pierce brosnan called brosnan <UNK> his <UNK> in this movie there is life after bond he has a wonderful flair for self <UNK> comedy don't miss it br br stay for the closing credits to read what the filmmakers say about <UNK> i look forward to more of richard <UNK> projects
<START> after reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years i must say it did not lose any of its <UNK> nor any of its eye popping martial arts action as i had remembered from my youth the story of a dying martial arts <UNK> sending his unfinished <UNK> out to find the 5 past members of his poison clan so they do not seek out a fortune which the <UNK> friend keeps hidden afraid that his last <UNK> did not have enough training he <UNK> him to <UNK> one of the five <UNK> so as to defeat the other four br br i can't say enough about the choreography or the camera work a fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made a classic
<START> one of the more satisfying western <UNK> johnny <UNK> has the <UNK> of many <UNK> made during the <UNK> of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or offbeat intelligent cinema br br johnny <UNK> is in most respects not terribly original but this actually does not count against it the success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience's expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements earlier pleasing experiences are <UNK> but with subtle or major twist that provide continuing interest the quality of the execution is also obviously important a tired <UNK> will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience br br given these <UNK> johnny <UNK> succeeds there are numerous <UNK> of elements from earlier films the setting is the brutal twisted semi <UNK> twilight world of shared by many of the best gothic family westerns made 1964 1968 such as <UNK> <UNK> massacre 1966 the plot is a combination of the basic <UNK> of dollars 1964 plot and the <UNK> films a fact not surprising as screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> leo was involved in both <UNK> leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of <UNK> in the 1960s 70s and his work helped provide much of the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to the genre along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of actors directors and screenwriters in the <UNK> plot the protagonist arrives in town <UNK> up a tense situation then <UNK> a near death followed by a <UNK> in some films like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> west 1968 it is quite literally a <UNK> the catholic <UNK> to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing especially given the <UNK> <UNK> explicit <UNK> <UNK> of the filmmakers and their films the <UNK> plot developed more fully by screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> in a series of films starring <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> protagonist chooses the interest of a community over his own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community with a healthy dash ironic <UNK> br br the relationship between carradine and johnny is clearly based on that of <UNK> <UNK> from a <UNK> of dollar 1965 the two scene of the exchange of the gun <UNK> provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two numerous films including da <UNK> a <UNK> 1968 or even el <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1967 use this relationship between an older and younger man father son older younger brother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> revolutionary as a central dynamic to the plot br br additionally there is the focus on deception and <UNK> <UNK> and mirrors that <UNK> throughout the best early <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> become literal <UNK> through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse br br what <UNK> johnny <UNK> from other <UNK> is the quality of director <UNK> <UNK> use of visual psychological space together <UNK> with the <UNK> intelligent <UNK> to forward the plot dialogue was never very important to the <UNK> and often <UNK> <UNK> thought there are exceptions such as the cynical <UNK> in <UNK> 1966 or <UNK> a <UNK> 1967 br br psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery it's <UNK> and it's description of the overall narrative situation see how the presence of the deadly samantha is felt during the beating scene  watching from the roof or from the background of the action or how johnny <UNK> samantha and <UNK> of their security and confidence in their power through his <UNK> <UNK> of their ranch hotel even bedroom this again is a theme from <UNK> finally note how there is a focus on the search for information like many elements this is borrowed from <UNK> which was ultimately based on the hard boiled mystery novel red <UNK> it is through incidental contacts wanted posters <UNK> conversations <UNK> out of windows watches left in the dust or mistaken identities and movements through the <UNK> created by the actions of <UNK> and samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative <UNK> forward to it's conclusion br br the movie was notable in it's time for what were perceived of as <UNK> in violence of course these films were hardly more violent than many american westerns what was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed which is to say that it was not the violence but it's meaning that had changed johnny <UNK> is distinct and interesting in it's use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film br br what i personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous <UNK> audiences in italy and spain to whom these <UNK> <UNK> held some significance and interest the <UNK> may have no <UNK> worth in and of itself  some <UNK> <UNK> from a <UNK> site a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> or a <UNK> piece of leather and <UNK> metal  but it is reference to some <UNK> presence lives that were significant simply because they existed while johnny <UNK> has <UNK> worth much of it's interest for me <UNK> from this connection and mystery br br top spaghetti western list http imdb com <UNK> list l <UNK> br br average <UNK> http imdb com <UNK> list l <UNK> br br for fanatics only bottom of the barrel http imdb com <UNK> list l <UNK>
<START> if deborah messing were not already cast as grace this might be a tolerable film however it is simply another story of a frustrated <UNK> with issues who hires a paid <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she reads about in a time magazine article to travel to london for her sister's london wedding how new is this plot br br neither funny nor remotely romantic the wedding date <UNK> over the storyline of <UNK> sex by bride and best man and paid for <UNK> to pass off the film as four <UNK> without hugh and definitely a dead end deal for the naive <UNK> who is ignorant to the sexual history of his bride amy adams while messing has <UNK> the repressed princess 30 something woman with a failed relationship history her neurotic and drunken moves on yet another faux beau is simply the <UNK> of her tv series if this woman is an actress get a role that does not rehash what is already on prime time br br lots of drunken female bonding <UNK> visual jokes and <UNK> in a <UNK> nice but the film is a bore with the obvious happy ending expected messing sequel divorce date
<START> this movie was just down right bad i love war movies and can normally come away from most movies and find something that i liked but this was not one of them this movie lacked substance and intensity ok i get it the <UNK> put up one hell of a fight and thats great but the story is poorly told you don't have any real connection with any of the characters and there's no real story line to follow you just go from one random scene to another nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be conveyed if you want a war movie that will keep you <UNK> and amazingly enough without battles scenes then i would suggest downfall wwii german film or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of action then i would suggest <UNK> of war korean war korean film these two movies will not let you down as winter war will
<START> i first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special as time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film which i will come to later for a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while when looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago now being 15 i <UNK> out the vhs of <UNK> bound after watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain the film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect the films nature of three completely different animals <UNK> together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground something that you all need the way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic in that you have an old <UNK> wise golden <UNK> looking after or <UNK> <UNK> the fun loving if slightly clumsy young american <UNK> with sassy the clever vulnerable but confident cat the film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen br br i don't want to sound like a soft <UNK> <UNK> when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy painfully are told by him to leave when both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow <UNK> over the horizon to the awe of all there is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15 this film may not be lord of the rings but for disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to <UNK> myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10 10
<START> man oh man what a piece of crummy film making but this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though i hate to admit it they showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time where i grew up in san jose california right on the border of <UNK> we had this thing called the g channel on our cable system and they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again <UNK> <UNK> was one of those movies i fell in lust and love with the young brooke <UNK> and loved her dopey adventures in the grand canyon in the 1940s the script makes almost no sense the direction is poor the few highlights are that henry fonda makes an appearance a lot of dialog that's so bad it's good and a nice carole king song played over the end credits maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick and hey everybody knows there ain't no gold in the grand canyon
<START> i have to admit this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in tears however i always think about things twice and instead of writing a <UNK> that would define the film as flawless and impeccable i prefer taking the risk of a closer look br br first what's first the movie has an <UNK> impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow paced movie that doesn't try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 9 11 thumbs up for this stroke of genius because unlike <UNK> world trade center this film fortunately doesn't focus on the attack itself but on the <UNK> which similar to the <UNK> of a nuclear explosion is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating the psychological impact the sheer <UNK> that 9 11 caused and the havoc it <UNK> on the american people is almost <UNK> in this movie i think <UNK> managed an <UNK> observation of the american post 9 11 society and sandler in my opinion sky <UNK> from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an oscar br br however in the film blood diamond the <UNK> <UNK> character says and i quote ah these americans always want to take about their feelings now i don't want to <UNK> their <UNK> but i sure would like to make a comparison ever since 9 11 the entire world is confronted with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of 9 11 the hollywood industry and writers such as <UNK> <UNK> more than <UNK> to 9 11 in their works now this huge amount of cultural products dealing with 9 11 turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century the number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject and i say this with all due respect blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of <UNK> br br fact is people die every day due to <UNK> actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people we have a war in iraq in afghanistan in <UNK> and lots of other countries on a daily basis we forget about the poverty the african people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the american victims of 9 11 simply because they are black and because their lives don't have much in common with our western lives africa neither has the money nor the potential to <UNK> their national <UNK> in a way america can so what i am saying is this the reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9 11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9 11 not a day goes by without a newspaper article a film or a book that <UNK> 9 11 br br in conclusion i <UNK> with charlie <UNK> but i wasn't sure whether i had the right to feel for him more than for a <UNK> who lost his entire family in the <UNK> civil war br br you catch my <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made the whole plot concerns someone trying to <UNK> the <UNK> and all the attempts made to stop them how tom <UNK> and donna <UNK> careers managed to survive this is beyond me however the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all avoid this one if possible
<START> first one was much better i had enjoyed it a lot this one has not even produced a smile the idea was showing how deep down can human kind fall but in reference to the characters not the film maker
<START> i cant describe how terrible this movie is am i the only one here who finds the way its animated <UNK> disgusting the men of <UNK> look 100 fake with their poorly colored hair that <UNK> even come close to matching what the actors look like the <UNK> looked terrible why does <UNK> walk with a bad limp why cant they <UNK> things correctly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there were other what sounded like terrible <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> characters all and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the <UNK> it was just a terrible terrible <UNK> go watch the <UNK> cartoon for a better cartoon of <UNK> work hell even the cartoon version of <UNK> is better then this <UNK> 2 10
<START> just like wine johnny dangerously gets better and better with every day this clever witty well acted film could very well stand on its own but as a parody of the gangster genre it's truly outstanding in fact it's quite obviously the best film of its kind the funniest spoof of mob movies and even the respective period although admittedly this position is probably easier to achieve when its main <UNK> are such primitive vulgar and dull <UNK> as jane <UNK> mafia
<START> this movie had so much potential a strong cast a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget i'm not sure where it all went wrong but each of those elements was wasted the story went nowhere the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring pointless waste of a film i hated it judging by the other votes i'm in the minority here and must be some sort of freak however i thought this movie was dreadful i had high hopes but was very disappointed a particular disappointment was <UNK> <UNK> character a very cocky <UNK> of sorts makes a nice idea <UNK> was confident and sexy but the character did nothing and went nowhere denzel washington played the same character he always plays enjoyable but nothing new
<START> this movie catches a lot of <UNK> but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered <UNK> version of the film that played us television and has also been <UNK> to death on vhs and dvd buy companies like <UNK> <UNK> etc this movie never had a theatrical release in the states although it was picked up by <UNK> <UNK> in 1973 in spain at the time when there was nudity involved the filmmakers shot two versions one with clothes and one with out the fully uncut english dubbed <UNK> print was titled werewolf never sleeps and seems to have been released to home video only in sweden back in the 80's it can be found on ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended my guess is <UNK> cut the film down for a r rated release that never happened in 1974 it was released by <UNK> to television titled fury of the <UNK> and the <UNK> version was used for this tv print cut to 12 years later and fury of the <UNK> pops up on home video on the <UNK> label this version appears to be what <UNK> was going to release back in '73 it's the <UNK> version with some nudity that would never pass on tv or in a pg movie there are several scenes on the <UNK> tape that play out with nudity that are <UNK> in the tv print the source for all those dollar <UNK> and vhs <UNK> but a comparison to the fully uncut <UNK> never sleeps reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version spoilers in next paragraph the scene where <UNK> has <UNK> <UNK> to the wall and <UNK> him after he transforms into the werewolf is <UNK> after <UNK> him into <UNK> she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf the werewolf responds positively to these sexual <UNK> too this scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat it's not graphic but the implied <UNK> was too much for us audiences or more likely the mpaa <UNK> is desperately in love with <UNK> and could not possess him hence her whole scheme to mind control <UNK> wife and involve her in an affair she wanted to wreck his marriage and she <UNK> this while <UNK> is in <UNK> unfortunately he returns a werewolf but this does not slow her down a bit if she can't physically have him as a man she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf this also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf <UNK> down with a woman he spots getting naked before <UNK> while <UNK> through her window this scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense in the uncut version it would seem <UNK> affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping the other cut is a complete scene of <UNK> in bed with karen and she is seen naked a very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the us version of werewolf shadow werewolf vs the vampire woman as well the film does have it's problems though for certain the director was drunk the bad stand in for the werewolf at points the atrocious english dubbing the inclusion of sequences from the first <UNK> film mark of the <UNK> aka <UNK> bloody terror and the grotesque <UNK> of that film's music score throughout etc but seen in it's original widescreen format and uncut ie werewolf never sleeps it is one of the <UNK> and most outrageous of the <UNK> werewolf series with a plot line <UNK> in it's everything but the kitchen sink approach the cut <UNK> pan and <UNK> full screen copies of this film do it no <UNK> and unfortunately that's the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen the film carries a 1970 <UNK> and i'd bet the 1972 release date on the imdb is incorrect the film <UNK> werewolf shadow aka werewolf vs the vampire woman in the series and was certainly released before werewolf shadow the ending of werewolf never sleeps fury of the <UNK> <UNK> directly into the opening of werewolf shadow offering <UNK> evidence of this sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release a perfect release would be the uncut english version but in spanish with english subtitles the english dubbing severely hurts the movie but any spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in spain during the franco era where nudity was <UNK>
<START> good times in my opinion is a must see cbs hit despite the fact that i've never seen every episode i still enjoy it it's hard to say which one is my favorite also i really love the theme song if you ask me even though i like everyone it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show throughout its entire run everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen on tv land now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> well what can i say there are b grade movies and there are b grade movies and this definitely falls into the latter however since it's obvious that even the makers of the film know that it's not a credible movie take a look at the closing credits it can be forgiven br br the plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed he accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow the killer now takes on the form of a snowman if you can believe that the snowman jack frost is after the country town <UNK> who put him behind bars in doing so jack frost ends up killing half the town br br this movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the b grade movies of the 50's this alone makes it worth watching for a laugh a movie to pass the time away
<START> whether it's a good movie or not films of this kind has to be made i think it remembers me of i love <UNK> a <UNK> puzzling movie with isabelle <UNK> being <UNK> by a young american in a mud pond in a merry sadistic <UNK> way i hope the director will go on stepping across the border as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made were not always subtle some of the scenes were <UNK> kind of <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> like a childish slapstick speaking about script and <UNK> the color of cube was black nothing is white more cheerful surprisingly than the former films of natali
<START> <UNK> up with this one on a dark and <UNK> night and prepare to be alternately amused irritated and frightened the <UNK> old plot about about a phantom train that's said to run through the lonely english countryside at dead of night may be implausible but it's a lot of fun there are some wonderful old cliches like the accident which the locals can remember but won't talk about but primarily the movie's a vehicle for comedian arthur <UNK> to showcase his particular brand of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bits <UNK> corny humor is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash over you it can be fun this is probably the best of <UNK> movies
<START> after star wars a new hope <UNK> science fiction and the empire strikes back <UNK> star wars it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two but this one really does a nice job the first part of the film <UNK> the cliffhanger left by the previous one with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the <UNK> final confrontation with the emperor when the battle begins the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy with the most at stake for the rebellion this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land including han solo <UNK> and leia the battle raging on in space including <UNK> and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star which leads up to another duel with darth vader it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war and there seems to be no escape although i think the idea of ewoks <UNK> <UNK> is a bit far fetched it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use rather than an actual threat to the <UNK> although they did have some luck fighting them there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming which may not be quite as stunning as that of the empire strikes back but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well with the light tone of a new hope and the more <UNK> tone of the empire strikes back this film really <UNK> them by combining the two in this grand finale the special edition for return of the jedi concentrated on what would have been nice to change since not much of the original really needed it fifteen years of technology <UNK> didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of <UNK> as far as the <UNK> scene is concerned and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter but other than that it was good the <UNK> non threatening <UNK> mouth was given moving <UNK> and a huge fly trap looking head that emerged which definitely added to the suspense also the disco was taken out of <UNK> palace and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration <UNK> the entire galaxy instead of just a small <UNK> village which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved it's hard to say which of the three films was the best but since it's all part of the same story the over all trilogy is like one big outstanding film a third must see for film fans
<START> this movie is a vehicle for <UNK> clone alexander <UNK> his charisma however is <UNK> to lift this movie above the level of its poor script he has little to add to his arnie act br br michael york is quite pathetic as the begging <UNK> watching him <UNK> his <UNK> act from the time that he was a better actor made me feel uneasy come on you can do better than that br br the story is full of holes and unexplained relations top of this bill is the informer of <UNK> who sounds like an american woman but from the context appears to be working for a russian government department br br although the story takes place well after the end of the communist regime all the russian characters are still very communist like in <UNK> to that <UNK> is allowed to drive a <UNK> up all <UNK> vehicle as police car the action scenes are poorly shot and therefore lack dynamics br br not a must see movie
<START> every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of <UNK> and the <UNK> state i do not think this is the point of the film at all the film parodies the <UNK> small time criminals who ran the <UNK> and the <UNK> league who <UNK> against government <UNK> but were really a <UNK> front <UNK> br br yes of course the film sends up the political social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society they want to be british and <UNK> through rather than foreign br br but i don't think they go back to being exactly like they were before
<START> this movie was like the disney channel after dark take out the aren't we naughty language and themes and you are left with dialogue and plot devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who doesn't describe saved by the bell as quality television the dialogue so laughably cliched and <UNK> dirty one might think the screenplay was the product of <UNK> aaron spelling and joe <UNK> in a room with orders to produce an <UNK> of every bad script each had ever had a hand in creating if that was roger <UNK> intention mission accomplished
<START> before watching this film i could already tell it was a complete copy of saw complete with the shack like place they were in and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the <UNK> <UNK> name on a movie would typically turn me away ugh can we say gross but i still wanted to give it a try br br starting out i was a bit interested the acting is absolutely horrible and i found myself laughing at almost each reaction from the characters especially the man that played <UNK> <UNK> was even worst but i continued to watch br br however the ending was the biggest joke of them all i seriously sat in shock thinking that was the ending is this a comedy br br i thought this pile of crap was funnier than the scary movie spoofs and that is really saying something
<START> i'm not going to waste my time writing an <UNK> and waste your time i would like to say however that all those who are uptight about this movie even being made are being totally ridiculous <UNK> you can't play that card and i mean the <UNK> patriotic card to make people not watch this movie this is a movie that expresses its free will in this country oh <UNK> i played that card even though the director is german and deserves a slap on the <UNK> every time he reaches for a camera but the world is full of controversy and its the same thing you've heard before like the <UNK> controversy it's a comedy laugh and be disgusted not disgusted all together its dark humor and obviously you don't have the heart to take it the past is past yes people remember those who were lost but its time to move on that was 7 years ago you can still watch this movie and have good moral values br br besides i'm insane and who needs a soul
<START> this movie is rich with action and gore the story line is strong enough to support the action sequences the english version needs a tad bit of help in the dubbing department but it was still enjoyable this movie ranks among my personal favorites next to hard boiled
<START> you don't need to write a script for this <UNK> outrage you just sit back and watch a pair of <UNK> women and guests duke each other out before a <UNK> audience exposure at the jerry show violent and obnoxious this cash in on the real jerry springer program reveals everything that the over rated hyped talk show doesn't show to you on the air unless you have a collection of <UNK> videos made by the producers of cops even the outside world of <UNK> reveals the most amateurish acting of the decade this goes to show you that the <UNK> show movie had a central character in a motion picture turkey change the channel rejected br br
<START> timeless musical gem with gene kelly in top form stylish direction by <UNK> minnelli and wonderful musical numbers it is great entertainment from start to finish one of those films that people watch with a smile and say they don't make 'em like they used to but they never did quite make them like this the climactic 25 minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history movie magic clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved a must see
<START> worst movie i have seen since <UNK> afternoon i suppose that this is a horror comedy i pretty much predicted every scene in this movie the special effects were not so special i believe that i could come up with as good of effects from what i have lying around the house i wish i could have something good to say about this movie but i am afraid that i don't even <UNK> should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey i do after a little thought have one thing good to say about this movie it ended
<START> i had the <UNK> of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago and outside the theater i was confronted by a camera crew from a local tv station looking for comments on the film at the time the only words that escaped my mouth were awesome just awesome i like to think i can <UNK> myself a little better than that but at the time i was somewhat incapable of doing so br br the story is intriguing and thought provoking and the acting is first rate from all the principals this film was the first one that terry gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for back with universal after his long <UNK> battle with them over brazil terry had achieved what he wanted most the final cut terry is a master <UNK> and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction it is only justice that such an individual should be <UNK> in his attempts to convey a concept unfortunately limitations still exist in such <UNK> br br the universal <UNK> edition dvd of this film is simply amazing although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box it contains among other things a director producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called the <UNK> factor and other tales of 12 monkeys it tells of some of the creative <UNK> in filmmaking including a test of <UNK> when preview <UNK> tested poorly striking the team with feelings of self doubt and despair fortunately for all of us they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success br br
<START> in the old commercial for blank audio <UNK> the tag line was is it real or is it <UNK> the same might be said for the events in this episode a <UNK> and <UNK> of the cage the first pilot of star trek mr spock has cleverly <UNK> the ship to take it to the forbidden planet <UNK> iv in order to allow capt christopher <UNK> his first captain who has been burned and <UNK> to return there why the <UNK> because to have any contact at all with <UNK> iv invites a death sentence why this is so is never explained that bothered me tremendously but if nothing else it adds to the story after he has gotten the ship to travel to <UNK> iv mr spock turns himself in to dr mccoy the senior most officer present capt kirk was off the ship for arrest and says the charge is <UNK> dr i never received orders to take over the ship what follows is a court martial in which thanks to the <UNK> we learn why it was so important besides the obvious <UNK> for capt <UNK> to get to <UNK> iv even at risk of mr <UNK> death the <UNK> the <UNK> create the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic and meg <UNK> as the keeper the head <UNK> is wonderful call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect the <UNK> having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely <UNK> upon the power of illusion are also <UNK> you can't really tell if they're male or female and it really doesn't matter this episode more than almost any other in the series makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are <UNK> that are so far advanced what a neat thing if this were so this is one of my favorite episodes and no matter how many times i've seen it i even have it on video it never fails to <UNK> me meg <UNK> looks like an alien and i do not mean that <UNK>
<START> it's hard to say sometimes why exactly a film is so effective from the moment i first came across the stone boy something told me it would be a great film in spite of that it seemed very unlikely that i'd ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself then one day while looking through the online <UNK> of my local library i saw that they had recently purchased the dvd release of this film which i'm extremely glad for because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old vhs copy could never <UNK> br br and speaking of the cinematography i must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film as a photographer who <UNK> very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in the stone boy i'm a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single <UNK> carry a film here he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs but to have juan <UNK> <UNK> behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty and you can almost never say that most films would never even expect such a thing of you scene after scene captures some detail some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away br br the director christopher cain has had a long and interesting career as far as i can gather this film is not very representative of it but sometimes to catch a director near the <UNK> of his career before all the big budgets and loss of focus there's a real subtle magic to be found cain steps back in this film lets things happen with a life of their own and then ever further much like early john <UNK> films characters are given space to breathe time to talk side stories happen because they do and that's how life is cain displays a remarkable raw even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film br br the acting ties much of this story together when people talk when they exist in this film they do so as actual people not held back by the fact that they are playing characters gina <UNK> script allows immensely talented and respected actors like <UNK> <UNK> robert duvall glenn close and <UNK> forrest to spend time simply existing whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance it all comes down with the weight of pure reality br br when you look at the actors involved or the great soundtrack by james <UNK> it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten maybe much of what makes the stone boy what it is was the time period it was made in there's this 1970s <UNK> feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood people talk of the 80s in terms of modern styles and music but that's not the 80s i lived in or remember the look of the images the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in north america i see myself in this i see how i saw the world and a film like the stone boy sees the world for how it truly is br br for more of this feeling please see br br the black <UNK> 1979 never cry wolf 1983 tender <UNK> 1983 testament 1983 places in the heart 1984 <UNK> 1987 high tide 1987 driving miss daisy 1989 the secret garden 1993 the secret of <UNK> <UNK> 1994 wendy and lucy 2008
<START> from a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate <UNK> bad acting even peter falk can't find his way finding john christmas is better left lost ms <UNK> performance is without depth or emotion as are her co stars william russ as brother hank and david <UNK> as love interest <UNK> jennifer <UNK> as <UNK> the daughter of single dad <UNK> is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing but who can blame them with material like this michael j <UNK> script is juvenile at best br br each year at this time i search the tv <UNK> and wait <UNK> for some of the really classic christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen films like miracle on <UNK> street <UNK> <UNK> delightful the shop around the corner and of course the 1951 version of scrooge there's frank <UNK> classics it's a wonderful life and meet john <UNK> hey forget the classics what about home alone or home for the holidays with holly hunter and a great performance by robert downey jr br br my present to you is by way of advice your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding finding john christmas merry christmas
<START> a little girl's dead body is found stripped of all possible means of <UNK> when it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other it is assumed to be the body of a <UNK> missing daughter after this trauma the couple <UNK> and the mother becomes addicted to <UNK> and leads a miserable existence all of this changes when one day many years later she receives a phone call from her daughter with the help of an ex cop and a reporter she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive los sin <UNK> is a mess plot wise moves at an <UNK> slow pace and is completely <UNK> the saving grace is emma <UNK> who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother the best part of the movie is the ending but i'm not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film beware of the english subtitles on the recent <UNK> release they aren't very accurate
<START> if i had realized john wayne was in this movie i would not have watched it it's <UNK> to the japanese unfortunate for hollywood and embarrassing to any thinking person but then most john wayne movies are like that hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved americans when the truth was and still is somewhat different the movie deals with the <UNK> century <UNK> of japan maybe it's hollywood that should be isolated to put it as <UNK> as possible this film is appalling <UNK> <UNK> sort of a <UNK> <UNK> with bad music
<START> i hated the first episode of this show <UNK> <UNK> so much in 1999 that i <UNK> the rest however when it came on 'the paramount comedy <UNK> i watched it in full and to my surprise found it absolutely hilarious <UNK> never judge a comedy series in its first week br br set in 1969 <UNK> stars simon pegg as <UNK> <UNK> editor of an <UNK> like underground magazine called <UNK> his friends are the feminist jill laid back alex and the half wit hugo back in the late <UNK> there was a feeling of incredible optimism amongst the young that they could change the world through the <UNK> of magazines nobody read rather than <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> towards it arthur <UNK> scripts <UNK> parody a number of that <UNK> icons <UNK> <UNK> 'the <UNK> even the infamous <UNK> <UNK> trial of the early <UNK> excellent performances from the cast julian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> strangely put me in mind of the richard <UNK> character from <UNK> about the <UNK> its a shame that there was never a second series possibly because of people like me if you missed <UNK> give it a try once you get past the dire opener you're in for a treat
<START> i haven't watched the movie yet but can't wait to see it it seems very interesting and inspirational it was one of the most interesting trailers i've ever seen the questions it <UNK> really stopped me and made me think the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the battle within thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing this film looks so fresh and smart and the actor is really hot i especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the rocky movies really clever i thought that the topic selected <UNK> <UNK> and childhood <UNK> is timeless and god knows a lot of people need it bring it on
<START> an excellent film with great performances from <UNK> <UNK> much to their <UNK> mine <UNK> arrived on station all due respect to jerry doyle but in seasons 4 5 i lost sympathy for the character it doesn't take him long to start <UNK> <UNK> who i love best of all on the show and taking charge i'm sure <UNK> could have <UNK> the <UNK> plot is fascinating especially if you believe in heaven as <UNK> does the humour <UNK> it nicely 10 10
<START> oh dear lord this movie it was horrible i am a huge fan of horror movies and most of the time horror movies other people say are bad i like the actor who played <UNK> was amazing i will say that but this plot was awful it made no sense it had way too much gore and an unnecessary and revolting sex scene at the beginning i do believe the director was trying to be <UNK> or <UNK> but it just came out awful to add to the pile of <UNK> crap they called a plot the actors besides <UNK> we're awful and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who in conclusion this movie made me sick if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway please do
<START> there are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how i felt about this film so ill keep it short br br the grinch i thought was marvellous jim carrey is a truly talented physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor in my opinion mike myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying i used to like him very much in his <UNK> world and so i married an axe murderer days but <UNK> never been fond of austin powers and the cat in the hat has just finished me off br br this film was horrible the gags were horrible inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they <UNK> amused anyone for 50 years the plot was messy messy messy its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was mom they probably could have picked a better villain than alec baldwin but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for myers ugly revolting over acted portrayal of the cat br br i mean did myers even glance at a script was one written the other actors seemed to have one but the cat just seemed to be <UNK> it br br on the other hand i would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous but unfortunately they cant save this film br br poor dr seuss the man was a genius dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy messy way br br 1 10
<START> visually speaking this film is stunning it has some delightful black comedic moments but on the whole the plot is very clichéd as is its seeming message if you're a fan of over the top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw you'll love it if you're looking for something at all high brow steer away i saw it as part of the <UNK> film festival <UNK> and i only chose it because i was looking for something disturbing ultimately it isn't disturbing just <UNK> and unpleasant to sit through if you genuinely want to be challenged go see something like the lost if you want to be <UNK> out or tell your friends about a really messed up film then this is for you
<START> or it's a bird it's a plane no look it's a disaster or no need to look up in the sky br br or ok that's enough if singer tried to make a romantic titanic like movie to crash the box office record he failed the sr structure can't do this the dark and <UNK> color scheme i would call it <UNK> <UNK> the boring usual dialogs the clown with advanced alien technology the missing fun and magic etc makes the movie completely disappointing br br it simply doesn't work br br the main thing at a character like superman is that he is a superhero that's the core the most important thing br br love trouble and a sadly lost <UNK> <UNK> can <UNK> only be a <UNK> in a 2 40 long superman movie not the whole time br br because then it is not a superman or superhero movie anymore it's like a and in this case a very bad and boring social study where every 30 minutes a person flies around br br that's a big difference br br this movie is a joke holy skywalker this is superman so give us <UNK> <UNK> and the most important thing <UNK> br br we want entertainment singer if you want to make a 2 40 long soul love trouble drama about lost and sadly people then take normal human characters and make a <UNK> remake br br they say superman returns and then <UNK> stands in the door br br maybe singer has tried to kill the legend without <UNK> but one bad movie can't do this don't give up they plan a sequel br br next time singer and warner brothers make a superhero movie not a <UNK> <UNK> soap or let it be a superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with a lot of fun and magic br br this movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover yes technically there are all sorts in yes there is a lot of small talks there are a few jokes a view action scenes etc but the only one what all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality br br it's not more than a super boring <UNK> and one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my live br br the ridiculous cast <UNK> cast them young as possible so we can make sequels in the next 25 years gives the rest kate <UNK> plays a 22 year old star reporter she's looking like 19 superman was full five years away so he slept with her 6 years ago so she was 16 looking like 13 and a daily planet reporter <UNK> i spend a night with superman warner brothers that's too much br br <UNK> is not so bad he is playing a little bit wooden but the whole movie is wooden so temporary good were <UNK> and sometimes posey the rest forget it even spacey this is not his <UNK> br br reeve hackman <UNK> were acting so easy with fun what a difference br br the jesus poses at the end are ridiculous too what the hell should that be the problem here is they mean this serious not as a joke next time <UNK> or batman or <UNK> falls and rises like jesus or angels or they speak with god directly why not they are <UNK> saving human lives every day so at least one talk with god every week should be possible oh my god br br maybe this was not the real announced movie instead it is from a bizarre dull parallel universe br br for the warner brothers this <UNK> <UNK> flick will be possibly the greatest disaster in history not only because of the money br br i understand how difficult it maybe was to create and transport some messages or feelings but showing lone lost and sadly people isn't new and thousands of movies or tv shows did it better in very old or new ones like <UNK> and the flying <UNK> there were more impressive than this flying <UNK> sorry superman of course br br singer and wb that's simply nothing in fact it's even more than nothing it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for comic superhero movies and steals us three hours of our life br br mrs <UNK> little brother very angry and green like the hulk
<START> dressed to kill is one of the best thrillers ever made its <UNK> with sex and violence make this a film for adults brian de palma once again proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story he directs many scenes without dialog and he tells much of his story strictly through the use of his visuals and <UNK> <UNK> brilliant score filmed in <UNK> the film must be seen in widescreen as de palma uses the entire <UNK> of the film to tell his story <UNK> on video dressed to kill is barely the same movie solid performances from its cast superb direction and perhaps the finest film score ever written make dressed to kill a must see
<START> the last film in <UNK> saga is a lavish spectacular looking production it is often considered the ugly <UNK> of the original trilogy but i think it is a notch above episode iv and just a notch below episodes iii and v in fact i think it is the third best film in the 6 part saga as far as i'm concerned it is still a <UNK> entertaining film it is not a movie with a beginning climax and ending the film's <UNK> <UNK> with only one goal in its mind bring closure to <UNK> universe there is an air of <UNK> attached to the whole thing which makes the film a little too sentimental but emotionally rewarding also it is a lot of fun new characters are introduced and old ones face new unexpected challenges <UNK> and <UNK> provide as usual great comic relief leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo and luke is still a great character to identify with again it is <UNK> and <UNK> inner conflict what gives the saga its <UNK> <UNK> aggressive imagination is still very much apparent and the film's themes of loyalty hope and redemption <UNK> strongly i'm glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> because this film is a great <UNK> to a long fascinating and captivating saga not a perfect movie but fun in the best <UNK> style
<START> well to answer one <UNK> question of why doesn't anyone remember this film it's because really not that many people saw it in 1978 and it's not been shown much on tv since if it's on video <UNK> be news to me even in the era of sometimes mindless comedies that was the '70s movie goers had the <UNK> to avoid this film unless they love billy <UNK> paul <UNK> or joan rivers that much br br paul <UNK> was funnier on <UNK> or hollywood <UNK> than here joan rivers at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel jokes about singer karen carpenter's lack of weight <UNK> <UNK> joan it also seems like every somewhat famous name from the era is in the cast most surprising is doris roberts later of everybody loves raymond br br anyhow a somewhat good idea for a storyline a man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here with help from a male friend crystal gets set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity but because she was on top instead of him he gets pregnant a commentary on women taking positions of power away from men br br <UNK> stomach grows he goes through all the female emotions and related feelings unfortunately he is now a socially misunderstood <UNK> he's attacked by a mob who wants him <UNK> out i guess br br he's forced to go into <UNK> to have his baby in a <UNK> or if you will a <UNK> god only knows where it may have <UNK> from <UNK> it turns out no shock here to be a girl br br everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettable the humor is high school level or less br br 2 stars for a good idea and a few good touching relevant moments w billy crystal ignore the rest of <UNK> test it <UNK> big time br br i can't believe <UNK> mcdowell signed on either end
<START> edmund lowe who reminds me somewhat of warren william heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a <UNK> pace and runs just a little over an hour br br douglas <UNK> plays the unlucky <UNK> who appears to be intent on his own demise <UNK> anyone and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast everyone from virginia bruce kent smith <UNK> <UNK> gene <UNK> jessie ralph <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and h b warner as an added bonus there's <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> detective and furthermore get a load of that art <UNK> set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film br br on the plus side the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable <UNK> of not being too <UNK> it's all suddenly clear to detective philo vance and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of <UNK> suspense br br nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner
<START> i discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it it is not a strictly <UNK> film it is loosely based on the facts but i found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness and michel <UNK> gives an unforgettable performance as dr <UNK> br br there are many memorable images in this movie <UNK> traveling through the night like a vampire his black cloak <UNK> behind him is almost iconic there are also several touches of <UNK> <UNK> crooked <UNK> <UNK> the stairs leading from the <UNK> where the butchered remains of his victims <UNK> <UNK> reminds me of some scenes from <UNK> br br but i found the primary appeal of this movie to be <UNK> the soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits accompanied by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small <UNK> and there is a <UNK> background noise of knives being <UNK> somewhere as well as a <UNK> playing eerie tunes on a saw there are animal noises as well the <UNK> keeps a goat unseen cats <UNK> and later in the film we see hapless cattle being <UNK> through an <UNK> the whole atmosphere is unsettling with overtones of violence and slaughter br br not only animals but human voices are often heard the screams of <UNK> victims <UNK> patients in his waiting room <UNK> by a listening device just the same as the suspected <UNK> after the war are <UNK> in their cells even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them when <UNK> goes to see <UNK> <UNK> we hear her singing as she works her voice <UNK> in the theater before we ever see her and even when she does appear she is often filmed from behind her voice calling out to her husband whose voice calls out to her in conversation <UNK> voices echo in large <UNK> and their owners when seen at all are photographed at a distance so we cannot actually see them speaking this is a ghost story and these are the voices of ghosts many of them <UNK> future victims br br yet <UNK> himself is often only a voice his frightening laughter echoes as he <UNK> from the camera throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody in a way he is as much a ghost as those he murders he is always <UNK> busy <UNK> from <UNK> to <UNK> never at rest but his activity is that of a machine lifeless and <UNK> it is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied paris <UNK> alone is <UNK> he is amused enthusiastic angry irritated <UNK> but never afraid unlike those real people he <UNK> to their deaths it is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical <UNK> including a <UNK> motion machine a true detail from the book he did claim to have invented many machines he is a sort of <UNK> motion machine himself and mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film from the opening giant wheel in the movie house to <UNK> <UNK> with its <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the sound of <UNK> knives to the <UNK> he keeps <UNK> up to play music before he makes a kill even his routine with his victims is mechanical write a note to your wife let me disguise you before you leave you need a <UNK> <UNK> casablanca <UNK> like a well <UNK> machine the routine is always the same just as the record is always the same br br <UNK> the author says that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that <UNK> so heavily against <UNK> at his trial his system was as smooth and efficient as a nazi concentration camp and this may be why the movie <UNK> a subplot of <UNK> involvement with the french <UNK> and the <UNK> nazis unfortunately it doesn't quite work as part of the story because it's very hard to figure out just what <UNK> is doing for the <UNK> or what is going on when he ends up at their <UNK> in the middle of the night <UNK> of bodies hiding stolen goods it's hard to say and harder to believe it's not likely the state would turn to a <UNK> like <UNK> br br but it does remind us of the <UNK> of evil people <UNK> is a <UNK> and a murderer but he is also a devoted father and husband just as we learned that hitler loved dogs and that nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men so we have to recognize that <UNK> could commit <UNK> horrors and yet also function normally his insanity is easily <UNK> by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in paris when killing robbing and disappearing are happening all around nobody pays attention as <UNK> <UNK> more corpses on the pile
<START> this movie is probably the worst i have seen bad acting bad script bad everything comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting both cyborg van damme 1989 and nemesis olivier <UNK> 1993 are much better and seems more <UNK> in both story and directing and still it's albert <UNK> who has directed these two as well br br the story is not original the world has become a terrible place possibly due to an <UNK> disaster or a nuclear war and people live under medieval circumstances a special breed of robots <UNK> live on human blood and there's the story the <UNK> need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there prophecy and the humans need someone to stop them one girl together with a robot kris kristofferson built by the creator of the <UNK> has been <UNK> by destiny to save mankind br br in this movie the director tries some hong kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and <UNK> far the movie fails miserably in this attempt br br i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new worst ever movie to relate to and to fans of the genre i recommend cyborg since i think it's a very <UNK> movie with quite a high entertaining factor and if you can't stand van damme then check out nemesis br br i rated this movie 1 10
<START> this is so bad so very very bad the acting is the biggest joke in history don't even bother to see it i did <UNK> it after 20 min and it was just as disappointing in the end as in the beginning i really don't understand peoples taste i'm a horror movie fan and i'm not <UNK> but i do have a limit maybe it was a quarter of a star better then the beginning of the <UNK> but that's it so i recommend you don't waste the 15 minutes you'll be able to watch i mean the acting is better done by monkeys and the big brother with the <UNK> role is just awful don't they pay characters in c movies no i must say it's not the first time i think a horror movie is bad but it's absolutely one in my down ten movies and it will be <UNK> places with portrait of a vampire cabin by the lake the <UNK>
<START> first i'd like to excuse my bad english br br i'm not a hostel hardcore fan but i liked that movie nevertheless live feed however sucked big time i have never seen a gore movie with superb acting but hey who's surprised the acting in live feed was well not there i've seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something <UNK> but not by students in media or acting school this was no class at all and what about the story a really sad rip off on hostel and what about the gore what about the <UNK> torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold <UNK> that was the most disappointing about the hole movie short quick and no edge more like an execution rather than a torture <UNK> there where <UNK> of blood but it didn't even look real the <UNK> and the violence reminded more of <UNK> than hostel or any of the saw movies and <UNK> was fun <UNK> i laughed at live feed a couple of times but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun br br so instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching live feed watch anything else
<START> br br film dominated by <UNK> haired barbara steele it was seen when i was seven or eight and created permanent images of <UNK> <UNK> men and women stalking a castle seeking blood steele is an icon of horror films and an <UNK> beauty and the views of the walking dead pre date romero's night of the living dead <UNK> <UNK> them in my mind br br i don't see the connection between this film and the haunting which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present la <UNK> macabre is a b movie without <UNK> daring you to fall in love with barbara steele and suffer the consequences there's no such draw to <UNK> overwrought claire bloom the comparisons to the haunting are superficial br br and no this movie does not need to be remade not only is it a product of the sixties but the large <UNK> of talentless <UNK> in hollywood cannot <UNK> <UNK> formula for terror that formula is based on one <UNK> factor good writing low grade classics like castle and <UNK> poe films with r <UNK> and <UNK> out of the past share a <UNK> of strong writing it's simple get a real writer like richard <UNK> or steve <UNK> and let them put a plot into today's cinematic mess besides that let hollywood attempt some original material for a change and stop <UNK> the obviously superior product of the past
<START> you can debate <UNK> acting talent or even his choice to parody his own life in this film there is no debate about his musical talent either then or now he seems like a shadowy has been twenty years later but the music remains relevant and fantastic br br having lived through the hype of this movie <UNK> high school <UNK> i can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time from <UNK> gore <UNK> wife trying to <UNK> little <UNK> and every thing else under the sun via the <UNK> parents music <UNK> center to every air band at the time <UNK> prince it was the absolute <UNK> thing out for a few weeks at least prince was bigger than madonna and michael jackson br br we all waited for the film and were <UNK> excited when it premiered it didn't disappoint everyone was caught up i was an mtv <UNK> at the time they actually played music then all the time prince played at least once or twice an hour i must qualify this commentary by saying that at that time my favorites were billy idol <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> flock of <UNK> and others in the punk new wave <UNK> the music of prince at the time <UNK> all types and styles one of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and <UNK> now is that it was <UNK> big then all the things that remind you of the 80's were iconic then it was mainstream and it seems like a <UNK> now it got so popular that it became ridiculous it's like the <UNK> <UNK> commercial for <UNK> <UNK> br br it looks stupid now because everyone was caught up in it sadly kind of like a bizarre purple <UNK> or something anyway i hope this gave you all a little insight
<START> what could have been an engaging and emotionally charged character study is totally <UNK> by the predictable factor fox is ok as <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> trained musician who dreams of playing with the walt disney orchestra until his <UNK> with <UNK> drive him into the street and ultimately <UNK> row looking for a good story to boost his <UNK> career reporter steve lopez robert <UNK> downey gets to know him and tells his story taking every element of the classic how we hit the <UNK> movies <UNK> very <UNK> from a beautiful mind taking the bogus feel good attitude of films like rocky you pick the sequel number and <UNK> up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie it is corny trite utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments i hate to say it but this is the kind of movie that if you say you hated it people will give you bad looks i really wish i could say something positive about this film but i really can't the acting <UNK> it somewhat but not enough for me to give it more than one star strictly made for tv movie stuff not worth your time
<START> one of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private <UNK> decide to take an <UNK> swim in their underwear rather <UNK> for 1931
<START> fay grim is a true example of what i call a completed puzzle film it has all the pieces of acting direction storyline and entertainment value they all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece fay grim br br this film follows a single mother fay grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing soon the cia contacts fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 <UNK> of her husband <UNK> these <UNK> were filled with <UNK> of his long past in the cia and his involvement with countries and their government <UNK> fay is sent to find these <UNK> in return to release her brother from prison and is sent on a cat and mouse chase all over europe to recover these <UNK> and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about br br parker posey had already been an actress i liked after i watched her in the oh in <UNK> and best in show she brought <UNK> to these two comedic roles of hers but fay grim was a far different role than the other two movies posey made me believe what was happening on screen i felt for her i <UNK> for her and i wanted to know more she grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you can't stop thinking about what is happening to her br br i haven't seen any other previous works by writer director hal hartley but i believe i will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as fay grim was br br if you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a dvd i'd highly urge you to choose fay grim if you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely
<START> many of the american people would say what to my opening comment yes i know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the master <UNK> kurosawa but if you analyze this movie my comment is right we have the <UNK> who goes to the town searching for help against a band of <UNK> who wants to steal the <UNK> of the village the great difference is the way that the story takes our <UNK> a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs heroes please watch again this incredible movie the seven samurai obviously and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the masterpiece of <UNK> kurosawa a tip is the 13th warrior with antonio <UNK> michael <UNK> copied the story to wrote his best <UNK> but he didn't found the third foot of the cat
<START> jason <UNK> stars as <UNK> a psychotic jewelry store thief whose grip on reality is <UNK> <UNK> according to the dvd <UNK> with his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the duo make off with a <UNK> of cash a result of a tip off from beautiful <UNK> <UNK> laura harris her reward to <UNK> a ride with the out of control duo so that she can meet her long lost father francis stephen <UNK> but he's on a <UNK> quest to even a score with his former boss louis <UNK> jr and has the cops hot on his trail rage murder and revenge are about to <UNK> stay out of their way br br the <UNK> 4 28 00 <UNK> <UNK> jason <UNK> laura harris stephen <UNK>
<START> i cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers they are too critical perhaps because they are stuck in the past i would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen basic instinct 1 perhaps someone very young i left the cinema feeling glad that i had not been <UNK> by the imdb reviewers 14 hours later i am still trying to find flaws in the plot but i cannot think of anything serious my advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mind br br it follows a similar pattern to basic instinct 1 but the plot is less confused it still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way sharon stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years extremely well this remains her defining role david <UNK> was satisfactory even though he is no michael douglas of the supporting cast i particularly liked david <UNK> as the police detective
<START> filmed in a documentary style but you can pretty well tell participants had been <UNK> a recently divorced wannabe film maker <UNK> <UNK> sees a chance to <UNK> up his love life and step into the movie <UNK> at the same time he <UNK> to make a documentary piece about finding love by filming twenty dates including <UNK> the comedy is <UNK> at best the rest is <UNK> after <UNK> also taking part are richard <UNK> robert <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> wagner trying for credibility the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is talked into a cameo this will suffice as a <UNK> on how not to get a satisfactory date
<START> a disney movie that <UNK> to do something different should at least be awarded for effort holes doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp for the first time events are not explained in details the flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer i must admit that at first i was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie but soon i realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in <UNK> <UNK> one example where <UNK> is forbidden to teach zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character like learning to read won't contribute to that holes is a movie that is smart and beautiful a must watch
<START> this is one very dire production the general <UNK> has always been that while princess margaret may have been <UNK> and <UNK> and may have <UNK> in the excess of luxury at her <UNK> she was a very beautiful young woman here was the <UNK> weakest point the actress failed to get that across it also appeared that the production budget couldn't stretch to a <UNK> from the outset the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in <UNK> look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush the actor playing the duke of <UNK> appeared to have prepared for his role by watching <UNK> <UNK> imitate prince charles and was <UNK> br br the production was a flaw ridden cliché ridden embarrassing load of rubbish i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas
<START> a good cast and they do their best with what they're given but the story makes no sense the characters' actions are inexplicable and there are too many moments of unintentional humor as when a man is killed by being <UNK> with pieces of a <UNK> record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and <UNK> off the scene when the two witch and her victim played by the same actress are in the house together sets up like a 3 stooges routine and the plot begs the question if the witch wants to possess this other woman's soul why doesn't she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase not to be missed is christopher <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> explanation of the <UNK> <UNK> the ancient <UNK> they wee <UNK> they expected the body to last through eternity like a used car that you <UNK> up but the <UNK> they knew you couldn't drive in the <UNK> you had to get out and walk huh the ending is absolutely <UNK> seems like they just ran out of film
<START> i would imagine that if steve mcqueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start wanted dead of alive the same year this film came out or be in the magnificent seven two years later he would not have done it but he did and we are the <UNK> for it br br sure it's a camp classic horror the way it was meant to be for the drive in theater it's fun and nostalgic br br it is interesting that the last lines of the film were br br lieutenant dave at least we've got it stopped steve andrews yeah as long as the <UNK> stays cold br br they never would have imagined <UNK> years ago that the <UNK> would be <UNK> the blob will soon return
<START> i really wanted to like the <UNK> book intriguing story interesting character <UNK> ewan <UNK> in the utterly glorious altogether unfortunately i hated every minute of it <UNK> got so <UNK> with presenting the movie uniquely and not to the film's benefit i won't even get into vivian <UNK> abysmal acting br br you get distracted from the story with 4 billion <UNK> windows and <UNK> that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that's playing it seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot and got <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that have nothing to do with anything it's a bit like presenting a john singer <UNK> portrait in a <UNK> hallmark frame that says grandma loves me in big <UNK> letters br br this movie seems to be a <UNK> of the director <UNK> ego instead of what it could have been <UNK> and <UNK> beautiful in another director's hands <UNK> coppola it could have been a masterpiece in <UNK> hands it's best <UNK> to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously
<START> i think that this movie is very fun and horror i love elvira and i like this movie it's very pity that second part of this wonderful movie had no success because it very funny like a first part i also regret that besides of this movie i have no seen <UNK> peterson in other films i think that she is amazing actress with big potential i hope that <UNK> see her in future in the third part of <UNK> adventures <UNK> peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses <UNK> if you read this know that you are the best and my heart will be with you you can rely on me what can i more add this is cool and classical movie
<START> this movie is a modest effort by spike lee he is capable of much more than this movie get on the bus while <UNK> anti racist does nothing but <UNK> whites and <UNK> the black status <UNK> the plot of this movie is about a group of black men who travel on a bus to louis <UNK> million man march the bus has every type of person you could imagine gay muslim <UNK> and the uncle tom he is thrown off the bus though there was one only white person on the bus he was accused of being a racist the minute he got on the bus to drive despite him being a jew and the fact that he explained is situation he ended up being a racist and leaving the bus i hate to say it but films like this need to realize their own <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> this should not be seen as a triumph but a sad <UNK> you may think i am a racist for writing this but i mean well better luck next time spike
<START> just cause takes some of the best parts of three films cape fear a touch of evil and silence of the <UNK> and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film br br sean connery is a liberal law professor married to a former assistant district attorney kate <UNK> and he's a <UNK> against capital punishment blair <UNK> grandmother ruby dee <UNK> connery at a <UNK> and <UNK> him to handle her <UNK> appeal he's sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl br br when connery arrives in this rural florida county he's up against a tough sheriff played by laurence fishburne who's about as ruthless in his crime solving as orson welles was in touch of evil br br later on after connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he's <UNK> he's feeling pretty good about himself at that point the film takes a decided turn from touch of evil to cape fear br br to say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly the cast uniformly turns in some good performances special mention must be made of ed harris who plays a <UNK> <UNK> like serial killer on death row with <UNK> he will make your skin crawl and he starts making connery <UNK> some of those comfortable liberal premises he's been <UNK> his <UNK> on many a confirmed liberal i've known has come out thinking quite differently once they've become a crime victim br br of course the reverse is equally true many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteed br br criminal justice is not an end but a process and a never ending one at that for all society i guess if just cause has a moral that would probably be it
<START> a bit quirky and <UNK> bad taste but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching a wheelchair bound young woman jane <UNK> helena bonham carter is teamed with a reluctant <UNK> richard kenneth branagh richard is an artist that <UNK> of human flight he builds an airplane in his garage and <UNK> to fly it he wants to <UNK> his own troubled life by taking care of the independent dying jane who suffers from an <UNK> disease that has all but left her speechless and very little <UNK> skills wheelchair bound and full of spirit her last dying wish is to loose her virginity she offers herself to richard who won't help her directly but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a <UNK> to do the deed i found this flick ambitious and humorous even in this role carter has a certain charisma and <UNK>
<START> well pop this into the dvd waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back and find out br br acting what acting br br production values production values br br story don't get me started br br after many years of <UNK> on imdb i never thought i would see a film so bad that i truly wished for a lower rating than one i always have found at least a reason or two to see merit if only in the intent or the effort of the writer the director the cast or the producer br br in this case they're all the same guy who really needs to get a handle on the fact at least as demonstrated by this worthless waste of video tape that he has no talent i mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this were some junior high <UNK> production for his first cinema class but the <UNK> artist behind this dreck was twenty six at the time of this <UNK> br br just how did this ever get made who in their right mind ever wrote a check for this moreover don't let the box cover fool you there's not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good exposure of the hunk on that cover br br two final items there was one second when this film had redeeming value the aforementioned talent gets <UNK> <UNK> out by his lover i <UNK> and i did learn one thing from this film there are times when something is so very bad that it is indeed truly very funny but not in any comical manner it's just sadly humorous very sadly humorous
<START> there is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer actress <UNK> <UNK> she is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge directed by simon <UNK> the film stars <UNK> <UNK> as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her <UNK> <UNK> oh but not by conventional means she plans a total <UNK> war and <UNK> bad girl <UNK> <UNK> as her weapon of choice she wants <UNK> as <UNK> to get close to her ex the handsome but dull <UNK> <UNK> who should stick to music to embarrass him and ruin his life david <UNK> is good in his few brief moments and former crime story star anthony <UNK> is given virtually nothing to do but <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful then evil and <UNK> she also handles vulnerable and maybe a bit psychotic well she's also quite hot though there's no naughty bits show so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at but the performance is kind of wasted in this movie which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend
<START> based on a true story this series is a gem within its kind the slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village br br in the diamond mining town of <UNK> in brazil the diamond <UNK> <UNK> by the king of <UNK> is the ultimate authority having grown up in the relative security of his house the young and beautiful <UNK> da <UNK> finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a <UNK> in town <UNK> to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter in a desperate <UNK> to save herself <UNK> steals the <UNK> <UNK> by the diamond <UNK> for the king <UNK> to use them to escape the king's army arrives to collect the <UNK> the very next day however and when the <UNK> turns up missing the diamond <UNK> is led away in chains his family <UNK> and thrown out in the street with only the clothes on their backs martin the diamond <UNK> son <UNK> vengeance <UNK> and the other slaves however are sold at <UNK> and <UNK> ends up in the home of the sergeant major an old man who bought her solely to <UNK> his lust to the town of <UNK> however comes the new diamond <UNK> the elegant and ruthless <UNK> <UNK> immediately struck by <UNK> beauty he <UNK> the sergeant major into selling her to him and thus begins a love story filled with danger intrigue and passion between a <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> slave girl who rises to one day become queen br br the series is filled with rich details of the <UNK> beliefs <UNK> politics fashion etc etc and it really manages to <UNK> your attention for every minute at times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor full of suspense and unexpected twists <UNK> da <UNK> is definitely a must i wish i could buy the whole series on dvd

<START> the film opens with bill <UNK> melvyn douglas telling a story about how his best friend make that client jim blandings cary grant and his family are tightly packed into a small new york apartment with not enough closet space and way too few <UNK> when <UNK> wife muriel myrna loy wants to <UNK> the apartment advertising <UNK> jim falls in love with or falls for an ad for a house once he's purchased the house bills and frustration pile up <UNK> as everything that can go wrong with the building of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> goes wrong br br one of three <UNK> between grant and loy this is a charming little comedy not very <UNK> with no real great message but a great way to spend an hour or two the laughs are there right from the start when the alarm clock goes off and jim tries to shut it off only to be <UNK> at every turn by muriel the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros and that's just what grant and loy give us polished performances simple chemistry and a lot of fun myrna loy is in a pretty <UNK> role it's evident that <UNK> character jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting and grant as always pulls both off with remarkable <UNK> but she gives muriel a colour life and bite that only myrna loy can give a character melvyn douglas plays <UNK> amusement to perfection as well never hitting a single wrong note br br one of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when bill gets himself locked in the <UNK> <UNK> and jim goes to <UNK> him only to get everyone trapped inside every little problem that pops up for the blandings <UNK> project including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for <UNK> seems to bring together everything that could go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch 8 10
<START> <UNK> as the most offensive movie ever guaranteed to offend everyone guess what it worked i'm offended that we <UNK> out money to rent this two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us it was by far the worst movie i've seen since hollow man i generally avoid the crappy ones but got sucked into this one we have since beaten the <UNK> who suggest we rent it and his movie picking <UNK> have been <UNK> there is nothing remotely funny about this movie even the adventures of <UNK> scene was <UNK> at best color me p ed thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason no it just sucked never watch this for any reason whatsoever not even with <UNK> amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny that's saying alot please for the love of all that is holy if you <UNK> your sanity never view this movie it's many things stupid pointless and worthless to name a few but the main thing it was aiming for <UNK> funny it failed miserably crash and burn
<START> okay let's start off by saying this film is not an exact rendition of the crimes and legal pursuit of <UNK> <UNK> while it may have been official policy in the <UNK> that the <UNK> had no serial killers in <UNK> the legal system had handled others and killer x as he was actually called was already being sought when <UNK> brought <UNK> onto the case in fact as soon as it was realized they had multiple murders on their hands the authorities assigned a task force of dozens of officers to track down and end the killing spree of a man that did not fit into what is perceived as normal serial killer <UNK> it's good the director and writers consistently remind the viewer that the story is only based upon actual events for a <UNK> this ain't br br spoilers follow br br that said this is a damn good example of a fast paced hollywood style thriller that still gets across the <UNK> of what happened it is easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of events to make for compelling viewing yes <UNK> raped and murdered both children and adults both male and female yes shoddy lab work set him free to continue killing for years yes innocent men were accused of the murders and <UNK> to their crimes at police <UNK> yes the gay community was <UNK> while the crimes were being committed albeit with <UNK> committed assistance and yes <UNK> was brought to confession not by the <UNK> of the special <UNK> <UNK> but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named <UNK> though <UNK> was really nowhere near the <UNK> <UNK> portrayed in this film <UNK> about truth and <UNK> aside all of these events are <UNK> in a manner that consistently <UNK> the tension and fear br br it doesn't hurt that director and co writer chris <UNK> has a pitch perfect cast stephen <UNK> growing emotional involvement in the killings and developing expertise in <UNK> clues donald <UNK> <UNK> manipulation of the soviet party <UNK> and subtle spine that becomes evident when it is needed jeffrey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of rage hidden by a fear filled demeanor max von <UNK> <UNK> excitement at being part of a criminal investigation all enhance the sharp dialog and crisp editing in ways that cannot be <UNK> br br taken for what it is citizen x is almost pitch perfect the almost due to one moment of self <UNK> at the end that just does not fit highly recommended as fiction well told not fact being presented but considering the <UNK> serial killer movies that hollywood usually <UNK> out that's good enough for me
<START> valentine is a horrible movie this is what i thought of it br br acting very bad <UNK> <UNK> can not act the other's weren't much better br br story the story was okay but it could have been more developed this movie had the potential to be a great movie but it failed br br music yes some of the music was pretty cool br br originality not very original the name <UNK> <UNK> recognize <UNK> br br bottom line don't see valentine it's a really stupid movie br br 1 10 br br
<START> picture the scene a <UNK> alien landscape twin <UNK> <UNK> the blood red sky the <UNK> lands and out steps the doctor a middle aged man in a victorian <UNK> coat and rose his companion from earth a <UNK> of recognition crosses his face well i never its the planet <UNK> 7 where i fought the <UNK> <UNK> they tried to use giant <UNK> to take over the planet the girl <UNK> the air can't we go doctor i don't like the look of this place i keep thinking we're being watched the doctor <UNK> a <UNK> finger don't be silly girl i wonder if the king and queen of <UNK> city remember me from my last visit come along rose come along he <UNK> off the girl struggles to keep up high on a hill sinister red eyes regard them with hatred br br that was not how <UNK> began back in 2005 and thank heavens for that say i unfairly <UNK> at the time of its original u k broadcast <UNK> can now safely be regarded as a landmark episode putting <UNK> <UNK> back where it <UNK> as one of the b b c 's <UNK> <UNK> the mistakes made by the <UNK> t v movie were well <UNK> instead of trying to <UNK> the new <UNK> into existing <UNK> it represented a fresh start for the series beginning with shop girl rose tyler <UNK> <UNK> going about her daily routine one day she goes to the basement to find a man named wilson and then the trouble begins <UNK> come to life and attack her it is only through the <UNK> of a mysterious stranger christopher <UNK> that she is saved br br the story slight though it may be is more than adequate as a starting point for the series the <UNK> are of course an old villain this was their first appearance since 1971 but no references are made to their past appearances another wise move the finale effectively <UNK> the famous scene in <UNK> from <UNK> when shop window <UNK> <UNK> to life as the doctor christopher <UNK> lacked the <UNK> of his predecessors <UNK> a modern leather jacket to the doctor's traditional period clothes but this made him more accessible to the show's hoped for new audience <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her critics by making a big impression as <UNK> also good was <UNK> clarke as her boyfriend <UNK> br br yes there was an added emphasis on special effects but then there needed to be the <UNK> sets and unconvincing monsters of the past have no place on 21st century television what is more important is how good a script this is ten million people tuned in to see the new doctor br br <UNK> <UNK> was back and back with a bang
<START> i really cant think of anything good to say about this film not a single thing the script is a nightmare the writer <UNK> the line between chemical and <UNK> traits and <UNK> seem to understand the difference you'd think they would at least get a technical <UNK> the performances were bad by most of the cast although i dont really blame them the material really stinks the editing was equally bad i'll just stop now its all bad 2 10
<START> in all honesty if someone told me the director of <UNK> <UNK> series of unfortunate events city of angels and <UNK> was going to do a neat little low budget indie film and <UNK> it be real good i'd say that person must be joking but that's what director brad <UNK> did and it was really good br br 10 items or less has a similar <UNK> to films like before sunrise lost in translation or more recently once it involves the chance meeting of two people who if <UNK> didn't put them there they'd probably never cross paths or if they did they wouldn't say word one to each other like those films 10 items or less focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters come to understand each other and build on each other's strengths and weaknesses br br the story involves morgan freeman playing an <UNK> actor who goes to research his role as a <UNK> store employee for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control ends up spending the day with the lady in the 10 items or less lane played by paz vega she has a rotten marriage and is hoping to land a new job as a secretary initially <UNK> character just needs a lift home after spending time with her however he wants to get to know her and maybe even offer her some advice br br brad <UNK> builds the characters almost entirely through the <UNK> between freeman and vega the plot is merely a setup for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the film's 80 minute duration freeman has fun with his character as he appears an <UNK> in lower class world that <UNK> character scarlett <UNK> vega in the meantime grows beyond the stubborn <UNK> clerk upset with her life's situation looking to move on br br there a couple things that really stood out in this film first of all <UNK> has probably taken note from independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and doesn't fall into any hollywood <UNK> it's a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film it works even though the situation itself does seem a little <UNK> br br i am also impressed with the performances while <UNK> presence gives this film credibility from the get go he shows a certain amount of charm and fun not usually seen from him paz vega meanwhile is <UNK> herself for a breakthrough in us film sometime in the future i loved her in <UNK> and she's equally good here as the tough no nonsense scarlet towards the end of the film she successfully conveys the growth of her character i'm looking forward to seeing her in more films br br overall 10 items of less functions best as a character piece well scripted and directed by brad <UNK> he hasn't done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big hollywood films yet there's certainly an artist at work here and am anxious to see if he'll take this road again
<START> yet another british romantic comedy which audiences all over the world seem to have a <UNK> <UNK> for this feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre all the classic clichéd scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate <UNK> to running after <UNK> trains to <UNK> one's love the characters are one dimensional caricatures save for love <UNK> who manages to bring some <UNK> to the film things <UNK> to spiral out of control in the <UNK> department as the film progresses our good natured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending if you're looking for a bridget jones <UNK> hill kind of experience you won't find it here
<START> the first scene in <UNK> <UNK> has a baby <UNK> into a <UNK> face for this movie that's witty a nasty mean spirited <UNK> it's inept on so many levels it <UNK> belief john ritter is the kind father who <UNK> the child from hell and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding <UNK> of one note annoying performances and <UNK> humour and what the <UNK> jack warden doing in this mess <UNK> directed by dennis <UNK> and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it's done with the <UNK> the movie is made so badly it's quite a bizarre experience but never mind all that the <UNK> of the whole thing is michael oliver the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen  believe me you will want to <UNK> him right in the mouth
<START> wow what an episode after last week seeing <UNK> constantly making cameos about the friendship of annie and <UNK> i almost <UNK> but that was nothing until seeing <UNK> <UNK> after being fired seeing her <UNK> around on her cast <UNK> out <UNK> and screaming for someone to get her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing ever on reality tv she continued to scream at people off set to get her clothes all of them like someone else would wear one of her hideous outfits <UNK> you are like 40 years old and you still throw temper <UNK> then joan starts calling annie and <UNK> every name in the book and gets up and <UNK> the show both rivers are spoiled <UNK> who were only left on the show this long to keep ratings up <UNK> crying and <UNK> to do an exit interview just proves to america what everyone thought you are a spoiled baby <UNK> <UNK> i can't get my way i love how annie told the cameras she could manipulate <UNK> to think her way and then did exactly that <UNK> is by far the <UNK> contestant and clearly deserves to win the whole game
<START> lost holds something interesting for everyone you can say an awfully lot about this series and an awfully lot has been said so i won't be the one to spell it all out for you again just read the persons who loved it and you'll know why you want to watch it the nice thing about this series is that its totally new there are not much movies and even fewer series based on the theme of only suspense but lost lives up to the theme with pride its all about the unexplained and if you combine that with an exotic location nice plot twists an excellent cast and a good format present and past combined in single episodes you'll have a series in which every episode is a story on its own but part of a greater telling you want to have all the insights of the characters you want to see the overall picture and you'll want to know where the writers are taking you the result of that is that its a series which does not let you go on a more <UNK> note the series went under a bit in season 2 probably due to its own success it is well known that lost was only written for one season originally and when the overwhelming success followed the writers were overwhelmed too in my opinion they made the mistake to add even more mysteries and in a higher pace in season 2 then to solve the ones or partially at least the ones of season 1 at the end of season 2 you ended with a big <UNK> of secrets plot twists and unexplained <UNK> but there is only so much a viewer can take the difference between season 2 and 3 however was huge season 3 handed out a lot of insights to partially replace them with new questions and that's exactly how they should write you want to <UNK> from one plot twist to the next not get a <UNK> of secrets spread all over you and then pick up a few to explain to the viewers they got that in season 3 and brings us a promising series future for season 4 its good to see that such a different format of a series can be so hugely popular
<START> this movie doesn't even deserve a one this was an utter waste of time it was a waste of film and money it was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting my spoiler is one that i think should be read by everyone there is full frontal nudity and disgusting language but not only that there is no plot line the actors are terrible the accents are horrible the actors are small time and i was even excited to watch this movie br br the only reason i rented it was for brian van holt who got only a fifteen second part by the way i think this might have been a mistake on the directors and <UNK> parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times adding only a new sentence br br a film similar to this is <UNK> head possibly the most disturbing movie in existence there is no plot line and is not funny although it isn't trying to be funny do not watch either movie
<START> otherwise it is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and i mean ever my wife and i were both bored out of our minds within 10 minutes not to mention being boring it is entirely unbelievable women non lesbian don't <UNK> together nor do they accidentally kiss brothers and sisters don't live together well into their 30s and run around swing dancing together and engaging in <UNK> in central park men don't find out their wife and sister <UNK> <UNK> the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife absolutely ridiculous br br heather graham is possibly the worst actress in films today she smiles when she should be crying and vice versa the only movie she has ever been good in is boogie nights and that is because she wasn't acting br br i cannot stress enough how bad this movie was
<START> i am glad to see most other people here don't think much of this movie either it has some big names in the cast but that's it there is nothing else to recommend save <UNK> a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films br br the story involves nothing but unlikable self centered chain smoking hip characters that national film critics all seem to like and most of the public can't stand br br the <UNK> accents are so fake they are laughable the southern racist stereotypes are right from liberal hollywood 101 and the story is depressing
<START> over the years i've seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies and every one holds the same amount of entertainment <UNK> the entertainment level is at a low sure the action sequences were amusing but that was pretty much it seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like under siege under siege 2 and executive decision at least on the action standpoint but during the past ten years these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past <UNK> br br on the more positive side the movie did make good use of time like some of the action sequences and use of wit just when the movie seemed to just drag on a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the <UNK> i honestly believe that more of <UNK> movies would do better if he wasn't the only one that fans recognize in the movie supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses maybe the movie will get more popular results
<START> it was one of those late night it's there i saw it things sometimes they are great this one was awful but it really shouldn't have been br br the movie had a really good cast how can you fail when you have <UNK> heston and jack <UNK> we're talking oscar winner <UNK> here it had good special effects it even had some really good tits and i mean nicely shown full breast with full <UNK> and at one point even some <UNK> but it didn't compensate for the one missing <UNK> a story the plot was ludicrous i don't mean the <UNK> crisis sun exploding stuff but that was bad enough it was the rest of the stuff the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff man that just <UNK> no amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that one br br i have seen the same cast members be incredibly good i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had <UNK> casts and budgets all the difference is in the writing
<START> this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since oh i don't know whats happening now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though it's mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves you don't get any good details into their personal lives it's mostly just them making stupid <UNK> small talk and acting like white trash look i love <UNK> music as much as the next babe but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her <UNK> yes that could be an actual episode thank god these two broke up because they were painfully dull together this show is toxic
<START> why would any legitimate actor having read the script <UNK> in this piece of crap my god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it i can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it also there is apparently some controversy as to whether river phoenix had a cameo in the movie he was uncredited but his list of roles here imdb does give him credit btw rain is his sister for those who have were asking before this film is proof that no matter how many big names you have <UNK> ears don't make <UNK> <UNK> i love <UNK> <UNK> but this was just sad sad sad maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film it has no endearing entertaining or even comedic <UNK> in comparison to it's bad everything else
<START> i know this sounds odd coming from someone born almost 15 years after the show stopped airing but i love this show i don't know why but i enjoy watching it i love adam the best the only disappointing thing is that the only place i found to buy the seasons on dvd was in germany and that was only the first two seasons that is disappointing but that's ok i'll keep looking online if anyone has any <UNK> on where to buy the second through <UNK> seasons please email me at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> com i already own the first one the only down side is that the dvds being from germany they only play on my <UNK> dvd player and my computer oh well i still own it
<START> wow baby this is indeed some fine asian horror gore and a crazy outlandish movie this is a japanese <UNK> that reminded me a little of <UNK> except in this case with all the blood and guts there is a bizarre love story it's hard to imagine how they even <UNK> up this visually stunning movie with some unique alien creatures that <UNK> humans as <UNK> turning them into part machine or i guess <UNK> the only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human is they need to kill each other and eat the other hmmm <UNK> <UNK> this would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun the movie also borrows a little from carpenter's the thing in creature design and effects i would put this in the must have category for <UNK> as there is non stop carnage and some very fine gore and a must have for <UNK> because you don't even need to read the sub titles the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip the design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a <UNK> reminded me a little of frank <UNK> movies which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour <UNK> machine is great fun for <UNK> there is no doubt about it and i simply loved it
<START> the humor in who's your daddy is such poor taste that i actually closed my eyes in certain scenes close ups of <UNK> are not funny nobody thinks they are people get nervous when they see something so gross and to hide their <UNK> they laugh watching who's your daddy gave me a disgusting nervous feeling
<START> yes i'm sentimental <UNK> but this movie and it's theme song remain one of my all time <UNK> robert downey jr does such justice to the role of louis <UNK> <UNK> and the storyline although far fetched is romantic makes one believe in happy endings
<START> this movie will always be a broadway and movie classic as long as there are still people who sing dance and act
<START> people <UNK> disney's animated features of the 1950s for being overly glossy set in landscapes that are much too <UNK> that criticism is just and yet it can't be the whole story because the two least glossy alice in wonderland and peter pan are also the weakest cinderella on the other hand set in a world in which the very dirt <UNK> is clearly the best br br it does look good the backgrounds are subtle and consistent the colours are pure without being too bright the animation <UNK> a bit i'll swear that some of the humans are <UNK> but then the <UNK> humans including cinderella herself aren't full blooded characters in the script so this approach works well enough it's really the animals that make the movie i think the studio had never quite used animals in this way before as <UNK> rather than <UNK> the mice for instance are the creatures who draw us into the story but they are really <UNK> or allies of the more <UNK> cinderella the cat <UNK> is a kind of <UNK> familiar to the wicked stepmother the cat is brilliantly conceived and animated one of the best <UNK> creations of all time the <UNK> animator was ward <UNK> and he <UNK> it on his own cat i wonder how he put up with the animal this approach allows the animals to steal the show without drawing our attention from the main story their actions are of maximum interest only in the light of the main story br br among the supporting cast the notable humans are the king and the grand duke the king is a one note character he wants <UNK> and appears to have no other desires at all but the note is struck in a pleasing fashion the grand duke is a put upon character who deserves to be lifted out of his <UNK> as much as cinderella does although he of course is <UNK> br br cinderella is disney's return to features after an eight year <UNK> and neither with it nor with any subsequent movie would he <UNK> the raw brilliance of his early years moreover he made things hard for himself by picking cinderella she's a passive heroine and there's not much anyone can do about that maybe i'm wrong on this score i haven't seen the recent ever after nonetheless it is remarkable how successful disney was in bringing this <UNK> story to life without cutting across the grain of its spirit
<START> the material in this documentary is so powerful that it brought me to tears yes tears i tell you this popular struggle of a <UNK> exploited population should inspire all of us to stand up for our rights put forth the greater good of the community and stop making up cowardly excuses for not challenging the establishment chavez represents the weak and <UNK> in the same way bush is the face of dirty <UNK> and capitalism ran amok indeed latin america is being <UNK> and the <UNK> majority is finally having a voice in over five centuries though in the case of mexico the election was clearly stolen by <UNK> chavez is not perfect far from it he's trying to change the <UNK> to allow him to rule <UNK> that cannot be <UNK> enough with the politics and back to the movie the pace is breath taking at moments and deeply philosophical at others it portrays chavez as a popular hero <UNK> to challenge the us <UNK> and <UNK> of the world's resources if you think the author is biased in favour of chavez <UNK> stopping you from doing your <UNK> one crucial message of the film is questioning info sources as was clearly demonstrated by the <UNK> <UNK> being <UNK> blamed on <UNK> supporters <UNK> puts american alleged democracy to shame <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this film is roughly what it sounds like a futuristic version of the cinderella legend but with songs and fairly tame sex scenes the film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess it's more expensive looking than most of director al <UNK> films but it's not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci fi films the actors are pretty bad and unlike most <UNK> films there are no former big <UNK> or b actors some of the music is ok but it's easy to see why cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years
<START> i'm sorry but i didn't like this doc very much i can think of a million ways it could have been better the people who made it obviously don't have much imagination the interviews aren't very interesting and no real insight is offered the footage isn't assembled in a very informative way either it's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves <UNK> special features one thing i'll say is that <UNK> <UNK> gets more beautiful the older she gets all considered this only gets a <UNK> '
<START> the rookie kept me smiling from beginning to end dennis quaid played the role to perfection the little boy that plays his son was fantastic he made this a father son movie to remember the messages are good ones follow your dreams failing at the pursuit is alright as long as you try the excitement is <UNK> i believe this movie will be a classic
<START> it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series from one to seven and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didn't see and i what to see it so badly like part two it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans which is cool and showed the return of the puppet master from part one it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did so thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit
<START> i drove from <UNK> to san francisco and back to see this movie premiere and really glad i did as a big movie fan and a life long northern <UNK> i was surprised how many oscar winning films have been made in the bay area as a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the bay area as opposed to going to la george <UNK> comments about <UNK> community and having a vision really <UNK> with me br br hey if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in sf so can other artists br br would recommend this film
<START> one of the last classics of the french new wave for direction <UNK> jean <UNK> drew from the simplicity of early century cinema for story <UNK> drew on the <UNK> of his own complicated love life so many things can be said of this film <UNK> brilliant self <UNK> overlong occasionally hilarious emotionally <UNK> etc etc in my mind whatever complaints that can be <UNK> against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths every film student writer or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts no music video <UNK> no soap opera like plot twists and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie everything is to be admired the writing <UNK> clever surprisingly funny acting everyone quite simply is perfect in their respective roles and simple direction the viewer feels like a casual <UNK> within the film make this film unforgettable this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you
<START> at what point exactly does a good movie go bad when does a movie go from watchable to where's that off switch thank goodness for dvds like this one that can be borrowed from the library for free likewise thank goodness for the fast forward switch on the dvd player i feel sorry for those people who were <UNK> at the box office br br at one point i've forgotten exactly when because now it's all just a <UNK> our hero luke wilson starts running through traffic i think he was looking for a cab it was at that point when i gave up realizing i couldn't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck br br the last time the movie was interesting was when luke wilson climbs out of the <UNK> hair <UNK> in hand and first meets the heroine uma thurman that scene ended with the purse <UNK> criminal <UNK> <UNK> from the fire escape far far above the <UNK> luke and uma that was the last time the movie was funny and when was that scene ten minutes into the flick br br every time the movie tried to become funny it couldn't every time the movie approached excitement it <UNK> out heading in the opposite direction when a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this <UNK> the sound track stayed empty and silent br br the sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish when uma turns into the crazy ex girlfriend i felt like i was watching the 40 year old virgin meets pulp fiction that's when i realized that there was no turning back because i thoroughly disliked the 40 year old virgin and pulp fiction br br luke <UNK> sidekick <UNK> wilson also seen in the dreary the last <UNK> adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie <UNK> wilson the king of television boredom should stay with that equally awful medium hey <UNK> wilson leave full length motion pictures alone every time <UNK> rival anna <UNK> came on screen i expected jason or freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery once you see anna <UNK> in scary movie that's all you ever see no matter the movie no matter the medium the character played by <UNK> sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick
<START> the script is nice though the casting is absolutely non watchable no style the costumes do not look like some from the high <UNK> society comparing gwyneth paltrow with kate beckinsale i can only say that ms beckinsale speaks british english better than ms paltrow though in ms <UNK> acting lies the very nature of emma <UNK> mr northam undoubtedly is the best mr knightley of all versions he is romantic and not at all sharp looking and <UNK> like mr knightley in the tv version p s the <UNK> cannot see at all mr <UNK> ms smith <UNK> development as it was in the motion version so one cannot understand where was all <UNK> trying of make a <UNK> smith match besides of the portrait
<START> this movie was an impressive one my first experience with a foreign film it was neither too long nor too complex i myself enjoyed the subtitles and the plot was surprisingly fresh the story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long <UNK> appeared cliched at first but it proved to be very touching and realistic there was also some subtle humor so as not to <UNK> or bore the audience
<START> i watched the <UNK> movie <UNK> <UNK> made in 1985 which in turn is probably inspired by an english movie of same name long back the basic story of <UNK> <UNK> is the same but it is told in a pathetic way the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal hindi movies probably the director did this to suit the taste of hindi audience br br i haven't seen the english original but had really enjoyed the <UNK> film made by <UNK> himself which was a side splitting comedy back then of course the acting by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> who did the <UNK> role was so natural and spontaneous br br probably i am too smitten by the <UNK> film that i cannot tolerate even the smaller flaws in its hindi remake but i still feel that akshay kumar and john abraham have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has done a decent job but doesn't reach anywhere near <UNK> br br but all in all its ok if one <UNK> it to other recent hindi comedy movies
<START> hey br br if your going to make a documentary about leonard cohen try making it about leonard cohen this is filled with only enough leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers some of them questionable talk about themselves <UNK> sounds like them <UNK> their diary entries in junior high who cares about you what about leonard guess what people if you do something worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you i found particularly insulting the <UNK> of <UNK> members as if that would add credibility to this movie not leonard doesn't need <UNK> or the edge talking about his <UNK> what would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to <UNK> some piece of his <UNK> through the film gee what a concept i will give props to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> for their covers of cohen tunes the rest of the performances were a bore and some were unbearable br br cohen fans don't say i didn't warn you
<START> after an anonymous phone call about a <UNK> that would have crashed in a frozen wood two police officers find <UNK> that the event really happened and apparently one martian had walked away from the spot they drive to the nearby hi way <UNK> and they find a bus stopped and seven passengers waiting the <UNK> of a <UNK> in bridge however the driver tells that he had only six passengers when he <UNK> the bus while <UNK> the <UNK> weird things happen in the diner with the lights switching on and off and the <UNK> turning on and off when the passengers are released and the bus follows his travel one passenger returns to the diner and <UNK> a plot of invasion of earth br br will the real martian please stand up is one of the best episodes of this great series the intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogs funny characters and situations and a surprising and totally unexpected plot point in the very end my vote is eight br br title brazil o <UNK> the martian
<START> this mini series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and <UNK> aspirations <UNK> falls somewhere between kung fu and h r <UNK> on the entertainment spectrum if it weren't so long nearly 3 hours i think that kids would like it quite a bit it's got adventure action cliffhanger scenes and not too much romance or other <UNK> stuff when you're young you're not too critical of <UNK> rubber swords campy acting and scenes that are repeated at least two scenes are repeated <UNK> in the movie just as was done in old time serials in order to bring the audience up to speed finally kids are usually more accepting of american english dialogue coming out of the mouths of asian actors not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non asian actors br br i was going to give this movie three stars but i felt like the director producers and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project this movie is not art but like painting your house it actually took some time effort and discipline to get it made br br overall not a recommended use for your time but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the mini van br br oh yeah hey imdb dialogue is the preferred and traditional spelling your spell checking seems to think that dialog is the proper spelling while dialog is acceptable both <UNK> and the <UNK> consider it an alternative form
<START> if there's one thing you can count on disney to do it's their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again even watching the commercial for lady and the tramp ii was a horrible experience disney's going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever it even had that spaghetti <UNK> scene it's been done before and that's what i say to this sorry direct to video the entire concept should be banned everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of <UNK> really bad movies the penguin and <UNK> duo i've even forgotten their names are just a really poor <UNK> copy of timon and pumbaa morgana is another ursula she even repeats practically all her old lines the songs are pathetic really abysmal i've never heard songs so bad from them before until now and the dialogue is atrocious it's pathetic and simplistic on the plus side at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent all of the usual characters aren't as annoying as they used to be or maybe that's a minus for little mermaid fans back on the negative melody is just so <UNK> cute you just might vomit i almost did do yourself and your little mermaid fan a favor don't waste your money on this true it's not as horrific as return of <UNK> or <UNK> ii but that's little <UNK>
<START> wow what would you do with <UNK> let me give you a choice you can either a shred it and <UNK> it down the toilet or b make a film based on the premise of whoopi goldberg as a hard nut futuristic cop <UNK> with a rubber dinosaur who uses terms like i didn't butt <UNK> and blows <UNK> on the basis that this is funny that's right you would choose the option that has more merit <UNK> down the toilet br br this has to be seen to be believed i cannot even find the words to describe how bad this film is it doesn't even fit into the so bad it's good category i actually have it on the television as i write and whilst watching i felt the need to come onto imdb and register my disgust br br considering jurassic park was made a couple of years before how on earth did they think that audiences would any longer tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit <UNK> should have simply walked and damn the consequences everyone concerned will go to hell for this criminal waste of money br br i have to stop writing i am about to <UNK>
<START> i noticed that this film has taken the <UNK> of a lot of insults it probably earned some of them but it wasn't that bad well i'll be honest i never want to see this film again it was a bad film but i don't hate this film it tried to tell a story as a drama this film could work very well actually i just think the filmmakers <UNK> which road to take when they made this they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy with a rewrite it could have been a great film but as a satire it didn't work in its current form many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot for example the robbery scene makes little sense in the story still it wasn't the worst independent film ever made is it in the top 10 worst that's <UNK>
<START> this is jackie chan's best film and my personal favourite after the disappointing u s made 'the <UNK> directed by james <UNK> jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into hong kong this is also probably <UNK> most violent movie with the audience cringing at the bone breaking stunts br br the action is fast and furious jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design bones were broken and blood <UNK> in the process of making this film as you'll see in the credits br br the script is a simple cops and robbers affair nothing special after all it was written around the action i must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing but it shouldn't put you off too much br br so get the <UNK> round crack open the beers and enjoy by the way the film was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by the stunt crew why i'll let you find out for yourself
<START> i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away it is a real masterpiece of art and i don't understand why most of the people think it's garbage the main idea of the movie take your ego away and then you will have true power this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look do you remember this from the movie because our true enemy is in us it is our ego that voice that always tells us that we are important that gives us our pride that tells us not to give but only to take that creates our <UNK> that wants to be in control that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts <UNK> expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance a superb movie
<START> it's very sad that <UNK> <UNK> does not stop making movies they get worse every time <UNK> and <UNK> 2003 is a depressing stab at the camera it's unfortunate that from the many movies that are made <UNK> in romania the worst of them get to be sent abroad e g chicago international film festival this movie without a plot acting or script is a waste of time and money score 0 <UNK> out of 10
<START> there have been race pictures almost from the <UNK> of the movie business films starring almost entirely black casts have been made by <UNK> poverty row studios more often than not owned by <UNK> for ghetto theaters with the growing urban <UNK> during the 1970s this idea was <UNK> with a wave of <UNK> pictures made for urban <UNK> houses which <UNK> black actors and funky atmosphere over traditional b movie plots this trend even spread into horror features with titles like <UNK> <UNK> and sugar hill serving up <UNK> versions of monster standards and it didn't die with the closing of most urban theaters  it just slowly <UNK> into the video age and continues with low budget direct to dvd releases like this one ed and jose <UNK> hood of the living dead <UNK> the recent popularity of horror movies for the hip hop audience ricky carl washington is a young scientist in <UNK> trying to keep his younger brother <UNK> brandon daniels out of trouble after the death of their parents after <UNK> is shot by drug dealers in a drive by ricky decides to use the experimental cell <UNK> formula he's been working on in an attempt to save the <UNK> life apparently his efforts are for <UNK> and <UNK> body is taken away however the body never makes it to the <UNK>  <UNK> re <UNK> in the <UNK> van as a flesh hungry zombie he kills the drivers then goes after the gang that killed him <UNK> the zombie <UNK> wherever he goes having heard from <UNK> friends kevin derek taylor ii and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about the attack on the gangsters ricky feels that the only thing to do is to capture <UNK> and try to cover up the whole matter before he and his <UNK> scott chris <UNK> get arrested for the mayhem they've caused however they soon find that the <UNK> is <UNK> too fast for them to control it by keeping things simple the <UNK> team manages to produce an entertaining little horror feature without <UNK> themselves to the point where things start to look shoddy along the way they also add in a few interesting bits of business when first confronted with a zombie scott tells ricky shoot him in the head like in the movies  an effective as any way to discover how to kill zombies an extra twist is added when the first head shot doesn't kill the brain adding to viewer <UNK> another good point is that the soundtrack makes only limited use of sub <UNK> style rap laying in standard creepy music throughout
<START> spoiler alert br br <UNK> <UNK> really a good guy but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some <UNK> of orders he's sent to jail or rather some sort of work camp he escapes but after a short while he's caught once again this time ends up in a <UNK> reality show in which he's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes and eventually die but we all know arnie and we all know that he's <UNK> than even the <UNK> of tough guys br br i really wanted to like this movie being an arnie fan and all however the running man contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me e g the <UNK> of <UNK> fight inside the helicopter where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident complete with 5 10 different camera angles this means that the military helicopter in which arnie flew was <UNK> with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members one of which inside the eye of one of the crew members arnie beats br br there are other flaws also and the plot which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative works for a while then it sort of creates a pool of <UNK> and <UNK> in which it <UNK> br br the acting can't really be said to be anything better than sub par with arnie in the leading role doing an average arnie performance the rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad br br the special effects are ok without being impressive br br rating 3 10
<START> <UNK> is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement the college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement the explosion that daria <UNK> represents the fall of all social <UNK> and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally <UNK> death <UNK> the end that a sees for the movement itself the film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life during the 60 ' and <UNK> young people were the driving force for the profound <UNK> for change one of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the <UNK> situation where there would be nobody to hide from i watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which a depicted the <UNK> to continue hiding this basic human instinct <UNK> was the way to <UNK> social <UNK> at that time and that is the method police applies to stop the students this society suffers from <UNK> and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls the dialogue between the policeman with the college professor who's <UNK> for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely <UNK> presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom the stealing of the plane represents mark 's inner wish for it but his going back or coming back or returning <UNK> shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' <UNK> said a depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game in my point of view a film to remember
<START> i really liked <UNK> really i did i have no problem with extremely low budget movies and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than <UNK> if you can imagine such a thing check out <UNK> vs zombies ' if you're interested indeed i prefer lower budget zombie films because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are <UNK> ' br br but <UNK> was just so bad it was retarded i don't want to bother being <UNK> in my criticism i want my 90 minutes back etc except that it really only took 80 minutes because <UNK> through i put it into 1 <UNK> fast forward br br okay here's some criticism br br 1 the pacing was terrible everyone talked in monologues even when someone just had a single line the camera work and the editing and the <UNK> of a bunch of f bombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue at first i was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to <UNK> 70 minutes but there were actually fewer <UNK> in <UNK> it's all talking br br 2 the gore effects got <UNK> just <UNK> <UNK> around on people's <UNK> br br 3 despite the epic exposition there really wasn't a plot and the exposition is indeed epic i won't spoil it if you're going to watch it don't watch it but then it's just a bunch of lame characters walking around and <UNK> for 80 minutes or fewer if you so choose
<START> major payne was really not very good at all despite being funny here and there the story was ridiculous and the acting was poor major <UNK> voice and <UNK> were especially annoying the idea was ridiculous and the things that the boys had to do in that film were even more ridiculous i would not recommend this film to anyone
<START> basically caprica is the <UNK> origin story the premise of the show is interesting however the writers follow so many story lines and <UNK> it with too many <UNK> characters that it <UNK> down the storytelling the plot creeps at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> what tension it might have had in any given episode little or nothing happens br br daniel <UNK> eric <UNK> is a military <UNK> working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip unfortunately his only working prototype is driven by the <UNK> version of his dead daughter <UNK> who died in a suicide bombing caused by soldiers of the one <UNK> an underground <UNK> <UNK> group br br meanwhile joseph <UNK> father of battlestar galactica 's commander <UNK> is struggling to hold his family together while searching for the <UNK> version of his daughter who also died in the bombing in a <UNK> virtual version of caprica which strongly resembles 1930s chicago br br in addition to the vapid writing caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origin stories we already know how it ends i e the <UNK> develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity
<START> spanish horrors are not bad at all some are smart with interesting stories but is not the case of second name it is badly directed badly acted and boring boring boring a missed chance for an interesting story
<START> this movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so none of them generate any interest or positive response i waited for the intrigue to begin hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end but there was no reward for doing that br br if you want a synopsis look elsewhere to me the action isn't worth <UNK> not that the story was that bad i guess you could say i had some problems with the script i e i thought it <UNK> a look at the credits will show you that there's a pretty strong cast here used to no <UNK> most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs of the actors i hadn't seen much of before i especially liked deborah <UNK> <UNK> that's about all that i can find good to say about this picture
<START> if you haven't seen eva longoria from the tv show desperate house wives then you are missing out eva is going to be one of the biggest <UNK> stars and you'll be seeing her in the theaters soon this was <UNK> first film and she does a fantastic job acting she was 24 when she shot it and looked hot then as for this low budget film it's pretty good for the first time director who has another soon to be released movie <UNK> mexico currently playing at many film festivals across the united states in fact it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news what would be nice to see is a <UNK> with a higher budget
<START> leslie <UNK> stilted play <UNK> becomes a poor choice vehicle for bette davis and gary <UNK> just after their joint success in all about eve after killing her <UNK> a scheming woman is visited by her husband's best friend who passes himself off as her husband once others begin stopping by the house irving <UNK> one of <UNK> best directors from her peak years is sadly unable to elevate this ridiculous material in which davis is curiously <UNK> and restrained until the outrageous finale where she thankfully pulls out all the stops production and supporting cast strictly second rate only for bette davis <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> johnny and jeremy are vampires of sorts minus the <UNK> of course they're dark bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery through their charms namely a sharp tongue and a fat <UNK> respectively they seduce desperate souls who they proceed to torment and <UNK> that's more or less the basis of this black comedy as i understand it br br it's not a blend of black humor that i can easily <UNK> to partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy main character i did enjoy however the sound and the melody of the rapid fire and supposedly very witty remarks i was very impressed by the <UNK> strong acting particularly david <UNK> only the character of jeremy seemed too <UNK> dimensional the photography and the music both dramatic and somber work very well together br br what really turns me off about naked and the main reason i'd never recommend it to anyone is the way it repeatedly seems to present <UNK> as a valid way to <UNK> one's angst in other words in a world that sucks so bad what difference does it make if one <UNK> some pain on girls right to suggest as some have on this website that johnny is not so <UNK> a person because he's not as rough on girls as jeremy seems completely absurd to me they're both terrible nasty people and they're particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance one could argue that johnny eventually gets what he deserves as if his bad <UNK> suddenly <UNK> straight back and bit him in the ass but still his and <UNK> sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter and i could be wrong but i'm guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical
<START> someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to high <UNK> now that is a real stretch i'm a big sinatra fan including some of his acting roles but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been don <UNK> first off as someone pointed out sinatra just doesn't have the build for a western bad guy wannabe he's just too <UNK> at this point in his life maybe he was about the same height as say <UNK> murphy but murphy had a pretty solid build sinatra comes across as the big talking little kid who nobody ought to take seriously br br the story is uninspired and really not credible i don't want to spoil it but i think the ending and how the <UNK> react in this story doesn't make any sense another thing these people constantly allow themselves to be completely <UNK> over by some <UNK> <UNK> this is just a little town so i don't get the attraction nor do i understand why the people would let themselves be dominated that way br br there is a <UNK> <UNK> in the story and if i followed it right she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so some other bad guy wouldn't kill him now there's true love for you <UNK> up for yourself tell him your name so he will kill you ' lol stop you're killing me br br unfortunately the basic premise of the movie isn't good enough and no matter how they tried this story didn't have a logical path to follow other than into the <UNK> want to know why it's not on video and never shown on tv the critics apparently <UNK> it in 1956 and they were right this movie is pretty bad i would almost bet sinatra paid someone to deep six the thing as much as possible br br you want to see a good western where a town stands up against a bad guy try tension at table rock or at <UNK> two really really good westerns with that theme johnny <UNK> is johnny <UNK> frank you were the greatest singer ever but you didn't belong in a movie like this
<START> this is a rather tame fluff piece concerning <UNK> ii <UNK> being broken stolen etc the acting is about what i expected from this cast of mgm b actors br br one big caution jean rogers who did such a great job playing the very sexy <UNK> <UNK> in the first two flash gordon serials is just awful in this movie her character is extremely annoying she absolutely never lets up with her overacting we are supposed to believe that during the height of a world war in what would obviously be a top secret code facility she would be allowed to just pop in and out of any office of her choosing although she has no official function from that standpoint i'm sorry that i ever watched this film it has forever changed my perception of ms rogers <UNK> she is an extreme lightweight br br lee <UNK> is his usual self meaning that he is merely adequate br br
<START> who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i <UNK> legendary bad trash film food of the gods nobody of course but director <UNK> lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a <UNK> sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history <UNK> is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late 80's location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80's this script hangs together by clichés awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a <UNK> two shoes scientist who performs growing experiments on ordinary <UNK> in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights <UNK> the huge and <UNK> rats escape and <UNK> pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielberg's jaws started there's an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely <UNK> corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats <UNK> the opening ceremony of the <UNK> new sport complex <UNK> food of the gods 2 is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say <UNK> stupid stuff like <UNK> into the <UNK> <UNK> while they know it's <UNK> with rats the acting is atrocious and there's a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth serum i wonder what <UNK> theory would be on that there's a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and  it has to be said  the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just can't get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creature features revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest 70's cult film <UNK> and its lame sequel ben the 2003 <UNK> remake starring <UNK> glover and the surprisingly good recent rat movies by once famous directors <UNK> <UNK> rats and john <UNK> the rats go nuts
<START> i recently saw i q and even though i'm not a romantic comedy type of gal i think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch so many movies in my opinion lack honesty you know that feeling when you're watching a movie and you just feel robbed because it's taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash the story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one how they stuck together and they tried to help tim robbins character become smart i liked the love story between tim and meg because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love nothing is what it seems i would recommend this for a sunday morning br br 7 10
<START> hard to imagine this film is based on a true story and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart stirring daniel day lewis is a <UNK> really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience br br the movie is not so <UNK> as i thought before the story is kinda bright and intriguing christy is not <UNK> by the <UNK> his life is also colorful and delightful although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful <UNK> through his eyes br br one important factor of <UNK> success is his mother's support which seems to be more touching and the unknown actress brenda <UNK> also deserves her oscar award for this role this fat little middle aged woman uses her all to make <UNK> dream come true so lucky for christy and hugh <UNK> is also excellent as young christy what a performance for a child the love story of christy is very well done <UNK> christy wants love and nothing can <UNK> him of the right to love his crush on the beautiful dr <UNK> cole surprisingly played by <UNK> shaw i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series the <UNK> aunt <UNK> so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind but anyway any woman has her own youth is <UNK> and offensive i do have sympathy for him love is a two edged sword happiness and agony are just next to each other br br btw jim <UNK> works are all good in america the boxer etc except get rich or die <UNK> god knows why he chose to direct that crap really a career <UNK> for him what a pity
<START> after <UNK> myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex rental dvds i figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than sam <UNK> for a number of reasons american beauty doesn't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that tom hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade for this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins and is simply wonderful to watch because of it and despite my usual <UNK> to any film with tom <UNK> name on it still can't watch big without wanting a cat to kick i'm glad i gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you'll kick yourself for if you miss it br br normally <UNK> clean hanks plays michael sullivan a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during <UNK> in the early 1930's he is also a professional hit man to mob boss john rooney paul newman but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons but after his <UNK> tyler <UNK> witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing the pair are forced to go on the run as john seeks to <UNK> the matter up soon father and son are pursued to chicago where a fellow hit man a menacing jude law is waiting for them br br on the face of it it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as i've said this isn't really about gangsters at all it's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances hanks is <UNK> teeth superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little <UNK> is also good as <UNK> son in all honesty there is not a single performance that i could single out as weaker than the others the cast is pretty much <UNK> as is the cinematography and costumes and it's not often i praise costumes which <UNK> the 30's with stunning effect there has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in <UNK> this could easily have looked rubbish they admit that the early 30's look was difficult to put down but it doesn't and that deserves every bit of credit chicago especially looks fantastic <UNK> with hundreds of <UNK> cars from the era and filled with people in <UNK> suits and hats true time travel even if a little cgi is needed br br the story is also a winner offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer maguire and proves that you don't have to be cagney or de niro or brando to play a gangster the film is decidedly noir ish driving rain and ill lit <UNK> <UNK> but at least violence and killing are finally seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who <UNK> and those who merely witness such acts the whole thing is <UNK> of a previous age and previous movies but it <UNK> away the old and <UNK> with a modern tale of redemption amid the tommy gun <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> it can feel a little slow in places especially if you're used to masses of gun play in movies like most modern audiences like yours truly but sometimes words can speak <UNK> than actions <UNK> has delivered a fine follow up to his oscar winning debut a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch road to <UNK> may not be to everyone's tastes but this is one dvd i shall not be <UNK> anytime soon
<START> br br this movie is full of references like mad max ii the wild one and many others the <UNK> face it´s a clear reference or tribute to peter lorre this movie is a masterpiece <UNK> talk much more about in the future
<START> a well made and imaginative production <UNK> free from cliché this somewhat <UNK> affair <UNK> a tale of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage expertly directed by alan gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement the film provides <UNK> in nearly every scene as <UNK> martin <UNK> richard harris believing that his <UNK> for <UNK> was particularly <UNK> <UNK> a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan following which his spontaneous nature comes to the <UNK> as he <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> of his childhood often <UNK> into song or dancing a few steps the <UNK> <UNK> gradually <UNK> the trust and affection of his captive and as police close in for an inevitable showdown the <UNK> pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their <UNK> to forms of <UNK> as <UNK> by a psychiatrist lindsay wagner assigned to aid a <UNK> police lieutenant james coburn who is in charge of the <UNK> for <UNK> and his prisoner this is an engrossing story worth telling a quickly paced and novel adventure that <UNK> from a capital performance by harris fine turns from wagner coburn and karen black along with justin henry as the <UNK> <UNK> with an appropriately whimsical score contributed by <UNK> <UNK> and top notch cinematography by frank <UNK> with all footage shot in a beautiful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> all dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies i've ever seen i first saw it when i was like 3 now i'm 12 and i rented it it makes me think of things and it brings back so many memories those were the days i love the music i love when charlie is arriving in heaven i love the song let me be surprised i love how charlie looks and his voice bert reynolds could only play charlie's voice this great i love this movie the 1st one is the best one because it's so original and great it really does bring back memories that no one can describe not even me if only i could go back to those days i love the characters if this is the way the memories come back when i'm 12 imagine how i'll feel when i'm like 19 i hope i'll be able to watch this when i'm older when i first seen this i never knew that i would really look back on it and feel this way i hope it will be available to watch i'm so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart on a scale from 1 10 i'd give it a perfect 10 it's an amazing movie it's so hard to explain the feeling when i get older and if i have kids i hope they can experience this feeling
<START> the little mermaid is one of my absolute favorite disney movies i'm sorry to say however that disney completely messed up when they made this sequel i'll admit it has some good points to it the songs aren't bad and the animation is clean and clear there is some humor i'm sure i don't remember because after watching it i immediately banned it from appearing before my eyes again the worst point of this movie is the plot in this movie ariel becomes her father she <UNK> her daughter to go near the sea yes out of fear just as she was forbidden to go near the land i personally think that given her past ariel would maintain some of her <UNK> ways and not treat her daughter like she herself was treated br br besides this fact ursula was replaced by a non scary pathetic sort of sea witch the <UNK> forgotten sister who is more comical than scary she too has some little <UNK> to do her <UNK> but she's not scarier or worse than ursula ursula spoiled us with her believability for badness this sea witch is a joke br br to make matters worse <UNK> is a fat deep voiced father no longer the cute <UNK> we all know and love and <UNK> voice is not even done by the same actor something that always <UNK> me in a remake sequel his voice difference was very obvious to me by the way i felt that the only reason this movie was made was so that disney could catch a few fast dollars something i hate to think about a corporation i actually really do enjoy i felt that this plot lacked imagination i know that this act child following in the footsteps of a parent happens but ariel was different that was what we loved so much about her she had a dream she fell in love and she made that dream come true until she appeared in this movie that is then she became just like the other adults this isn't the ariel i know and i don't like her br br i know of some children who have enjoyed this film and i know some adults who didn't mind it either but for me and for all of you out there who have the <UNK> love for ariel please don't see this movie the ariel we know dies within <UNK> only for a song or two and one final scene that actually isn't bad where she accepts the water back again although she takes very little part in the ending regardless
<START> charming doesn't even begin to describe saving grace it's absolutely irresistible anyone who <UNK> into this movie will leave with their spirits <UNK> high haha br br grace <UNK> brenda <UNK> has just lost her husband but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse her <UNK> <UNK> has left her with no money and outstanding <UNK> faced with losing everything she has to find out a way to get a lot of cash fast she gets an idea when her <UNK> matthew craig <UNK> asks the town famous <UNK> to give him advice on a plant he is secretly growing grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana so they decide to use her <UNK> skills to grow a lot of top quality <UNK> and then sell it to pay off her outstanding <UNK> br br the most notable quality about saving grace is its <UNK> every character is extremely sympathetic and save for the first 20 or so minutes the film is non stop good cheer everyone wants a happy ending for everyone even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activities br br the acting is top notch brenda <UNK> is one of <UNK> finest actresses and here is why she turns what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual she's a nice lady but she's not stupid craig <UNK> is equally <UNK> as matthew he's a <UNK> loser but he's so likable that it doesn't matter the rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well but special mention has to go to <UNK> <UNK> the french actor always has a aura of menace about him and that suits him well but he also has great comedy skills br br <UNK> cole finds the perfect tone for saving grace it's all about the charm one of the problems i have with british humor is that all the energy seems to be <UNK> out of the film not so here the film is thoroughly likable and always amusing that's not to say that saving grace is just a likable movie that will leave you with a grin and a good feeling while this movie is not an out and out comedy it does <UNK> two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical br br if there's any problem with the film it's that the climax is a little confusing the questions are answered though and the ending boasts an unexpected twist br br see saving grace especially when you're having a bad day
<START> i didn't know the real events when i sat down to watch this just the fact that this was based upon a true story after the death of the kid's father <UNK> tries to help her daughter <UNK> i did not know anyone actually named their <UNK> that cope with the loss this is really made for children as is often the case with family flicks with that said go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing though i'd keep teenagers out of it unless you're sure they're gonna buy the concept but it doesn't <UNK> the <UNK> that the death of a parent is and it doesn't really talk down to anyone the plot is <UNK> interesting and moves along well enough acting <UNK> with the excellent <UNK> <UNK> most of her fellow cast <UNK> following that pretty well and <UNK> and her peers with a few exceptions being the least convincing of the bunch and frankly they're irritating then again i'm not really in the intended audience for this thing the editing and cinematography are standard and certainly not less than that while humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so the tone is not an unpleasant one there is an intense scene or two in this i recommend this to fans of these types of movies 7 10
<START> i picked this one up because the music was done by hans <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made by someone dear to me the jacket art says the 2003 version br br i give it one point for a strong female one point for <UNK> dialog and one last point for meg <UNK> light blue eyes of which there are plenty of shots of br br it was fun seeing david <UNK> casually swimming the pool has a <UNK> viewing window while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in <UNK> br br the sets were <UNK> impressive that is rich people's houses in l a and <UNK> <UNK> where the castle was i found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around the wind wasn't fierce enough to be believable to me i kept thinking that the animal <UNK> on the furniture must be nasty etc and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding i stumbled over things like why did she light a fire blow out the match then throw the match into the fire dumb stuff like that it was clunky at best oh well robert <UNK> got to have a bit of fun with his <UNK> <UNK> character and a nice vacation out of it
<START> most people <UNK> gave this movie a 10 and those who don't are being too critical or maybe expected something else this is one of my favorite movies from the 80's it grows on you and has it all i just got it on dvd and 20 years later it still does not disappoint having plenty of action drama romance and even comedy add to that the great car chases automatic weapon <UNK> and lots of stuff blowing up and you have a fun edge of your seat experience you will even be <UNK> or <UNK> the main theme song for days after seeing this br br you can watch this movie with your wife <UNK> and you will both enjoy it lots the premise is that of a <UNK> book hero like doc savage really existing and helping people fight evil so he can write the story is almost true to life here the actor jake speed is also a director producer and writer of many films in this film jake speed the character is an indiana jones <UNK> type he usually uses his head to get out of <UNK> situations but will sometimes <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and sheer dumb luck too keep an eye out for his one james bond hi tech equipment the ultimate road warrior <UNK> dropping out of the sky br br the heroine is the very beautiful young love interest from the early jim carey vampire movie once bitten and here she is a little older and still a <UNK> even compared to her teenage blonde little sister br br the bad guys are real bad men and are the worst <UNK> villainous <UNK> you love to hate the ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel sadly never made but you can just imagine what would happen next br br you have to see this movie just because it will entertain and <UNK> you and that's worth the price of a ticket
<START> conrad hall went out with a bang the great film photographer finished his <UNK> career with this movie before passing on he did himself proud as this is one of the best looking crime films you'll ever see br br of course the acting ain't bad when you have tom hanks and paul newman playing the leads the amount of action in here is just right too not too much not too little br br none of the characters in here frankly are good guys as hanks is a professional hit man for town boss newman <UNK> only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him although he does teach him how to be the <UNK> man in <UNK> huh br br as good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is the real star of this film is cinematographer hall who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens his work is just awesome
<START> okay i didn't get the <UNK> thing the first time i watched this episode it seemed like something significant was going on that i couldn't put my finger on this time those <UNK> <UNK> fires on tv really caught my attention and it helped that i was just writing an <UNK> on <UNK> but let me see what hasn't been discussed yet br br a <UNK> review mentioned that tony had 7 <UNK> of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator yeah 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons especially religious but here's one more for ya on a <UNK> i <UNK> <UNK> and guess what <UNK> divided into 7 levels <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and paradise the stuff at the bottom of the stairs and what tony can't get to br br on to the allegedly random monk slap scene as soon as the monks appeared it fit perfectly in place with tony trying to get out of <UNK> you can tell he got worried when that christian commercial death disease and sin came on and he's getting more and more desperate because christian heaven is looking kinda <UNK> for him by the time he meets the monks he's thinking hey maybe these guys can help me which sounds like <UNK> other <UNK> e g <UNK> and wondering if some other path could take him to salvation not that tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a <UNK> but it appears <UNK> tried that and messed up that slap in the face basically tells tony there's no quick fix as in no you can't suddenly embrace <UNK> and get out of here br br tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven but at the <UNK> entrance he realizes that's not going to be so easy for him at first i saw the name vs <UNK> license problem as tony having led sort of a double life what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people he feels free to have an affair with quasi <UNK> because he's kevin <UNK> he figures out that he can fool some people with <UNK> cards like hotel <UNK> but it won't get him out of <UNK> those <UNK> the <UNK> of heaven are keeping track of him and everything he does br br after reading all the theories on <UNK> though it seems like <UNK> identity is a reminder of the <UNK> different paths tony could've taken in his life possibly along with the car joke involving <UNK> that made no sense to me otherwise <UNK> at that point my brain <UNK> out
<START> <UNK> again from the darkness stunning photography highlights this disney documentary and provides a glimpse into some of the <UNK> of animals that live in the wilderness for anyone over 40 disney and mutual of <UNK> wild kingdom provided much of our insight into wild animals since our childhood back when there was no channel dedicated to national <UNK> or nature or animal planet br br what always <UNK> is just how difficult the circumstances are for many of these <UNK> creatures watching the elephants <UNK> for days nearly delirious from lack of water is oh so painful but their <UNK> battle against the lions is thrilling br br some of the underwater shots are breathless the mama and baby <UNK> are beautiful and watching the great white shark attack its prey is every bit as chilling as jaws the most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the <UNK> i had never seen such detail of the <UNK> of the range br br don't think most young kids today will be too excited by this one but it surely is one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries i have ever seen
<START> this is one of those cheaply made tv movies were the characters seem to lose all sense the premise of the story the kidnapping of a son by the boy's father is very good but the story just seems to <UNK> belief whenever the mother is advised not to do anything you know fine well she is going to do it it is a bit far fetched and not worthy of a viewing
<START> when i look for new cars i expect not to be shown <UNK> when i drink <UNK> coke i should expect that the drink contains coke when i watch a movie that <UNK> itself with the name of en excellent scientist i expect that it is in some way relevant to that person or their work this could have been people discussing my <UNK> diary the material covered is relevant only in that they vaguely <UNK> science i fell asleep the first time i tried to watch it the second time i stopped watching it br br i love science documentaries i would rather watch them over the latest blockbuster however this falls far short of providing anything worth your time  avoid at all costs
<START> invasion of the star creatures would definitely be in the so bad it's good category if the film wasn't quite so sexist or racist that it is such just makes it plain bad br br it has the same kind of <UNK> stereotypical <UNK> that you saw in queen of outer space and the kind of racist stereotypes in this instance native americans that you would normally find in thirties forties b westerns in terms of being non funny the same walking through the cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie ray does do one good impression of jimmy cagney but can't make it work for two impressions of cagney in a row nor handle a peter lorre when he tries it there really aren't any production values to speak of as the star creatures make the <UNK> man from robot monster or <UNK> johnson in plan 9 from outer space look like creations of industrial light and magic br br this film was definitely one of a <UNK> of what you would have to call early independent cinema not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an all night drive in br br
<START> what a great gem this is it's an unusual story that is fun to watch yes it has singing but it is very nicely crafted into the story and is very <UNK> to hear it was so pleasant to watch i enjoyed it from start to finish br br the movie takes place in england during world war ii it is about an apprentice witch who is searching for a missing portion of a spell that she needs she uses her rough magic to transport her and 3 children under her care to various <UNK> to find it they are joined by her <UNK> teacher who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work br br although the special effects may seem a little dated at first once you get used to them they become part of the charm of this movie in fact the movie won an oscar for these effects br br the movie is innocent and fun and it's hard not to like the <UNK> songs the characters are wonderfully interesting to watch i think anyone at any age could find something to like about this movie
<START> much as we all love al pacino it was painful to see him in this movie a publicity hack at the <UNK> ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career pacino plays his part looking like an <UNK> bed and <UNK> everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern accent br br the plot <UNK> out this way and that with so many loose ends and <UNK> that the mind <UNK> and then <UNK> br br kim basinger is there not doing much her scenes with pacino are flat and unconvincing hard to believe they meant a lot to each other there's no energy there br br tea <UNK> on the other hand lit up the screen she was electric and her scenes with pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie but not enough to save al from embarrassment
<START> the movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a call girl the other an upper class political party the crossing point is the public relation character played by al <UNK> as he is the witness of the crime and the <UNK> of the evening br br if the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama the performance of al is memorable how many <UNK> can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man as the godfather as here as a little servant see also <UNK> <UNK> br br actually the big young lion has become a tired old one this passing of ages is very moving because it makes the audience <UNK> about getting old too br br but his <UNK> is only a make up because he can get back his energy in church scene br br maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the <UNK> on <UNK> talent
<START> these two stars are the only iconic heroes villains i know that got a good tv series so let's compare br br freddy 7 movies <UNK> 3 movies br br freddy 1 tv series 2 seasons about 40 episodes <UNK> 1 tv series 1 season about 22 23 episodes br br freddy 2 extra films freddy vs jason freddy vs <UNK> <UNK> 4 extra films <UNK> prime <UNK> dark justice <UNK> <UNK> burn <UNK> br br freddy 1 upcoming film <UNK> 1 upcoming film br br who's had more screen time well they've both had 7 movies 1 tv series and 1 upcoming film but freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films one being a fan film 17 18 tv episodes br br since this is a comment for the series between freddy's nightmares <UNK> the series <UNK> the series i would personally choose <UNK>
<START> i do not know who is to blame miss leigh or her director but her performance as catherine is almost impossible to watch ben chaplin on the other hand does a superior job against all odds as far as i am concerned his character is entirely too charming and appealing but certainly not shown as greedy enough to put up with <UNK> character's silliness chaplin appears <UNK> by what cannot possibly be understood as <UNK> <UNK> and lack of grace but rather her <UNK> <UNK> there has to be some element of believability to his interest but as played it is incomprehensible the performances do not <UNK> maggie smith and albert finney are of course wonderful despite any effort to <UNK> them the supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch what a pity too the leads don't work together because the production is lovely to look at
<START> this movie scared the crap out of me i have to admit that i spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what i saw was really scary i screamed out loud two or three times during the show br br film making wise my favorite aspects were the sound and photography the sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful i read somewhere that it's some weird husband and wife team that made it for some reason that makes this even stranger for me br br if you enjoy the jumps and <UNK> of scary movies than this one is for you very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies <UNK> up on a <UNK> screaming like little girls
<START> i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru not one laugh in it ok maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke <UNK> bit as the big black bald gay virgin but the rest of it was shockingly un funny on top of being void of any laughs the skits go on forever steer clear of this one if you value your time and money dreadful the worst
<START> so terrific so good i have never seen a man be more funny than eddie murphy in this stand up comedy you will see a lot of <UNK> more done by anyone br br if you have seen raw 1987 you will have to see delirious it's so funny it's so professional
<START> i'm actually watching this film as i write this if the following comments prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then so be it br br but i thought am still thinking as i'm <UNK> viewing that this film to put it mildly is very very overrated again very br br it looks like a really really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources and who didn't pay that much attention to detail br br i don't want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but well i just don't get it <UNK> i fully admit that maybe it's me that's the idiot here not the film maker for not getting this piece of imaginative genius i rented this on a <UNK> because the reviews were very very outstanding br br <UNK>
<START> i like this presentation i have read bleak house and i know it is so difficult to present the entire book as it should be and even others like little <UNK> i have to admit they did a very good show with the staged nicholas <UNK> i love diana <UNK> and i could see the pain of lady <UNK> even through the expected arrogance of the <UNK> i am sorry i think she is the best lady <UNK> i am not sure who could have made a better <UNK> but i am ok with mr elliott it is not easy to present these long <UNK> books oliver twist would be easier this is a long and if you don't care for all the legal situations can be dreary or boring i think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring i just loved mr <UNK> it can be entertaining there is always a child jo will break your heart here i think we should be given a chance to judge for ourselves br br i have to say i loved the show maybe if i read the book again as i usually do after seeing the movie maybe i can be more critical in the meantime i think it is a good presentation
<START> quite average even by <UNK> standards this mystery a remake of the <UNK> has an oddball plot which is not <UNK> to much effect you'll see through it after about ten minutes the two leads have some nice <UNK> dialog at the outset but john hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain perfectly cast lionel <UNK> <UNK> the role and warren <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is pretty annoying however it's worth sitting through for a five minute appearance by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> the janitor who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance you've got to hand it to bill one take <UNK> he wasn't much of a director but he would always punch up a routine <UNK> with some goofy vaudeville
<START> my friends and i went into this movie not knowing what to expect but hoping for the best when we came out we were only slightly more informed on what the plot of the movie actually was though not the worst movie i've ever seen i definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters maybe have a friend rent it for you it's not even worth the rental cost either if you really want to see it br br when a movie is so convoluted that you have no idea what's going on until the last five minutes there's really not much that can be said in its defense the acting was decent more than you'd expect to get from this movie and some of the shots were good but it was all <UNK> down by a lame plot and poor script br br this movie was actually so bad that as soon as it got out i went and purchased a ticket to see a good movie just to <UNK> my mind i recommend that all of you just skip the first step and go see a good movie instead
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a classic <UNK> short the guys are inept <UNK> working at a radio station and during some <UNK> around in a broadcast booth <UNK> perfect <UNK> of a recording of voices of spring is mistaken for the real thing leading to a radio contract and a zany musical party the <UNK> mock rendition of the <UNK> from <UNK> de <UNK> is especially entertaining no doubt this is essential viewing for <UNK> fans br br although the evidence of <UNK> failing health is visible in his face and voice his performance is amazing and it is probably the last glimpse of the old curly some fans think that a bird in the hand is the last great curly short but his coarse voice and slow movement are just too difficult to watch
<START> this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of <UNK> dance of death poem is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people that meet in an old <UNK> house for example the cat and the <UNK> the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays a demented <UNK> of life size dolls that <UNK> the guests he dies early in the film or does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences i won't go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must see for fans of old dark house mysteries br br watch it with plenty of popcorn and <UNK> in a <UNK> room br br dan basinger 8 10
<START> after viewing this film i felt the compelling need to <UNK> a bit of my frustration <UNK> blair is a fabulous currently underrated actress and max <UNK> was rather charming in kill me later the story while not exactly original certainly showed some promise none of that <UNK> though at all br br i don't know what her deal is but director dana <UNK> has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director she <UNK> footage down <UNK> footage up <UNK> footage used awkward camera angles used annoying color <UNK> made a <UNK> quick cuts jumped back and forth in the <UNK> and topped it all off with an obnoxious modern soundtrack of <UNK> junk i can't remember the last time i saw such an incompetent job of directing a film her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of it is <UNK> down their throats br br there are a couple of good scenes in kill me later which show what could have and should have been unfortunately just when things would start to show promise ms <UNK> would dig into her bag of film school tricks and <UNK> things up again it's a shame because blair and <UNK> had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart 3 10
<START> i went in expecting the movie to be completely dumb with such a low expectation any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise the soundtrack was the best part of the movie but <UNK> fun at the nonsense that goes on in <UNK> <UNK> was also amusing br br this said there were many things about the <UNK> ward that were completely annoying the entire film was poorly dubbed and made watching mouths while listening to their voices very irritating this lack of <UNK> was <UNK> only by the cameos of mormon celebrities who have no business acting br br this film will do well among <UNK> especially in college <UNK> where <UNK> ward exist however the conclusion will offer no hope for the poor losers who find themselves <UNK> only the pretty girls in the <UNK> ward get married the fat ugly ones don't but all the ugly men do ultimately we realize that the whole film was an <UNK> for <UNK> com
<START> <UNK> massacre should have been this movies actual title and the tag line should have read guaranteed to make your kids cry this is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild <UNK> in a remote region starting with the meeting and pairing of two young <UNK> and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them the only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the <UNK> giving insight into the animals loves and lives lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals sounds good huh well from there things go straight to hell and then start <UNK> towards the core br br spoilers below or they it may be a warning br br almost first off we learn one of the <UNK> is born blind but seems to get along well enough and there's a beautifully cheerful musical score to <UNK> him and then he dies next we have one of the siblings adventures and then he dies one of the sisters gets her screen time and then she dies and so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature in traps just up and <UNK> and even by a bunch of <UNK> by the end of the movie almost all the <UNK> have been <UNK> though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen least not in the version we saw unlike say <UNK> the <UNK> the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then <UNK> out one or two <UNK> would have been acceptable it is a nature film after all but not nearly the whole family br br do not go to see this film <UNK> by the <UNK> box into thinking its safe for the kids watch it with some <UNK> that things are not going to go well at all and that you or your kids may be left feeling very badly depending on how sensitive you or they are you may enjoy it or you may not
<START> i've seen a great many films but <UNK> cold <UNK> stands alone in a class by itself it excels in every department the fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story rather than the name on the <UNK> blake and wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo the fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place even inside the very house add additional chills the black white photography <UNK> the mood and the photography is magnificent there are many outstanding cinematic works out there but if i could only vote for one to top the list it would most probably be in cold blood
<START> how this movie got made with a supposedly 70 million budget and without being completely <UNK> is beyond me the storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before no one seems to be grounded in the real world the acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down the hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit it was so oddly attention grabbing not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the <UNK> finally for a movie about l a being <UNK> by giant <UNK> this film is shockingly boring what a shame if you do see this your mind will be constantly racing thinking up ways that you could have taken the <UNK> scenes and built a far better movie around them sadly it wouldn't have taken much
<START> the premise sucked me in but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible interesting to watch just to run through the <UNK> <UNK> list i can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece romero comes to mind but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one the message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 or simply get a <UNK> jennifer what happened to ya and <UNK> follow the bible without any sort of self examination whatsoever or we'll trigger the second coming it's the kind of attitude that makes people fly <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> story buildings i work around the corner from the site of the former <UNK> i like to think that god is a little greater than that
<START> this movie made me feel as if i had missed some important scenes from the very beginning there were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started i was very disappointed because i love whoopi goldberg danny glover in addition to that have always trusted respected danny <UNK> taste in his choice of roles grand canyon for example i just could not finish this movie after what seemed an eternity but was probably just a little over an hour we had to turn it off there was no comedy there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them there was no <UNK> of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited confusing and unnecessary what could have been a great idea for a movie even as a drama not a comedy although i think a comedy in this situation would have been better because i love to watch white people freak out start acting like complete idiots it makes me laugh became a waste of my 1 credit at the video store
<START> as the number of video <UNK> i've yet to see <UNK> this little pile of garbage popped up on my to rent list when i saw it was available br br the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for <UNK> by a <UNK> crew of idiots some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a <UNK> chip though if he returns with the girl and all the money he gets a significant cut he's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot is one of the worst actors ever granted they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood after stealing away into the jungle we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose <UNK> <UNK> god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> now this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever <UNK> <UNK> balls for eyes and that's pretty much it his <UNK> and <UNK> are an <UNK> feature on the soundtrack and i found myself <UNK> much of those scenes br br oh did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity this is probably the main reason this film was banned though there is one specific scene about one second long where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans also jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close ups of female <UNK> and sadly male as well so if you want fair in terms of exploitation you got it br br i can't recommend this trash to anyone it's not even the good bad movie it's just <UNK> padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then if you are making your way through the list leave this for the very last if you watch it first you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list which is certainly not true
<START> one would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film and i've seen hundreds of hindi and bollywood movies too the actors the beautiful settings locations and surroundings the deep emotions portrayed the sweet songs especially the singing voice of <UNK> <UNK> my favorite everything was just lovely the human <UNK> element was also woven in to create some drama and drive the plot as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution <UNK> <UNK> is such a terrific actor so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays he almost steals the show from the young stars i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love as one of the best films out there hindi or otherwise
<START> complete drivel an unfortunate <UNK> of the <UNK> toxic culture of a decade ago in this movie pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with <UNK> <UNK> the annoying <UNK> feeding <UNK> rice forget historical reality too didn't most western slaves comes from west africa an american <UNK> easily capturing <UNK> with a handful of men finally david <UNK> could not have been any more obnoxious one can only <UNK> how would he have <UNK> in the miniseries promptly <UNK> most likely the miniseries was superb and it is unfortunate that <UNK> should have gotten his hands on something unique and made it mundane i tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco
<START> i sincerely hope that at least the first season of <UNK> is released on dvd someday the episode with <UNK> eccentric genius brother george played by the late <UNK> lee <UNK> is classic hilarity it reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happy br br mr <UNK> and ms <UNK> brilliantly <UNK> the chemistry that they shared on the <UNK> show for many years and to put them in a more middle class role shows the <UNK> they can take as artists br br the <UNK> of comedic dynamite <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and mr <UNK> classic genius
<START> the highlight of this movie for me was without doubt tom hanks as mike sullivan he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an <UNK> for him role hanks is usually the good guy in a movie the one you like admire and root for sullivan was definitely not a good guy it's true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son even so he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings so hanks took a role i wouldn't have expected him in and he pulled it off well br br <UNK> good performance aside though i certainly couldn't call this an enjoyable movie after an opening that i would best describe as enigmatic it wasn't entirely clear to me for a while where this was going it turns into a very <UNK> movie about the complicated relationships sullivan has developed as a gangster largely raised by rooney paul newman who's a sort of mob boss and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them clean so to speak isolated from his business after the older son witnesses a murder the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet gets the wrong son and the mother and leaves sullivan and his older son mike jr on the run it becomes a weird sort of father son bonding movie br br although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note at least in the overall context of the story it's really very dark throughout that mood being <UNK> with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and <UNK> <UNK> i have to confess that while i appreciated <UNK> performance the movie as a whole just didn't pull me in 4 10
<START> dr k david h <UNK> has been trying to master a formula that would end all disease and <UNK> but needs live <UNK> to complete his work his doctor brother richard dennis o'neill has a son named eddie derek <UNK> who is accepted to medical school eddie has a girlfriend named sarah <UNK> <UNK> who is pre law and plans to attend law school herself the coming fall she and eddie resume their relationship when sarah calls things off with her current boyfriend who is also <UNK> the lady of walt bill sebastian <UNK> best friend who recently paid for his cheating <UNK> <UNK> job eddie accidentally gets hit by a car and appears on the <UNK> of death when dr k makes a suggestion to richard let him <UNK> eddie using his secret illegal methods when dr k applies his serum to eddie horrifying results occur <UNK> face <UNK> massive <UNK> while he has also acquired a taste for human flesh many will die so that eddie can feed this <UNK> <UNK> he can't <UNK> soon he may even pose a threat to his father and girlfriend eddie monster must be stopped br br typically awful direct to video horror flick suffers from a severe lack of budget acting and overall talent the premise which seems like an interesting fright fest fails to deliver even as a zombie flick the gore is limited with a few <UNK> scenes but most of the violence occurs off camera the use of time to move the story along can really get annoying
<START> this may sound crazy to even the people who remember this show but i remembered this as being live action i don't think i ever saw the cartoon but movie maybe i remember it very clearly the guy was in a building kinda like a <UNK> he even had the red jacket it was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him the car guy <UNK> around and crashed through the big <UNK> type window and out onto the street and then <UNK> to drive off that is all i remember i really hope someone else out there remembers this too if not maybe i'm still crazy but i'm hoping i'm not
<START> based on christy <UNK> <UNK> novel this endearing film tells the story of his life him being affected by cerebral <UNK> and being considered basically not a person by everyone including his mother amazingly he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot which is the only part of him he can control an amazing story of courage with a truly amazing and unforgettable oscar winning performance by daniel day lewis 9 of 10
<START> while filming an 80's horror movie called <UNK> <UNK> the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is <UNK> as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer after all of this the production is abandoned and the stock <UNK> are left to gather dust so a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they're warned by people to keep away from the film as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film from this it's <UNK> as a cursed production not taking these <UNK> seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from hollywood to <UNK> her role but not as the daughter but the mother but again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film's killer br br look what <UNK> started hey i enjoy those films but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses during this stage the sub genre came back with vengeance but it wasn't much of a good thing as they were mostly <UNK> and unoriginal attempts where they followed the derivative pattern of the scream franchise <UNK> which is an independent australian take on the <UNK> slasher genre is purely <UNK> garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick but you know what i found it a cheesy delight yeah it's <UNK> awful and highly forgettable but it's a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted although i did hate it when i originally came across it but the second time around i knew what i was getting myself into and it worked better for it it was just like helping myself to a nice slice <UNK> again but this time it wasn't so sweet br br the film came out around the same time as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> legends the final <UNK> did which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie <UNK> <UNK> is obviously the strongest of the three but i would actually watch this trash over urban legends the final cut though it did seem more of a <UNK> to the 80's slashers than that of one of <UNK> bastard <UNK> pretty much the film is given b grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances the dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense while the performances are pure mockery and molly <UNK> takes the crown for it she plays the wash up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and i had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send up performance she provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly the rest were mostly recognizable australian tv stars that's if you're an australian with a ravishing jessica <UNK> leading the cast with the likes of stephen <UNK> and frank roberts also pop singer and supposed actress <UNK> <UNK> makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be <UNK> up nice these teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed sometimes it feels like they just waiting in <UNK> because they have no real substance to be there br br the plot starts off rather interestingly then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up but then it makes a sudden u turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre simply it's rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness i was kind of left <UNK> oh my this when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner but sadly it falls along way but don't you just love an opening ending also it sports some pop culture references and a self <UNK> tongue in cheek approach predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over stated at times but it knows that by <UNK> fun at itself quite a bit the atmosphere <UNK> a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the <UNK> but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added <UNK> <UNK> the cinema scene is done rather nicely too br br now now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick but sadly there's no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard if lacking but it's more then decent for such low budget flick there are one or two creative deaths but the rest are <UNK> the killer wasn't bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it i thought well the smart ass attitude didn't sit well with me another notes of the production which were dire <UNK> from the cut away editing out of place soundtrack and <UNK> <UNK> direction lacked execution and was pretty <UNK> but these <UNK> factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness br br the imagination matches the budget that's for sure but heck this lousy slasher wasn't trying to be anything else pure schlock that's slightly amusing
<START> it was extremely low budget it some scenes it looks like they recorded with a home video <UNK> however it does have a good plot line and its easy to follow 8 years after shooting her sexually abusive step father amanda is released from the psychiatric ward with the help of her doctor who she is secretly having an affair with the doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car but within the first 20 minutes of the movie amanda kills him and <UNK> him in her backyard then she <UNK> her neighbor richard sets eyes on him and stops at nothing until she has him she acts innocent but after another neighbor buzz finds out that amanda killed that doctor and attempted to kill richards wife laurie this is after amanda and him get it on in the hot <UNK> then she stops acting so innocent and kills buzz and later on attempts to kill richard whom she supposedly loves and cares for and you'll have to rent the movie to find out if amanda dies or not overall good movie reminds me a lot of my life you know the whole falling for the neighbor and stopping at nothing until you have him part
<START> two old buddies are sent to japan to get back results of a genetic research containing <UNK> which is stolen by the black suited ninjas at the beginning of the movie first they just have to learn some ninja skill because only ninja can beat the ninja br br <UNK> killers tries hard to be enjoyable ninja flick but fails that badly the whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that is hard to say anything good about it same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before characters are too briefly drawn direction is dull and script doesn't offer anything surprising even in the ending scene which by itself reduced movie's trash value br br even 80's ninja flick fan who understands the <UNK> of trash movies is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable it simply doesn't offer anything new to viewer neither in visual level nor in plot <UNK> are thrown and <UNK> are swinging but it's not enough to lead the movie direction it meant to be and <UNK> similar fighting scenes <UNK> even the most <UNK> viewer after the first 30 minutes br br it's hard to recommend movie to anyone even franco <UNK> clumsy performance in enter the ninja falls behind <UNK> killer's american ninjas even in visual level movie doesn't have any balls and it's waste of time to try to find any great fighting scenes in this movie there isn't any in all one of the most <UNK> ninja flicks i've ever seen doesn't interest even in curiosity trust me on this one br br <UNK> out of 10
<START> the third fred macmurray carole lombard film is a bit more serious than hands across the table and the princess comes across it's yet another adaption of the play <UNK> which apparently was popular back in the day br br the original play <UNK> ran on broadway in the <UNK> <UNK> season for <UNK> performances and it's the role that carole lombard plays that barbara stanwyck <UNK> on broadway that brought her to hollywood a version starred nancy <UNK> in the early days of <UNK> and later on betty <UNK> and dan <UNK> did still another version of it in when my baby smiles at me br br in fact i have a <UNK> album of a radio version that al <UNK> and ruby keeler did for the <UNK> radio theater that's an interesting work believe me br br anyway macmurray and lombard do fine by the old <UNK> the story is now set in a nightclub where lombard is a singer and macmurray is a jazz <UNK> note a nice performance by dorothy <UNK> as the latin <UNK> who gets between fred and carole also anthony quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the make for lombard br br swing high swing low holds up real nice today and i wouldn't be surprised if we see yet another version of <UNK> for the twenty first century
<START> i own this movie not by choice i do i was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me so i popped it in the old vcr and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying why god why the story line was not that bad as an <UNK> i could appreciate bits of it i think that maybe if you're into super geeky cheese romantic scenes you'll enjoy this film i always thought of myself as a <UNK> you know like dr spock unable to love there is very few good things to say about this film truly it is awful but if you're up to really badly made film this is the one for you the real story's much more interesting though br br if i had to sum up this film in one word it would be br br lame
<START> centered in the downtown and out <UNK> of detroit this comedy i found to be a terrific new comedic duo <UNK> pat <UNK> is a very funny man who happens to be a cop from japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief who has stolen a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> super <UNK> reluctantly he goes to the united states to follow the thief after being ordered by his commander <UNK> character <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> character a fast <UNK> but down to business player type detroit cop when they cross paths though the honorable <UNK> of japan meet the all out old school detroit police <UNK> <UNK> the two stumble and trip over each other at first but then develop a <UNK> that turns into an explosive two layered <UNK> team that <UNK> the case cold after battling a city crime boss for the stolen <UNK> and closing the case these two go from <UNK> each other to being friends and working well together a little worse for wear and in need of an extended vacation on top of it all they manage to come to a <UNK> closing i rated this a 9 <UNK> direction <UNK> this a near perfect comedy fun for all ages i recommend it highly
<START> birth of the beatles for being a us television movie released in the fall of 1979 has actually been so far the best movie which tells the tale of the the four <UNK> from <UNK> that <UNK> the music industry and the world as told by the point of view of former <UNK> pete best the performance from the entire cast is excellent but most especially the performance by stephen <UNK> as john lennon and rod <UNK> as paul <UNK> the film was produced by a legend of the rock and roll era mr dick clark who a year earlier in 1978 had produced another tv movie that has stood the test of time starring kurt <UNK> in the lead role about another musical legend elvis that movie was directed by an unknown director named john carpenter who went on to direct other successful movies such as halloween escape from new york and the thing the same can be said for the director of the birth of the beatles mr richard <UNK> he went on to direct other theatrical blockbusters such as star wars return of the jedi eye of the <UNK> and <UNK> edge among many the only other film that tells the story of the <UNK> four that i know of is back beat which had a theatrical release in 1994 however the critics did not care for it nor did the public for it did not have a long life span in the theater birth of the beatles is very charming and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the struggles <UNK> they went thru and ends at there <UNK> of success when they arrive in nyc and appear in the ed sullivan show in 1964 i highly recommend this film
<START> we all know a movie never does complete justice to the book but this is exceptional important characters were cut out <UNK> and alba were essentially <UNK> into the same character most of the subplots and major elements of the main plot were eliminated <UNK> <UNK> was extremely <UNK> making her seem like a much more shallow character than the one i got to know in the book in the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people which in turn was a key element in the life of the family in the movie she was no more than some special lady the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> third by the way is the son and thus comes after <UNK> second and its connections to that between <UNK> and his <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> not son who he also did recognize is chopped in half and its importance <UNK> br br one of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is all but stripped of this is called the house of the spirits where is the house the story of 3 4 generations of a family is supposed to <UNK> around the big house on the corner a line stated so many times in the novel the house in fundamental to the story but the movie <UNK> <UNK> it to a mere backdrop br br if i hadn't read the book before i would have never guessed that such a sappy shallow movie could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel
<START> a small funny film it is totally incredible unbelievable impossible but it is funny how an <UNK> <UNK> can become totally <UNK> and <UNK> even <UNK> by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his <UNK> of course it is a <UNK> of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet you must not believe ten percent of what you're told there and never ever ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally most of their <UNK> there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you but here the <UNK> deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive he is <UNK> silly but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his <UNK> and winning one think is sure too security in english <UNK> is not exactly what it should be but i guess it's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have <UNK> up all rules and <UNK> it is just fun to go through their <UNK> and foil them <UNK> then they have their vengeance by losing your <UNK> a real plague on modern <UNK> and don't expect to get fair <UNK> or even <UNK> a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener funny isn't it dr jacques <UNK> university paris <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK> university <UNK> saint quentin en <UNK>
<START> antonioni really showed some <UNK> when he had this movie made he went to america working under a contract from the most lavish studio mgm and he made the most <UNK> portrait of american society i've ever seen having seen la first hand this is the most accurate portrayal of the crowded <UNK> and <UNK> city if only antonioni had met bill <UNK> br br the subsequent burial by the studio is understandable after such a <UNK> investment and dismal return it is sad that people don't get to see this film any more as i believe antonioni has been proved right here he <UNK> the end of the hippie civil rights movement in the politics of america everyone is much more interested in what goes into their <UNK> and the relentless <UNK> of living space into the <UNK> yet beautiful desert and beyond how i would love to see interest in this film re <UNK> and a lavish dvd release br br i <UNK> people to watch zabriskie point with an open mind and an open heart we have a genuinely unique film commenting on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet and we have forgotten about it br br an unexpected gem
<START> it pains me to write such a <UNK> review but by not doing so i'm simply <UNK> these people first off just because a film is made on a small budget does not automatically make it good nor endearing in fact in this case the small budget is probably the films sole achievement in that it prevented large sums of money from being <UNK> on a one <UNK> race horse with the <UNK> have you ever seen a comedy at the theatre ever heard people laugh and thought what the dickens are you on well even these <UNK> weren't laughing things got so bad by mid way my cat took his first ever bath this is not film this is children no monkeys making images that leave you feeling like moving to france got to go there's a clown at my door
<START> unhinged was part of the video nasty censorship film selection that the uk built up in the 80's keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children don't you know it must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about by today's standard unhinged is a tame little fairy tale br br 3 girls are off to a jazz concert and right away you know the body count is going to be quite low they get lost in the woods wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake it's laughable they are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house one of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs then there's talking talking about why the girls are here and how they must be to dinner on time because mother doesn't like it when someone is late and more talking <UNK> <UNK> some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and <UNK> the girls and someone's <UNK> is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like hitchcock's psycho i <UNK> because there is so much blah blah in this film that you wonder when the killings are going to start in fact one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods alone looking for the town smart move she probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part but just didn't care more talk continues after this as we wait wait and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed br br and then there's the twist ending the expected unexpected for some viewers for others a real <UNK> quite possibly the only reason why someone would really want to watch this i don't care how twisted it is nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time i had watching it even with the minor impact of the ending the director just didn't have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it it would have made a much better 30 minute 1 hour tv episode on say tales from the <UNK> br br if you really must get this for any reason perhaps just to say you've watched every slasher movie do yourself a favor and have the fast forward button ready since the movie has so many <UNK> scenes just zoom through them and in no time you'll get to the wow that's what it was all this time ending oh and halfway through the movie there's a shower scene with 2 girls showing boo <UNK> <UNK> for boo <UNK> those beautiful <UNK> honey making boo <UNK>
<START> the british <UNK> series putting witty conversations taped from average people in the mouths of cute <UNK> creatures at least had the advantage for non british viewers of seeming <UNK> and the kind of <UNK> <UNK> humor you couldn't get on u s television someone made the mistake of putting it on u s television br br sort of like the sadly miscast american version of the sublime brit com <UNK> which died in a month on nbc when the same basic scripts didn't translate from british english to american english what seemed <UNK> and <UNK> and just a bit dull in england comes across in creature <UNK> the american version as simply boredom with puppets there's no through plot line no characters and after one and a half episodes watched of the three ultimately aired no reason to suffer through more br br the only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully brief run it had is that the <UNK> is at least <UNK> done and coming as a set up for the single worst show on the cbs schedule the new adventures of old christine or how to be a horrible mother or person in one interminable unfunny lesson kids who wanted to stay up past their <UNK> happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show and the adults could wait to tune in until <UNK> when two and a half men guilty pleasure and how i met your mother actual quality writing come on
<START> 10 10 for this film br br i'm a british india doctor currently in india the word beckham put me off <UNK> i'm a die hard <UNK> fan and personally think that owen is really cool since <UNK> and man <UNK> are rivals i was dead sure that i wouldn't watch the film br br but then i was in <UNK> to meet some friends and i had an early morning flight so i thought what the heck let's <UNK> time by watching this film <UNK> it was a late night show br br what a moron i was i should've seen this film the day it was released i guess using <UNK> name was to draw audience attraction which had back fired in my case but then i really can't think of a better title for the film br br and <UNK> knightley drop dead gorgeous and rhys myers did a superb job br br if you hate football dislike <UNK> united or england for that matter then this is <UNK> the film for you in fact i'm just <UNK> <UNK> old a psychiatrist by profession but a kid at heart this film has knocked star wars off my no 1 position br br surprisingly there aren't very many comments on this film by indian brits like me i wonder why br br 10 10 for this film
<START> this is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching the story is engaging and it doesn't take long before the chemistry between nicole kidman and ben chaplin grabs your attention the acting is first class and the characters are represented well sometimes it feels like the director couldn't decide himself between drama and romantic comedy ben <UNK> portrayal of the law <UNK> and shy <UNK> with porn s m magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs as does the look in nicole <UNK> eyes when she is offering john his first taste of <UNK> in a long time other times the actors and especially nicole kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic <UNK>
<START> without doubt beat street is the best film about the <UNK> scene everything about it is spot on the clothes <UNK> the music and most importantly the dancing the storyline is basic but hey whats there to tell a story about the whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doing what <UNK> to them it shows that teenagers in general are good all that <UNK> to these everyday kids was music dancing and friendship having watched the dvd recently i was <UNK> surprised how well it had stood the test of time the clothes didn't look dated possibly because <UNK> is now having a massive comeback the music still sounds fresh and the dancing is still captivating to watch a film anyone 10 25 years of age should see as part of their youth culture

<START> i loved this movie you have to respect <UNK> that dressed up like tiny martians sure the story may have been thin at times but you can't take away from the way it was done i used to watch this over and over again when i was 8 its a kids movie and besides it has some of the greatest quotes ever <UNK> home on the range rendition is awesome br br very well done if you ask me 8 of 10
<START> thanks to some infamous home video <UNK> who brought in the so called german independent series four for <UNK> is not only awful but really awful so awful that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash br br nick and charlotte is a married couple who reached an <UNK> of having sex only on <UNK> due to their <UNK> schedule of their profession eva and luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth where eva works as a waitress and luis an artist nick <UNK> causes eva to lose her job as an waitress luis and charlotte had an affair at the back of eva and nick luis cheated on eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to london to do something related to his artwork but the fact is he is flying off to <UNK> with charlotte for an adultery holiday eva kidnapped nick and dragged her 2 kids along to <UNK> for confrontation the trip to <UNK> ends up both nick and eva falling for one another br br the presentation of the journey from germany to <UNK> between nick and eva marks the failure of the comedy it not only look senseless but also <UNK> in the film nick try to seek help for several ways but it ends to no <UNK> it is either the strangers around him who acts like morons or they are just simply dumb br br the comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to <UNK> the story while some of the problems that can be solved with common sense no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem they prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem br br it fails so bad that even the beautiful <UNK> in <UNK> fails to pull up the reputation of the film
<START> <UNK> and michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other <UNK> has a long time lover in the hospital and michael hires a prostitute that doesn't satisfy him the two <UNK> with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end br br there's not a whole lot to this particular short the direction is straight forward and dramatic which is good the acting is sincere but the story leaves a little bit to be desired why exactly do we care about these two people it's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it's much more <UNK> down and doesn't search for meaning in it a <UNK> change of pace if anything br br i don't know it's possible i don't connect to these stories because i've never experienced them but i have noticed that the <UNK> in these <UNK> are typically the same i e a couple talking together while avoiding eye contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines etc the nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different and i'd like to see a different take br br <UNK>
<START> in fact it's basically the same movie and they couldn't even get the time line of events correct maybe that was intentional due to <UNK> or not caring either way this thing is a real <UNK> it doesn't even deserved to be called a movie i viewed this as a so called second feature on the disc containing the original the boogeyman i thought my head would explode and i urge you to run as far in the opposite direction of this thing if you should be cursed with the misfortune of <UNK> across it's path it should come with a warning label like warning may cause your i q to drop several points if you are within it's <UNK> for me there's no doubt this thing is a 0 10
<START> i love this <UNK> movie walsh is a true master of the cinematic form his film have been sometimes in my opinion overlooked but this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in br br all the wonderful characters that existed the lifestyle the mode of dress the way they spoke ok they might be exaggerated but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to <UNK> each other with insane stunts br br i just felt it was <UNK> of history thats should be <UNK> by many people and appreciated because of that fact br br can i get it somewhere on dvd i have only seen it on tv but for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one
<START> this is an extremely dense somber and complicated film that <UNK> quite slowly revealing excruciating detail like the attention paid in a novel and watching this film is like watching a novel unfold while i didn't care for the narrator as i felt he was out of balance with the rest of the performances this film features some of the best ensemble acting i have ever seen and the lead summer phoenix is fabulous her innocence and <UNK> some might find implausible sort of a cross between cinderella and alice in wonderland i can buy that critique but she's still fabulous partially because she's unlike anything i've ever seen before br br this film is unbelievably beautiful filmed by eric <UNK> and part of what is so unique about this film is how it doesn't ever show what you'd expect it's always surprising and despite it's length the film never reveals more than it needs to at <UNK> minutes it's extremely <UNK> to a fault i'd say which is one of the wonders of this film it's filled with brief moments which are simply stunning some of the best you're likely to see all year and all these moments add up in the end to an extraordinary film experience the family moments are unique ian <UNK> is brilliant and what this film has to say about the theater hasn't been seen in films since <UNK> opening night or perhaps <UNK> <UNK> but believe it or not this film is much less conventional i never knew where this film was going and now having seen it it still has multiple possibilities this is a powerful incredibly provocative film
<START> i think that the shots and lighting were very poor when i watched it for the first time i thought it was the old version 1956 when i really found out the true year of the film i was shocked i didn't know that there could be such a bad film made so recently thats really all i wanted to say this film had a good plot though nothing you couldn't miss out on if you would simply read the novel that george <UNK> wrote all i really want to say has already been said except for this i can't believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and nominations i gave this film a one awful because i felt that it was very badly made well that is all so long
<START> an interesting idea involving an alternative dimension inside a hospital it <UNK> stephen kings <UNK> kingdom hospital and old twilight zone episodes <UNK> strong the set up was great there were also some very clever <UNK> <UNK> moments which always have that head melt appeal the story had plenty of vague references which led me to believe that all the ensuing weirdness of time slips ghosts a weird bat <UNK> demon and a rather silly heavy metal <UNK> <UNK> thing would be explained and that was were dark floors severely let me down based on my viewing the movie gives no explanation as to what is behind the events whilst some ambiguity is always expected welcome in these kind of films dark floors took it to new heights of <UNK> i don't expect things wrapped up in a pretty <UNK> but neither should i be left feeling huh is that it did i dose off maybe i hit chapter skip by mistake dark floors left me with a deeply unsatisfying suspicion that it was all a dream which is a shame because up until the last reel i was very much on board and enjoying the movie
<START> when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don't care what the movie is edison started really good with some good effort from the singers who want to be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience done a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action done and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie when you see 30 elite police officers packed with weapons that can <UNK> a building shoot at a guy behind a car fail to hit him even once while he kills all but 3 and then the guy takes out a flame <UNK> to kill the rest 3 you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this
<START> when i first saw the title i was already <UNK> the theme of the film it clearly wasn't a reference to british <UNK> so it had to be <UNK> and about pounds of flesh taking them or giving them will smith's a <UNK> actor so serial killers were out it could only be about a man giving them so must be about guilt somehow i <UNK> the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched as the beauty of the build up is the way parts of the main character's background are <UNK> fed to slowly <UNK> the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doing br br guilt is a very hard subject to do simply because it's deeply uncomfortable and sad which is not an <UNK> premise when you are hoping for a roller coaster ride you know its going to be unpleasant i wouldn't say the movie <UNK> suicide it <UNK> into the most extreme form of self sacrifice <UNK> br br it's also <UNK> with symbolism everywhere which is a <UNK> tell tale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep <UNK> nature the most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and <UNK> but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could determined to die but his plan is <UNK> by falling in love what a 2nd act <UNK> absolutely masterful br br yes it is very slow paced but i'm <UNK> as to whether it would have been better <UNK> into a smaller <UNK> i didn't feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have but maybe that's just me having ruined it for myself beforehand saying all that though it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get
<START> if there has ever been a worse comedy than <UNK> <UNK> i am unaware of it the new york jewish <UNK> <UNK> premise is that siblings sam gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix sam up with a girlfriend only to find that gray is equally attracted to their target charlie the revelation that gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her there is a deeply offensive wedding sequence a deeply embarrassing <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> and graham and a performance that would embarrass <UNK> everywhere for its <UNK> from tom <UNK> sissy <UNK> demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this <UNK> from her resume molly shannon plays the <UNK> friend with <UNK> <UNK> only alan <UNK> emerges with any credit but is seriously under employed and given nothing with which to work the whole disaster is <UNK> by <UNK> bizarre eye rolling performance culminating with the <UNK> scene where she wears a comedy hat and an <UNK> despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar it is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs
<START> perhaps not the absolute greatest entry in the hammer house of horror series but it surely wins the award for most <UNK> titled episode the house that <UNK> to death  i could yell out this title all day without ever getting tired of it and besides the wondrous title this short movie also <UNK> from a <UNK> written screenplay and a handful of genuinely suspenseful moments it might require an extra viewing before you fully understand the peculiar end twist but it's definitely an original idea for a horror short the story opens with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle class house the husband <UNK> kills his wife and several years later the cursed house is still for sale a young couple and their <UNK> daughter move in and start to <UNK> it but mysterious events occur and affect especially the young sophie her beloved cat is killed an even her birthday party gets ruined when one of the <UNK> <UNK> suddenly <UNK> blood all over the guests a particularly chilling sequence this one is the old house really haunted or maybe the <UNK> helpful neighbors cause all the horror the answers to these questions are provided in the original and fairly unpredictable climax and there's even room for a real shock at the very end the tension is masterfully built up and the titular house is filled with eerie scenery like the pair of rusty <UNK> used by the husband to <UNK> his wife little warning though the sequence with the cat is hard to watch when you're an animal lover in conclusion another winner for <UNK> short running tv series
<START> there is something special about the <UNK> movies not only by <UNK> but by <UNK> and other directors as well this is the <UNK> sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the movie <UNK> is no exception this effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing in <UNK> i have never had the feeling that these are actors playing but real people instead so real is the visceral feeling of the viewer almost as if the grumpy <UNK> or lonely lady in the movie are living below you in your block br br any person living in vienna can without any doubt painfully recognize the people in the movie with their <UNK> <UNK> complaining their hidden sexual <UNK> and the <UNK> macho guys this is further <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> which is according to many especially made for complaining as a way of life a special <UNK> and arrogance typical for vienna are also very well portrayed br br the <UNK> <UNK> have a vivid presence in the movie with their <UNK> and <UNK> where nothing happens moreover they have been turned into a celebration of <UNK> with shopping <UNK> and huge department stores <UNK> are the houses of the people where they <UNK> into what they <UNK> is pleasure giving activities trying to stay in touch with their human <UNK> yet in vain the examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men which <UNK> on rape the <UNK> guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who <UNK> and <UNK> her drivers br br the film has no soundtrack as it concentrates on the <UNK> <UNK> of its images only another typical feature of <UNK> and other <UNK> directors is his showing of <UNK> sexual images these include the <UNK> of the old woman for her husband the sexual scenes in the bath the sexual game of the lady with the two men in her apartment etc br br in <UNK> <UNK> has portrayed the lives of people who eventually may be as much <UNK> as they could be citizens of paris new york or <UNK> the viewers should not despise or feel pity for the <UNK> in the movie as they themselves could become victims of the same human <UNK> and alienation albeit in different circumstances in the end i believe <UNK> film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in <UNK> and if the viewer does not <UNK> to the reasons for this evil transformation <UNK> has achieved his goal
<START> for such a great classic tale the setting location grendel was disappointing as a writer i blame the script which completely lacked dramatic tension the <UNK> of the club story is useful and would have provided a new take on the literary classic for some weird reason that <UNK> was dropped early on to know this was shot in 21 days says to me rushed and it unfortunately shows now we'll have to wait for the hollywood version on the big screen i word on fx i can tolerate really crappy cgi but the script has to rock and this one was just too slow <UNK> and lacking in drama i'd blame it on the actors but since i know writing more than acting i'll pick on my colleague
<START> totally forgettable specially because of the weak acting this is the first movie i've seen with <UNK> shepard to my surprise he's been around since the late 90's i thought he was a newcomer since his acting was so bland i could say the same about <UNK> tyler although i've seen her do well in other movies she gave <UNK> cooper a strange personality <UNK> is not the kind of actress that will give the character a fiery emotional personality like diane keaton would be able to but it was pretty strange to see her say her lines in <UNK> mode it seemed that altogether there simply wasn't a very good chemistry going on between the actors and i think diane keaton <UNK> that as well she's a fantastic actress but seemed just a bit over the top in this movie it felt like she just wanted to get this movie over as soon as possible i wouldn't blame her
<START> since this movie was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well off it was just scary as to how real it really was the acting is what gave the movie that push to greatness br br diane keaton portrayed the main character <UNK> <UNK> who had two sons whom she <UNK> her performance is what made the real life story come to life on a television screen it was very hard to watch some of the scenes since they were so real as to what happens when one becomes addicted to drugs br br just watching this very loving mother go from sweet to not caring at all was hard but so true i have known people who have gone through <UNK> and it was very much like what happened in this movie from what i remember br br i also thought that it was very <UNK> for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman yet it was done so well i applaud the director for making this movie br br i highly recommend this to anyone who has known someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or to just learn what can happen to you if you do become addicted to them
<START> unlike others i refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance i don't want to give style a bad name still it's the most apt description that comes to mind br br a pointless unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears wonderland leaves one wondering only why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the <UNK> to this dreary and <UNK> mess a biography of porn star john holmes a study of who the man was why he went into the business and how it affected him great bound to be compelling bound to be entertaining bound to be <UNK> and fascinating on about a million levels and i have zero interest in porn br br but a confusing violent <UNK> style study of a series of murders holmes was connected with after his career ended who in hell cares what insights do we gain this film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of john <UNK> life that he was a porno star wonderland might as well have been about anyone the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult film star in history is almost irrelevant br br to make matters about a thousand times worse the picture is loaded down with <UNK> gimmicks annoying machine gun editing sloppy <UNK> 95 <UNK> unnecessary split screen graphics and animation etc etc br br in the absence of a compelling story and unique main character the director and i use the term loosely has thrown together a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a movie among these the trendy <UNK> <UNK> look of <UNK> or traffic or minority report the frantic often incomprehensible throw the pieces of film in the air cutting style of natural born killers or 28 days later the fill every moment of silence with an old song to evoke the period soundtrack of <UNK> or blow the <UNK> retro title sequence of <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> or catch me if you can the list goes on and on and on pathetic br br i wanted to like this movie i had real hopes for it wonderland <UNK> had been around for years had the context of the murders been <UNK> rather than the murders themselves i think it could have worked had the murders and <UNK> growing involvement with seedy l a types <UNK> the end of a career or the end of the swinging '70s i think the film could have had meaning it could have served a purpose as it is meaningless pointless who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown by the public the case isn't famous enough to merit such <UNK> examination br br this film should have been the third act of the john holmes story that's it period and it could have worked what's that oh right right they didn't want to tell a traditional rise and fall story they didn't want to make boogie nights or <UNK> or star 80 or <UNK> they wanted their film to be different right br br well in one sense they succeeded there's a big difference between those films and wonderland the difference is those films are good br br
<START> this is a modest character driven comedy filmed in brazil on a low budget the premise is familiar the same as in the 1950's danny <UNK> movie on the double someone who as a joke does an impression of a famous person then is <UNK> to <UNK> the person for real br br the contrast between the two leads is highly effective <UNK> julia as the german <UNK> secret policeman is tall cool menacing and latin he sports a deliberately obvious blond <UNK> job richard <UNK> animated short new york jewish is funny and sympathetic there are many references and inside jokes about show business br br the setting is clearly <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> was indeed ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by gen <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> military dictator whose father had <UNK> from germany but writer director <UNK> reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints <UNK> <UNK> as a typical latin american <UNK> with huge <UNK> in wealth and an active <UNK> <UNK> further in this vein <UNK> casts comic jonathan winters as an american <UNK> who in truth is c i a station chief in <UNK> and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a profanity laced chewing out br br in fact the u s has little influence in <UNK> which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region this is due to the country's having fought long and <UNK> wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries the male population was nearly wiped out both times but the society that emerged was patriotic <UNK> <UNK> and strongly united br br on yet another level there is a bow to <UNK> in the form of the character madonna played by brazilian actress <UNK> <UNK> madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body <UNK> presidential pleasure girl at the film's start but is seen on television as president herself at the end now politically and <UNK> correct no makeup hair <UNK> pulled back swept to office by a <UNK> revolution br br the one time that such an event actually happened in latin america the administration of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> not the beloved <UNK> who never held office lasted two years after the death of her husband legendary <UNK> juan <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> may have had the potential to be even a half way plausible and more enjoyable thriller had the main character lisa roberts <UNK> cox not been so stupid when she is the victim of another attack on the streets of new york comic book artist roberts moves to a small town out west in her first days there she meets the <UNK> crazy randall <UNK> craig <UNK> playing this part well who will eventually not leave her side <UNK> for her safety after having been in the situation already twice before she strikes up a friendship and relationship with the <UNK> <UNK> town cop steve smith d b <UNK> who's character does not seem convincing enough leaving disbelief among viewers who should otherwise be convinced of the red herrings thrown by the writers smith needs roberts <UNK> because as he tells her <UNK> is an ex con and guilty of sexual assault but the cops have lacked the evidence to put him away before br br the movie had enough <UNK> to at least make an interesting movie because soon enough there is such confusion as to whom roberts should trust however much of the intended suspense appears too forced because roberts character never seems to react to simple things as we think any reasonable person might and her <UNK> <UNK> allow much of that suspense to occur to easily and <UNK> particularly in the finale perhaps <UNK> was the wrong choice for this role too baby faced in ways that kind of recall kevin <UNK> persona evident in his character in <UNK> with the enemy ' or if lisa roberts was written as a stronger character this might suffice as well in the meantime the film is not all that great even as a low budget b thriller
<START> there are many <UNK> born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times constant <UNK> or <UNK> information in the realm of <UNK> have kept <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> busy with enough work to last them decades occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their <UNK> or even of their existence that is the premise of the film entitled the night <UNK> it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel <UNK> robin williams who spends his <UNK> enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay <UNK> perhaps its because his show is losing it's authentic <UNK> which causes <UNK> to admit he is no longer himself feeling abandoned by both his lover jess bobby <UNK> and his and best friend joe <UNK> he seeks shelter in his <UNK> despair and isolation it is here a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help <UNK> needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called peter <UNK> culkin in reading the boy's harrowing <UNK> which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents <UNK> is captivated and wants to help however things are not what they seem and <UNK> soon finds himself en wrapped in an <UNK> and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d <UNK> sandra oh as anna and john <UNK> as pop this might be comical instead this may prove to be one of <UNK> more serious performances
<START> to be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it but i'm never one to let others influence my viewings in fact i'm more likely to watch something out of <UNK> <UNK> had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway the fact that <UNK> <UNK> and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away the picture isn't very good and is in fact very morally dubious all the characters are corrupt and <UNK> in one way shape or form all motivated by greed or <UNK> <UNK> this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax <UNK> picture sadly it doesn't and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can't help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film nobody in the cast come out with any credit with lead man guy madison painfully wooden in the extreme br br not even the lovely <UNK> can make me recommend this to anyone 3 10
<START> i'll keep this short as i know i don't need to say much br br alive is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some but i found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning the film did very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so convoluted that i completely lost interest as i said i know others enjoyed it but i found <UNK> alive to be anything but a lame extremely boring drama disguised as a thought provoking action sci fi flick i felt like i was <UNK> into watching this film based by its intriguing premise and uber exciting cover art br br my suggestion pass it up for <UNK> far more enjoyable <UNK> effort versus or his 2004 riot godzilla final wars br br and don't get me wrong i'm always up for a good thinking man's film but this certainly wasn't it there was <UNK> a moment that i actually cared about a single event taking place in this overly preachy dialogue heavy movie br br if you wanna talk about something talk about boring
<START> connie hoffman is very pretty and is <UNK> topless at times br br that's it folks the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not br br these 70s <UNK> period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> big hair <UNK> <UNK> etc this one isn't br br the script is bad the acting is bad the direction is bad and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad br br the title <UNK> at a sex comedy is grossly misleading br br i <UNK> recommend avoiding this one like the plague
<START> we have to remember that the 50's were practically a blank <UNK> when it came to movies hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies noir two reel <UNK> etc to movies with a message we had <UNK> jungle on the <UNK> and so on some folks might think that was an improvement i don't who was the <UNK> who said if you want to send a message call western union he was right these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy br br this one is a <UNK> it's about three sisters trying to <UNK> control of their dead father's estate one of them maybe the only one worth redemption <UNK> the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay he's initially in it for the bucks but eventually falls for her meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to <UNK> the romance the results are predictable you get a little bit of everything in this movie sexual tension between the sisters a little subtle <UNK> <UNK> insanity if there is such a thing we never get to meet the parents but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar the acting is so bad it's hard to believe it was released under the united artists <UNK> by a company called <UNK> air productions it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without <UNK> the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene br br i can't explain it not even to myself but i gave this pile of trash an 8 10 i'm familiar with the term it's so bad it's good but i don't think i ever ran into the phenomenon before well maybe hot <UNK> to hell but this one certainly fits you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in <UNK> basement
<START> paris je t ' <UNK> is a movie that explores the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it <UNK> this movie <UNK> some of the best directors from around the world such as gus van <UNK> joel and ethan <UNK> walter <UNK> a read more <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to tell short stories about love located in paris each one with their particular way of directing in this film we also have one of the best cast ever seen in a movie including such great actors like willem dafoe steve <UNK> natalie portman <UNK> wood gerard depardieu and many more each one with great performances in conclusion this movie is a <UNK> of stories of happiness <UNK> unexpected encounters and love
<START> first off i'm a huge fan of 80s movies and of jennifer <UNK> as well so yesterday i <UNK> into a local used book movie store and found a vhs copy i read the back and it sounded good and for 3 99 it was a good deal so i took it home and popped it in the vcr what a sweet movie at my age now i relate more to movies like about last night or st <UNK> fire but still i remember what it was like to be 15 16 and in love with an older guy etc we all have those little <UNK> when we're younger and if it doesn't work out we're <UNK> and we think that we'll never get over it but of course we do many times it's that sort of sweet quality that i really got from this movie the feeling of <UNK> i remember when something like that happened to me is all through it the characters are interesting and well developed i recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies teen films in particular or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives
<START> all in all a good film and better for the fact that had the film not been made the story might remain hidden to the masses brosnan does a good job as the native american with a hidden past and the photography is stunning to some this may be too whimsical to others boring for me it is a gentle well told tale and perfect for family viewing now that's not something you get a lot of recently
<START> i remember following the case of andre <UNK> in the <UNK> while i was living in south africa they had photos of him sitting in his cage while being <UNK> in court not as it turned out to protect the court members but to protect him from the public this was fascinating albeit morbid reading i later heard that a film had been made by hbo about the case but it was made for american tv <UNK> strangely citizen x got a limited cinematic release in south africa i charged down to the local <UNK> <UNK> complex and <UNK> bought a ticket i was alone my girlfriend at the time was only interested in the likes of steel <UNK> and fried green tomatoes wow what a brilliant film why wasn't it released to a wider audience had it not been made for tv it could have got an oscar nomination or 2 there is no way to spoil the ending who the killer is is never kept from the audience jeffrey <UNK> portrays a truly terrifying psycho he is calm <UNK> considered a failure by his wife and subjected to constant <UNK> and <UNK> by his superiors at work by committing these horrendous acts he gets to feel strong powerful br br fighting to catch him against all odds is a <UNK> played to excellent turn by stephen rea in one of his strongest performances he must battle the <UNK> pace of russian <UNK> the primitive resources he has at his <UNK> and above all the <UNK> by his superiors to acknowledge that the <UNK> even has a serial killer the general in charge <UNK> <UNK> says that serial killers are a <UNK> western phenomenon only donald sutherland is willing to help but his help must be under the counter the ever brilliant max von <UNK> plays a russian psychiatrist who breaks <UNK> and decides to help the <UNK> in their quest it is the first time in russian history that a shrink is used to build a profile of a serial killer still on the loose and he has everything to lose if his involvement is made public br br citizen x is brilliantly acted well written and the music and editing only add to the tension and theme of the film excellent support from a horribly underused <UNK> <UNK> and a real sense of impending doom make citizen x a film worth seeing this was too good to be made for tv
<START> series 2 has got off to a great start i don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them and this show makes you think like that these 4 30 something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic so the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than <UNK> making those choices
<START> lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show well if that idea doesn't intrigue you which it shouldn't stay away from <UNK> i had the <UNK> of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie i guess jerry springer doesn't play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show and he is only known as jerry in the film the plot if you can call it that is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mother's live in boyfriend so the mother's brilliant idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as getting it on with her daughter's boyfriend is it any coincidence they live in a trailer park meanwhile somewhere else in america a woman finds her <UNK> man with her friend in bed together so of course call america's <UNK> jerry springer i'd talk about the rest of the film but even thinking about the film now is giving me a headache jamie <UNK> who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive in the movie and remember michael <UNK> the kick ass karate master from the american ninja series well take a look at him now as a white trash drunk the thing is he really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it getting in touch with his <UNK> but if your idea of fun is seeing jerry springer sing a country song about his own show or guys <UNK> up with <UNK> well just watch the show instead at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this flick
<START> yes indeed it could have been a good movie a love <UNK> sorry for the <UNK> license but is not a triangle an interesting story unfortunately badly told the image is sometimes weird sometimes ok the picture looks crowded and narrow <UNK> the sound needs more attention it usually does in romanian movies the light and color <UNK> are sometimes badly chosen the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action about the acting sorry but the best actress is the <UNK> the others are acting <UNK> and cannot convince the viewer the acting is <UNK> when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be <UNK> it's a picture for adults told by the children bother only if extremely curious
<START> i always have a bit of <UNK> before watching the british period films because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays such as the ones of for example vanity fair or the other <UNK> girl but with a magnificent production design european landscapes and those thick british accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really have fortunately the excellent film the young victoria does not fall on that situation and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story the excellent performances from emily blunt paul <UNK> and jim <UNK> and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the view and i say unexpectedly because i usually do not pay too much attention to those details br br victorian era was in my humble opinion one of the key points in contemporary civilization and not only on the social aspect but also in the scientific artistic and cultural ones but i honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much and maybe because of that i enjoyed this <UNK> of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so much i also liked the way in which queen victoria is portrayed which is as a young and intelligent <UNK> whose decisions were not always good but they were at least inspired by good intentions i also found the depiction of the romance between victoria and prince albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of <UNK> as well as in the emotions it evokes the only fail i found on this movie is that screenwriter julian <UNK> used some clichés of the romantic cinema on the love story something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplay br br i liked the young victoria very much and i really took a very nice surprise with it i hope more period films follow the example of this movie the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story and not as the replacement of it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a good actor and when he's not directing a family film a fine director but he really shouldn't have directed this movie and the screenplay should've been rejected the director and writers must understand what the original tv show was really about as well as who the characters were and how they worked the original series had many episodes with razor sharp writing using good dialogue and with situations that american producers would never consider using in children's programming much less a movie which made the original series so well received by adults i mean the <UNK> were college <UNK> and some of them did even <UNK> alcohol and <UNK> <UNK> and there were characters who did get killed although most were bad guys if they had written it the way that it was originally done which isn't <UNK> things down with poor dialogue <UNK> humor and a weak plot this universal studio <UNK> joint venture wouldn't have such bad reviews br br this motion picture is almost pure <UNK> if you've seen the original <UNK> series then you'll know what i'm talking about br br the first thing that was out of place and annoying were the constant references to ford <UNK> company even going so far that lady penelope was riding around in a <UNK> ford <UNK> made up to look like <UNK> 1 instead of using what would've been more appropriate considering ms <UNK> station not to mention being more faithful to the original a rolls <UNK> <UNK> 1 she's supposed to be a distinguished member of british society hence the <UNK> for <UNK> finest make of <UNK> in the original series one other reviewer here <UNK> that penelope wouldn't be caught dead in a ford he's pretty much right in the context that the idea of her riding in a ford doesn't work at least they could have had penelope ride in a <UNK> made up like <UNK> 1 since <UNK> is a british car make that is owned by ford but no they had to use a straight ford but the ford product placement doesn't end there every single car you may see is a ford even the news flash that is shown on the tv sets in the movie were <UNK> by ford ford ford ford the <UNK> of ford vehicles makes this movie an obvious marketing vehicle for ford br br the original series had a design that was futuristic for the 1960s and still remains ahead of its time even today but the futuristic design in the original series worked because there was an effort to make the design look practical and <UNK> this kind of treatment didn't exist in the movie where everything is stylized to excess <UNK> the sense of <UNK> and <UNK> a lot of things that were done in the design of the movie were done strictly for style many times with no sense of function to give that style a sense of reason br br the original series relied on good acting performances of the voice talent to overcome the limited expressions in the puppets bringing them to life in the episodes the brilliant and lively music score by barry gray helped even further to connect the audience with the story the characters and how everything came together to help achieve the super objective a little bit of <UNK> talk the movie on the other hand had some overly grating performances anthony <UNK> <UNK> brains to a fault bill paxton as jeff tracy just didn't work despite decent acting one of few there were better choices for the hood than ben kingsley and many others that i don't care to mention it would take too long quite simply the puppets were more believable second was the overly generic and <UNK> music score by hans <UNK> sounding more like a mix between days of thunder and apollo 13 br br and of course the hood the hood in the original series had an ability to communicate with <UNK> through a statue of <UNK> as an <UNK> for <UNK> contact but that was where his extraordinary <UNK> ended he's a master of disguise and deception which allows him to sneak around <UNK> for the most part anyways to gather information of the thunderbirds vehicles for his own means he also uses weapons for his own defense including <UNK> and generally <UNK> information using a film camera although he tried to steal <UNK> 1 and 2 in the 1960s united artists release of <UNK> 6 which was the last thunderbirds show filmed in <UNK> and was the second thunderbirds theatrical release but while he is a nemesis of international rescue the hood isn't the villain in every thunderbirds episode and he tends to avoid direct confrontation with international rescue in the movie he's obviously the main villain but he and his <UNK> seem to act more like morons along with the hood having extended mind control ability including the ability to move objects and move himself into flight for brief periods of time this totally <UNK> from the hood as a character in the original series with one that may leave kids laughing and people familiar with the series scratching their heads in confusion or leaving the theater in disgust br br there are more criticisms but the 1000 word limit for imdb reviews will not allow me to list all of them so i will close with the point being made that i didn't enjoy this movie as a matter of fact i think it sucks having seen the original series and <UNK> movies thunderbirds are go <UNK> 6 i was hoping for something a lot better than this br br the original <UNK> was a lot more sophisticated and elegant than this live action farce and that's saying it nicely <UNK> wells
<START> i grew up watching inspector gadget it was and still is one of my favorite cartoons if not my absolute favorite i learned a lot of <UNK> and history from the spin off inspector <UNK> field trip i wanted to slip on a banana <UNK> and become the greatest detective ever br br but the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon br br matthew <UNK> an actor with potential was definitely not the role for inspector gadget first thing in the film inspector gadget is smart not so in the cartoon in the film gadget <UNK> the mystery mostly by himself in the cartoon it was almost always penny brain and the awesome book i still want her book if gadget solved the mystery it was by accident gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective but in the cartoon was pretty dumb which was where the humor came from br br another thing is that it's too much good guy v bad guy in the film it's not just meant to be a silly saturday morning cartoon also gadget never should have a love story but disney corporation is filled with idiots br br also i miss the true <UNK> that gadget had and especially the gadget car in the movie it was a <UNK> <UNK> in the cartoon it was a <UNK> police car and could turn into a van it also barely had any <UNK> and was mainly there to get him from place to place br br but if anything the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie inspector gadget was a silly saturday morning cartoon the movie was too serious too overdone had too much of a plot and wasn't even remotely as funny br br tip for those who haven't seen it never see it ever watch the cartoon it's a true classic
<START> i just watched the documentary fog city <UNK> on the <UNK> cable tv network it is without a doubt one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever it chronicles the san francisco bay area artists and creative talent responsible for the some of the best films ever made in addition to the well known artists listed t also includes segments with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a segment about pixar animation studios i hope it will be released on dvd this is a must for any collection about cinema history and brilliant film making if you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them you will not be disappointed
<START> <UNK> of the lost kingdom is a movie about a young prince simon who is <UNK> from his kingdom due to his father the king being killed by the cliche evil <UNK> this movie's about simon's adventures the special effects plot acting and generally everything about this movie is bad however it's so bad that it's funny you will keep watching this movie simply because it's so bad it's funny and like the other reviewer of the movie said it's so bad it's good
<START> the mere fact that i still think of the movie a decade later is what really speaks volumes about the film to me this <UNK> grand canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another i truly believe that before the movie crash there was grand canyon the major difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of their release i'm not going to argue which one is better but i will <UNK> to the idea that they share the same message i'd love to hear from those that have an opinion on this subject i will start a commentary which you can find at http www <UNK> com <UNK> you may also find me there to post any other topics about movies that we may share because i have a true love for film
<START> this series gets 2 stars solely because it puts some of <UNK> bleak house on film and perhaps someone will read the book contrary to what is probably received opinion diana <UNK> was poor as lady <UNK> she was clunky and wooden lady d is a reserved character but not a <UNK> <UNK> elliot is wrong wrong wrong for mr <UNK> so i'll <UNK> myself and respond to all those people who are saying i didn't read the book so i don't have to take this guy's opinion because he's <UNK> his <UNK> on the book true and not true for ex diana <UNK> is bad in her role because of poor acting whether or not you've read the book on the other hand <UNK> elliot is a passable <UNK> although too old the series fails not because it's unfair to compare it to the book but because the various plot lines and characters just don't <UNK> to make a coherent dramatic mysterious <UNK> entertainment it is dull and flat if you want to make <UNK> good bleak house you need to <UNK> 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes but i suggest that producers etc leave dickens alone even a christmas carol television <UNK> the genius of dickens as <UNK> in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a wonderfully made australian film <UNK> a true australian hero we are taken into the world of ned his best friend joe <UNK> and the other members of the kelly gang as the film explains and perhaps <UNK> <UNK> actions br br there is an exceptional cast present who all give stellar performances which brings the film to life great job heath orlando bloom was fantastic as joe playing the role of quiet loyal <UNK> very well i was swept up in the moment for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at <UNK> alas it was not to be br br some aspects of the film are fictional and as an avid ned kelly fan and <UNK> was slightly disappointed by this perhaps also the film could've gone longer to cover more of the kelly <UNK> <UNK> life i felt not enough was covered br br regardless of a few flaws this is a moving film which <UNK> all sorts of emotions and hey i'd assume this film would be better to watch rather than mick jagger trying to portray ned
<START> seriously the fact that this show is so popular just <UNK> the mind this show isn't funny it isn't clever it isn't original it's just a steaming pile of bull crap let me start with the characters the characters are all one dimensional morons with loud exaggerated voices that just sound like <UNK> on a <UNK> the voice acting could've been better then there's the animation my god it hurts my eyes just looking at it everything is too flat too <UNK> too bright and too candy <UNK> then there's the humor or lack thereof it's completely idiotic they just take these b grade jokes that aren't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death they also throw in some pointless <UNK> humor which <UNK> me and finally last and least the music it's just plain annoying it sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and <UNK> no emotion whatsoever i wish there was a score lower than 1 i really do this show seriously needs to be canceled it's a show i try to avoid like the plague whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off if you've never watched this show then don't watch quality programming like the simpsons or <UNK>
<START> the movie started off strong ll cool j deed as an undercover police officer with partner sgt <UNK> dylan mcdermott from the practice possibly miscast as a bad guy committing robbery and murder deed refuses to kill the drug dealer which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience the other big names freeman spacey et al are well cast and the movie shows promise br br the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake <UNK> is introduced given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake i would choose the former even talented actors have to work hard at their craft timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him i would have thought he would put on a better show given the fact that he has been acting talented for years everything he did in this film was unconvincing br br just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out <UNK> it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films even hardcore <UNK> fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent br br that aside there are a few plot holes such as <UNK> sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse <UNK> this movie had so much promise thoroughly disappointing
<START> i must admit that i had my doubts about this movie before i was going to watch it the main reason for that is because it was compared to a hitchcock movie i've seen several movies that were said to be inspired by hitchcock or that could have been made by the <UNK> of <UNK> himself but so far i haven't seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time in my opinion hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some cheap thrillers but on the other hand i must admit that i was intrigued by it because this is a european movie normally it's the big hollywood studios who like to abuse hitchcock's name if that can raise their <UNK> but this movie was made in one of the most <UNK> european countries ever and i'm sure that most french would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an <UNK> that's why i decided to give this movie a try and i must say that i'm glad that i did br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or read my lips as it is called in english tells the story of a young secretary named carla she is a <UNK> and loyal employee but has never been very appreciated by her colleagues that has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing <UNK> which has denied her to climb up on the <UNK> ladder of the company but when she is allowed to hire a <UNK> that can work for her all this is about to change paul <UNK> is a 25 year old and completely <UNK> ex convict the man is a thief but carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed she hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like but at the same time he drags her with him in his old life br br since i still believe that the name hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller which this movie definitely is i will not make any comparisons between hitchcock and jacques <UNK> directing fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie i hadn't heard of him before but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course i doubt if there is someone in hollywood who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband you know the typical tv movie story br br also worth <UNK> is the acting in this movie vincent <UNK> is quite famous but <UNK> <UNK> was a complete mystery to me there is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles but they both did an excellent job with their characters making them feel very believable and realistic paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and carla the typically helpless woman but thanks to their performances you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together br br all in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting despite the fact that i had my doubts about it i've soon become one of its greatest <UNK> i give this movie an 8 10 don't hesitate to give it a try
<START> an enjoyable game which offers fun and easy game play and fair replay ability staying true to the comic and providing a low learning <UNK> gives this game something not seen in most action <UNK> today also the narration and animated scenes used though lengthy animations are replaced by slide shows on the <UNK> 64 version use full advantage of the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> got to be one of the best political <UNK> i have seen to date with an excellent performance for <UNK> tomei and all the supporting actors br br excellent plot very well placed and a very good unexpected twist at the end the action scenes were well filmed choreographed very funny br br all in all i give this film a big thumbs up it's extremely critical of us military <UNK> in the middle east and as such it may receive bad reviews from people who don't share the same political view or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and <UNK> humour indeed at places the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic
<START> 10 items or less is one of those <UNK> the <UNK> pictures that is <UNK> in the simplicity that most independent movies have honest ad <UNK> performances by its two leads morgan freeman and paz vega who establish quite a <UNK> if unlikely duo the great thing is this entire movie looks improbable despite its <UNK> <UNK> roots how morgan <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> not physically arrives to where he meets this jaded check out girl who has an <UNK> relationship with her current <UNK> who also happens to be getting it on with her <UNK> husband played by bobby <UNK> in a small role is somehow left for us to witness more than <UNK> and their witty banter two people on opposite sides of the <UNK> of society is <UNK> simple so in a nutshell while there aren't any bang moments of earth shattering revelations this movie is a quirky little mood piece that probably otherwise got lost in the <UNK> of <UNK> which came out in 2006 but deserves to be seen if only for its honesty
<START> <UNK> the movie was fairly good a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes but chuck norris did hardly anything except for <UNK> the bomb and shoot a few characters the movie was very similar to the events of <UNK> 11 with a bin laden like terrorist sending a video to the president <UNK> and threatening to <UNK> it <UNK> mills had some superb action roles taking out <UNK> compound and various kick butt roles but there was a lack of chuck norris <UNK> took over most of the action leaving joshua chuck with <UNK> on her computer but overall it was realistic and didn't lack the action but only did it on mr <UNK> part i gave the film 7 10
<START> as a native film professor i can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films with native content that i have ever viewed i would rather get a root <UNK> than view this film again the use of stereotyping <UNK> attempts at <UNK> portions of traditional <UNK> stories and poor camera work were only made worse by the <UNK> <UNK> story line and bad script the writer and director have displayed the worst parts of a <UNK> approach to portraying native people and <UNK> if this person is native they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the <UNK> racism and poor sense of humor that they have developed if this person is non native they need to seriously re examine their white <UNK> and ask themselves if they are displaying <UNK> unintentional racism or if they are intentionally being ignorant my only hope is that the native actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts if you want to see good native films then check out christmas in the clouds dance me outside medicine river <UNK> highway smoke <UNK> to name just a few
<START> i loved <UNK> <UNK> before this show i thought she was great on top model and was really glad when she won i also liked chris knight he seems like a great guy but this show just made me sick i'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show i don't care that they were different ages i know age can't stand between love but <UNK> you had been together for only seven months it didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't <UNK> and i don't see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they're ready if it's meant to be then why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other and let it come naturally turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary it's <UNK> obvious that chris loves you with or without a ring and chris shame on you for breaking down and <UNK> to her anyway you've been through two failed <UNK> how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit i hope the relationship lasts but i really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage
<START> i have to confess that i am severely disappointed br br this version can in no way compete with the version of 1995 the reason why i watched it was that i wasn't entirely happy with <UNK> <UNK> as captain <UNK> and thought that rupert <UNK> jones looked much more like the captain i had imagined when i read the book and he was too br br unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film the rest is as un austen like as possible br br miss elliot would never have run through the streets of bath like this it wasn't in her character and it just wasn't done by a lady of the those times the anne elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity there are other painful <UNK> but this was the worst br br although there are 3 important quotes from the book they are at entirely inappropriate moments warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed br br and although this version is not much shorter than the other one it feels like everything is rushed very little care was taken to introduce the characters show their <UNK> and motives important scenes were <UNK> how could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way a disaster and it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one br br no no no if you love austen then don't waste your time with this
<START> when i saw previews of this movie i thought that it may be dumb but it will at least be funny well i was wrong even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re <UNK> their life the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible the first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny but by the end i could almost predict what stupid <UNK> is going to happen next br br throughout the movie i like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre which is still more than i can say for the movie itself
<START> after seeing a heavily <UNK> version of this movie on television years ago i was curious to see the <UNK> version i was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than i remembered but one thing really stood out i think other reviewers have mentioned this also namely what exactly is the nature and motivation of the chris sarandon character has he raped other victims before is he completely psychotic or an average <UNK> how did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister is this character at all credible or is it just a matter of more background being necessary he seems almost simultaneously to be an <UNK> believable character and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young vulnerable girls this seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general it has nothing to do with his performance which is <UNK> convincing the movie <UNK> an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject without quite <UNK> into either mode not the worst movie ever made but not all that good either
<START> this movie made me very angry i wanted desperately to <UNK> the scientists and unseen film makers during the course of it very very painful to sit through <UNK> and pretentious in the worst way the little good information on brain function chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new <UNK> horse sh t the worst <UNK> were the crack pot <UNK> <UNK> and joseph <UNK> mr <UNK> informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he on the other hand is living on a higher plane even the ideas and attitudes that i basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed clumsy superior pretentious preachy manner that i felt the desire to <UNK> them i think that's what made me so angry the fact that they've taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age <UNK> much of it is based around the <UNK> of <UNK> concepts of quantum theory to the <UNK> world <UNK> the <UNK> portions with <UNK> <UNK> are amateurish and cliché ridden br br i would refer people instead to bill <UNK> excellent <UNK> of science a brief history of nearly everything there's plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual established science
<START> monstrous mother son duo alice <UNK> and brian <UNK> sucks life force of <UNK> and their <UNK> target is pretty but lonely <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> however these monsters are <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> i have never been fan of sleazy overrated <UNK> like king <UNK> or barker but this b movie written by mr dung himself is actually not near as bad than it could be yes it is sometimes jaw <UNK> atrocious but there is actually some surprisingly impressive touches good old fashioned graveyard eerie soundtrack and <UNK> gothic house scene mirror showing the monstrous form of the villains etc of course the film is <UNK> by mr <UNK> <UNK> mouthed dialogue and all tactics of toilet seat obsession to <UNK> fat people leading to totally pointless subplot of rapist teacher but there is <UNK> among <UNK>
<START> this film may have been the biggest let down i've experienced in renting movies based on imdb reviews overall i simply found this to be a second rate movie br br leslie cheung is certainly passable as the <UNK> and ma wu handles his character with cheerful <UNK> on the other hand ma <UNK> makeup facial hair is so obviously phony that i simply could not take him seriously he looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for halloween complete with the 4 95 stick on beard br br the special effects were so so though the undead in the <UNK> were pretty good the tree tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick though the <UNK> shots from the <UNK> view more closely <UNK> sam <UNK> trademark shots in the more recent evil dead trilogy the <UNK> were ho hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get in fact it most closely reminded me of the lost in space episode where the <UNK> are caught in a <UNK> and br br the plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of european fairy tales there was no suspense and no plot twists in fact you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good who is bad and who is going to survive br br i just returned this film to netflix and then i sat down to write this review the very first thing i did was check the production date yep it says 1987 not the 1967 that i thought it might be and that pretty much sums it up the production values and fx are typical of the 1960s the plot and action seem much older as hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s br br out of

<START> thelma ritter did steal the picture i just finished watching it again i couldn't help becoming emotional in her final scene she didn't get the oscar that's why you shouldn't put too much faith in oscars richard widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3 d flawed human being jean peters was great as the <UNK> tough girl in her best role ever and richard <UNK> must have been very good why else would i have hated him so yes it was heavy handed on the <UNK> but without it you don't have much of a film watch their faces the top three stars didn't really need much script i would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue if you've ever seen ray <UNK> and rita <UNK> in the thief maybe you know what i mean when i was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to nyc i made my <UNK> uncle drive us to the foot of south street looking for no <UNK> that's when i knew that hollywood couldn't be trusted but i did find the river br br i'm not giving away much of the story because i hate it when i know what happens before i see it for myself if you have seen it no <UNK> is necessary just maybe someone who is reading these comments hasn't seen pickup on south street you will like it just don't go looking for <UNK> south street in new york city
<START> i read the running man from kings books as <UNK> and i felt for the main character john and his family this movie could have been so much more the trouble it was set during the big action movie <UNK> i watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing i felt nothing for the character and less for his cause yes it had funny scenes or laughable though i think that it did not save the movie in my eyes if you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of john as he gets his final revenge br br i give this movie a low number it may not have been this low if i had not read the book
<START> this is a truly terrible film br br i'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it if i have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film i shall die happy br br <UNK> dull although since it stars al pacino i was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen then the credits rolled and i realised i had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel br br i cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at imdb over 5 stars when i last saw the voting are you people voting ironically br br please please please do not watch this film
<START> this is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark half man type <UNK> on an <UNK> island then calls up all his old business and academic buddies to come and see his creation evil laugh but actually he wants his <UNK> to kill them lots of bad <UNK> goofy plot elements and babes <UNK> in tight t shirts follow br br these monster movies all follow a similar formula but this one <UNK> things up with a bit of humor i guarantee the folks who made this had <UNK> firmly planted in cheek not to mention the sexy babes but let's mention those sexy babes several hot babes in tight t shirts <UNK> <UNK> one's in her <UNK> at the beginning another at the end thank you thank you makers of bad movies the plot is full of goofy stuff a guy drives up in a <UNK> <UNK> it right into a tree then offers to fly everyone off the island in a helicopter yeah um well how <UNK> we think about that for a while we'll get back to you the <UNK> is hilarious either awful cgi or an equally comedic guy in a rubber suit the mad scientist gives a pretty good performance he's evil that's his motivation he makes no apologies br br overall if you want a stupid fun b movie this one should do the job
<START> i have seen this movie when i was about 7 years old which was 33 years ago and i never forgot this movie i was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle and i just couldn't believe it when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die br br my sister was in the movie with me and i asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it like we saw it only yesterday so it isn't just me br br this movie is a must see br br you will never forget it just like my sister and me
<START> <UNK> first film has all his trademark visual flair and <UNK> technique accompanied by compelling performances from <UNK> <UNK> as the handsome drifter and best of all clara <UNK> as the fabulous frantic giovanna remade several times as 'the <UNK> rings <UNK> but never <UNK> can't believe this was the man's first film it shows the confidence of someone at the <UNK> of their career
<START> over several years of looking for half decent films to rent for my kids i've developed a sixth sense for <UNK> the really cheesy direct to video efforts that are really painful to sit through for anyone over the age of eight i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me what did she say that for and why did he do that and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply bringing realism to a film please run them through with a dull <UNK> knife <UNK> was head and shoulders above this <UNK>
<START> the father of the who's alcoholic drummer keith moon was named arthur i found so many similarities between dudley moore and keith moon in this movie <UNK> <UNK> who usually overacts did quite a good job in this one and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn yes i agree sir john stole absolutely every scene it was a very different movie <UNK> the viewer to have a glimpse into another life we often try to catch a <UNK> of this movie on satellite god rest dudley moore this was such an enjoyable movie much satire and thumbs down to the rich and <UNK> <UNK> the close friendship between moore and sir john is rather endearing
<START> some guy gets whacked right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him he's got some <UNK> and they <UNK> the killer but a reporter gets interested she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked she walks in and <UNK> one bodyguard but he doesn't feel like talking i can't figure out why it's not like anyone else is interested she's the only reporter there anyway her editor <UNK> her from working on this lame story but hey she does anyway she goes to see the killer's sister mom a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time somebody blows up their trailer huge ball of fire then she <UNK> out the bodyguard from the hospital she finds him <UNK> on his boat but a minute later they're both underwater sucking on a <UNK> tank 'cause three guys are trying to <UNK> them and have blown up the boat big time huge ball of fire the reporter and the bodyguard <UNK> two of the guys who are trying to <UNK> them br br in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street there's a shootout with several <UNK> in a warehouse some car chases with <UNK> death a fake suicide etc etc <UNK> <UNK> all <UNK> carnage br br great stuff but what the reporter and the bodyguard can't figure is why in hell the original guy got whacked what's the motivation of course it might help us to figure out why the <UNK> even interested through almost all of this she's the only reporter on the story nobody else in the media cares not even with all the big <UNK> and dead bodies true the original guy who got whacked wasn't exactly a celebrity his job was a little bit dull he was just the president yeah the one who lives in the white house oh and the bodyguard is a secret service agent br br is that the spoiler br br it should be after all there are no tv cameras no other print <UNK> no <UNK> just another one of those police <UNK> crimes br br so what's the spoiler br br <UNK> think br br no wait the spoiler is that his wife did it yeah the first lady she was p ed because the president was <UNK> around and she gets away with it she's really sharp huh but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out why would anyone bother after all only one reporter is even interested br br i give this move a 1 it was so dumb i just had to keep watching and it only got dumber that's the real spoiler but even though i've told you you've got to see it to believe it
<START> despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie i really liked it this one however how to sum it up in one word this movie is and here comes the word crap br br but let's look at it part by part here is the plot finally the old queen has been removed from her castle but her <UNK> snow white has problems of another sort the court <UNK> father of her son has gone <UNK> as the super <UNK> goes to the extreme to battle his gray hair and sells the royal <UNK> for some blond and full hair in her desperation snow white seeks the help of <UNK> otto <UNK> who must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal <UNK> or at least try to find the name of <UNK> br br the whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay br br yes there are some good jokes even for fans of the first part or for fans of any of the other actors it's really not worth buying the the dvd believe me br br the only thing that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion are the performances of some of the actors that's why i gave the move 3 10 sadly the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story br br for example at one point they even cross over in our reality and sadly they don't do anything funny while being here br br still a lot of great actors in this movie otto <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> martin schneider nina <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> especially funny <UNK> <UNK> as the mirror <UNK> schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians aren't able to bring this really bad script to life br br maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now dvd <UNK> or <UNK> it's not worth the money br br i even regret renting the movie
<START> for fans of 1970s hammer type horror films this movie should be a treat the only thing i didn't like about the film was the fact that peter cushing was wasted on the worst episode in general however this is a solid spooky little movie if this is not <UNK> best film it's certainly one of them the best episode rightfully saved for last is the one featuring jon pertwee as a horror film actor it is really excellent as good as pertwee was in this role it's hard to believe he didn't do more of these types of movies all in all this is an entertaining movie which scared the heck out of me as a child and which still gives me the creeps to this day
<START> terrible movie if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006 that should be <UNK> what a waste of time other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the dialog is cheap and sexual clichés are all over it the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting the only good thing i can say about the movie is wait wait there is nothing good i can say about it i must have really disliked it to write about it this much <UNK>
<START> one of my all time favourite films ever just beautiful full of human emotion wit humour intelligence the story grows as does the lesson of life just a wonderful film in so many ways br br the cast are also <UNK> a great selection of the finest british talent around i loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film br br italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this everything about this film works br br i love it
<START> a truly adorable heroine who at turns is surprised and terrified by <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> runs full on into closed doors just a few of the moments that <UNK> in my memory of 'the naked <UNK> i loved what i caught of this show <UNK> <UNK> plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show tea <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> cute <UNK> and wonderfully accident prone how refreshing to see an actress who can clown it's no wonder <UNK> doesn't seem to know how to cast her but where oh where are the dvd releases the amount of <UNK> they release it's incredible me that this little gem continues to remain buried someone please correct me if i'm wrong
<START> rather nasty piece of business featuring bela lugosi as a mad scientist with yes a <UNK> like assistant and his mother a dwarf and yes the <UNK> wife sounds like a <UNK> movie actually lol lugosi gives his wife <UNK> from dead brides why them who knows so that his wife can keep looking beautiful he gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some <UNK> that makes the brides collapse at the <UNK> after another bride bites the dust a newspaper reporter just happens to be around for the scoop and decides to <UNK> around for a story she gets all sorts of clues about the <UNK> and lugosi heaven knows where the police were soon she's off to <UNK> <UNK> when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be <UNK> it all <UNK> in a totally far fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist but it seems that the scientist has x ray vision as he <UNK> her plans oh no what will happen i actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure lugosi is great here his <UNK> on are all very very strange the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable a fun little view
<START> here's an indie film i really wanted to like but ultimately could not the lack of script <UNK> <UNK> in the main titles really shows through and kills the picture the story is a nonsensical mess that isn't worth trying to figure out i quickly became bored within 10 minutes then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes hoping for the best before hitting the chapter stops to mercifully get to the end even that wasn't worth the extra effort <UNK> savage clearly tries too hard to be clever <UNK> its best sequences from evil dead 2 and the matrix as a result there's very little in <UNK> savage that hasn't been done before and better this film would have been much more fun as a 10 20 minute short but as a feature it just feels padded and forced of course there's no money in shorts so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to 75 minutes director matt <UNK> shows great promise and i wish him luck
<START> this santa movie starts off strange and i think santa might be a <UNK> instead of the usual <UNK> toy makers this santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from it's a small world i guess there are no child labor laws on the weird <UNK> plane on which he lives it's apparently not the north pole and not on earth none of these kids seem very happy and i kept wanting to see <UNK> break in and rescue the <UNK> though i guess for some of the third world kids these working conditions were perhaps an improvement over local <UNK> i sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys br br then the scene abruptly changes to hell where lots and lots of demons dance about like they are in a busby berkeley musical this fun in put to a stop by satan who orders one of them pitch to go to earth to ruin christmas personally i thought this movie already did that the devil and his <UNK> are actually kind of cute like hot stuff from the harvey comics but with cool evil <UNK> or if you are puerto <UNK> like a <UNK> mask with a <UNK> br br somehow a poverty stricken mexican kid named <UNK> a group of jerky kids who want to <UNK> santa and some rich kid are key <UNK> for the devil and santa so if the prince of darkness not donald <UNK> it's the other prince of darkness can somehow make her steal and be bad he'll <UNK> what we don't really know in fact as they root her on you get the impression that the film makers intend santa to be jesus as he has all these great powers and fights the devil over kids' souls later santa meets with his friend <UNK> he asks him to make him a special <UNK> that makes people dream nice dreams considering how much santa laughs in the film like a demented <UNK> i assume he must use this drug a lot he immediately goes to see a <UNK> who makes him a magic key that opens all doors considering he keeps kids as his personal <UNK> this magic key thing <UNK> me immensely during <UNK> christmas eve ride you see <UNK> behave like a little angel one problem down santa then takes time out now to take care of the rich kid whose parents are selfish <UNK> he gives them some sort of crazy cocktail which magically <UNK> their problems two problems solved this is a rare case where alcohol drugs help kids and <UNK> problems and as for the little <UNK> he gives them coal frustrated with his <UNK> to santa pitch then tries to steal the <UNK> which is pulled by creepy <UNK> deer when this fails he destroys <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> as a result santa can't become invisible to avoid dogs and gets <UNK> uh oh how can santa take a <UNK> to the betty ford clinic if he's stuck up a tree will st nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the <UNK> win if you care tune in and see however be warned that the film is bat crap crazy br br technically speaking the film is <UNK> while it is in color it's really <UNK> the music is mostly done on an <UNK> which along with bad singing from the kids produces perhaps the worst soundtrack i've heard in recent memory and the story is just incomprehensible and very very very creepy <UNK> and a santa that kidnaps kids is just plain creep <UNK> it's a film you should never show to kids but makes a great film to watch with friends so you can laugh at it from start to finish
<START> when i was over at hollywood video i looked through their <UNK> out movies and there was <UNK> for five <UNK> plus fifty percent off i saw it only once before and couldn't pass up this great deal the second viewing was much better than the first the box is so cool and the music is very good if you haven't seen <UNK> yet i recommend that you do or if you rented and hated <UNK> do give it another chance as another viewing of it may change your mind if you seen a copy at hollywood video for the price i got it for don't pass it up as it is a great deal br br <UNK> is well a very different but entertaining movie believe it or not is like watching a <UNK> video game with out playing it it has very low budget and actors i'm sure that nobody is familiar with we began the the video game uh i mean film with a guy and a woman some where in italy and there is a cave that actually looks like a <UNK> road train track tunnel and she says don't go in there and what does he do the normal stuff he didn't listen to her he goes in there and find lots of gladiator <UNK> and armor and a almost perfectly <UNK> body of a legendary gladiator named <UNK> where did the chair come from that <UNK> was sitting on and how did his body stay so good and where did the <UNK> pot come from so every cave is complete with a <UNK> pot <UNK> is wearing his armor helmet and has a weapon or two he does the dumbest thing a person could do he puts on the helmet and is taken over by the spirit of <UNK> from there he walks around just killing all of the <UNK> near by to bring back the real <UNK> br br now i said before its like a video game its hard to explain but it just feels like it the music even sounds like video games the acting is really terrible the actors say things like why is he doing this oh he was nuts already and fine since he's nuts i'm going home also the movie also has some major errors like a guy is running and trying to find his girlfriend in the night and is still running in the day time still searching for her with out taking a break br br this movie has some errors but it isn't a classic like werewolf but it is entertaining if you like really low budget error prone movies then you better see <UNK>
<START> when i first popped in happy birthday to me i checked the <UNK> to see how long the film was i was amazed at the length both animated and horror films share a common ground attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around 90 minutes anything more and you'll lose the bulk of your audience br br this <UNK> minutes or 20 minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me i'd like to say half of this movie could've been edited out but i would be too generous to say that go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could've been edited even without being a film major br br regardless of the <UNK> visit the movie was below mediocre it spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the elite 10 is killing off the remaining friends for the most part they not only over do it but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say it's this guy no it's this gal you'll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie and don't get me started on the acting br br okay that got me started i had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if melissa sue anderson played the character that went blind on little house on the <UNK> later research proved my <UNK> correct because all the way through this movie she genuinely looked blind strange as an established actress she should've been the best of the group but turned out the worst the rest of the staff aside from ann <UNK> was pretty damn bad too but she uh took the cake br br the movie begins with a group of ten friends and one's immediately killed off barely anyone thinks twice of this dear friend's disappearance so they continue on their merry way slowly then more rapidly there are revelations about <UNK> anderson the main character past and her psychologist who's a tad bit more personal and on call 24 7 apparently than most <UNK> all the while more and more deaths occur br br what's funny is just as the first disappearance the more best <UNK> <UNK> the less the rest care sure they give a few seconds of air time to say wow that person just wouldn't run off etc but then they're back to their sexual ways and speaking of which it's probably due to the horrid script or maybe it was i who was losing interest at minute 30 but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the max by another and best friends the next scene see the creepy guy that kept a mouse rat in his pocket  literally  and was the most obvious suspect i'm giving the film too much credit and time but how he became part of the elite 10 i'll never know br br but i <UNK> there's a mystery here why are these kids targets why is virginia thinking she's killed someone when it was never proved <UNK> the end that any of them actually has been slaughtered and why would the trailer and poster claim these killings to be six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see hell even for 1981 most of these had been shown in any of the first two friday the 13th films  <UNK> enough friday the 13th part 2 was released 2 weeks to the day of happy birthday to me perhaps they're speaking of when they filmed it months prior but were late to the well party br br when the secrets are revealed trust me you'll have to <UNK> 3 <UNK> to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives and even then put the subtitles on to get all the <UNK> victim killer's words even if you get the first time it's an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale it's almost worth watching the whole movie again but as a drinking game br br this birthday gathering should be avoided it's a horrible and illogical first draft script  please please know it takes multiple <UNK> before the cameras role it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting and it's 100 unrealistic on how people react in extraordinary circumstances br br side note when i was a kid or say 10 11 years old i loved horror films still do oddly definite guilty pleasures but they are getting harder and harder to watch as years pass we got our first vcr and i taped as many horror films off network or edited versions tv all i remember of happy birthday to me is getting the last 10 minutes on tape which scared me to death  and obviously gave away the big mystery on who the killer was even though i have seen other clips of this movie i think this is the first full length viewing i've had thankfully this awful movie didn't wound me as a child i am older now and i can take this trash but never again br br side note 2 that said that crazy happy birthday to me song played in the end credits and as a score throughout still creeps me out tremendously i guess this movie or last few minutes did have an influence on my childhood shame on you melissa sue anderson
<START> <UNK> has an interesting premises but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach the cast in unconvincing even patrick <UNK> who played great roles in movies like <UNK> cop 2 open fire under siege 2 and <UNK> the rest of the cast is unknown and not very good with the exception of jeffrey combs herbert west from the great re animator trilogy but he can play roles like this in his sleep which is a little what he does here the main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all the story is rather dull and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gory scenes especially at the end br br this could have been so much better i do not get the good reviews on this one it is below average really
<START> i went for this movie believing it had good ratings firstly it is ridiculous that they're releasing a movie originally made in 2001 seven years later in 2008 here in india everything in the movie looks dated even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget there is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get anthony hopkins doesn't seem to know what he is doing in the film he ends up giving a long monologue towards the end if the film had bright sparks during that scene i missed it as i was sleeping on my seat nothing about jennifer love <UNK> resembles a devil she wears ill fitting trite clothes and <UNK> at random kids as for alec baldwin a scene where he goes to meet <UNK> for the first time is not to be missed what a waste of money as anthony hopkins rightly put it go back home and write better
<START> too much of something borrowed grade b br br super bowl sunday is one of the <UNK> days at movie theaters every year because of this movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend every few years a studio releases a counter programming female <UNK> movie <UNK> the wedding <UNK> to compete with the big game this super bowl weekend similarly titled the wedding date will try to find success and attract viewers not watching the game br br sick of people feeling sorry for her single woman <UNK> <UNK> debra messing tv's will and grace hires male <UNK> nick <UNK> <UNK> about <UNK> to pose as her boyfriend for her sister's wedding in london her family has been giving her a hard time about her not being married and her ex fiancé of seven years who dumped her without a reason is the best man to make him jealous <UNK> <UNK> nick around her ex to make him see what he is missing but ultimately nick helps <UNK> realize that she can open up and let someone love her br br the film borrows too much from similar wedding movies it is almost a <UNK> copy of <UNK> picture perfect and mixes in scenes similar to the wedding <UNK> and my best friends wedding the movie also has a reverse pretty women theme going for it and knowing her audience the director makes clever references to that and other films br br the wedding date has all the clichéd elements of a typical wedding movie there is the stereotypical overbearing mother holland taylor <UNK> blonde and practically <UNK> wedding speeches by the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner the twist at the ending has been done before but it was something that wasn't completely expected the real reason why <UNK> was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film for the last half hour br br even though the wedding date is predictable it is able to stand on its own debra messing in her first lead role proves she can be charming and funny <UNK> <UNK> has great chemistry with debra messing but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic he is able to make best of what he is given and be able to salvage the character br br by the use of many clever <UNK> often sexual the film is actually funny although primarily a chick flick the film has <UNK> everyone can enjoy the feel good story and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time
<START> in the standard view this is a purely awful movie however it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie andy <UNK> ghost dressed in native american <UNK> dancing sends me into <UNK> <UNK> i wouldn't waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on tv check it out
<START> if i could give this film a real rating it would likely be in the minus numbers while i respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible horror films seriously people buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time br br despite it being a horror film there is nothing scary about it unless the idea of seeing how many horror <UNK> you can fit in one movie scares you if the rating had been higher it probably would have made for a better film in the long run br br whoever made this version of prom night you screwed up the actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip i'd sooner go and see one missed call again at least that had some plot
<START> depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this christmas evil can either turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller or one of the most pathetic and <UNK> lame holiday themed slashers ever made me personally i'm tempted to <UNK> for the latter because i didn't bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and <UNK> early 80's slasher with a <UNK> in a santa <UNK> costume <UNK> people wrong the movie actually handles about a bloke named harry <UNK> who's obsessed with christmas works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on christmas eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment harry's issues all started when he witnessed santa  his daddy in a costume obviously  <UNK> his <UNK> naked legs at a <UNK> young age after that he just developed into a social <UNK> much to the <UNK> of his younger brother who's bound to snap one <UNK> day i fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie but did it really have to be so boring there are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens i can forgive the <UNK> of gore and outrageous bloodshed but this movie doesn't even <UNK> from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists with the notable exception of the finale i must admit also i would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on <UNK> <UNK> the naughty children he doesn't and exclusively kills <UNK> adults how are you supposed to take wannabe controversial and original christmas thriller serious when santa doesn't even commit one miserable child murder that would have made christmas evil a classic whereas now it's just a forgettable and <UNK> piece of junk
<START> another fantastic film from a country where due to decades of <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> has no problems in creating passionate subject matter <UNK> takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing non professional cast while still getting across his message of what he sees as being <UNK> wrong with his country he does so without the need of a heavy storyline it is a positive take on a country in particular its people that the iranian population desperately need the greatest pity is it won't be released <UNK> the <UNK> paranoid iranian government <UNK> that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them after growing up amid revolution and watching the <UNK> artists and educated <UNK> over the last 25 years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there the realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup <UNK> really <UNK> you to the event the fact he shot it on <UNK> is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format it looks fantastic his <UNK> in only using non professional actors also really works in this film fine performances all round after watching many films showing the problems iran has and also the news media <UNK> the facts we can tend to <UNK> the people as well as the government this film does the opposite it shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of <UNK> law that maybe a change for the better isn't too far away some call <UNK> a feminist film maker but i think he just fights for the most <UNK> <UNK> in iran young independent women
<START> i am a kind person so i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 it was without a doubt the worst movie that i've seen in a long time there was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas that were touched upon i e what jesus may really have wanted us to know were <UNK> over and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted upon our heroine arquette total <UNK> in the first 15 minutes would have been more <UNK> to both her character and the audience the acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired and if i saw one more <UNK> of water or <UNK> flying toward the camera i may have started screaming <UNK> than patricia
<START> red <UNK> was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease br br his shows certainly brought a laughter to the american <UNK> of years back br br he would begin the show with an opening monologue afterwards we would have a variety of characters remember <UNK> and <UNK> in the monologue how can we ever forget san <UNK> red i remember one episode where as a king red introduced his queen by referring to her as your <UNK> br br go know that red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life he lost a son to <UNK> at age 11 or so his wife georgia died by suicide
<START> i <UNK> read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago and said to myself seems funny plus it has michael clarke <UNK> how can i lose i <UNK> to pay 15 99 plus tax for it i took it over to a friends house and we both stood <UNK> at how poorly it was written and acted wooden performances abound all the hilarious and outstanding performances promised never seemed to arrive after 90 minutes i hung my head in shame knowing that i could never get that 90 minutes or 15 99 back i literally almost cried as well because if that was what could be considered comedy i didn't want to believe in movies anymore my friend and i constantly informed a friend of <UNK> of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone this was my next horrible mistake because as i watched i just became angry i began to yell at the movie and i'm not one to talk to movies period everyone i know that has even <UNK> this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often <UNK> my friends but that could not save this movie even the fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on imdb is astounding the fact that its rating at the time of this writing is 3 6 is a crime against humanity
<START> <UNK> speaking fay grim is a highly entertaining thriller featuring two of the most <UNK> enjoyable names in american movies <UNK> beautiful and <UNK> <UNK> parker posey and endlessly charismatic and <UNK> hilarious jeff goldblum they have many scenes in the first half of the film in which we see these two <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> off of each other even <UNK> with charm when goldblum rolls off hartley's shamelessly epic info <UNK> nevertheless if one were to <UNK> fay grim one would see many instances in which countless scenes could've been <UNK> for much more benefit than they have resulted in being br br this sort of filmed in joke is the sequel to hal hartley's henry fool which was made ten years earlier it has title character posey forced by cia agent goldblum to track down the <UNK> that were the precious <UNK> of her missing fugitive husband the <UNK> titular anti hero available within them is information that could <UNK> the safety of the united states fay first makes for paris to get a hold of them but becomes <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> celebration of espionage clichés featuring everything from car bombs to ambiguous <UNK> to following the girl to double crosses to triple crosses br br the primary appeal of it all for me is that it's such a novel approach to the sequel of a movie about a <UNK> and a struggling novelist in a small town in the original henry fool posey played a simple woman leading a very simple life hartley's talents do not reach the heights of many of the other independent <UNK> from the 1990s but i do admire his wild creativity in making an <UNK> <UNK> sister out of her giving her a terrific <UNK> as he did to her character's brother played by james <UNK> in henry fool as she is trapped between whether or not she may still love her overwhelming <UNK> husband and the <UNK> but <UNK> plans of goldblum br br hartley however is simply riding on that <UNK> idea his plot though complex and <UNK> true to the form of the spy film it seems as if to be entirely <UNK> the reason i was not bored was mostly due to the pace at which the story unfolds not to mention the presence of posey and goldblum the problem with the remainder of hartley's cast is that i cannot seem to become fond of the rest of them it has nothing to do with how obscure they are compared to the relative star power of the two said charm masters but with how they don't seem to hold their own alongside them though <UNK> <UNK> certainly comes close most of the scenes not involving posey or goldblum are far too light on their feet <UNK> us along with info <UNK> we have no choice but to listen to or else be totally lost in the ensuing sequence of scenes they are shot almost entirely in <UNK> angles as if hartley is <UNK> for that <UNK> feeling of a lack of material br br liam <UNK> however playing the now teenage son of fay and henry has a certain <UNK> about him seeming wise beyond his years certainly much <UNK> than any of the adult characters perhaps hartley intended that or maybe it's simply <UNK> presence the problem with a hartley film is that you never quite know what was intended and what just happens to be there as scorsese said cinema is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out one has to be able to trust that what we see is a conscious decision by the filmmaker to remain in the finished film
<START> i thought the film was good in parts the start was exciting the first 30 minutes of the film were good the camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and i did not like it <UNK> the were they not covering the actors entirely br br i think the last 25 minutes of the film were really not that great from which we expect a lot in case of such films br br the <UNK> did not make sense and i don't think they were very witty br br i felt as if they were trying to copy films like <UNK> in terms of dialogues but failed miserably it seemed as if they many of the scenes between the actors were put for sake of it and did not make any sense to the story br br the entire film features only law and caine br br i don't think it was a waste of time its an ok film but not <UNK>
<START> personally i think this show looks pretty cheaply made some of the actors are terrible they over do it seem fake i can always tell how it's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so <UNK> clear it's not very well written either i love to watch it to laugh at it you know the saying it's so bad that it's good well that saying applies to this show i also like to watch just to see if i'm right when i guess how it's all going to end so far i've been right every time it's like a little game that i play it's nice when you are bored you feel like laughing at something
<START> i hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is lucky that bad film making isn't a capital crime or he'd be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster i'm amazed that this film had a <UNK> budget but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop that <UNK> will hopefully never get to make another movie the rest of the life and therefore not waste any more of <UNK> time i would think the actors would have gotten together and <UNK> him by now br br with the effects resources available to them a great film could have been made with this budget as usual the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story transformers was another visual feast with a weak script but this makes it look like citizen kane
<START> i passed this one on the shelf a few times looking at the <UNK> of huge positive quotes with tiny names on the front and wondering if i was missing something the other night it was on one of the movie channels and i tuned in i missed nothing br br i must admit that i only watched the first 30 minutes perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that given the slow plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 i seriously doubt it br br the lead character starts the movie in classic i don't know how to start my movie style with a long tiresome monologue about how he doesn't want to get <UNK> it's not funny it's not even remotely funny others have commented on the san <UNK> bit ok a small chuckle the first time he says it then he <UNK> it into the ground smiling at the camera like it's the funniest thing ever written get over yourself in fact i think the talking to the camera bit was the reason i instantly disliked the film don't assume <UNK> with your audience <UNK> is earned much like respect br br from there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very <UNK> way about his dull life as a <UNK> i didn't realize he's jewish it's a <UNK> to jewish comedians to call this jewish humor it's just unfunny humor just because you're jewish doesn't mean you have a knack for the comedy a <UNK> <UNK> gray does a better job of self <UNK> humor than this guy so obviously it's not about <UNK> br br if one of the bits i had seen had worked i might have stuck around but some <UNK> going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with then listing them for five long minutes doesn't make a great movie br br this is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of office space don't let yourself become a victim of target marketing just say no to <UNK> tunnel
<START> the <UNK> says it all this is one really bad movie which is sad because i normally like <UNK> and i have been impressed with <UNK> roth in other roles this however is terrible i wont waste any more time its just that bad
<START> the 1967 in cold blood was perhaps more like the real thing think about it would we really want to see the real thing but it was black and white in a color world and a lot of people didn't even know what it was and there was an opportunity to remake it for television plus if you remake it you can show some stuff not shown in the original the book in cold blood by truman capote was the first <UNK> novel <UNK> book was in fact not 100 true to the real story i thought the canadian location <UNK> for kansas pretty much for a tv movie look for the elements of sex drugs and rock <UNK> roll <UNK> <UNK> perry being an <UNK> <UNK> perry playing blues guitar
<START> i am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film thought visually stunning like all of ang lee's work each still frame seems worthy of a print i was really disappointed by the film's disjointed pace it really was too long br br the story is set in civil war era <UNK> and is about a young man <UNK> who joins the <UNK> forces of the <UNK> sort of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who conduct <UNK> type fighting with the <UNK> their union counterparts he and his close friend jack bull <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> join the group after <UNK> father is shot point blank and his home is burned presumably by <UNK> the story follows <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war including former slave who fights for the <UNK> daniel holt played by <UNK> wright and a war widow played by jewel br br it seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped for example the <UNK> among <UNK> group caused by former slave holt <UNK> in the <UNK> cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding <UNK> and <UNK> and then dropped until later in the movie a young <UNK> bully <UNK> hates <UNK> and directs much angst and violence against him but we never know why some of the characters never seem to surface i think that is because the movie <UNK> too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history br br the historical detail was excellent i loved looking at the <UNK> furniture clothes etc and i thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of <UNK> the characters though they stumbled a bit with the dialog unless you really enjoy history or are a huge ang lee fan though take a pass on this one
<START> story of a wrongly executed prisoner who <UNK> the prison he was <UNK> in and kills random prisoners while waiting to take revenge on the man who framed him br br viggo <UNK> is great and the acting is pretty good overall lane smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty warden also this film has some great gore including death by <UNK> wire <UNK>
<START> i have recently watched this movie twice and i can't seem to understand why the h ll the makers made this pile of crap i mean yes it gives a great impression of hitler's environment and i mean the way they <UNK> <UNK> in the late <UNK> wwi and the inter war period what i can't understand is why they <UNK> hitler as a 100 pure evil mad <UNK> mentally unstable freak he was after all a very thoughtful loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides no doubt about that but why in <UNK> name portray him in this way all of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario leaving nothing but a very propaganda like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever yes he threw germany into the devastating 2nd world war yes he was racist and yes he was at times <UNK> unstable especially at the end of the war all true but again why the hell did they plain lie to the public to warn us br br i absolutely don't think this movie was a warning the true danger of hitler and the <UNK> was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness the fact this evil was so recognizable yet so <UNK> by almost every german alive not to mention <UNK> and a lot of other people makes it a warning to modern civilization not the fact hitler was such a <UNK> if it would have been like the makers make us believe i would have been convinced that the german people were retarded a man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader not to mention <UNK> br br 4 10
<START> i tried <UNK> the movie twice i put it in three machines to see what was wrong did steven <UNK> voice change did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who doesn't even resemble him or was the sound on the dvd destroyed after about 10 minutes you finally hear the actor's real voice though throughout most of the film it sounds like the audio was recorded in a bathroom br br i would be ashamed to <UNK> a copy of this movie to <UNK> if i owned a copy i rented it but i will never do that again i will check this <UNK> before renting any more of his movies all of which were more or less good movies you usually knew what you were getting when you watched a steven seagal movie i guess that is no more
<START> i finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through and i must say i was very impressed michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses it's not only the fact that she can act but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem i've read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand but i certainly disagree diana is a feminist she follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks with the exception of her caring brother tiny and her <UNK> and manager hector who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent which is what the word <UNK> is all about it's good to see films like this <UNK> the true side of <UNK> that they're not a bunch of <UNK> losers but that they have dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love and she and adrian have a more realistic complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out <UNK> is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into my perception of people thanks michelle br br 8 10 a very important movie that's <UNK> to not just young women but everyone wanting to go far in their lives
<START> this is one of those so bad it is good films that you always hear about but never see unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy and i am not amused this one is 100 pure serious br br however with features such as a supposedly super lethal killer robot that <UNK> about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining br br <UNK> enough because of that
<START> a couple of years back i had purchased and enjoyed the mgm double feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies the night stalker 1971 and the night <UNK> 1972 when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out i had intended to buy it immediately â but rumors of <UNK> issues with the <UNK> dvd <UNK> kept me from adding it to my collection recently i placed an online order which consisted of a <UNK> of <UNK> universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak 3 <UNK> as well br br having watched it now i can safely say that i <UNK> regret <UNK> this beloved if short lived crime horror series one bit it may follow a <UNK> formula â <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> carl kolchak <UNK> played by darren <UNK> gets into <UNK> hair with his attitude <UNK> editor simon <UNK> long suffering colleagues <UNK> <UNK> figures a <UNK> of monsters and villains faces up to the inevitable and usually supernatural threat alone but finally is <UNK> into keeping his story under <UNK> â but a winning one further <UNK> by an impressive line up of guest stars and notable behind the scenes credits making the show a great deal of fun br br that said quality <UNK> from one episode to another and the modest budgets <UNK> them results in special and make up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired for instance the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment â not to mention the fact that these were <UNK> to 50 minute <UNK> and intended for family <UNK> to boot rather <UNK> a <UNK> and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and <UNK> themes in the case of the werewolf again <UNK> never seen biting anyone but somewhat <UNK> is made to merely throw people around br br while the <UNK> cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the <UNK> plots <UNK> a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode often but not exclusively revolving around <UNK> relationship with either <UNK> or geeky reporter jack <UNK> â to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere the setting for the most part is chicago and suspense to make the ride even more pleasant <UNK> a <UNK> score by <UNK> <UNK> and jerry <UNK> br br for the record the monsters encountered but not always defeated by kolchak throughout the series are a <UNK> jack the <UNK> a variety of <UNK> voodoo native american aztec aliens vampire werewolf going round its over familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise liner <UNK> <UNK> swamp creature mass of electricity robot <UNK> witch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> armor taking a murderous life of its own the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast â featuring john <UNK> as a <UNK> police captain hans <UNK> and robert <UNK> helen of <UNK> and crocodile some of the actors other than those playing <UNK> co workers return in the same roles â <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> both as officers of the law john <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> attendant and richard <UNK> as two distinct <UNK> of the hero if i were pressed to choose the finest or most entertaining episodes <UNK> lean towards horror in the heights co starring phil <UNK> and abraham <UNK> and the <UNK> mentioned the <UNK> murders â while as the weakest <UNK> go for the werewolf due to reasons <UNK> already explained and <UNK> based on a story <UNK> by robert <UNK> and bob <UNK> br br unfortunately the set contains no extras it would have been nice to see a <UNK> discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak the night stalker as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing or even <UNK> the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci fi series popular today in fact kolchak himself â in a much younger and ostensibly darker <UNK> â returned in a 2005 revival this version is available at my local dvd rental <UNK> for various reasons <UNK> not sure <UNK> want to check it out so soon after the 1974 5 classic
<START> i enjoyed this film but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy it was amusing at times but really it wasn't very funny at all if i'd been expecting it to be a comedy i might have been disappointed with the film but going in with no expectations i found it to be enjoyable and engaging maybe it was because as an engineer i identified with the protagonist i was less concerned with satire of capital or labor and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention a man who's less interested in <UNK> gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to <UNK> and be put into production he's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for <UNK> his invention so i find it interesting that people here have compared it to jurassic park me i compare it to the <UNK>
<START> drew barrymore was excellent in this film this role is the type of role you don't normally see drew play her typical role is as a woman looking for love the storyline is also great br br when holly is <UNK> in her mother's murder she moves to l a she moves in with a guy who becomes her lover but her brother who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder is almost killed she is <UNK> accused it is then revealed to her lover that she has multiple personality disorder after that another woman becomes paranoid when she's around her in the end though they find out the truth
<START> one of the best ensemble acted films i've ever seen there isn't much to the plot but the acting incredible you see the characters change ever so subtly <UNK> the influence of the rented villa in italy and love and happiness the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you much as the villa does on all the women truly enchanted
<START> this is the <UNK> <UNK> from the swedish king of crap <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seldom has a movie of this <UNK> been made in sweden and it truly stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in swedish film to date who pays for these things br br the russian nuclear scientist <UNK> wants to <UNK> to sweden but his plans are ruined by the russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in sweden this <UNK> is their way of seeing to that <UNK> continues his work in nuclear physics that will <UNK> the energy supply for the whole planet the cia however is bent on getting <UNK> to the west and send their ninja to <UNK> him br br the practice of having swedish actors speaking english is something that <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> in his later works the cheap b movie feeling this creates is probably <UNK> for performance but besides this well the action is standard direct to video style machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke thousands of russians dying people running around in black ninja suits trying to hide in the snow br br what really stands out though is the insanely poor way the fighting scenes are choreographed when they say ninja in the title i expect martial arts i expect close combat but there are maybe two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this movie and they are hilarious it's so bad i lack the words to describe it if the ninjas moved any slower their hearts would stop and of course the whole movie ends in a bang that <UNK> a special effects budget <UNK> of four food <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> br br so what's the verdict instant classic of course never before has a movie been made that is so obviously meant to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol it's the ultimate party movie insert into video and laugh one just has to realize that movies like these are not made any more this is film history br br therefore the rating is 8 10 for entertainment 1 10 for quality and 10 10 for accents
<START> rented a <UNK> of films from blockbuster last night and this was the first one i watched it was late on a saturday night wanted a horror film fix br br wow this was awful almost embarrassingly so stupid slasher type story i really thought films like scream had put an end to amateur actors delivering <UNK> and insipid dialogue that is hard to believe was actually <UNK> and read off a page and gore scenes that are nothing to get excited about especially when occurring in a film this poorly scripted br br but i've always believed no film is 100 percent totally worthless here's the few good things i can say about this mess br br 1 <UNK> phillips love this actress she's the only member of the cast who displays any acting talent whatsoever the only reason i took a chance on renting this is because her name was on the front cover she <UNK> her presence in this dreck with <UNK> even though she looks <UNK> at times that she's acting in such a moronic story br br 2 unintentional hilarity this is the kind of film i can remember seeing back when there were still <UNK> house theaters around the country and they used to include crap like this as the third movie on a triple bill with some <UNK> thriller movie that was finally making it's way to the <UNK> unfortunately in this direct to video age most viewers have to endure these <UNK> alone now without the <UNK> experience of being part of an audience <UNK> and throwing stuff at the screen because the film is so terrible which leads to br br 3 porn stars trying to act mostly on hand because the producers don't need to <UNK> or <UNK> with them to <UNK> for extended sex scenes but this trade off usually means they actually get to speak some lines that are supposed to advance a story other than <UNK> yeah baby or harder and proudly they all deliver expertly at looking foolish when trying to act i'd almost <UNK> ginger <UNK> allen from this group if her character wasn't supposed to be an irish mom and she's actually attempting at times to do an accent which just keeps the smiles coming br br it's nice to look for the positive in all experiences and that's what i took from this <UNK> a k a evil breed
<START> this comedy has some <UNK> funny stuff in it surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time and the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this or they were simply making it all up as they went along 1 2
<START> i was drawn to this movie curious to see how they have adapted <UNK> <UNK> brutal novel i thought that a literary piece of such depth with a rich <UNK> of characters horrid situations and social critique could not translate into a bad movie i was wrong br br this flick is a terrible movie experience not for its content but for its form director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in my sincere opinion a terrible directorial job that does no justice to the original book no wonder <UNK> is a tv director this movie looks and feels like a bad made for tv flick some of my views on this bomb spoilers ahead br br lack of directorial creativity the scenes are slow feel slow look poorly shot and barely ever move from an <UNK> position the only liberty they take is in the cinematography area with a nice dark tone other than that the movie has the same technical creativity as a tv soap opera br br all the actors do a terrific job at portraying these miserable characters the problem is that the adaptation does not tackle a basic element in the development of the plot motivation all these characters move around like robots without a clear motivation for their action they seem to do things out of the blue like robots for no reason at all <UNK> misses every opportunity to <UNK> character development by not exploring the character's motivations and by avoiding developing each character's personality to its full extent br br this lack of character development is blatant on <UNK> jennifer jason <UNK> does a great job playing this trashy prostitute but her alcohol induced decision to let the sailors <UNK> her is not explained it looks extremely stupid as we see this character doing this out of the blue this is a clear example of poor character development br br the movie also has many secondary token characters that do nothing feel nothing and add nothing to the plot i would have liked to learn more about harry's wife for instance and the interaction between the two that's another missed opportunity br br <UNK> only approaches character development with harry and his <UNK> with his gay lover only to screw it up at the end not clearly explaining again his motivations the thugs are also a joke in their lack of development br br the soundtrack is one of the worst i've ever experienced terrible job by mark <UNK> i seriously expected more from the former leader of dire <UNK> but his job in this movie is seriously lacking at times like in the battle between the union workers and the police the music seems totally <UNK> from the movie it also feels completely poor and <UNK> i could swear the whole soundtrack was made with a <UNK> toy keyboard it <UNK> from the actual action br br the book adaptation by <UNK> <UNK> is so literal that <UNK> the point of the story it feels as if they tried so hard to keep the action by action storyline in the book that they forgot to actually develop the characters and once again explain their actions and motivations br br i seriously can not recommend this movie not even to a <UNK> fan because it can ruin the original book it's a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel and shows very little creative <UNK>
<START> as a <UNK> fan i recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted as an 11 year old living in <UNK> i heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream i thought <UNK> if girls like them they must be crap my only records until then were <UNK> mills the <UNK> brothers ricky nelson soon after while on vacation with the family at a military <UNK> in <UNK> i heard a song which i later learned was <UNK> me <UNK> and was <UNK> by the difference between it and every song i had ever heard until then when i heard the <UNK> the <UNK> album of my older brother i was hooked for life having read the definitive book of their <UNK> by davis i was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use it did touch on the use of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> first of all i love good <UNK> and am not afraid to get in touch with art but this zero budget flick is none of it the picture quality is so damned low the soundtrack the most annoying one i ever heard and as for the fx well the super low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie what this junk here isn't no concept a <UNK> thin storyline primitive acting and rare dialog i think i counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie each one repeated about 20 times same for a lot of film sequences may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made the story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother got psychological damaged and as an adult goes <UNK> performing a show of self <UNK> so far so good but for these pseudo art idiot directors this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense <UNK> taken out <UNK> are thrown on a naked bound woman in an earth hole why and why is that the only time you see both woman and <UNK> in the whole bloody movie disturbing yes sick yes necessary no artistically no everyone <UNK> this cheap gore show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch pink <UNK> the wall to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an <UNK> way i hope this was your first and last movie andrew <UNK> and all you gore heads out there remember not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically art
<START> and i absolutely adore isabelle <UNK> she was so cute in this movie and far different from her role in <UNK> <UNK> where she was more like a man eater i think she should have been nominated for a <UNK> i mean <UNK> <UNK> was good but isabelle was far superior imo <UNK> has done fine work for his first time out and i noticed he <UNK> in a couple of his buddies from rock et <UNK> <UNK> guy a <UNK> andre <UNK> it was fun to see them in this i didn't know they were going to appear br br i don't think i've seen a romantic comedy from <UNK> that i didn't like and this one is as good as any i've had the pleasure to see and if you're in the states and wondering how you can get a copy of the dvd www <UNK> <UNK> delivered it to me in less than a week
<START> this movie was absolutely terrible i can't believe i paid to see it in the theatre i wouldn't watch it on free cable t v i'm surprised that joe <UNK> even made it do not waste your time with this movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film written by <UNK> <UNK> and directed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a chinese ghost story has it all <UNK> <UNK> sin played by leslie cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for <UNK> deep in the woods a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near the trek alone is <UNK> with wolves and a crazy <UNK> monk lives at the temple br br <UNK> <UNK> sin meets <UNK> a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple she is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress but when she meets innocent <UNK> <UNK> sin they fall in love br br <UNK> <UNK> sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place while <UNK> tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods there's great martial arts even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual <UNK> sword forms the movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films <UNK> with magic and flying through the air <UNK> from tree to tree with elegant long <UNK> and <UNK> but the movie genuinely flows and everything is effective br br <UNK> is to be married to a evil tree monster which cant be good and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice br br in the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue and go with <UNK> deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls and bring <UNK> <UNK> back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation br br a beautiful story that truly pays attention to details one is touched in many ways by this movie you'll laugh cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography and though at the end <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting <UNK> we never know if <UNK> was <UNK> a reincarnation but we do know her
<START> my older sister was born in march of 1985 and has cerebral <UNK> in her 22 years of life she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled and i still think to this day that nobody is or ever will give a damn about her and her condition then i saw this film br br i knew what <UNK> family was going through but they were lucky christy could talk he could communicate and he had artistic skills my sister can walk but she can't utter a word and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister and the ending to tell the truth made me cry and i've seen <UNK> this film is seriously underrated and it shouldn't this movie tells people something that people should be proud of their own lives thinking you can't write well this guy wrote with his foot thinking you're not attractive this guy got turned down by lots of girls because of his condition not the <UNK> runner christy couldn't even stand up br br my point parents of young children i suggest your children watch this movie with you so they'll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair they don't stare at them like they're aliens my sister got millions of stares and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people this film will teach people that people who might not seem normal are people too 10 10
<START> back again in scotland <UNK> is again on trial for her life because the faithful dog sleeps on her <UNK> grave she must be put to death according to law oddly it is also explained that <UNK> had no legal owner which is apparently also against an old scottish law if after three days no owner is located dogs must be destroyed edmund <UNK> as john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> case which leads to an extended flashback showing <UNK> <UNK> by donald crisp as john jock gray br br although it's based on an interesting original story <UNK> bobby challenge to <UNK> <UNK> several earlier <UNK> situations and it does not improve upon them <UNK> speaking this one is sloppy and <UNK> and it's a disappointing follow up to the sun comes up 1949 <UNK> brooks as susan brown and several of the other performers may be charming but can't elevate this one little jimmy <UNK> from it's a wonderful life is among the notable children supporting <UNK> much later he will grow up to marry dark shadows ' <UNK> <UNK> lara parker
<START> the one and only was a great film i had just finished viewing it on <UNK> on <UNK> i am an independent professional wrestler and i thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler now this film was made 4 years before i was born but i don't think the <UNK> of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much sad funny and all around great 10
<START> well i wasn't sure what the film was going to be like as i had only seen a little clip but i was thinking its going to be good and i was right i watched it twice on the day i got it and well it is my favourite film br br i think alison <UNK> played the part of beth really well she is such a <UNK> actress and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about <UNK> although the ending when beth is in the hospital an has 2 <UNK> observation after <UNK> because iv been told like 1 house is ok and also that <UNK> doesn't help <UNK> as iv been told which is probably why i'm still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me <UNK> as i to have <UNK> but this is a <UNK> film i recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for people who know some one with eating <UNK> as it can let them in to the lives of a <UNK> person and see the world how they do a bit over all a <UNK> film and i recommend it to any one and any type of person
<START> hi everyone if you saw singing in the rain you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain you also remember the dance number of donald <UNK> make 'em laugh if you saw royal wedding you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling if you saw <UNK> rock you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself br br that is what is missing here there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation the closest was chuck <UNK> i can do that the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film richard attenborough was to blame for this failure he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing br br yelling at people <UNK> for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at it does not work here br br the cast was good except for michael of course a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production but someone should have thought about how to film it br br next time they do one of these i hope they call me first br br tom <UNK>
<START> i first saw this film when it aired on the now <UNK> trio channel a few years ago and recently watched it again sans commercials on sundance i was impressed the first time and found it even more engaging on second viewing yes some of the segments are far from perfect <UNK> <UNK> hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumb but taken <UNK> 11 <UNK> <UNK> is a total success best of show <UNK> <UNK> amazing final segment which contemporary critics such as the thick witted mick <UNK> somehow <UNK> as an attack on 'the <UNK> but now stands revealed as a masterful anti war <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 9 11 with a <UNK> concern for the children of afghanistan and <UNK> <UNK> amusing children's <UNK> for <UNK> bin laden a hunt almost as serious and successful an <UNK> as the one for the real <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that bin laden and <UNK> are basically creations of american foreign policy and the cia and though sean <UNK> character study seems out of place it's still an effectively bittersweet piece of film making all in all essential viewing and a darn sight better than oliver <UNK> <UNK> world trade center
<START> ah noir my favourite genre otto <UNK> follow up to laura is a film noir set in a <UNK> new york where corruption and violence run rampant it stars dana andrews as sergeant mark dixon a detective whose brutal tactics have landed him in hot water with his superiors br br when he accidentally kills a murder suspect dixon tries to pin the blame on crime boss tommy <UNK> dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead man's wife the beautiful morgan taylor of course in typical noir fashion things quickly go down hill br br while the film does nothing interesting camera or narrative wise it does have a constant tone of dread and <UNK> like most great <UNK> it is also wonderfully paced sucking the viewer in right from the start br br still like most of <UNK> <UNK> films it's not something i'd watch again it lacks the verbal wit of wilder the visual <UNK> of hitchcock or the <UNK> <UNK> of welles like <UNK> later work sidewalk feels very much a clone of what a noir should be instead of something really artistically genuine br br <UNK> the film is nothing special it's about a cop who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal in one scene dixon explains that his father himself was a small time crook the film <UNK> with the notion of <UNK> but this one scene is as far as otto goes or <UNK> to take his ideas br br the camera work is likewise disappointing there's no intelligence in <UNK> camera no effort is made to <UNK> the camera to anything it doesn't play with space or architecture or <UNK> the step by step police <UNK> it's just <UNK> set ups with the occasional <UNK> in and out meaningless though most people don't care about these things br br there is however one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters noir cage which itself enters a vehicle lift another cage and is taken up into the chief <UNK> <UNK> like lynch's blue <UNK> otto <UNK> the film constantly <UNK> upstairs to hell this works well but the set design fails to <UNK> it br br 7 10 otto seems content to follow the <UNK> <UNK> of what a noir is rather than toy with the possibilities of where noir can go like <UNK> night in the city scarlet street in a lonely place act of violence <UNK> and johnny eager where the sidewalk ends is one of those well made second <UNK> film <UNK> it's competent and engaging but lacks that extra special magic
<START> the oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep engaging <UNK> ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn best picture in the big show among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well acclaimed play the original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation which comes as a double edged sword on one hand who better to translate the play than the original writer on the other hand who better to not see the mistakes and <UNK> of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense with a frustrating ending unnecessary dialogue questionable directing and of course the inability to provide substantial answers it is a growing trend among these high caliber films to not answer all questions it provides and this has to stop br br doubt is like a joke without its punch line like a book with the final 20 pages missing like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a <UNK> <UNK> football game and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the <UNK> game and see what happens next doubt just like the previous best picture <UNK> no country for old men doesn't really end it doesn't provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending yes that was the intent but this isn't a test of humanity it's a cop out i do not pay money to see an unfinished work i pay money to see a beginning middle and end and pray that i don't fall asleep during the three acts we are forced to become the writers of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other br br this little drama is about a nun meryl streep who seems very sure that the well beloved priest philip seymour hoffman is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church the first african american boy in the catholic church the church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing <UNK> sins behind everyone's backs the plot <UNK> as some of the kids begin behaving differently which <UNK> the notice of a young teacher amy adams the story is set right after the assassination of john f kennedy which <UNK> the nation for quite some time and <UNK> their faith in humanity and in each other br br <UNK> strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever engaging suspense that builds slowly and never <UNK> over streep seems to be oscar worthy in every role she's in and here she is no different as her <UNK> and cold hearted behavior places a <UNK> of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church hoffman excels yet again as the priest by successfully <UNK> suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura the seemingly <UNK> personality is tough to pull off especially when we are suppose to like him and also <UNK> about him at the same time but hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers when these two argue you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched but let's not forget amy adams enchanted and <UNK> davis law ad order for their superb job either <UNK> casting ensemble is among the best in 2008 br br yet like previously stated it's the writing and directing that ruins this film especially when <UNK> down the third act questions pop up but they aren't answered characters pop up but provide no real <UNK> towards the plot kids behave different but we never truly find out why there are awkward angles in the camera <UNK> no actual reason why john patrick <UNK> the writer of the play had one previous film in his directing <UNK> joe versus the <UNK> whether sheer arrogance or stupidity we are stuck with seeing <UNK> sequences of random conversation utter annoying <UNK> that <UNK> to no end there was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted thanks to mr <UNK> br br bottom line the lack of an ending is a stupid trend that's just as irritating as the <UNK> camera work in action films it doesn't matter that we have a great talented acting cast or decent cinematography or a good story being worked upon or good usage of sound and music because we have a <UNK> of unanswered questions that <UNK> all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet doesn't even finish the translation from play to film is good and quite accurate because we have the original <UNK> behind the <UNK> he took the mistakes and stupid <UNK> from the play to the film as well this decade has seen its share of blockbuster and high profile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end <UNK> cast away no country for old men burn after reading are a few examples br br <UNK> end your <UNK> movie please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank like wall <UNK> depressing <UNK> instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of <UNK> confusion and mental anguish have a beginning middle and the end please as a critic i prefer my films to be whole not <UNK> doubt feels <UNK> which is why it gets an incompetent grade br br someone has to break this stupid trend
<START> the 1983 bbc production of jane eyre starring zelah clarke and timothy dalton love him has always been and will always be my favorite jane eyre if you watch any other version of jane eyre without reading the book it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day but watching this one almost equals to reading the book i used to watch these miniseries a lot when i was little and they inspired me to read the book at the time i didn't pay attention to how close this television production was to the book recently i watched the 1996 version of jane eyre and was very disappointed it was only 2 hours long and didn't have many important scenes from the book such as my favorite gypsy scene after that i fell in love with this jane eyre even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story the other versions don't if you haven't read the book br br the cast of 1983 jane eyre is excellent it's true that timothy dalton is a very handsome actor handsome enough to play butler in scarlet and <UNK> <UNK> but he is so great as rochester that i can't imagine anybody else playing this role and zelah clarke is without a doubt the only jane that follows the description of the book the other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors jane looks so modest and naive just as <UNK> describes her although she doesn't look 18 but do you actually pay attention to that br br some people say that this jane eyre is too long but i would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching some other version some say the movie is dull and boring because jane is not passionate enough or because there are not enough kissing scenes i hate when they make jane eyre some hollywood movie with inappropriate kissing scenes you don't have to include crazy <UNK> in love scenes to show the love between jane and rochester and both zelah and timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no other scenes needed i am 19 years old and many girls of my age refer to this film as boring and old fashioned but i can only feel sorry for them because they don't appreciate the <UNK> and beauty of it after all the novel is set in 19th century and that old fashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book br br i don't think there will ever be any other version of jane <UNK> that will have the popularity and love of this one no matter who plays jane and rochester in other movies the real jane and rochester for me at least will always be zelah clarke and timothy dalton
<START> this is an in name only sequel to a christmas story originally entitled a summer story <UNK> <UNK> his family adventures during the summer when they moved to a small <UNK> town in the middle of nowhere hilarity unfortunately does not ensue br br the original worked because of its <UNK> nature and honesty everyone could relate to it this one is simply stupid and not very funny at all charles <UNK> last movie no wonder it's one of his <UNK> roles i felt sorry for him br br mary <UNK> is given little to do <UNK> formulaic and you have to wonder why they even bothered br br and i mean come on a competition with spinning tops sadly it's the best part of the movie
<START> i collect horror films from all over and i have seen the good and the very bad zombie bloodbath is a low budget video sure the acting is bad the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots the thing you seem to be missing is that it's still entertaining and really very fun the effects range from like someone on here has said <UNK> faced zombies that look like kiss rejects to really good ones with some amazing <UNK> work but the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area the effects are very good for such a small film someone called it a party movie and it is 100 fun party movie i have heard from various <UNK> that this is actually a rough cut of the film that got general release but the actual director's cut is coming on dvd and it is very nice quality i will buy it and judge for myself br br story is basically a nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies the <UNK> <UNK> it down hides the story and <UNK> houses to be built over it some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area a few actors do a great job there's some pretty straight social commentary that is insightful and true good music great lighting some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore one guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up if you know what i mean then his guts are shoved out of his mouth another is torn in half like in day of the dead and they did a great job of that effect there are a million gore gags and it's almost all action i say stop being a <UNK> enjoy life and get more movies like zombie bloodbath and meat market two great undead epics br br ok update i just got the dvd set and here is what i thought br br much better picture quality and for once i was able to see the actual director's cut of the film and it is a much better movie i liked it before but now i can see what todd sheets was actually trying to do with this one and the commentary helps too hearing sheets talk about the film in detail he knows it's a trashy zombie movie but he does show respect to all people involved also sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like <UNK> fox and mtv over all a fun little film that is very rough around the edges but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride i have seen many <UNK> films and some shot of video films and many are quite dull but this one really wasn't while newer <UNK> films are technically superior they just aren't this much fun br br ps i heard they are now <UNK> this on a big budget
<START> this foolish implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard boiled police detective delivers some nearly <UNK> lines <UNK> our greatest fears he is dead perhaps the film would have been saved had the director <UNK> the dazzling star power of a <UNK> in favor of this sadly anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment that a no name hack <UNK> off the street could salvage such a <UNK> film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a <UNK> for an unsuspecting diver his moment is brief his promise is immense perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure <UNK> if there is ever a sequel to this ill advised film
<START> it's a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in <UNK> the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be <UNK> but they were good in fighting so it was <UNK> the guy is cute too so it's a good match if you want to the guy or the girls
<START> well made and stylish while still ultimately making sense this thriller would work better for non giallo fans to get interested in the genre than the later <UNK> entries which go overboard in all directions br br for fans of these crazed italian thrillers they will appreciate george hilton and the turns his character takes and what he's put through the camera work is fresh with <UNK> of graphic violence and odd but appropriate choices and a good not overblown music score as well the less you know about the story the better to make it work br br the only thing lacking in keeping this from being a great sergio martino directed giallo is that the story doesn't have that extra sexual or psychological or both element to put it over the top it's more a routine mystery the characters are well defined but live or die according to the plot not according to their own virtues and flaws br br the recent dvd 2005 release is beautiful looking and definitely the way to see the film unless these ever get art house <UNK> which seems unlikely
<START> ride with the devil has something rich and special if you can stand the slow development while <UNK> a dark gritty subject the brutal <UNK> war in the american west during its civil war which in turned <UNK> the <UNK> of the old west of the <UNK> the movie maintains a strangely satisfying <UNK> atmosphere what i'm <UNK> to is the tendency of <UNK> music and lighting to make you feel the mood you'd expect to feel but <UNK> instead has a relatively upbeat soundtrack and lets the words and action do the talking set the mood rather than manipulation of the viewer's senses br br as an <UNK> of this particular area of <UNK> history i'm greatly impressed with the accuracy of the film the <UNK> is expertly written even with subtle humor occasionally with references to <UNK> and previous <UNK> battles independence for example a far cry from the <UNK> trail the minor events that occur to <UNK> band are similar to actual events that took place especially the attack when they're <UNK> up in the house and the destruction of the store booth the battle scenes though rare are pretty well executed it even has the first <UNK> <UNK> battle put on film recently br br the directing shows the talent everyone expects of ang lee in subtle ways example the character of black john is shown <UNK> a lawrence resident during the massacre where's your army who are we to fight who are we to fight the shot then switches to a trio of <UNK> <UNK> standing doing nothing to stop the carnage while the voice continues you are <UNK> all who are the <UNK> really little touches like that really enhance the movie's quality br br there are no major glaring areas in the history something that can not be said of the masterpiece of film glory which was basically fiction within the context of the major events it follows some minor problems include the fact that the years as shown by the events represented don't add up but you will never notice that a larger curiosity is the fact that the only african american man at arms character in the film is the quasi slave fighting for jake and his <UNK> <UNK> it is true that some blacks did fight for the <UNK> out there including one who <UNK> lawrence for <UNK> before the attack who would suspect him though this black rebel is a <UNK> character whatever pc african americans might think of him not a single black union <UNK> is seen in the film which would have been more <UNK> of the black experience in the western <UNK> one of the first black <UNK> of the <UNK> was raised in kansas by the murderer senator jim lane and before the <UNK> mass <UNK> of fame was organized and black troops in such battles as <UNK> springs <UNK> played a critical role br br no glaring historical errors good realistic action which is <UNK> and not <UNK> good directing this film may not be the blockbusters other recent civil war were but it's the <UNK> job of any
<START> this guy has no idea of cinema okay it seems he made a few <UNK> theater shows in his youth and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship this all is very good but look carefully he does not know his job the scenes are <UNK> without proper start and and with a <UNK> content and full of <UNK> he has nothing to say about the subject so he over <UNK> with violence <UNK> and <UNK> language how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art why don't they let him <UNK> in piece
<START> <UNK> ignorant ill conceived career killing where is the talented angela jones now deeply unfunny garbage it's no wonder <UNK> <UNK> hasn't directed anything else since anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules based on his own script with the help of quentin tarantino himself and creates something like this anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world doesn't deserve a second break under the circumstances the performances are good the actors do what they're told to do and they do it well it's just that they shouldn't have done it in the first place br br 0 out of 4
<START> there are so many <UNK> to play on the title of the spectacularly bad valentine that i don't know where to begin i will say this though here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the valentine cards we used to give out in <UNK> school you know the ones with batman <UNK> you're a super crime fighting valentine br br valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of scream the villain is <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the heroes are easily scared when people run around <UNK> and grab them by the shoulders screaming <UNK> the score is more overbearing than norman <UNK> mother br br the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends now grown up and extremely <UNK> since the film gives them nothing else to do they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one this stalker appears to be former nerd jeremy <UNK> who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school with <UNK> day approaching the women begin receiving scary cards <UNK> their doom <UNK> seems like the obvious suspect only problem is as numerous characters warns in thirteen years <UNK> could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome so insert terrified gasp here everyone is a suspect br br here's problem one in order to have any sense of suspense while watching valentine you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming david <UNK> <UNK> don't turn into angel when they grown up they turn into older <UNK> <UNK> he's not a terrible actor but the script by no less than four writers gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out denise richards the <UNK> actress in hollywood never to star in <UNK> is especially exploited most <UNK> in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene note to self always bring a bathing suit to a <UNK> day party just because it's <UNK> doesn't mean you might not feel like taking a little <UNK> br br the slasher in valentine dresses in head to toe black with a <UNK> mask here's problem number two the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who's <UNK> people in the face with hot <UNK> plain and simple it's not instead it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face including his eyes and ears can move so <UNK> without <UNK> his <UNK> on <UNK> or tables then again given the things the <UNK> killer does maybe he can <UNK> and his eyes are on his hands br br not only is the movie bad it isn't even sure who the killer is the final twist is more huh than <UNK> when you're not scratching your head you're <UNK> then <UNK> then searching for the nearest exit do not watch this movie even if you're alone on <UNK> day find something anything else to do you'll be glad you did
<START> this movie is just great it's entertaining from beginning to the end you're always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics br br sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain rescue guy <UNK> walker together with him michael <UNK> makes a great appearance as hal tucker and then john <UNK> one of the best performances i've seen of him as a villain br br and the fact that 75 of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action br br brilliant movie
<START> some critics found this film bleak but for me there was enough good humour and optimism to overcome this impression for example the quietly positive and stoic character of the daughter is the still centre of the film often <UNK> the unhappy aspects of the setting and <UNK> br br the film is full of original ideas and characters and the final outcome is not predictable i felt it could've gone either way br br by the way many reviews i've read mention the effective use of black and white but the print i saw shown on the <UNK> tv network here in australia was in full colour br br
<START> so todd sheets once stated that he considers his 1993 shot on video z epic zombie bloodbath to be his first feature film anyone who's ever seen a little beauty called zombie rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is i mean what makes this one that much more superior well then again zombie rampage doesn't include that <UNK> guy now does it br br for one to comprehend exactly why zombie bloodbath is actually considered worth a damn one must remember what the 90's were like for lovers of bad horror a decade that all but said goodbye to b and z cinema as we knew it technological advances awkward <UNK> and the internet would <UNK> the mysterious charms of the s o v 's big <UNK> golden years and anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too self aware for it's own good basically <UNK> the purpose luckily not everyone changes with the times enter zombie bloodbath br br and i guess this is the part where i explain the same exact premise from 500 other zombie flicks from the last 40 years alright so some kind of accident at a nuclear plant <UNK> everyone in sight turning them into flesh eating zombies who go on a rampage <UNK> some of the most gruesome yet humorous gore scenes of the 90's the first 20 minutes are <UNK> with the most awkward sounding conversations you could imagine conversations that let you know that this isn't just a low budget zombie flick this is a z grade <UNK> <UNK> plenty hysterical non existent acting to go around and that goes triple for mr <UNK> that guy is truly the highlight of the night br br the fact that todd sheets seriously considers zombie bloodbath to be that superior to zombie rampage <UNK> me to no end i mean really both are complete jokes on celluloid but then again so is redneck zombies so obviously todd sheets is in the company of <UNK> by 1993 a movie this bad would no doubt be a full blast spoof but mr sheets stands his ground giving us some good old fashion schlock the way it was meant to be unaware clueless and pointless god bless todd sheets for anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile 90's b horror <UNK> <UNK> darkness should be at the top of your list as for zombie bloodbath if you're a <UNK> who got bored sometime around 1990 then <UNK> would be the perfect time to pick up 8 10
<START> in any number of films you can find nicholas cage as a strong silent hero dennis hopper as a homicidal maniac lara flynn boyle as a <UNK> tramp and the late <UNK> j t walsh as the heavy these are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche what a relief therefore that john <UNK> a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action directed this nuanced <UNK> thriller hopper manages to keep from going over the top cage shows a little more depth than his usually superficial action heroes boyle is by turns <UNK> innocent and scheming and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character wayne <UNK> direction gives a sense of the <UNK> of the big sky country where the story takes place while also being intimate enough to show how a <UNK> brow can indicate a radical change of plot in store the plot twists are top notch and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains it isn't often that minor characters like deputy <UNK> have more brains than their <UNK> superiors but with a director as smart as <UNK> you shouldn't be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film an excellent movie
<START> although the casting for this film was admirable particularly <UNK> keaton and tom everett scott the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth watching br br my wife and i decided that the reason we watched the entire film was that it was like a train wreck and it was almost impossible to turn away it may have been that we hoped that the message would eventually make itself apparent and that we would be able to <UNK> some meaning from this effort unfortunately this did not happen br br of course the audience may have been able to make sense of this convoluted tale a credit to the <UNK> of the human brain to make sense of the absurd the writers however did nothing to <UNK> this <UNK> need we seem to have for finding meaning br br it was apparent that those involved were simply going through the motions of their respective <UNK> and that any <UNK> passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or non existent br br unfortunately made for tv movies have seemed to <UNK> over the years whereas <UNK> a message to the audience may to have been the primary interest of the writers in the past present day writers and producers seem condescending to their audience <UNK> primarily on <UNK> us to stay tuned through the <UNK> advertising which seems to be the only reason movies such as surrender dorothy are made
<START> when he remade broadway bill 1934 as riding high 1950 <UNK> bing crosby as dan brooks did not help a screenplay that was <UNK> in <UNK> let alone 50 this sad film has entire scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles unless they were dead though being older did not seem to matter to the director nor that the cars and clothes in the background <UNK> from 1934 did not seem match up too <UNK> standards not even <UNK> <UNK> singing can redeem this effort br br we rated both the original and the remake imdb four stars <UNK> touch was long gone and all that was left was <UNK> corn that did not stop mr <UNK> though after <UNK> around the 50's making some educational documentaries he wound up his career <UNK> lady for a day 1933 as <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> again a fine cast was let down on that imdb six star effort compared too the originals eight stars sometimes it is better to quit while you were still ahead right after state of the union 1948
<START> bad stuff this movie is real crap bad stunts for one thing they looked so fake i thought this was the twilight zone the flashbacks are pretty much useless one part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better i wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting even from the adults was horrid a kissing scene in this movie even sucked this movie killed the book the book was great i highly do not recommend this movie not even for educational purposes br br good stuff i don't know what i can say really there is some suspense parts that get you going but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting br br my verdict do not watch
<START> a decent sequel but does not pack the punch of the original a murderous screenwriter judd nelson assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel cabin by the lake still ruthless killing but movie seems very tongue in cheek any humor is not of the funny kind total project seems to have the quality of a <UNK> and at times nelson is way over the top this movie is about a script being <UNK> before going to the screen this should have happened to this script
<START> it's getting worse the series is on a serious down fall the first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a <UNK> of really really terrible movies robert englund gives another great performance as freddy but the rest of the cast can't act the story is alice having survived the previous installment of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the <UNK> murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of <UNK> unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son check out the first three miss the next three then watch the last one
<START> it's a shame that this piece of work wasn't acknowledged as a piece of work it has everything a historical film must have a serious historical research outstanding performances of every actor involved and a <UNK> but great direction br br when i saw the movie i knew it should be a prototype for every <UNK> movie
<START> this is the only movie i have ever seen that has <UNK> me to write a critique on any internet site and that is a significant statement from someone who likes the attack of the <UNK> monsters this movie is perfect for anyone who wants an <UNK> movie it is devoid of sex and violence for example i believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages this movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained challenged or <UNK> in any way adults could easily catch up on their sleep in front of the tv while the kids watch this movie don't be surprise however if you <UNK> to find the kids have turned the tv off and started a board game as an adult who enjoys being entertained who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism drama comedy and action all of those adult things that reflect real life on earth and or <UNK> the imagination this movie has nothing to offer
<START> hollywood does it again lots of money no creativity i'm sure the writers were on something other than <UNK> when they wrote this one based on the previews i thought that this would be a funny movie but if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture then you'll miss most of the silly humor in this movie why waste your time you can sit on a <UNK> doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide br br
<START> i loved <UNK> in series noir his talent is <UNK> in the <UNK> aka going places okay it's a couple of guys <UNK> convention in the most absurd and <UNK> ways many folks find such behavior amusing this was a boring pointless exercise designed to shock i find the <UNK> on <UNK> face the face behind the camera annoying series noir was a valid expression of personal liberty and <UNK> behavior from the first moment when we see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the abandoned lot we get an idea of the <UNK> beautiful anti hero we'll be spending time with for the next couple of hours when we see him chasing the hapless middle aged female with his buddy depardieu in going places we have fair warning that two hours spent with these <UNK> will be soul <UNK> i have trouble <UNK> even a 3 for this annoying distraction
<START> spoilers br br i'm sure back when this was released in 1958 it was much appropriate for its time back then films were slower paced to allow audiences to follow and analyze the story here a man moves into a house owned by his last wife that died mysteriously with his new wife the <UNK> mickey played by alex <UNK> who also directed he film really is an <UNK> character he gets a skull to <UNK> warn <UNK> that she is in trouble since he knew that there was foul play in the first wife's death he can't tell <UNK> directly what happened so he tries to scare her off with the skull <UNK> we also find out saw her parents die thus causing a lifetime of mental anguish that lead to <UNK> like many audiences today i found the pacing to be a little too slow for my tastes but if you like slow paced horror without a lot of gore this film is for you br br
<START> even though it has one of the standard revenge price plots this film is my favorite of vincent <UNK> work <UNK> has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters <UNK> when you watch it you feel for him you feel his frustration the <UNK> against him and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance even though he <UNK> you a little with his original fury as the film goes on his character becomes tragic he's committed his murder but now he must kill to cover that up and again to cover that one up and again your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood even if the revenge story is of old the plot devices themselves are original <UNK> uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways a shame this one isn't available for home <UNK>
<START> darkly comic <UNK> about a <UNK> <UNK> with odd ties to elvis <UNK> running into a sea of elvis <UNK> while speaking at conventions in <UNK> and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own kim basinger a still attractive actress of considerable merit likes to pick quirky movies to play in but this dreadful screenplay by mitchell <UNK> and adam michael <UNK> hasn't an <UNK> of good humor the stereotypes and low ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy but even on a <UNK> shameful level the picture is crude and sloppy if you do watch see if you can count how much <UNK> shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink <UNK> hands always in the same position and a non <UNK> look on her face hopefully both she and elvis were well paid no stars from
<START> it seems as if in science fiction you have this <UNK> <UNK> to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels it's where the first novel <UNK> <UNK> game blows you away with an <UNK> revolutionary story the sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make the matrix is finally the film equivalent the matrix stands tall alone as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle seeing this cash cow just sitting there and wanting to explore other aspects of society the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most painful monologues and non action sequences in scifi while the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies the new <UNK> of the characters falls terrible flat in the sequel watch for eye candy not for deep thought br br 4 out of 10 as <UNK> by this fine website
<START> a very close and sharp <UNK> of the <UNK> and dynamic emotional world of <UNK> one <UNK> old guy that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy during an vacation with a part of his family br br i liked this film because of his <UNK> clear and <UNK> storytelling with all this sound close ups and quiet moments <UNK> had been full of <UNK> <UNK> br br
<START> this one <UNK> back to the days of the <UNK> when kids with nowhere else to hang out took their dates to the balcony after <UNK> their younger siblings below it didn't matter what was on the screen the little kids would sit through it and the big kids would ignore it the adults of course would never see it br br but they put it on video anyway along with most of the other <UNK> low budget b horror flicks of the golden age of television this film's inherent and unintentional humor is derived from stale ideology the bad girls <UNK> to replace poor <UNK> crushed body they had it <UNK> <UNK> plot a mad scientist trying to play god violent yet <UNK> monster whose presence in the <UNK> normal seeming <UNK> rural lab is never fully explained and acting that <UNK> at wooden or over the top br br this is a great party film assuming your guests enjoy adding dialog and commentary to otherwise <UNK> cinematic exploits in fact should you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment this film is also available on video in its mystery science theater 3000 treatment in which the host and puppets of the cult tv series make the necessary <UNK> for you
<START> the script for this movie was probably found in a hair ball recently <UNK> up by a really old dog mostly an amateur film with lame fx for you zeta jones fanatics she has the credibility of one mr <UNK>
<START> welcome to <UNK> is a lot of things but it is none of the following br br a george clooney star vehicle unfunny un original br br and yes i know the basis for the movie is another movie but as far as hollywood goes this may rank with their most authentic <UNK> this decade and for me it does br br the movie is from start to finish an absolute gas here's why br br there isn't a bad performance in the film the funny parts are funny the edgy parts are edgy the script contains not a dull moment of dialogue the cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful and it doesn't <UNK> to the hollywood norm you'll see what i mean when you see the film br br when i was a kid i remember seeing <UNK> for the film this film went under the radar after not <UNK> much at the box office and isn't even a cult classic the reason why transformers 2 is seen as acceptable by average movie goers is because they are used to seeing transformers 2 if film's as original and funny as this were <UNK> out as often as multi million pieces of s t the cinematic experience would be a much <UNK> place br br when <UNK> say they don't make em like they used to <UNK> didn't see welcome to <UNK> br br a fun mini masterpiece of caper comedy that refuses to compromise one of my favourites
<START> well i'll be honest it is not exactly a sholay but you cant get a sholay every week in fact you could see distinct <UNK> of not without my daughter sally field 1991 in this movie however as most inspired movies go this one was a well inspired one well handled and well done <UNK> <UNK> as usual tends to <UNK> his <UNK> but all others are commendable specially so about <UNK> naval saw her after a long time but she hasn't lost any of her grace in fact she has performed much better that when i last saw her another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age br br all in all a nice watch
<START> ripoff of a dozen better films particularly steven <UNK> la story which at least had the grace to be obviously fictional even though it starred his then girlfriend playing his girlfriend in the film br br yes naive boys and girls 20 dates is a <UNK> although i am not absolutely certain that was <UNK> <UNK> intent when he started my impression is that he started the project semi seriously then quickly realized that it would be pathetic and not funny unless he made the situations more and more ridiculous as a result the whole thing has an uneasy cheap and <UNK> feeling about it br br as someone <UNK> pointed out the film has two of the dates <UNK> and putting <UNK> orders on <UNK> and yet they appear in the film which would be impossible as it would require a <UNK> form it also appears to me that the majority of women who appear as the dates are professional actresses <UNK> not famous ones <UNK> tina <UNK> they are simply too obviously pretty polished thin and comfortable in front of the camera to be average civilians br br mr <UNK> makes a classic error in only casting this kind of very pretty thin actress instead of <UNK> a variety of believable women which might have made the premise even in a <UNK> more believable and funnier he also <UNK> over what is probably his real world problem and which is that both the movie character and the real world <UNK> <UNK> appear to be <UNK> unemployed his real life imdb credits are practically non existent <UNK> this film even in the world of the movie his ex wife divorced him for never being employed i think the viewer let alone mr <UNK> real life dates are deserving of an explanation of he manages to live in one of the most expensive urban <UNK> in the us in a luxury apartment driving a fancy car and eating out at <UNK> <UNK> when he doesn't seen to have any source of <UNK> whatsoever is he drug dealer living off his rich parents no clue br br you can get away with most anything in a film if the jokes are really funny 20 dates is painfully embarrassingly un funny mr <UNK> idea of a joke is to have his character while on restaurant dates <UNK> to his companions how the food served is likely to give him either <UNK> or <UNK> the worst kind of childish <UNK> humor br br it is not very surprising to discover that mr <UNK> never made a film before 20 dates and in the last 8 years has not made a single film appeared as an actor in anyone else's film or had a writing or producing credit of any kind my gut instinct tells me that this film was not <UNK> by <UNK> the gangster money man who appears off camera but more likely by mr <UNK> <UNK> parents or perhaps represents a shocking abuse of credit cards <UNK> it was we can all rest easy that we are unlikely to have to see <UNK> <UNK> or any of his creative efforts ever again <UNK>
<START> i found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian chris rock who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid 50's white mans body he doesn't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before he <UNK> to rap music sings along and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man the real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community
<START> a true wholesome american story about teenagers who are interested in <UNK> their own rocket in a rural west virginia coal mining town after the launch of <UNK> in 1957 br br through trial <UNK> and <UNK> beyond belief they are ultimately able to achieve their goals br br jake <UNK> as the leader of the group is excellent in the title role as his <UNK> science teacher laura <UNK> is quite good but her southern accent is over the top br br there is a standout supporting performance by chris cooper a head <UNK> who wants his son to follow in his footsteps but gradually comes around at film's end br br what makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed <UNK> scenes and no profanity whatsoever it is the epitome of an american story that is well done br br besides the science angle we have the father son <UNK> football <UNK> as a way to escape coal mining and the loving spirit of family br br why aren't pictures like this recognized more at award times
<START> i couldn't believe it when i put this movie in my dvd player i thought i'd have a good laugh since i've played d d for half my life i had to turn it off as i had company and they were wondering what the crap i was watching br br finished it later and i should have just left it off at the soft core gay clown porn in the beginning no they run the gamut of fart jokes <UNK> jokes incest racism dressing up as <UNK> this movie is flat out mean to anyone who's ever played d d br br no wonder it looks like the real d d wouldn't let them use their game who'd want their name attached to this
<START> men of honor features cuba gooding jr in what is probably his best performance to date he plays carl brashear a man of <UNK> courage and <UNK> he's a poor dirt farmer from the south who wants to become a navy diver but has problems because of his race the head of the diving school played by robert deniro is a racist redneck that nonetheless grows to respect brashear the film is about how brashear has to <UNK> the nearly <UNK> odds not once but twice the performances are what make this film special gooding is great and deniro the best actor in movie history gives a <UNK> performance his best dramatic work in years <UNK> <UNK> gives another solid performance as <UNK> much younger wife the film lays on the <UNK> a little too strong though no where near the level it was in the <UNK> and a few of the characters are just one <UNK> bad hal <UNK> mr <UNK> is just so evil but the film is a <UNK> among films today it's uplifting and <UNK> a wonderful film
<START> i really think that this movie is great personally but in every movie there is a <UNK> now some of you may not have watched <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> your <UNK> but if you think about it those two shows are very very similar if you know what i mean in <UNK> new <UNK> holly wants so bad to get into <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> your <UNK> <UNK> wants to go to a <UNK> in l a don't remember the name of the <UNK> there they are both in the music field and they both have to sing at the ending of the <UNK> it's really funny how these two films are alike i personally like <UNK> new <UNK> better than <UNK> your <UNK> though
<START> i don't remember seeing another murder mystery movie as bad as this this movie about a medical <UNK> who <UNK> his friend's mysterious death in a car accident has the complete <UNK> for a bad movie bad acting boring story lack of suspense poor humor and no drama i remembered seeing this movie on <UNK> a tv station notable for <UNK> out low budgeted and campy made for tv movies such as this one tv movies of course do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the big screen but this movie sure hit all sour tastes the makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making <UNK> for murder a great tv movie the title does offer some suspense br br so if you want a good recipe don't watch this movie this movie alone can kill your tv <UNK> br br grade f
<START> no day passes without a new released computer animated movie so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects after watching ice age i felt that's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre br br but it's because i am a big guy now and i am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children maybe up to 14 the story is quite simple and the actors are funny in a cute way without any crude or complex humour even the evil is lovely <UNK> big cat with those funny teeth and the story has a happy end which was a small disappointment for me knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to <UNK> in a sad way but a great thing for children and apart from some fights nobody dies not even when he gets <UNK> on by a <UNK> several times which made a <UNK> feeling br br the computer animation part is nice but nothing special apart from some really nice <UNK> feeling scenes when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics which means lots of work nevertheless br br there were some gags which made me smile i accept the creators tried to satisfy those <UNK> but they are hard to spot and in my opinion better left <UNK> since it does not feel to fit into the story br br overall it's a nice movie but it's rather in the ideal world and <UNK> animals for children disney cliche if you don't hate cute animals making funny things watch it at least once
<START> a different look at horror the <UNK> differences between american and russian films is interesting however from my american perspective this movie just wasn't that good the protagonist marie played by <UNK> <UNK> wasn't a pleasant character and i had a hard time <UNK> with her she was <UNK> most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film then a long time passed before any real suspense built up once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else the concept was more original than most direct to video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot all in all i'd recommend it for renting but not for theater goers
<START> the house of the spirits is quite awful i live in south america in a country that suffered a military <UNK> just like the one the movie tries to describe and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid things are not so simple and linear as appears here and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in the house if you can't show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all there are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema without so many <UNK> in some parts i felt that carmen miranda may appear within <UNK> and palm trees when you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but <UNK> to your <UNK> intelligence
<START> ok here is my personal list of top <UNK> shows as in today br br 1 all grown up <UNK> <UNK> br br 2 my life as a teenage robot br br 3 <UNK> <UNK> br br 4 <UNK> <UNK> br br notice a word with only capital letters that means this is the nick show i'm going to talk about br br <UNK> is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three wealthy cats mr <UNK> gordon and <UNK> who get into weird and really surreal situations from attempting to join human <UNK> <UNK> party for root beer to saving a planet of slugs from the evil spaceship this is one nick show that you will simply have your funny bone <UNK> sooner or later the theme song is catchy and memorable voice actors including wayne knight from the <UNK> franchise brings the characters to fresh life with very quirky personalities the stories are enjoyable <UNK> episodes would be king of all root beer and <UNK> lucky claw and the humor is all done in some style of <UNK> jim br br so in conclusion <UNK> is one of the <UNK> series like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> which becomes very very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less
<START> when i say doctor who you might <UNK> up an image of tom baker or jon pertwee or maybe peter <UNK> when i say james bond you ll almost certainly <UNK> up an image of sean connery while a small handful of people may think of roger moore or pierce brosnan but when i say sgt <UNK> absolutely everyone will think of phil <UNK> unlike doctor who or james bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor and that s the problem with this film version you ll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show in fact the whole idea of making a film version of <UNK> without <UNK> in the title role comes close to <UNK>
<START> one of those classics held up next to deep throat and behind the green door br br sure it was clever but the female lead isn't that attractive and sex isn't that hot but if not for this film porn would not have <UNK> into what it is today br br harry <UNK> was the ron jeremy of his day worth a look if you're a fan
<START> this movie was the <UNK> mormon movie made yet it made the <UNK> sons of <UNK> look like well done films it was supposed to be funny from what i was told the best part was the best actor in the movie travis <UNK> if he wasn't in the movie it probably wouldn't have been made he ruled br br 10 it wasn't funny 9 it was beat 8 it had <UNK> big t <UNK> who's character made no sense 7 it was made in <UNK> 6 it didn't make fun of <UNK> 5 it had larry h miller in it 4 it was the 1st movie clint howard wasn't funny in 3 gary coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a comeback 2 they should have cast at surreal life <UNK> 1 it was made by <UNK> entertainment
<START> i think this still is the best routine there are some others like <UNK> bring the pain and allen's men are pigs that are hilarious damon <UNK> last stand is also funny in a <UNK> way but this routine has no errors all the jokes are funny and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect just long enough to last 20 years i just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and <UNK> i'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool not putting in a category with ellen and <UNK> but something you can watch if you're <UNK> thanks eddie god bless
<START> i was thirteen years old when i saw this movie i expected a lot of action since escape from new york was 16 rated in germany i entered the movie as <UNK> it was so boring afterwards i realized that this was just crap where a husband <UNK> his wife i mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access it is more then 20 years ago but i am still angry that i waste my time with this film this is a soft porno for <UNK> <UNK> bo derek and painting her with color nice but then they should named the film <UNK> bo and painting her
<START> for the record i am not <UNK> with the production in any way br br hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date over 7 seasons this is the last they have produced some 50 or so episodes br br this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone <UNK> their time and energy br br by their own admission the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects green screen work and acting all improve br br i did find it difficult to <UNK> into so started from the beginning and watched all the way through <UNK> benefits from story <UNK> just like all the best sci fi and <UNK> nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set characters and relatives from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories sometimes <UNK> on the characters over the original br br the whole experience includes an excellent web site <UNK> <UNK> a high <UNK> forum which is <UNK> by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat br br if you are looking for high definition high budget productions this is probably not for you br br if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think this is the one
<START> the super sexy b movie actress has another bit part as future <UNK> star ray <UNK> girlfriend in this box office bomb she plays marion has only one line of dialog well one word of dialog actually she shouts out joe as <UNK> character is <UNK> poor pia <UNK> with a plastic garden <UNK> <UNK> this movie is so bad though it becomes funny hilarious at times the guys at mystery science theater 3000 would love this check out the hysterical scene at the end where pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and effects they do to try and show how badly <UNK> character is freaking out pia plays an aspiring hollywood screenwriter in this pia <UNK> as a screenwriter yeah right pia can barely talk let alone write pia is utterly and absolutely miscast in this dumb role but who cares the real star is the hot and fresh glory <UNK> in her bit part in this <UNK> opinion rock on glory
<START> <UNK> has helped me with my own <UNK> and <UNK> i'm a middle aged married father of two i'm quite <UNK> in my personal and professional life still i have pain from my past that i use <UNK> to <UNK> and issues from which i am slowly recovering when these <UNK> and their families share their lives with me they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family br br the show unlike many others <UNK> into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do as alice miller says the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood the show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started this digging is painful and difficult but worth it so much coverage of addiction fictional and non fictional seems to ignore the underlying issues often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self interest and now they can't stop not so <UNK> are about killing pain i can relate to the different events and <UNK> in people's lives there are common themes and surprising exceptions many <UNK> have suffered miserable abuse some kids simply respond badly to divorce to those who think that addiction is an over reaction to a <UNK> i would just say that different people respond differently although some kids handle divorce well others like <UNK> in the show collapse in a heap on the floor and have their lives forever changed by the event br br for example last <UNK> <UNK> said that pretty young <UNK> seeks <UNK> from men she <UNK> for cash for a 75 year old neighbor and lets men abuse her sound familiar to anyone the series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make <UNK> to our lives often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest as they say even a stopped watch is right twice a day but a slow watch can go <UNK> for quite a while until it's made your life miserable br br to the producers thank you for making the show for digging into the past for the follow ups also the graphics the format and the theme music are brilliant br br to the <UNK> thank you for your courage to share whether or not you have helped yourself you have helped me
