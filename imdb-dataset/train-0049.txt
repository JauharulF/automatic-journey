<START> this movie is horrible everything in it has been done before there is nothing original i cannot stand when writers don't come up with their own plots br br a girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult hmm sounds a lot like a movie in the 80s called big what is even more annoying is jennifer <UNK> acting she doesn't act like she is 13 she just acts like she is stupid br br from then on you can guess the whole plot she gets a good job and it just so happens that a friend she had at 13 works with her wow how awesome but no her friend is bad and turns on her trying to get her job but of course she wins in the end when she comes up with a great idea br br there's also a dancing scene in the movie that i've seen a thousand times before br br i hate this movie
<START> this is it this is the one this is the worst movie ever made ever it beats everything i have never seen worse <UNK> the <UNK> and give it to these people there's just no comparison br br even three days after watching this for some reason i still don't know why i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is was its so bad so far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence br br this made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society we should be ashamed i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross <UNK> of our reality for our own good it's an embarrassment i don't know how on earth any of these actors writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making loaded i don't know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies br br that being said i love a good bad movie i love shark attack 3 i love bad taste they are hilarious i tell all my friends to see them because they are bad br br but this this crosses the line of bad into a whole new dimension this is awkward bad this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen every line every action every death every sequence before they happen and not just like a second or two before i mean like after watching the first 5 minutes before br br every cheesy editing effect is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point i really never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cuts or <UNK> cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever this is <UNK> boring repetitive and just <UNK> the audience br br but and let me be specific here the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this <UNK> i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into <UNK> demanding that he run home and swallow two <UNK> of drain o or i will do it for him br br if we ever needed a new form of <UNK> torture for our war prisoners abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again trust me i think they will become more <UNK> with suicide methods after the <UNK> time of sitting through this br br stop these movies they are just the most vile of all <UNK> of our society please stop now
<START> i was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise the friendship of three women <UNK> by one falling in love with a younger man br br intriguing br br not i <UNK> to add these women are all drawn in extreme caricature not very supportive of one another and <UNK> and <UNK> to bring each other down br br anna <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town br br and for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time <UNK> the lack of men sex lust in their lives i felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension the lesbian sub plot went nowhere and those smoking drinking women all 3 in their forties were very unrealistic even in the baby scene screw the baby <UNK> a cigarette right br br like i said a shame of a waste 4 out of 10
<START> cute and playful but lame and cheap <UNK> is another <UNK> clone to come out from the 80s i'm not much of a fan of the <UNK> br br first it was the excellent <UNK> br br then came the very average <UNK> br br lets not forget the lousy <UNK> br br but the complete <UNK> would have to go to <UNK> br br is there more br br now <UNK> for me would have to fall somewhere between <UNK> and <UNK> actually i probably found it more entertaining than <UNK> but i preferred <UNK> one's darker tone br br from the get go it plays up its goofy nature which it's better for it but due to that nature the hammy acting <UNK> <UNK> and charlie phillips can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the <UNK> running amok that's where the fun occurs mostly light hearted fluff though as the story mainly <UNK> on the <UNK> who are either hungry horny and destructive in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters some moments do work in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase it's silly but strangely engaging thanks to the <UNK> pacing the creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed as they're basic dolls being <UNK> about where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak and with attitude br br charlie <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> van der <UNK> who was in <UNK> were fair leads harvey <UNK> was acceptable in two roles robert <UNK> also pops up br br <UNK> low cut entertainment for the <UNK>
<START> butch the <UNK> evidently after the violent beginning with spike tom and jerry all swinging away at each other butch calls a halt and wants to know why it's a good question br br cats can get along with dogs can't they he asks tom who <UNK> his head in <UNK> mice can get along with cats right jerry <UNK> no and then sees that isn't the right answer br br they go inside and butch draws up a peace <UNK> complete with professional artwork most of the rest and the bulk of the cartoon is the three of them being extremely nice to one another what a refreshing change of pace i found it fun to watch i can a million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the head br br anyway you knew the peace wasn't going to last a big piece of <UNK> spells the death of the peace <UNK> but en route it was nice change and still had some of usual tom jerry clever humor
<START> let me say that i love adam sandler watching reign over me i was paying close attention to his acting br br when he raises his voice i cant help but think of happy <UNK> yelling at a golf ball then i snap back as adam sandler sucks me in br br reign over me is a great film a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting emotion in every scene br br don cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an oscar in any movie he does br br adam sandler was amazing in so many ways not only was this his most dramatic best acted film of his career but i can recall laughing out loud at many parts of this film br br the supporting cast was great also with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> smith br br i would highly recommend this movie its got tremendous acting beautiful shots of nyc great comedy great drama and a new found respect for adam sandler if you ever <UNK> him or a <UNK> at how great don cheadle is
<START> i was absolutely blown away by john <UNK> opening night it's the first movie of his that i've seen that seems to be on a bigger scale thus it feels more mainstream but it still doesn't feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films that is perhaps what makes it so intense there is also something undoubtedly <UNK> about watching this movie br br it's about what in fact cassavetes has made a <UNK> of his career an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front <UNK> character middle aged stage actress myrtle gordon cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she <UNK> follows <UNK> after <UNK> resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage until she finds the right one it's a <UNK> abstract premise br br this is a movie that does not fail to capture the <UNK> <UNK> that one goes through during an emotional <UNK> no one understands why myrtle does many of the things she does and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive yet it just might be the best thing for her it may be a <UNK> rather than a breakdown a <UNK> a <UNK> a rebellion it all <UNK> into a <UNK> cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch which is that early on she is <UNK> arguing that she has nothing in common with her character yet she is in quiet but emotionally <UNK> fear that the opposite is true br br the last scene the climactic performance that myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her is one of the most interesting hilarious hard hitting <UNK> and enjoyable moments i've ever seen in a movie
<START> when this movie so well proves that they indeed are unnecessary br br although few lines it was kind of weird to see this movie no <UNK> in a language unknown a friend of mine sent a vhs included a few pieces of papers with all lines translated to english with her translation next to me i began watching this tale it is indeed a tale and from the very first tunes of the <UNK> melody during opening credits i was stuck the colours that minimal acting well in most cases absurd comedy slapstick thoughtful beautiful along with a few other movies paris texas and <UNK> et <UNK> this one is able to speak to anyone's heart without words whenever you get the chance see it whatever you do don't miss it it's a once in a lifetime experience oh acting is great the soundtrack is brilliant the story is simple and told a thousand times before but rarely never like this
<START> now this is what i'm talking about finally a low budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage wendigo while occasionally flawed is a triumph of the imagination granted it <UNK> heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its <UNK> but it's still a damn sight better than 99 of direct to video <UNK> br br the story is pretty simple a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are <UNK> by one particularly unhinged hunter but director larry <UNK> really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical wendigo is it real is it all in the boy's imagination is it an <UNK> of the child's emotional state br br some have <UNK> that the film is unsatisfying because it's left to you to decide don't be put off by such petty nonsense a film that makes you think is not one to avoid it's one to <UNK> in
<START> this is a horrid disaster of a film from beginning to end it's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing the only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by streisand because the kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to the main problem of this film is that we never see <UNK> character at his peak or <UNK> character struggling the first should be seen in decline and the second rising the final streisand number could have been one of the greatest <UNK> in film if it was directed and edited properly the single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake had the band audience and wide shots of the stage been shown this number could have been dynamic and interesting this film must have been directed and edited by an <UNK> film school <UNK> the only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay the final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film and even that is <UNK> completely by misguided technical decisions
<START> raising victor vargas is a movie you definitely need to see it was very heart felt and had a lot of humor that gets you sucked right in it is so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through victor a cocky teen but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right places dealing with girls and family at the end victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with a old fashioned grandmother and a girl who he wants to use is actually using him too i recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like you are watching a real family thats how much feeling this movie has one heart felt moment was when <UNK> grandmother throws victor out over something simple victor was really heart and couldn't believe that she would do something like that it made me feel real sorry for him like it was real overall i give this movie a b
<START> this <UNK> fairly routine series deserves credit in the tv history books for two reasons it was the first to win an emmy award for best <UNK> series and it was the very first show to come from the <UNK> studios of republic pictures known for its low budget but high powered shoot em ups in the 30's and 40's br br republic was one of the first hollywood studios to make a leap into the small screen which was still in its <UNK> but the <UNK> <UNK> as producer of tv pulp fiction would be brief after this show they would later <UNK> with the other format that they were known for the adventure serial with <UNK> cody as well as other series but like this one they didn't last longer than <UNK> episodes also republic was in its last stages as a studio it would finish out its <UNK> in hollywood as rental stages for several <UNK> studio series such as soldiers of fortune the original <UNK> and <UNK> carson before finally <UNK> its doors in 1959 br br anyway stories of the century wasn't that bad of an <UNK> its calling card was tales based on authentic figures in western history mainly <UNK> like black bart johnny <UNK> john wesley <UNK> the dalton bros and the like the late jim davis best known for his role as the <UNK> <UNK> in dallas put in an <UNK> job in the lead role as matt clark a fictional <UNK> detective who has to <UNK> with said <UNK> played by veteran and soon to be veteran character actors br br two amazing facts here the incidents would take place in different time lines some in the <UNK> some at the turn of the century but clark never ages and also matt has the good luck to <UNK> himself with two lovely female detectives as <UNK> frankie adams played by mary castle and her replacement margaret <UNK> jones by <UNK> miller the lone ranger could only wish for lady <UNK> you can only spend such time with <UNK> for so long br br stories of the century is a studio city tv production from republic pictures <UNK> <UNK> episodes were made during 1954 all <UNK> of which are in public <UNK> and on dvd
<START> anyone not aware of the 1973 original british lion movie ' the wicker man' would no doubt have left the cinema with the impression <UNK> and <UNK> br br as a <UNK> of the original i left with the impression purely poor br br from the grim reality of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> drawing the force of law and order into a web of <UNK> <UNK> ritual on a remote scottish island named <UNK> the original to a near amazon <UNK> colony off the <UNK> coast of the us named <UNK> the remake hardly hits the spot br br this is quite sadly a case of what <UNK> have been a classic remake of a classic being <UNK> with to <UNK> for a simple minded public nothing more and nothing less br br gentlemen or given the <UNK> context of the film ladies involved hang your heads in shame
<START> this is probably the <UNK> paced and most action packed of the german edgar wallace <UNK> series a cross between the dr <UNK> films of <UNK> and 60's pop thrillers like batman and the man from uncle it <UNK> the outrageous villain from an earlier film who <UNK> a stylish <UNK> habit and breaks the <UNK> of victims with the <UNK> of a deadly whip set at a posh girls' school filled with <UNK> middle aged <UNK> and with the cops <UNK> their hot to <UNK> <UNK> at every opportunity it certainly is a <UNK> to those wonderfully politically incorrect times there's a definite link to a later wallace based film the excellent giallo whatever happened to <UNK> which also concerns female students being <UNK> by and <UNK> their <UNK> quite appropriate to the monk theme the master mind villain uses <UNK> trapped <UNK> here to deal some of the death blows and also maintains a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> his captive audiences br br alfred <UNK> was always the most playful and visually flamboyant of the series directors and here the lurid colour cinematography is the real star of the show the monk appears in a raving scarlet <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> setting off the <UNK> white whip while appearing against <UNK> night backgrounds there's also a <UNK> friendly <UNK> swimming pool which looks great both as a glowing <UNK> for the <UNK> students and as a shadowy backdrop for one of the murder scenes the trademark <UNK> of hiding the <UNK> card somewhere in the set of the last scene is also quite memorable here and there's a fine <UNK> and <UNK> score for retro music fans br br fans of the series will definitely miss the <UNK> eddie <UNK> character in these later films instead the chief inspector sir john takes on the role of <UNK> convinced that he has <UNK> criminal psychology after taking a few night <UNK> unfortunately <UNK> kinski had also gone on to bigger and better things the <UNK> had lost some of their offbeat <UNK> charm by this point and now worked on a much more blatant pop culture level which will make this one quite accessible to <UNK> viewers
<START> the first mistake you make in <UNK> a film is to use of the living dead without really having a budget for real zombie fx sure this was a low budget zombie flick really low budget i thought it was a film school project amateur actors and amateur effects br br it was really not too bad considering the above and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre if you are going to get an r for violence you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked the women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as gay interest br br and i am staying out of <UNK> there was a heck of a lot of shooting going on and no cops in sight
<START> this may not be a memorable classic but it is a touching romance with an important theme that <UNK> the importance of <UNK> in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill br br the story revolves around <UNK> a widow who becomes <UNK> with a fellow employee at her factory job an illiterate <UNK> worker named stanley <UNK> discovers that stanley is unable to read and after he loses his job she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen of course as you might predict the two although initially <UNK> of involvement develop feelings for each other br br jane fonda competently plays <UNK> a woman with problems of her own <UNK> with a job lacking <UNK> two teenage children one pregnant an unemployed sister and her abusive husband however robert deniro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and <UNK> but illiterate stanley bringing a dignity to the role that <UNK> respect they aren't your typical charming young <UNK> couple as generally depicted in on screen romances but an ordinary working class middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles br br i won't give the ending away but it's a lovely heartwarming romance and a personal look into the <UNK> issue of adult <UNK> albeit from the perspective of a fictional character
<START> it is always a nice <UNK> when a film made for tv turns out to be entertaining such as little richard this is a very watchable film about the story of rock and roller little richard played by an actor called leon who i have never seen before but does an very good job as most tv films this is a little <UNK> than if made for cinema which is a shame because i am sure there is lot we could have seen about little richard that was controversial instead we see a lot <UNK> rubbish which is the only thing that <UNK> the film and eventually <UNK> a very promising career all in all this film is good and the acting is above average <UNK> a tv film 7 out of 10
<START> this a superb self contained work that is <UNK> with anything before or after brat pack <UNK> and club <UNK> are not my <UNK> of choice but in this law free world they make an <UNK> ambiance the film is packed with our guys distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances the dialogue is a joy in fact it's a new <UNK> one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with <UNK> appreciation br br <UNK> include billy <UNK> british <UNK> ben <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> of ad <UNK> <UNK>
<START> not funny how can anyone link this to monty python that is absolutely ridiculous there are no laughs this is not funny over the top but ugly weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time unfortunately something that did not make them funny br br it should be given some points for effort etc whatever actually it appears there is a laugh track or is there one <UNK> since there are barely any laughs that's a <UNK> question br br maybe i'm doing it injustice maybe it's some sort of exercise some sort of art in that case anything goes never mind br br but these guys playing women with high pitched voices turned up <UNK> come on not funny br br there is only one heir apparent to monty <UNK> intellectual wit and that is stephen <UNK> and maybe jon stewart
<START> amy <UNK> second film johnny dangerously is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the warner <UNK> tradition michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in <UNK> keaton's mother maureen <UNK> has continuing health problems so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle meanwhile the <UNK> richard <UNK> plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks joe <UNK> has a hilarious turn as danny <UNK> yeah that's right <UNK> <UNK> dunne is keaton's younger brother turned district attorney <UNK> <UNK> his wife and <UNK> <UNK> plays keaton's <UNK> the film looks <UNK> cheap making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film br br the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour due to the combination of dialog and gags the film holds its own for the first half but then it rapidly loses steam and <UNK> into mediocrity and <UNK> in the second half keaton <UNK> the scenery doing his best james cagney impression <UNK> has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious not funny <UNK> does the once bit one time too many several supporting actors try to hold up the <UNK> like danny <UNK> dom <UNK> ray <UNK> as a street <UNK> alan hale jr as a desk sergeant and <UNK> bond as an <UNK> cleaning lady the second half <UNK> into a hit or miss television show type tone and never <UNK> the closing scene <UNK> the roaring <UNK> is an <UNK> as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a <UNK> earlier in the film i think <UNK> should have known better since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring <UNK> actual 1939 release date 1 2 of 4 stars
<START> great western i hear you all say brilliant first effort well i'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one i saw great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none the acting was poor to say the least and i couldn't care less about any of the characters making the whole film pointless the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to tv low budget rubbish like you see on those fact or fiction <UNK> on sci fi br br please if you are looking for a good film a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half please look elsewhere
<START> <UNK> <UNK> directorial venture of <UNK> <UNK> novel is brilliant <UNK> <UNK> plays an inspector <UNK> who is forced to protect underworld don <UNK> <UNK> played brilliantly by <UNK> <UNK> this is <UNK> <UNK> most talked about movie this is a very good and a classic film <UNK> <UNK> plays the female lead opposite <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shah is brilliant in a cameo role although <UNK> <UNK> has only 4 scenes in the movie he <UNK> the movie this was <UNK> <UNK> acting debut <UNK> <UNK> won a national award for this film for the best actor <UNK> award winner for best film story supporting actor <UNK> <UNK>
<START> before seeing this i was put off by the subject matter but this is not your average triumph over <UNK> story although this is technically about blind <UNK> kids climbing <UNK> <UNK> there is so much more to it this movie shows the very strong often <UNK> personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is an american blind mountain <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> is a blind german academic who started a school in <UNK> <UNK> they are both exceptional in their own ways but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids <UNK> wants them to reach the <UNK> while <UNK> wants them to enjoy <UNK> as a role model and take pleasure in moment the nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea the most profound scenes are with the <UNK> children themselves and the <UNK> they faced before finding their way to the school the most moving for me was the story of <UNK> a <UNK> teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him i could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students if you liked <UNK> or <UNK> you will love this
<START> i was really horrified by this eerie movie what an unusual dark atmosphere and such a creepy musical score really promising indeed after ten minutes you really start <UNK> and feeling uncomfortable for you start <UNK> the worst this movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare and what's worse it all comes out for one hour and a half i have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake <UNK> <UNK> is a truly horrifying picture for your eyes your ears your intelligence and most of all your <UNK> since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap <UNK> <UNK> is the biggest horror of all
<START> i was <UNK> to see this movie by its <UNK> but ultimately that's all it delivers it plays much more like a greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption it's greatest flaw is its <UNK> and utter lack of suspense we know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow along as they fall like <UNK> the film to its credit does <UNK> from gratuitous violence and sex but has forgotten to substitute good clean romance or excitement in any other way all the flavor of a good flat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> q a which also takes place in new york is a far better alternative as is la <UNK>
<START> i expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip hop but was disappointed on many levels first of all the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable second the setting acting and story are not very authentic or believable third there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks how about some originality third there were very few hip hop songs played in <UNK> if any none <UNK> really central overall film was a great disappointment but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile
<START> the mother is one of those films that you know is good maybe even great but it is like eating <UNK> or doing <UNK> <UNK> is to a kid too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in br br the story is potentially <UNK> in many ways the death of a character within the first half hour the december may romance the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty something characters the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives this movie was made in the 2002 or 2003 but is a throw back to a collection of british usually made for tv movies from the late 1980's it has a moral <UNK> that never lets up which produces an <UNK> <UNK> angst br br the mother is flawless but that is in part the problem if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws inconsistencies of script some lesser actors it takes the edge off but if such a film is so pitch perfect the experience of watching it is raw and painful even the technical qualities lighting editing etc make the viewer <UNK> the london in this movie is bright and open filled with harsh cutting light br br if you are tough as nails or are one of those super sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gut wrenching sad movies or novels then you will enjoy the mother anyone in between give it a miss or be prepared to <UNK> and be warned as tough as the movie is from beginning to near end the worst is to come br br toward the end of the movie the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it for having slept with her boyfriend and the daughter <UNK> says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her the mother agrees to this they both stand up and instead of a well <UNK> slap the daughter <UNK> her fist and delivers a <UNK> blow <UNK>
<START> this movie should have never been made from the poorly done animation to the beyond bad acting i am not sure at what point the people behind this movie said ok looks good lets do it i was in awe of how truly horrid this movie was at one point which very may well have been the worst point a computer generated <UNK> tooth of gold falls from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth uh <UNK> the villain of the movie was a <UNK> <UNK> that was killed within minutes of its first appearance the other two manages to kill a handful of people prior to being burned and <UNK> down then there is a random one awaiting victims in the jungle which scares me for one sole reason will there be a part two god for the sake of humans everywhere i hope not br br this movie was pure garbage from the power point esquire credits to the slide show ending
<START> this movie is about basically human relations and the interaction between them the main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past doing an analysis of how she lived her life this journey is <UNK> because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a <UNK> home it is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy real love marriage or destiny although this type of movie <UNK> are nothing new this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas there is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed i really recommend this movie for a quiet saturday afternoon
<START> first off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasn't meant to be convincing it was a low budget <UNK> but really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions br br i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in non shock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid <UNK> i didn't trust anyone for about a week because i didn't want to wake up strung up and tortured
<START> <UNK> man now this is what i'm talking about as far as bad cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own a real gem br br first off the film wasn't originally in english that's okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional here is my favorite <UNK> from the dialog and there is plenty more where this came from  i'm feeling a little better i'm just <UNK> for your blood br br and what drama here is a play by play <UNK> of the interaction between the military and <UNK> br br scene <UNK> scientist you can't do <UNK> it'll be a disaster military officer that's just science fiction he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted br br scene <UNK> scientist if you do that many people will die military officer you don't know what you're talking about he does it and many people die br br scene <UNK> scientist don't do <UNK> it'll kill everyone military officer that's nonsense he then proceeds to kill everyone br br scene 4 5 6 <UNK> you get the idea br br if that wasn't <UNK> there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics in one scene the military has literally 10 guys pointing guns at two <UNK> men the leader yells go get 'em and all 10 army guys one at a time drop their guns and fist fight the two <UNK> instant classic br br and don't worry no attention to detail was left out this movie even had a hip upbeat <UNK> keyboard <UNK> soundtrack to set the mood br br and trust <UNK> i realize this review might contain some spoilers but there are so many <UNK> in this epic i really only <UNK> the surface a movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade a true movie watching experience a masterpiece wow
<START> while to most people watching the movie this will be of little interest but out of the many hundreds of movies dealing with magic and the occult in one form or another this one is probably the best in many ways br br from the <UNK> to the craft the subject seems to be of endless interest to the movie industry the majority of movies which touch on it in any way do so <UNK> for example <UNK> a true piece of utter garbage in every way either taking the <UNK> elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> more frequently the subject comes up in an hysterical religious context in the various revelations oriented movies the <UNK> is inevitably an <UNK> of some kind of new age style practice rarely a movie seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as it is <UNK> in real life but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be described as <UNK> and not literal or symbolic or just not quite right br br i watched this movie again after many years tonight i had seen it before on vhs it is a dark moody piece and after watching it on dvd i would say if you have any intention to watch this movie watch it on dvd don't watch it on vhs br br the darkness and <UNK> are <UNK> in vhs but in dvd the movie takes on a very different tone i think <UNK> pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of vhs this goes over the edge dvd brings the movie to life again and i saw it differently br br anyway seeing it as if for the first time i realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie it's difficult to go into all the reasons why i don't care to take the time to do so br br for anybody who's curious anyway if you want to see what it is like in real life this movie is just very right on countless levels br br and for anybody who isn't you really wasted a lot of time reading to this point
<START> this familiar story of an older man younger woman is surprisingly hard edged <UNK> hippies free love and jail bait mix surprisingly well in this forgotten black and white indie effort lead actress patricia <UNK> as the titular candy gives the finest performance of her career <UNK> all of 3 drive in epics <UNK> was <UNK> and <UNK> in the young <UNK> 1971 but gives a more serious performance in the babysitter the occasional violence and <UNK> nudity are somewhat surprising but well handled by the director leads <UNK> and george e carey sell the may december romance <UNK> there are enough similarities between the babysitter and the young <UNK> to make one wonder if the same director <UNK> the latter film as well patricia <UNK> where are you br br <UNK> from seattle <UNK> miss <UNK> had appeared as a dancer on the tv rock and roll show <UNK> u before <UNK> the cover as well as appearing in an eight page spread of the august 1968 issue of best for men a <UNK> adults only magazine she also appeared as a <UNK> witch in the popular 1969 cult drive in shocker the <UNK> br br the babysitter has finally made its home video debut as part of the eight film <UNK> box set drive in cult classics <UNK> 3 which is available from amazon com and some <UNK> stores such as best buy
<START> if there was some weird <UNK> oscar academy awards festival this flick would win it all it has all the gods excellent plot extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar well this could be the scenario if the world was <UNK> but it's not instead it's the worst horror flick ever made not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a <UNK> with bad <UNK> but also extremely low on special effects for example the devil costume which by the way is a must see is something of the most hilarious i've ever seen whenever i saw that red black so called monster on screen i couldn't hold my laugh back and to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a <UNK> belt br br do not do the same mistake as i did checking imdb seeing that the movie was released in 2003 had less than five votes and thinking well it's worth a shot can't be that bad br br yes it could br br i'm not even going to waste more words on this movie
<START> made after <UNK> was trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by <UNK> here the three stories are the <UNK> mr know it all and <UNK> the first two are comic the <UNK> is like a prolonged joke but one with a good pay off and the last more serious as health issues are involved again the author introduces the film and the stories br br james <UNK> soon to have his signature role as samuel <UNK> is the hero in the <UNK> he holds this small <UNK> type job in a church but the new <UNK> michael <UNK> is an intellectual <UNK> when he hears <UNK> has no <UNK> he fires him <UNK> has saved some money so he tells his wife kathleen harrison he <UNK> buying a small news and <UNK> shop he has a good eye and his store <UNK> soon he has a whole chain of stores when his <UNK> is <UNK> by <UNK> the latter is amazed to see how <UNK> his ex <UNK> the payoff is when bank manager felix <UNK> meets with <UNK> about <UNK> his <UNK> i'll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic <UNK> of the meeting br br according to <UNK> he met a man like max <UNK> <UNK> patrick on a cruise in mr know it all <UNK> is a <UNK> friendly and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by <UNK> his state room mate is mr grey the ever quiet and proper <UNK> hyde white who is somewhat <UNK> <UNK> of max max likes to <UNK> things and soon is heavily involved in the <UNK> entertainment at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non <UNK> story and film china <UNK> <UNK> as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after <UNK> that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real i won't describe the way max rises to the occasion br br <UNK> is the longest segment <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> the fictional alter ego of <UNK> a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock's the secret agent here he has to use a <UNK> for a couple of months for his health he finds a remarkable crew of people including jean simmons as a <UNK> but beautiful young woman <UNK> <UNK> as an <UNK> <UNK> john laurie as a second <UNK> <UNK> who is at war with <UNK> raymond <UNK> as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up and michael <UNK> as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness <UNK> watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions the last dealing with simmons and <UNK> is ironic but deeply moving br br it was a dandy follow up to the earlier <UNK> and well worth watching
<START> as if most people didn't already have a <UNK> <UNK> on the field of <UNK> this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients <UNK> a successful dental <UNK> witnesses his wife going down on the pool man on their <UNK> of all days and <UNK> big time into a furious breakdown after shooting an attack <UNK> head off he <UNK> into work and ends up taking his marital <UNK> out on the patients as he plans what to do about his slut of a wife there are plenty of up close shots of mouth <UNK> tongue cutting and beauty queen <UNK> as well as a <UNK> deranged performance by corbin bernsen the scene in which he ties up and <UNK> his wife before mercilessly <UNK> her teeth out is definitely hard to watch a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail the dentist is incredibly entertaining fast paced and laughably gory at times check it out
<START> i'm not kidding about that summary and vote the video <UNK> have <UNK> this as just another typical '80s werewolf movie but it is in fact the greatest parody of the horror genre that you can imagine having done for the horror movie what blazing <UNK> did for the western i have seen plenty of comedies good bad stupid weird etc usually walking away <UNK> and i think that comedy must be the most difficult genre for filmmakers and actors to work in it takes just the right kind of touch to make things successful and part of that is having good ideas full moon high is <UNK> with good ideas so many in fact that it can easily put the <UNK> <UNK> team of airplane and naked gun to shame one of the best of these is the very presence of ed <UNK> in a starring role as a john <UNK> style right wing <UNK> the jokes non <UNK> <UNK> and word play are literally non stop and everything including the kitchen sink has been thrown in the ironic tone is very similar to that of back to the future br br some people i e almost every reviewer here must have been turned off by the spirit of <UNK> here but i almost died of laughter and this is one of those movies in which you never know what kind of insane situation will <UNK> next since b movie <UNK> larry cohen had not made a straight comedy before this one gets the sense that he was making up for lost time by including any joke he or his <UNK> could think of if mel brooks had made this the critics would have <UNK> it a comic masterpiece but because it was made by cohen it has been <UNK> as schlock critical reviews have called this movie too silly silly what is a comedy supposed to be serious anyway i laughed out loud more for this movie than any other i can think of cohen makes fun of everyone himself included with plenty of references to his usual brand of low rent film making he and the actors must have had a complete blast making this br br the humor is very mel brooks ish and anyone who loves jewish humor or watches a lot of b movies especially horror will love this trust me the movie isn't too hard to find and as long as you accept it for what it is a roller coaster of belly laughs with no <UNK> of social value whatsoever then you'll truly enjoy it br br one <UNK> this movie should somehow go down in history as the one thing bob <UNK> ever starred in albeit briefly that was actually funny
<START> louis <UNK> compelling children's classic is about as disney as freddy krueger it's got murder racism facial <UNK> and killer <UNK> br br tightly plotted it's a multi layered <UNK> story that <UNK> history to reveal <UNK> own <UNK> and the secret behind the holes it races from <UNK> lush <UNK> to the <UNK> marked camp green lake hint there's no lake and no green br br disney's first success is re creating the <UNK> <UNK> so convincingly the set design is superb and without <UNK> the other plus is in the casting rising star <UNK> <UNK> charlie's angels 2 project <UNK> might not be the fat boy of the book but his attitude is right and he's far from the usual clean cut hero the rest of the cast is filled out equally well from patricia arquette as the frontier school <UNK> turned bank <UNK> to henry <UNK> as <UNK> dad the downside is the pop soundtrack pure marketing department and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end
<START> the main problem with the documentary czech dream is that isn't really saying what it thinks it's saying br br in an <UNK> i hesitate to use the word inspired act of street theater <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> two student filmmakers from the czech republic pulled off a major corporate <UNK> to serve as the basis for their movie they deliberately <UNK> a phony <UNK> the eastern european equivalent of <UNK> or wal mart super store built an entire ad campaign around it <UNK> with <UNK> radio and tv spots an official <UNK> a catchy theme song and photos of fake <UNK> and then waited around to see just how many <UNK> would show up to their creation on opening day they even built a <UNK> <UNK> to convince people that the store itself actually existed br br one might well ask why do such a thing well that's a very good question but the answer the filmmakers provide isn't all that satisfying a one essentially we're told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something even something that's not true simply through the power of advertising and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the real i e higher purpose for the <UNK> is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the <UNK> <UNK> them to join the european union fair enough especially when one considers that the actual <UNK> who agree to go along with the stunt <UNK> against the <UNK> nature of lying to customers all the while <UNK> their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of research into what does and does not work in advertising in a way by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments these ad men and women are as much <UNK> of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the <UNK> br br but in many ways the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target it ironically <UNK> right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it for it is they themselves and not the good hearted and naturally <UNK> people who ultimately come off as the <UNK> and <UNK> ones here as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long <UNK> on foot to get to the spot and what is all this supposed to prove anyway that people are greedy because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for <UNK> or that they're stupid and <UNK> because they don't suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised such <UNK> would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world br br no i'm afraid this smart <UNK> nasty little stunt only proves what complete and utter <UNK> the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots and indeed many of them when they finally discover the trick that's been played on them react with a <UNK> and good humor i'm not sure i would be able to <UNK> were i to find myself in their position br br i'm not saying that the movie isn't gripping something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action but when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red faced and empty handed to their homes we can safely <UNK> that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed
<START> a woman who hates cats alice <UNK> and her son brian <UNK> have moved into a small town and must deal with a mean teacher glenn <UNK> their incestuous relationship a lovely girl <UNK> <UNK> and one hell of a big secret br br okay so technically this is a bad film but who cares it's so very fun br br impossible things involving corn happen people freak out about kitty cats there's bad one liners there's too much cheese to handle br br so yes you will enjoy this a lot it won't move you touch you scare you or thrill you in any way but it will keep you entertained and laughing
<START> i'm a pretty old dude old enough to remember the taste of <UNK> and coke as they were 50 <UNK> years ago when every taste for a kid was fresh i wish i have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker so that i could taste those things today this magical locker might even have <UNK> the fabric of the food to account for how i've <UNK> physically and otherwise a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations over the half century they would have had to <UNK> quite a bit because you see i would have known that i set them aside eating one now would be a celebration of self and past and story and sense that would almost make the <UNK> years an anticipated reward br br i didn't have enough sense to do that with original coke and i couldn't have invented one of those magical psychic <UNK>  not then but i did something almost as good in the seventies i really tuned into roman polanski he was a strange and exotic pleasure  you know movies <UNK> out of the soviet block movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward movies that make you want to live with polish women one and then deciding that they would be the last to get it br br here's what i did i took what i knew would be my favorite polanski movie and set it aside i did not watch it i <UNK> until i thought i would be big enough to deserve it over the years i would test myself my ability to surround beauty and <UNK> it without <UNK> it there probably are few <UNK> who have worked at this practicing to deserve <UNK> working to deserve <UNK> when i see it trying to get the <UNK> from the edges br br recently i achieved something like <UNK> that it was time to pull this out i already knew that i was already past the time when this would work <UNK> because i had already seen and understood <UNK> gate br br if you do not know this it is about a man who <UNK> <UNK> a room in which the previous tenant about whom the story is named jumped out the window to die later after this man played by polanski visits what happens is that time <UNK> and he becomes this woman we are fooled into believing that he is merely mad but the way we follow him he is not he merely has flashes that the world is normal and that the surrounding people are not part of a <UNK> <UNK> his reality br br the story hardly matters what matters is how <UNK> <UNK> this thing both in the way he <UNK> the eye that only makes edges and in <UNK> the body that only consists of confused flesh the two never meet there is a <UNK> that may haunt me for the next 30 years its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all  at all except a <UNK> wig br br i know of no one else that could do this this sketch that remains a sketch this horror that remains natural br br to understand the genius of this you have to know one of the greatest films ever made rear window the genius of that film is the post noir notion that the camera <UNK> the world that the viewer creates the story what roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out in rear window the idea was that the on screen viewer jimmy stewart was the anchor and everything else was fiction woven as we watched here the on screen apartment <UNK> is the filmmaker we know this we know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator we know it is true that bodies shift identity that times shift that <UNK> is plastic we know that the narrator will kill us we know that the narrator will leave us in a <UNK> horror on that edge that he <UNK> but never shows us and lets us imagine br br ted's <UNK> 4 of 3 every <UNK> person should experience this
<START> when the us entered world war i the government forced hollywood to <UNK> out propaganda films the little american is probably the best of the lot because it stars mary pickford br br pickford plays a young woman torn between two men jack holt german and raymond <UNK> french but her decision is <UNK> because of the war as both men <UNK> br br when the ship pickford is <UNK> on is sunk by the germans think <UNK> because it is carrying <UNK> pickford has a great scene as she stands on the <UNK> and yells at the german commander later on of course she runs into both holt and <UNK> when she is being held as a war prisoner at a <UNK> br br director cecil b demille provides one truly great scene in this film as pickford and holt are wandering through a bombed out village they pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing against the wall is a very large <UNK> as they stand and watch the wall <UNK> but the jesus figure remains suspended in mid air it's a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and un artsy br br pickford is as always a pleasure to watch she was always a very natural actress who avoided the arm waving <UNK> many other actors of the day used she's also very very pretty holt is very good here in a leading man role <UNK> is ok among the list of name actors in extra parts are wallace <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moore ben alexander <UNK> <UNK> norman <UNK> walter long james <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br not a great film but interesting to see us propaganda at work
<START> you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but you'd think that after watching <UNK> stink <UNK> heroes run <UNK> through the bush with an egg on a <UNK> for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting br br and i'm not even speaking of the shows <UNK> which for the record i find questionable it's just hard to suspend disbelief for <UNK> bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are <UNK> in an air <UNK> make shift bio <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> br br what's the appeal here i don't care about these people or their meandering lives i just don't get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy <UNK> people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true <UNK> they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette <UNK> from a <UNK> of garbage <UNK> eventually striking pay dirt and <UNK> a <UNK> dr frankenstein <UNK> cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of <UNK> <UNK> on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are <UNK> sent <UNK> to the local institution when the frightening <UNK> state of full blown <UNK> kicks into gear now that's entertainment
<START> the influence of hal hartley in <UNK> <UNK> i'll take you there is not overt but clearly has ties to his work <UNK> has acted in two of hartley's films not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative but the hyper stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light though this film is not ironic on the whole thank god the small and subtle <UNK> that pepper the piece <UNK> to the bitter truths in love and loss with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies i'll see you there is a great indie film that doesn't <UNK> to <UNK> irony when dealing with the <UNK> of love and the reality of human emotion br br the film begins with <UNK> life falling to pieces not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the <UNK> all washed up bill <UNK> in his own <UNK> and doom until his sister lucy played by the director <UNK> <UNK> brings him all kinds of surprises a self help book and a date for her traumatized brother br br the unwilling bill tries to refuse but the sudden appearance of <UNK> at his door leaves him no choice no doubt <UNK> initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous <UNK> detract from his ability to <UNK> with her however her pseudo hippie qualities annoy him so much that he <UNK> at her on their first date and <UNK> is so traumatized by his <UNK> remarks that she <UNK> herself to him forcing herself upon him to what end we are not aware except for maybe the fact that she is psycho and who better to play the psycho than ally <UNK> br br aware that bill desperately wants to see rose <UNK> offers her car but on the condition that he take her somewhere first on the way she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun a <UNK> detective no less an <UNK> of angst <UNK> redemption passion and violence ensue as bill and <UNK> find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose of course with a few stops along the way
<START> an absolutely wretched waste of film nothing ever happens no ghosts hardly any train no mystery no interest the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful everything else is pathetic the premise is idiotic a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no place because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes what and the <UNK> leaves them no place to stay in a heavy storm i think not oh they can walk 4 miles across the dead black fields <UNK> yeah sure or they can force themselves on the <UNK> <UNK> and stay at the <UNK> train station a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring utterly without ghosts interest or plot br br so very terribly dull that this seems impossible br br this ought to be added to the lost films list <UNK>
<START> i went into watching this movie knowing it wasn't going to be great but what i witnessed was to awful for words i don't mean to be harsh its just the movie was terrible overall it had bad i mean awful special effects the acting wasn't too bad but wasn't good either and sasquatch himself was like well not sasquatch in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is harry and the <UNK> its not violent or horror but it has the best depiction of sasquatch at least its a suit and not some half ass cgi rip off only see this movie if you are desperate or really appreciate anyone in the film or go watch <UNK> saints it is much better
<START> any movie that portrays the hard working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the <UNK> era br br it's little wonder that this movie was written by a woman
<START> i rated this film 7 10 which is an average of 8 10 for screenplay direction and 1944 production values and 6 10 for acting my acting rating in turn was <UNK> at 4 10 for all the screen characters except for that played by heroine ella raines as carol <UNK> who was excellent at 8 10 also i <UNK> thomas <UNK> as inspector burgess whose character convinces that he personally does not think the guilty verdict on scott henderson alan curtis was just in view of his naive <UNK> these two then form an alliance to prove scott's <UNK> br br i have this film on a <UNK> film noir <UNK> <UNK> dvd in spanish as la <UNK> <UNK> with the original soundtrack <UNK> as an alternative language since despite searching i could not find a wholly english version i was however anxious to see another performance by ella raines after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in impact playing a sole female garage <UNK> here ella performs another heroic role believing in the innocence of her engineer boss and refuses several <UNK> that she should return to her home in kansas her <UNK> pet name for her before solving the missing <UNK> the fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a little hard to believe since he <UNK> just seemed to have had a <UNK> business relationship with her he had however designed children's homes and <UNK> so i suppose family man had lit up in <UNK> brain br br in the 1940s with the film code in operation producers could only portray sex through <UNK> and here it is done in the form of furious <UNK> played by elisha <UNK> <UNK> carol dolls herself up as a girl of easy virtue in an attempt to lure the drummer into giving her information about the phantom lady <UNK> the other main character jack <UNK> an associate of scott henderson is played by <UNK> tone whose performance i found too theatrical and wondered why carol for instance did not notice him constantly and strangely <UNK> his hands here the screenplay should have been improved and provided more suspense as these theatrical moves <UNK> the plot far too early to the audience
<START> the saddest thing about this film is that only 8 people cared to leave a review of it and no one felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boards br br made the same year as philadelphia the tom hanks oscar winner this is the film that people really should have seen and given awards to there is more humanity life love <UNK> and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film i have seen and it is all true br br in order for this to be <UNK> i need to leave a few more lines of text suffice it to say that anyone who really wants to know what it was like to be gay in the 60's and 70's and to understand just what aids was like before the modern drug <UNK> allowed people to breathe a little easier this is the film to see br br oh and i will add a personal comment about aids despite everything there actually has been a silver <UNK> to all the horror when aids first arrived it was called the gay cancer and <UNK> preferred to let them die rather than spend a red <UNK> on research to help save a bunch of <UNK> then it became clear that aids would also be a <UNK> disease but the government wasn't ready for that so when straight people began getting ill too the only <UNK> and <UNK> that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves examples the names project the <UNK> <UNK> all those who died of aids act up etc the result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them because no other <UNK> existed this close contact in my <UNK> is what finally broke down the <UNK> of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals when aids first came on the scene many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us and that probably would have been true if <UNK> didn't suddenly become ill too nevertheless the <UNK> that have been made in gay <UNK> to the point that as i write this there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage these <UNK> would probably have taken a lot longer without aids to bring us together it is sad to think that all those people both straight and gay had to die before our common humanity became more obvious but if what i am writing here is true and i think it is then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain
<START> granted i had seen some speed <UNK> but i never really watched it and i had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed as birds who flew a ship called the phoenix and another revolving around a space ship that looked like a giant ocean <UNK> and it flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five this one though i watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it it actually ended the bad guys done in unlike nearly every american cartoon where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one transformers that ended with <UNK> and this new bad guy <UNK> to get the <UNK> <UNK> and dragons with the kids never making it home with <UNK> joe with <UNK> still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth this one did end and did feature a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed it was a bit bland to begin with as it could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons as it went on he got a cool shooting fist like the one <UNK> 16 used against cell in <UNK> z then that weapon evolved to include <UNK> that shot out then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were <UNK> into the wings he would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called <UNK> in america the villains not only consisted of dr hell but a really weird person that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head interesting show and it was kind of nice seeing a conclusion
<START> cheap and mind <UNK> dull story and acting not a single good line not even a line bad enough to be good and no memorable delivery even the <UNK> reel included with the dvd showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having the <UNK> and occult basis was <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> failed to be creepy or believable the <UNK> overtones were <UNK> tame and <UNK> and were limited to young boys <UNK> their <UNK> while <UNK> in their <UNK> i'm not gay enough to appreciate it but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake
<START> here's a review for people like me this movie sucks from beginning to end i threw popcorn at the screen and <UNK> to entertaining myself a la <UNK> the plot <UNK> on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart the lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get <UNK> and she's rich and she's a famous psychologist come on people she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about <UNK> her that was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half witted movie viewers rain man would have been insulted i also admit that i despise mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat <UNK> war starters and fur <UNK> my hatred is so complete that it defies logic but i'll give it a shot that it's not supposed to sound real is fine i don't care it's that everyone talks the same mamet can't create characters all he can do is <UNK> his voice on us relentlessly through different actors no wonder his actors are so wooden they're confused about everyone being the same character however his later films do improve
<START> to those who have not followed the anne marie <UNK> murder case you are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all the murderer is popular <UNK> attorney tom <UNK> and the victim is the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> secretary anne marie <UNK> their relationship was a well kept secret until her disappearance and murder she wanted to leave him but he just wouldn't let her go so easily on the other hand he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters where did he find the time to have two <UNK> and a domestic family life besides the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four hour mini series while the actress who plays ms <UNK> does a fine job she does not have her dark long hair his other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman mark <UNK> is better looking and does an emmy award winning performance as tom <UNK> it would be better with actual <UNK> and philadelphia locations with ann <UNK> executive producing she adds accuracy to anne <UNK> characteristic of organization and her personal battle with an eating disorder these bits of information might be overlooked by any other executive producer or director if you have not read the book it is well worth it ann rule is a fascinating <UNK> of true crime it is ironic that mark <UNK> plays tom <UNK> he also played ann <UNK> former friend and subject ted <UNK> in an another book adaptation many years ago he was brilliant then and now he does an above average job with an amazing story even president <UNK> offered his assistance in the anne marie <UNK> case and now the former <UNK> tom <UNK> is now the united states senator for <UNK> who defeated longtime popular <UNK> senator richard roth in the november 2000 election if you don't think the movie is interesting then the read <UNK> book
<START> the class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27 year old former class mates br br i like the idea of the show that's why it <UNK> me that the class is not funny even though it has the obvious potential it's not enough corky just <UNK> haha this is due to a <UNK> <UNK> and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines also some actors have difficulties with timing br br most <UNK> written characters are the twins <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and heather <UNK> but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show on the other hand the characters i find most uninteresting are the main character ethan and the used to be couple <UNK> and nicole br br what bothers me with the series is that the only latino character aaron is being picked on for his accent even though by a non respectable character but anyway
<START> this 1991 nbc tv movie aired six months before john <UNK> big screen version of the life of babe ruth came out for my money there is no comparison between the two the tv production isn't perfect but it presents the <UNK> story with more depth and complexity than <UNK> one dimensional telling i especially enjoyed the film's depiction of the complex love hate relationship ruth had with <UNK> manager miller <UNK> who always understood his star <UNK> brilliance and also kept trying to point out why <UNK> own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players the tv movie rightly notes how ruth never <UNK> his dream of managing the <UNK> because of his flaws while the horrible goodman version tries to push the <UNK> that ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking br br this film makes a great companion piece to eight men out since the story starts with <UNK> arrival in new york in <UNK> one year after the black sox scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin indeed the continuity between the two films is even <UNK> with john anderson <UNK> his eight men out role as <UNK> <UNK> mountain <UNK>
<START> i usually enjoy loretta <UNK> early movies her acting back then was light and <UNK> and she sure knew how to wear clothes but this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny supporting turn by glenda farrell young is a <UNK> girl who talks her writer husband paul lukas into becoming a championship bridge player it's not the most cinematic of games and the long talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the film br br there's one interesting bit though as lukas and <UNK> <UNK> start their climactic game a series of quick shots show <UNK> trains football games even a diver in mid air <UNK> in anticipation of the event it's the earliest use of a freeze frame i've seen in an american film wish the rest of it were that inventive and funny
<START> this has the absolute worst performance from robert <UNK> who sounds just like william <UNK> throughout the entire film his hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest i'm not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or <UNK> but it's the only thing i can recall from a truly forgettable film this picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do thank god duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a <UNK> accent he is a good character actor but that's about it <UNK> is so much better his performance is muted and noteworthy
<START> it really <UNK> my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there this is by far not one of the worst out there still not a good movie but not the worst nonetheless go see something like death nurse or blood lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the night brings charlie is the worst the film has decent camera work and editing which is way more than i can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films br br the film doesn't deliver on the on screen deaths there's one death where you see his <UNK> saw rip into a neck but all other deaths are hardly interesting but the lack of on screen graphic violence doesn't mean this isn't a slasher film just a bad one br br the film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously the film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements done in a tongue in cheek way for example after a kill charlie goes to the town's <UNK> sign and marks the population down one less this is something that can only get a laugh br br if you're into slasher films definitely give this film a watch it is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers but not by much the comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious you may forget the movie you may remember it i'll remember it because i love the name
<START> loved it what's not to like you got your <UNK> you got your zombies you got your family issues you got your social <UNK> you got yourself one fine retro 1950's style flesh eating under class held at bay by an uneasy worried about whether they're the next meal upper <UNK> you couldn't ask for more br br cast is superb carrie ann moss is absolute perfection as a <UNK> social climbing housewife she's both <UNK> and criminally <UNK> every <UNK> dream <UNK> is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence and somehow <UNK> he's a genuine screen presence very <UNK> and natural without <UNK> them all the rest of the cast is wonderful henry <UNK> plays a suspicious policeman with <UNK> instincts and little <UNK> as if it's his everyday persona billy connolly is delightful as fido a fine actor i wish that he had played the title role in braveheart with gibson directing my sense is that his william wallace would have been closer to the actual character his fido is contained yet accessible a nice touch br br in short a great and marvelous <UNK> poke at morals values social <UNK> feelings growth <UNK> in uncertain times and <UNK> <UNK> to impossible conditions a true reality show
<START> i attended one of the <UNK> last night and have the following observations br br 1 just because you've directed a ton of music videos does not make you <UNK> to make movies the movie had an <UNK> of lingering shots that made no sense horrible angles and terrible lighting the editing didn't help this mess at all when <UNK> shows up late for the <UNK> service her mother remarks about her hand but it's never clear what the heck she's talking about br br 2 the plot had promise but the script was thin and full of ford truck sized holes we never get to understand what drives the characters what's really behind the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how they resolve them sixteen years of distance is wiped out in 4 days seemingly by magic the deep conversations were marred by stupid clichés in fact the whole town was one big cliché of southern life half the audience <UNK> when toby <UNK> ya got my blood <UNK> through your <UNK> <UNK> and we were treated to that insipid line not once but twice the revelations were yawn inducing and the dramatic <UNK> boiled down to i was stupid and stubborn br br 3 the acting was okay considering the wreck of a script they had to work with toby was dark and brooding most of the film but when he <UNK> and <UNK> up he was charming it's a shame he didn't have more screen time like that kelly <UNK> acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows lindsay <UNK> is talented and it's certainly not her fault the writers made her character so unlikeable in the beginning that you don't blame her father for not coming to look for her burt reynolds and tess <UNK> were able to make more of this movie but still looked more or less lost and indeed their characters get lost in this film br br 4 if you're a toby fan you'll love the songs but often the movie felt like a scene was forced in just so they could feature one of his songs or the artists on his record label for instance the movie's official love song is crash here tonight you'd think that would play around a tender love scene but nope we hear about 45 seconds of it as he's heading to a <UNK> service it was as if they said well we gotta use this song somewhere the song broken is haunting and the best thing to come out of this movie br br in summary a promising plot never fully develops and the movie is horribly uneven as it <UNK> tries to be a vehicle for toby <UNK> music and product placement for ford <UNK> it goes from being about people <UNK> broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this <UNK> music video i like toby and really wanted to like broken bridges but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where
<START> it was supposed to be the last freddy movie and it was for over 10 years you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done but they turned out giving us the worst of the series and that's saying a lot the plot made no sense i seriously can't remember it all the main characters were idiots you really wanted them dead and freddy's <UNK> were even worse than usual the only remotely good bit about this was a brief and funny cameo by johnny <UNK> the first nightmare movie was his first br br also i originally saw it in a theatre were the last section <UNK> freddy's childhood was in 3 d well the 3 d was lousy faded colors and the image going in and out of focus also the three flying <UNK> which were supposed to be scary i think had the opposite reaction from my audience everybody broke down laughing looks even worse on tv in 2 d pointless and stupid very dull also skip this one and see freddy vs jason again
<START> this is a poor film by any standard the story in match point had a certain intrigue and the direction and writing a certain fascination woody allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic english murder and exploring what can be done with it br br scoop however has none of this it is poorly written the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all the genre that it spoofs requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and tie ups why are <UNK> cards and keys kept under french <UNK> in locked rooms br br allen's delightful and witty versions of various hollywood genres curse of the <UNK> <UNK> purple rose of <UNK> etc have given us so much pleasure over the years even hollywood ending had a great central idea sadly his inspiration has deserted him this time
<START> for years we've been watching every horror film that comes out from the dull hollywood <UNK> like saw 2 to awful indie releases that are completely <UNK> we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like dark remains br br we managed to catch a screening of this film at <UNK> 2005 the audience loved it and i believe it ended up winning the award for the best film br br while it may not have the budget or star power of studio films it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category the acting and cinematography are top notch but it's the direction that makes this film worth the view the story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares br br the editing and visual fx are also top notch and while many horror films don't manage to use music to their benefit the score for dark remains only adds to it's creepiness br br i know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals but none have been near me so i can't wait to hear when it'll finally be coming out on dvd trust me even if you're sick of the current state of horror films give this one a try you won't regret it
<START> this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn while flynn is of course best known for his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to throw in a couple of high <UNK> european terms this film gives him an opportunity to stretch albeit only slightly as an actor as he plays an <UNK> social <UNK> with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match the supporting cast is excellent everyone seems well chosen for their roles br br the story moves <UNK> and while not particularly profound it misses perhaps intentionally the opportunity to render social commentary on the <UNK> uneven distribution of <UNK> during that time it certainly entertains and <UNK> from what i know of jim corbett the story is also reasonably faithful to history i also really liked the great depictions of <UNK> san francisco all in all there's little not to like about this film very well worth the time to watch it
<START> i recorded this ages ago but only got round to watching it today i have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch i am so glad i saw it and which i could <UNK> my memory and watch i again for the first time this movie is so wonderful it reminded me very much of fried green tomatoes at the <UNK> <UNK> br br the story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are some people have said this is a kids movie i disagree it may be made by disney and many characters are children but i am 23 and i loved it there were moments when my spine <UNK> the story is unlike any other film these days full of adventure i have just ordered the book from amazon can't wait
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen i saw it at the premiere at <UNK> and was extremely disappointed the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere this is a drama but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was that's never a good sign the only saving <UNK> were dominic <UNK> and jason leonard as <UNK> roommates <UNK> they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself <UNK> too seriously the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd the soundtrack was excellent however and was probably the best part of the movie unless you're one of those crazy <UNK> dominic <UNK> fans don't bother with this one
<START> this can't be mandy <UNK> last film somebody do something br br <UNK> br br what little life this one might have had the directing finished off don't blame the cast they did ok even the <UNK> younger brother was pretty well done and he didn't even get into the movie until halfway through and please please put mandy in some more movies she's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age <UNK> <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> br br two specific criticisms in case anyone cares apparently nobody liked this movie very much first the way <UNK> kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment in order to see whatever she was supposed to see and never got seen in return was very annoying hollywood please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives it's dumb write better scripts so you won't have to use that lame plot device any more if your script isn't good enough to stand up without that then don't produce it br br second carmen wouldn't have fallen for that fake injury trick that <UNK> pulled she already had <UNK> <UNK> more bad writing directing there br br i could trash this movie further but mercy <UNK> it actually i didn't hate it as much as the others seem to have it just didn't have much of a reason for being made unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely mandy oh and to whoever didn't think she was sexy the character wasn't very well written but how can you say she wasn't sexy one or the other of us needs glasses and i don't think it's me br br more mandy not to be confused with moore mandy although i'd like to see her again too br br p s did i mention i hope mandy makes me more movies d
<START> the goofy <UNK> win the t v game show pig in a poke grand prize and all fly off together to europe where they manage to cause one stupid disaster after another of all the ridiculous unfunny money spinning sequels this one beats the lot harold <UNK> 1983 film was a below average <UNK> in which the <UNK> family went on a nightmarish vacation across the states this time amy <UNK> look who's talking <UNK> what turns out to be a disastrous comedy which will annoy you more than it will make you laugh br br hughes script with rob <UNK> is awful and you wonder why the likes of chevy chase and beverly <UNK> bothered with such a dead beat project as even anthony michael hall and <UNK> <UNK> had the sense to decline the offer even an <UNK> michael <UNK> is unable to lift proceedings to any level that one could call entertaining br br yet as <UNK> as it may seem european vacation was successful enough to warrant a second sequel surely it couldn't be as unbearable as this one you know i have yet to see a national lampoon show that was worth the bother br br monday december 26 1994 t v
<START> yes the plot is hardly plausible and very thin yes the acting does range from average to laughable yes it has been done so many times before however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing i urge everyone to watch this film with an <UNK> eye and see it for what it set out to be a scary funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none
<START> i have only seen gretchen mol in two other films girl 6 <UNK> <UNK> and don't really remember her but she did a great job as a naive girl who <UNK> for pictures because it made people happy br br she really didn't think what she was doing was wrong even when she left the business and found her religion again br br the photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited and politicians <UNK> on the <UNK> of pornography david <UNK> good night and good luck played a super part here br br mary harron american psycho wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous <UNK> girl ever
<START> the message of a world on the brink of war is <UNK> by the masses the mythical city of <UNK> in 1940 represents england in general but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world when war finally does arrive it's <UNK> continue not for another five years but until 1966 at which time <UNK> is completely destroyed adding to the <UNK> and <UNK> on humanity is the wandering sickness a <UNK> that continues for another four years br br things to come <UNK> both a <UNK> and futuristic world view where science holds out a hope for a <UNK> civilization the wings over the world concept plays out a bit corny though it's <UNK> <UNK> raymond massey is <UNK> in his mission and dedicated to his cause if he fails others will follow this message is continually <UNK> throughout the film brought home convincingly in <UNK> end of movie speech man's <UNK> need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an all the universe or nothing mindset br br the film's imagery of <UNK> and <UNK> in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film metropolis as <UNK> is <UNK> and transformed by the year <UNK> the spectacle of the city's <UNK> strikes a <UNK> <UNK> as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's <UNK> <UNK> vision is coming to <UNK> where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon but in 1936 a hundred year <UNK> probably seemed more legitimate than 1969 br br things to come is one of those <UNK> in film a picture that makes you think which side will you come down on the forces for <UNK> in the face of <UNK> or maintain the status <UNK> it's not a comfortable question as both choices offer inherent dangers and <UNK> <UNK> those who choose to be <UNK> risk being swept away by forces beyond their control
<START> phantasm class phantasm ii awesome phantasm iii <UNK> terrible br br even though i would love to stick up for this film i quite simply can't the movie seems to have sold out first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start something the others did not also too many pointless characters prime examples the kid who is a crack shot funny initially but soon you want him dead the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls <UNK> not gonna work or rather shouldn't and the <UNK> zombies what the hell are they doing there there no link to them in the other <UNK> also there is a severe lack of <UNK> running about br br the only good bits are the cracking start and of course <UNK> b br br possible spoiler coming up br br to me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in iv br br overall very very disappointing 3 10
<START> i love science fiction i am fascinated by egyptian mythology and i appreciate digital animation i figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable i could not have been more wrong the story or actually the lack there of was completely uninspired and lacks imagination while imagination usually is the biggest <UNK> of any science fiction story the dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie especially thomas <UNK> gives new meaning to the term <UNK> <UNK> bad acting wouldn't have been such a huge problem if only <UNK> <UNK> didn't take himself so seriously all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic it looks like <UNK> really thinks he has made a piece of art here well there's no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk only <UNK> this man should really stick to making comics since he fails on all possible accounts as a director worst of all is the terrible digital animation which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience the graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in <UNK> <UNK> look like live actors and since half the characters are cgi animated it is quite a problem that the cgi effects look so fake if the egyptian gods actually exist then <UNK> a dead guy since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this <UNK> bad movie
<START> i am a huge fan of david lynch this film however was a quite disappointing experience apart from the <UNK> background music  which really sets the mood of the film  it lacks almost all the qualities that i've come to associate with lynch's work the visuals are dull to say the least and the dialog is to vague and <UNK> to be of any interest br br this feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director i've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera work scenery sound and script this film lacks almost all artistic qualities i feel as though i'm watching one of <UNK> home videos produced during a weekend trip with some friends
<START> another movie to suffer without an adventure to run no <UNK> to solve just an illness man acting like an animal no a good reason to take this journey pitt and lewis are great actors magnificent michelle forbes but a weak david duchovny performance
<START> this movie was so bad outdated and stupid that i had rough times to watch it to the end i had seen this rodney guy in natural born killers and i thought he was funny as hell in it but this movie was crap the jokes weren't funny actors weren't funny anything about it wasn't even remotely funny don't waste your time for this only positive things about this were the beautiful wives and molly shannon who i'm sure tried her best but the script was just too awful that's why i rated it 2 instead of 1 but it's definitely one of the worst films i've ever seen
<START> an imagination is a terrible thing to waste especially when you have talented actors writer director jones wastes no time in <UNK> the viewer with his protagonist br br anyone who has shared an apartment with a <UNK> will be crying with laughter anyone who has arrived while a <UNK> maid places a ticket on your <UNK> will just plain cry we've all wanted to rip a terrible <UNK> off a man's head these are only snippets of what's in store when watching cross eyed a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for jones and his <UNK> sense of humor both in front and behind the camera
<START> this movie features charlie <UNK> dancing in a strip club beyond that it features a truly bad script with dull unrealistic dialogue that it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking
<START> this is a so called <UNK> <UNK> movies however it made me sad in a way why because i had the talent but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy as well the fact that at the age of 12 i decided to quit soccer br br and soccer is the red line in this movie together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have an english indian girl and her parents with their traditions and strong family ties and on the other hand the english family with a <UNK> who dresses like a boy and plays soccer a combination which <UNK> her mother this movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people as well as the indian community in england it is about believe in your dreams and live your one life where did we hear that before br br <UNK> <UNK> a beautiful women plays <UNK> a girl who is not interested in boys new clothes make up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff in <UNK> with her sister <UNK> complete the opposite of <UNK> br br a real must it is to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents and finds her luck eventually with great music from <UNK> curtis <UNK> texas <UNK> c as well as indian hit songs br br pleasant to watch but if you as myself ever played soccer and never made it to the top then this movie will make you <UNK>
<START> this tim burton remake of the original planet of the apes from 1968 and starring <UNK> heston is a far far cry from the quality and plot of the original br br certainly special effects have improved since 1968 but writing has not the characters were boring and the dialog was awful i sat through the entire film with a friend who thankfully only rented it and completely understood why before christmas all of the planet of the apes toys at target were in the <UNK> bin br br my advice to tim burton don't put this on your resume br br my advice to everyone else watch the original 1968 planet of the apes movie
<START> over the years we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what keeping 8 simple rules going after john ritter died comes to mind but this is probably the first time i cared the idea of having that 70's show without eric or to a lesser extent <UNK> is ridiculous they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore it just didn't really connect it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny the last season felt like the season too much for every single character simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be <UNK> in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were focusing on the gimmick that is <UNK> was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working because the whole deal was that he'd say something weird from out of nowhere and you can't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours they also brought in the standard cousin oliver only this time it just wasn't a kid whenever you heard somebody knock on the door you started praying it wasn't randy please let it not be randy the deal with randy was that he'd do really awful jokes usually as red would say smiling like an ass and totally <UNK> up delivery and donna would be in <UNK> i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused the problems had started earlier though what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera everybody started being in love with everybody emotional scenes were dragged out at <UNK> with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to <UNK> attention that we were watching as the world turns i'm guessing this was character development but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from family matters to be fair the last episode also because it had a cameo by <UNK> grace a cameo in his own show was really good even if not that funny either br br by the way yet more criticism on season 8 what the hell was with the opening theme not only did they use the same joke twice a character not singing <UNK> scared the hell out of me dude don't open your eyes that far but the first five seasons or so among the best comedy ever broadcast
<START> the movie had so much potential but due to 70's technology constraints and also a weak script killed the main plot of the film the book version of the film was much better and well conceived if it had been done right in the beginning with sources from the book it could have been a very cool classic
<START> an average tv movie quality totally formula story of religious fanatic ron <UNK> who gives good i'm not just the president of <UNK> r us ' i'm also a client who gets control of a <UNK> virus think the virus from the movie the rock too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an <UNK> with bank robbers and the government agents trying to stop him led by the <UNK> <UNK> mildly entertaining wolf <UNK> backed by fred <UNK> along with the standard in the wrong place at the wrong time <UNK> female the forever bland erika <UNK> and lived as a <UNK> but died as a hero at the last minute male brandon <UNK> has the standard background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic wife and son killed in a police raid a few years previous br br basically a decent rainy day movie br br favorite line spoken by ron <UNK> after he finds the <UNK> of the virus hidden in erika <UNK> <UNK> a woman and her mystery br br worth a rent
<START> it's often said that tobe hooper just struck lucky with his grisly 1974 horror film 'the texas chain saw <UNK> and every time i see another hooper film that view is only <UNK> it would seem that hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as <UNK> and <UNK> in 1990 and so we end up with spontaneous <UNK> a film with a couple of good ideas and a whole load more that are borrowed from other films put it all together and you get a messy boring film that most people would do well to miss the film leads the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focuses on some experiments carried out on two young people in the fifties the couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death as a result of the experiments done on them fast forward some years and the baby is now an adult named sam but naturally he's not a normal person and soon finds when it's discovered that he has the ability to set things on fire at will br br the film stars brad <UNK> who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with child's play two years earlier but actually was an uninspired decision as the central performance is really terrible and not helped by the terrible supporting performances the turgid direction and dull script also don't do the film many <UNK> and the trend of lacking in <UNK> is continued by the special effects which are very unrealistic and have nothing on the films that this one is ripping off all of which were made some years earlier the plot is really slow and it's almost an hour before anything of note happens and i didn't care for it even then it soon becomes obvious which direction the film will go in and it all <UNK> down to the sort of tedious ending you would expect the final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the film not that any revelation would have been interesting anyway overall this is a rubbish film and another reason why tobe hooper is a long way from being a great horror director see <UNK> again instead
<START> i find myself comparing all stand up acts to this one performance now even older recorded performances i once thought were funny just don't seem as funny after seeing eddie izzard in this award winning look at history language <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a terrible storyline <UNK> at his worst pointless and self conscious <UNK> obvious shock tactics and <UNK> acting make this film rather like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> everything that went wrong with the much <UNK> british film revival the humour is at best limp and the <UNK> of the whole set up including some kind of internet terrorist group <UNK> how contemporary really begins to <UNK> br br final summary a half baked attempt to be <UNK> that does no one any <UNK> still it's always a pleasure to see <UNK> <UNK> on screen br br
<START> this was on the <UNK> <UNK> dvd for blazing <UNK> itself brilliant but not this nowhere did i see mel <UNK> name on here and i can guess why he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot my <UNK> who would find this funny sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny well cause it's simply not funny it's like the writers didn't even try to be funny just to cash in on being tied with blazing <UNK> did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot flat out they didn't care it was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out i guess it's useful for historical purposes only or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative hollywood writers can be
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the dick tracy persona this is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story if you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old dick tracy b w movies then you're sure to get a kick out of this rendition the <UNK> colors and larger than life characters rendered in a <UNK> authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as it's meant to be i personally find <UNK> musical element to be a major part of this film the cd featuring her music from this movie is one i've listened to often over the years it's just so well done and performed <UNK> and tuned to that era in my mind <UNK> finest moment both on screen but especially <UNK> this is sure to bring out the kid in you
<START> i saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources i would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this film br br i am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really <UNK> with any of the roles br br for the political <UNK> and those interested in corruption in other world <UNK> out there this film is probably quite good but to the average movie watcher this film is awkward very boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entrance <UNK> br br see it if your ready to focus 100 on every minute detail or politics interest you don't see it if you actually like watching films
<START> well the movie isn't exactly funny br br okay i admit there are a few humorous lines but definitely nothing that is laugh out loud funny for example right before a steamy sex scene between <UNK> and one of her male <UNK> sh is <UNK> to the <UNK> and he cannot remove her shirt before leaving the room to retrieve the key he tells her okay don't go anywhere br br see humorous but not funny br br the plot and acting are pretty good br br but erika <UNK> definitely steals the show she's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can't help but <UNK> and re watch br br there are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines br br overall 5 stars i'd only give it three if not for erika <UNK>
<START> wow i loved this film it may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch the tale revolves around this one family from <UNK> and it's the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch the main lead <UNK> <UNK> plays his part very well at no time does he leave you to believe that he's acting all his feelings it's his brother <UNK> <UNK> who stole the show for me though when the two were in scenes together they <UNK> their lines off of each other giving fantastic performances great cast great film
<START> i'm really surprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on imdb it's one of those movies that could easily get by someone but for romantic comedy moonstruck is really in a class by itself it's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie few movies in the 1980's were as good as moonstruck and it's funny too out of
<START> this movie is a re write of the 1978 warren beatty movie heaven can wait but it is written for the stand up comedic style of mr rock the premise remains the same lance barton rock is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with god's representative mr king to come back to earth as someone else as in <UNK> movie he chooses the murdered charles <UNK> a rich white man all because he <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> king who happens to turn up at <UNK> house during the murder the role of mrs <UNK> and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo <UNK> simply does not work also the <UNK> used to show rock as <UNK> and then as the real <UNK> <UNK> fail miserably <UNK> could have been made to the original beatty plot which in itself did not masterfully portray the life after death idea but they certainly were not to be found in down to earth
<START> i couldn't believe some of the horrible dialog coming out of people's mouths and the end reel of <UNK> attached to body of the film was a real hoot and we get <UNK> shots of <UNK> <UNK> sort of and loren <UNK> to boot br br a <UNK> device <UNK> by psychic <UNK> <UNK> brings an alien <UNK> to an underground lab out in the desert according to director fred <UNK> ray they were <UNK> sets from the <UNK> kinski film <UNK> which gives the film an <UNK> value beyond how cheap it looks br br inside the <UNK> is a midget alien played by <UNK> son who starts <UNK> people to death it was pretty funny watching this little <UNK> in a black <UNK> suit with what looks like large beetle <UNK> attached to it running around in the dark we even get to see the little thing <UNK> and tear at a poster of et which i thought was hilarious br br and then there's what looks like a snake that also comes out of the <UNK> that gets <UNK> to death by william fair after the mini creature <UNK> into frank <UNK> neck in the kitchen a low budget take on alien i suppose br br the whole thing ends abruptly looking like they ran out of film at the end before the <UNK> reel comes in with the end credits talk about a lack of funding br br fred <UNK> ray also mentions in the director's commentary that they also weren't sure if <UNK> ray would make through the shooting and remember his lines he barely did br br low budget cheese <UNK> it's fun to watch i'll grant ya that br br 4 out of 10
<START> a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread br br i was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it mandatory or <UNK> br br i think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so <UNK> br br the global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to do right it appeals particularly to more liberal <UNK> people because it doesn't have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets <UNK> who want to force you to be good going br br and that's the problem with the film al gore is a politician and a very successful one at that he just can't help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would the political appeal is just too great br br and there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body <UNK> with a <UNK> to force other to do right br br another interesting question is how did the <UNK> movement get <UNK> by such people
<START> spoilers br br i wasn't sure what to think of the movie not too much of a kids film <UNK> should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it br br i was a bit disappointed by the <UNK> minutes of time we had even less without the credits and the trailer gets you to think the <UNK> is a main creature but alas they torture him right until the end of the movie those two <UNK> <UNK> the movie 2 stars but i do recommend the movie even for a sequel br br 8 10 br br quality 9 10 entertainment 7 10 <UNK> 7 10
<START> this isn't among jimmy stewart's best films i'm quick to admit that however while some view his film as pure propaganda i'm wondering what's so wrong with that yes sure like the tv show the fbi this is an obvious case of the <UNK> doing some <UNK> work to try to drum up support but as entertainment goes it does a good job plus surprisingly enough for the time it was made the film focuses more on crime than espionage and <UNK> instead it's a <UNK> of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose now considering the agent is played by jimmy stewart then it's pretty certain the acting and writing were good as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who wasn't about to waste the star in a third rate flick so overall it's worth seeing but not especially great
<START> ok first of all ignore the last <UNK> review they admit to falling asleep through it so it's no wonder they didn't understand what was going on as thriller horrors go this film ain't too bad it is certainly very watchable right from the opening scenes you get a general idea exactly what is going to be the cause of all the <UNK> that follows and come the end you are proved right with everything being made clear br br i enjoyed this movie it was quite eerie at times and as old films go it was passable great to watch late at night i give it a generous 7 out of 10
<START> i waited until the 4th of july to write this because well because it just feels right to be doing it on this day br br in <UNK> d w griffith needed a hit he had not had a big one since <UNK> of the storm <UNK> he'd been working <UNK> since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right <UNK> with audiences he was planning a film about patrick henry when he was <UNK> by members of the daughters of the american revolution <UNK> who asked if he might expand his ideas to <UNK> more of the american revolution this movie is the result by the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasn't a trace of patrick henry anywhere br br we all know the story of the revolutionary war but griffith threw in a love story with <UNK> farmer nathan neil hamilton falling in love with <UNK> aristocrat nancy <UNK> carol <UNK> a leading lady for griffith for many years <UNK> matters is the fact that <UNK> father hates nathan well not just nathan he hates all rebels it does not help matters when during a <UNK> on the streets of <UNK> someone <UNK> <UNK> arm causing him to <UNK> his gun and accidentally wound <UNK> dad br br <UNK> the love story is the mostly true but partially <UNK> story of capt walter butler lionel barrymore a <UNK> british officer who feels he owes <UNK> to no one with thousands of indians form the six nations on his side he hopes to crush the <UNK> and become <UNK> of his own empire br br comparisons with birth of a nation <UNK> are inevitable the <UNK> family might just as well be the <UNK> from the earlier film while nathan could be a part of the <UNK> family the sequence of the battle of <UNK> hill is staged very similarly to a scene in birth of a nation with the attacking army in this case the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> packed with <UNK> the only thing missing is henry <UNK> <UNK> across no man's land to stuff a flag into the <UNK> of a cannon amazingly enough the battle scenes in america seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in birth and fail to draw the audience in something is clearly missing it isn't scope g w billy <UNK> camera work is quite good maybe what is missing is dare i say it sincerity br br the brutality of capt butler and his men is well <UNK> although much of it happens in long shot or <UNK> don't expect any heads to be <UNK> off in <UNK> like we saw in <UNK> <UNK> in one scene <UNK> second in command capt <UNK> louis <UNK> <UNK> out the eyes of a captive <UNK> we see only the beginning of the deed for the remainder the camera focuses on <UNK> face as he obviously has a good time doing this lionel had been working with griffith on and off since <UNK> a story goes that he approached griffith for work and d w knowing the reputation of his famous family said i am not hiring stage actors to which lionel <UNK> and i am nothing of the kind sir he makes a very good and quite believable villain louis <UNK> appeared with <UNK> older brother john three times in sherlock holmes and dr <UNK> and mr hyde both <UNK> and later in the <UNK> <UNK> as capt <UNK> his wild staring eyes and <UNK> hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad also br br neil hamilton later <UNK> that america was his first time on <UNK> and i was scared to death he hides his <UNK> very well though and we can believe he was quite the <UNK> by the time shooting was over mr griffith was very much in love with carol <UNK> and at one point asked her to marry him she refused and soon left his stock company after which her star status gradually <UNK> br br speaking of horses one accidentally amusing moment which had to be <UNK> came during the depiction of paul <UNK> ride he rides his horse right up on the front <UNK> of a family to <UNK> to arms the <UNK> are coming but as he tries to leave the horse cannot <UNK> the steps backwards and stumbles <UNK> his rider on the ground i am amazed griffith did not do another take br br so is america a classic yes don't wait for july 4th to see it it is enjoyable anytime
<START> disney has now made straight to video sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features two of these were made for their 1991 classic beauty and the beast well these ones aren't really sequels as they are both set in between the events of the first film the first of these two straight to video films was beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor but i think that can usually be expected with sequels however this second one <UNK> magical world is definitely inferior br br the film features three short stories all of which take place while belle is in the castle and the place is under the spell of the <UNK> the first is the perfect word where a <UNK> at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble and neither wants to be the first to apologize the next story is <UNK> <UNK> where <UNK> and <UNK> fifth <UNK> is coming up and <UNK> is <UNK> so belle helps him however <UNK> sees <UNK> practicing romance with belle and thinks they're actually in love the film ends with the broken wing in this story belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out as he hates birds br br the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disney's third beauty and the beast movie apparently in the dvd version there is another story added called mrs <UNK> party but i've only seen the original version however since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest i see no point in watching the special edition anyway the first thing i will say about <UNK> magical world is that the animation is very 2 dimensional compared to what we're used to from disney which would obviously disappoint many people i didn't like beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas that much but you certainly can't say the same about its animation i'm sure the stories in <UNK> magical world could entertain many kids mostly younger ones i think and each story has a moral so they could also teach them some valuable lessons however for adults the film really doesn't have a lot i personally didn't find any good humour in it found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got <UNK> and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way they're not very well written in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast you're acting rude and foolish is a bit cheesy and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories br br by the time this straight to video movie first came out i was around eleven or twelve years old i don't know what i would have thought of it at the time as i had lost interest in disney by then and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back even when this movie was first released i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at i never saw beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago but unlike that film i never even heard of this one until recently i think just after seeing the first sequel to disney's 1991 hit well as much as i like the theatrical original i wouldn't have been missing much if i never became aware of this film's existence for little kids i'm sure <UNK> magical world can be highly entertaining and probably somewhat educational with its morals but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans
<START> the only thing about this film that <UNK> me out is that the dvd is so expensive it's too much for my budget at the moment or i would purchase it because the film is a good example of film noir and i enjoy watching richard widmark jean peters and thelma ritter br br <UNK> produces great dvds but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much that's the case here for an 80 minute black and white <UNK> sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary cinematography wise br br the story is the story here as opposed to visuals actors sound sets etc as a <UNK> widmark inadvertently winds up with espionage <UNK> in his possession after <UNK> <UNK> purse say that three times everyone but peters is a believable character in this movie widmark the cops the u s agents and the <UNK> and especially ritter as moe an <UNK> she and widmark are the stars of this film br br peters does a decent job of playing the cheap <UNK> but loses her credibility early on by falling in love with widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her only in world of film too bad because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it br br this an average film noir which means good but not great and certainly not worth <UNK> at a price of 25 35 for that price one could do a lot better in the film noir market
<START> just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong take mike myers for example he's reached the point where you realize that his <UNK> hasn't changed since his snl days over ten years ago he's doing the same <UNK> stream of consciousness jokes and the same voices his cat is painfully unfunny he tries way to hard he's some weird type a comedian not the cool cat he's supposed to be the rest of the movie is just as bad the sets are unbelievably ugly and clearly a waste of millions of dollars cardboard cut outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than <UNK> an entire neighborhood and main street alec <UNK> tries to do a funny great <UNK> impression but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent there's even an <UNK> <UNK> moment with faux celebrity paris hilton that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr seuss story avoid this movie at all costs folks it's not even an interesting train wreck i hope they'll make <UNK> hears a who with robin williams then we'll have the bad seuss movie starring <UNK> comedian trilogy
<START> kay <UNK> the man behind this movie is a real great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways he has written a bunch of good and well written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul happy the message in most of his books and this movie is about that your thoughts in fact is what causes your problems and that the reason of your anger hardly ever is caused of what you think of the main message is that you can choose to be happy but hardly ever do that br br to watch this movie and learn something very important on life you have to keep your mind very open and l i s t e n to all the hidden messages or <UNK> to get through life which most of the parts in this movie contains if you listen and watch watch it with your ears br br you won't learn the meaning of life but you'll learn how to live and get the most out of it br br so while watching please keep in mind br br the mind is like a <UNK> it doesn't work unless it's open
<START> i was about 7 when this dire monstrosity of a film was released in the uk it was advertised on the tv in the summer of 1977 for weeks as if it were some incredible blockbuster film it was actually the first film i ever saw at a cinema and i was put off going for years to come the following week i was invited to go and see the new film star wars and i <UNK> to this day i have never seen it in protest at having to watch sasquatch seriously even at the age of 7 i could tell that i was watching garbage it's just so bad it's almost unbelievable rambling nonsense that should never have made it to a cinema i was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again just as well as far as i'm concerned avoid at all costs
<START> pop <UNK> you're a part of the modern armed forces in <UNK> on routine <UNK> and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history what do you do well if you're a hollywood studio you change the japanese g i s in g i samurai aka <UNK> to the crew of an american aircraft <UNK> have them debate stopping the attack on pearl <UNK> for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final <UNK> this sees its premise through thrown back 400 years into the japanese <UNK> wars its <UNK> soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a <UNK> to <UNK> the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs samurai action including a very impressive <UNK> 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands <UNK> serious damage on each other and yes there are <UNK> br br of course things don't go as planned and even superior <UNK> doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers even before that the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and <UNK> for the hell of it <UNK> directed and surprisingly well thought through the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction especially when they feature english lyrics sung by japanese singers who <UNK> can't <UNK> the words let alone speak the language but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci fi <UNK> br br <UNK> uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut <UNK> minute version
<START> all hype what better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their film through a mainstream <UNK> consequently they do it themselves otherwise the hype of the film doesn't justify the content in the film the story is absent and could easily be a short the acting is poor but the animation and music is pretty good otherwise don't waste your time don't believe the hype however if you have the chance to see the film for free do so then you won't have to waste money still the filmmakers do a good job of <UNK> their story and creating <UNK> with their self indulgent mini series otherwise they're one hit wonders who never had a hit
<START> in the <UNK> <UNK> of the future mankind is <UNK> by <UNK> with human <UNK> have discovered a new source of fuel human blood <UNK> by their vicious leader <UNK> lance <UNK> the <UNK> prepare to <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> populated human <UNK> br br only one force can stop <UNK> death <UNK> cyborg gabriel kris kristofferson who is <UNK> to destroy <UNK> and his army br br in the ruins of a <UNK> village gabriel finds <UNK> kathy long a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by <UNK> ten years earlier now she wants revenge they strike a <UNK> gabriel will train <UNK> how to fight the <UNK> and <UNK> will lead gabriel to <UNK> br br five time kick boxing champion kathy long has all the right moves in this high speed adventure that delivers plenty of action also stars gary daniels as david and scott <UNK> as simon
<START> in the first howling we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized the plot in that film made some sense a tv reporter <UNK> this and attempts to <UNK> the truth she ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one then she shows the world that they do exist by <UNK> on live tv the special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they don't get any better in this one whether it's the <UNK> or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the <UNK> br br the plot line isn't all that bad they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason this won't destroy all werewolves and it really doesn't end the threat from werewolves as it they just want to kill her i think there was some <UNK> reason for this but it really gets lost in the film br br after the film ends we have a 10 minute <UNK> of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some <UNK> esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves br br the only thing that makes this movie even watchable is christopher lee
<START> there are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie's trailer i am trying to be balanced in my review because i strongly support local movies but i can't help but support the <UNK> against this movie it is slow boring and <UNK> on pointless even the almost nice and believable moments were immediately <UNK> by painful clichés and bad acting <UNK> lopez and wong li lin whom i usually love were only passable in this movie it felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic tv soap then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen the leap years should come with an <UNK> rating rated awful but it hasn't changed my faith in local movies more good films will come so long as more films like these don't get made
<START> i actually quite enjoyed this show even as a <UNK> i was interested in all sports and that included horse racing it was always going to be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get <UNK> from the race tracks to record filming about this controversial subject one episode i particularly remember <UNK> around a horse expected to win a big race that looked a bit off colour a <UNK> was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it had been drugged but nothing showed up in the blood <UNK> all too late they realised the horse <UNK> been <UNK> but had had its <UNK> <UNK> removed like running a car with no oil and the engine <UNK> up the horse broke down with tragic consequences
<START> felt mine was while watching this but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film not that makes a lot of sense anyway as others have mentioned this was one of <UNK> last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all it's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this <UNK> boris did get off slightly better than poor old bela lugosi but not by much br br boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together the <UNK> background music doesn't help and <UNK> from any <UNK> moment apart from boris the rest of the mexican cast are dubbed into some strange <UNK> english <UNK> that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies br br at a guess i think it's edgar allen <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of poe in the finished article br br still there are far better films out there with boris karloff at his best search them out and give this a wide <UNK> unless you want the curse of the <UNK> <UNK> too
<START> trapped buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened and is soon to close br br we start with a guy in gear blowing up <UNK> to avoid the possibility of <UNK> somehow that doesn't make sense anyways he's about to blow away one particularly big one when he notices the resort is open despite his best efforts higher authority tells him his day is over br br soon as everyone expects an <UNK> hits br br look i'm not gonna reveal any more all i can say is this was a b movie designed for the family channel which i just saw it on and the fact it had no commercials proves it's a b movie anyways it's a pretty decent film but it's partially unreal br br <UNK> when people are buried by ice and snow they're buried not just <UNK> by <UNK> or what about a cd for a <UNK> it's not possible and finally what i can't stress enough is that an explosion cannot stop a <UNK> guaranteed br br furthermore it's worth a rental or a tv viewing but not <UNK> 7 10 br br the movie is rated pg but maybe it should have received something a little more strong a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator but his leg is cut around the <UNK> a guy is <UNK> by electricity and <UNK> and in the weight room dead people are laying around br br enjoy
<START> nightmare weekend is proof positive that some people are so desperate to be <UNK> the <UNK> they are prepared to do almost anything br br i'm not referring to the countless women who seem quite happy to appear completely <UNK> in this dreadful piece of trash after all the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of no i'm talking about those who are more than willing to co star with a badly made hand puppet called george now that is embarrassing br br a bio electronic being created by brilliant scientist edward <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> george who looks like a demented felt clown with green <UNK> for hair is the <UNK> intelligent <UNK> for an advanced computer system that <UNK> a revolutionary device a silver <UNK> about the size of a golf ball that when <UNK> can reverse character <UNK> br br <UNK> personality <UNK> experiments have been successful on lab animals but the <UNK> scientist is reluctant to carry out <UNK> on human subjects <UNK> that there may still be side effects his evil assistant julie debbie <UNK> however has no such <UNK> and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs inevitably they all turn into hideous killer mutants br br with bargain basement special effects a cast totally devoid of talent and a plot that is almost impossible to follow i took notes as i watched the film and even then i am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate nightmare weekend is a complete and utter disaster that not even several soft core sex scenes and a touch of gore can rescue br br this film also features one of the most irritating characters i have ever seen in a horror movie tony bruce <UNK> a <UNK> wearing idiot who <UNK> away to crap 80s music in a manner that makes me look like justin timberlake in comparison
<START> this is one of the most atrocious <UNK> i've ever viewed if they want to make a movie with a lousy story they should <UNK> from giving it a title of a fine book there is hardly a relation between <UNK> book and this movie other than the title i don't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen at least the changes shouldn't hurt the final product the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing the actors are miscast the director and or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or <UNK> an unconvincing <UNK> br br if you've seen this movie and disliked it try the book if you've seen this movie and liked it read the book
<START> back in my days as an <UNK> private lessons played at the 4 <UNK> i was working it was a sleeper hit selling out friday and saturday nights for several weeks i never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend so i decided to give it a shot what i witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies i have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch br br the basic story is a teenage boy <UNK> after his sexy maid sylvia <UNK> she too seems to feel an attraction towards the boy but for more sinister reasons so we get scenes of the boy watching her <UNK> and her <UNK> him in to watch and it goes from there br br eric brown as the teenage boy has to be one of the worst actors i have ever seen his scared reactions to every time sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him are horrible i didn't laugh a single time during this piece of junk br br and let's not get started on the subplot of the maid and <UNK> planning to <UNK> money from the kid let's just say it involves <UNK> a death <UNK> a body i could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous br br the sex scenes are the worst i have ever seen even though eric brown was older then he looked the fact is he looks like a baby it appears he has no idea how to kiss a woman if that was acting then maybe i should re think my criticisms of brown and it just came too close to <UNK> on child pornography to be erotic i have never been so turned off by a sex scene even though miss <UNK> is quite beautiful with and without clothes br br spoiler warning i must make mention of the last scene to me it's just plain sick but i can remember audiences cheering as the film freeze framed and <UNK> into credits our hero returns to school and begins a <UNK> with one of the female teachers he asks her out for dinner and she gives him a look as if tom cruise has just asked her out she <UNK> <UNK> and he walks away smiling at the camera in triumph give me a break yes i am sure teachers all over would just risk everything for a plain looking teenage kid br br i will never understand the appeal this film had in 1982 certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office and to think that these same teenagers that <UNK> that movie 22 years ago are now working their way up corporate <UNK> and possibly helping to run this country that is a scary thought
<START> hey everybody i've got an idea we found this egg shaped <UNK> from outer space so why don't we <UNK> it out and open it up yes i know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do and it could be filled with <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> unknown to earth and could potentially wipe out the human race but hey i want to know what's in it and nobody tell <UNK> they might take it away from us wow this <UNK> gives off <UNK> yes really strong ones on contact so don't touch it but it's okay to cut it open hi there handsome check out my <UNK> later that day do not open uh oh we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we don't have phones or <UNK> or <UNK> even though we have a <UNK> dollars worth of other equipment here i've never seen such <UNK> technology yeah <UNK> take this stick and stab it i'm getting out of here i don't care if i do kill the other 6 billion people on earth <UNK> <UNK> me look it's the friendly aliens from the <UNK> they want us to come with them the end
<START> the internet <UNK> lists this as a tv show and yes it was a series on mtv shown on the <UNK> program after the head and before <UNK> <UNK> if i recall correctly but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes br br you have the story of the <UNK> julie winters sarah and mr gone the <UNK> is a super hero or a bum julie a social worker or a <UNK> queen sarah a girl who should listen to less of the <UNK> and mr gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on and then there's the other weird creatures br br i use or with <UNK> and julie because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams maybe they're all real or dreams maybe one of the characters doesn't exist maybe only one exists and dreams of the others you'll have to wait and find out br br i had the comic books before the show came out and it was one of my favorites the artwork was spectacular and the story was original unlike anything you'll find in superman or batman it will bend your mind and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive and the show used basically the same exact artwork only now it moves and the same story <UNK> that the beauty <UNK> found in the comic would be <UNK> <UNK> this was the best show to appear on <UNK> hands down br br if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip this is a show to check out it's <UNK> <UNK> before there was ever such a thing br br the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series but i don't say this in disappointment by keeping it simple they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the <UNK> brought on by <UNK> failures
<START> i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i <UNK> that they <UNK> false advertising br br it's not enough that the movie itself is a p o s but the cover art is what sold me i've done better make up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art can you say <UNK> eyes br br i'm not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details but come on the movie's main character is an l a cop who was born and raised in <UNK> but has a german accent it's beyond insulting
<START> <UNK> <UNK> are three kids <UNK> of their leader captain <UNK> rope girl and <UNK> <UNK> all with their own <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and outfit and moves they work for the <UNK> kevin and were <UNK> after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game they lead normal lives as well and have family and school duties but most of the action takes place away from school fighting villains the villains all have rather unique and <UNK> traits such as mister vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are but act anyway from an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil and often strange plans to gain power take revenge etc br br the animation itself is quite nice and smooth but the style appears to be simple on purpose the backgrounds have <UNK> colour and the buildings seem futuristic the music is quite nice and the show isn't too bad altogether although the style isn't my favourite br br the plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous but after all this is a cartoon and one can't blame them for that however this would not be in the same rank as <UNK> or pepper ann
<START> many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with the mortal storm or casablanca everyone is entitled to compare films they choose but the similarities of the mortal storm and watch on the <UNK> are clearly the problems of <UNK> threatened by the nazi <UNK> while the main <UNK> point brought out with casablanca is the seeming <UNK> treatment of <UNK> bogart in 1943 by the academy of motion picture arts and science because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar it does not strike me as totally wrong lukas had a good career in film both here and in england he is the villain in the lady <UNK> and this performance was his best one bogart had more great performances in him than rick <UNK> for instance he was ignored for sam spade in the <UNK> <UNK> and roy <UNK> in high <UNK> two years earlier both of which were first rate performances and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c <UNK> in the treasure of <UNK> <UNK> the writer murder suspect in in a lonely place and captain philip francis <UNK> in the caine <UNK> afterward he got it for <UNK> in the african queen i think that <UNK> should have got it for the role of <UNK> but it did not happen but lukas was lucky he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career few can claim that br br to me the film to look at with watch on the <UNK> is based on another play script by <UNK> the searching wind they both look at america's spirit of <UNK> in the 1920s and 1930s the searching wind is really looking at the whole inter war period while watch on the <UNK> set in the years just <UNK> our entry into world war ii deals with a few weeks of time therefore it is better constructed as a play and more meaningful for it's impact br br the film has many good performances led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti nazi fighter <UNK> davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low <UNK> as possible due to lukas being the center of the <UNK> activities <UNK> as the selfish conniving but ultimately foolish and <UNK> <UNK> lucille watson as the mother of davis and <UNK> fitzgerald as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and fed up wife and kurt <UNK> who delivers a devastating critique as the local <UNK> <UNK> chief about <UNK> and others who would deal with the nazis it has dialog with bite in it and what it says is quite true it also has moments of near poetry witness the scene towards the end when <UNK> is left alone with lukas and davis and says the new world has left the scene to the old world <UNK> could write very well at times br br given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films
<START> the 1930s classy elegant adele <UNK> played with <UNK> resolve by debbie reynolds and <UNK> <UNK> helen the magnificent shelley winters going full <UNK> <UNK> with her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are the mothers of two killers they leave their <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> behind and move to hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring kid <UNK> adele begins dating dashing millionaire lincoln <UNK> the always fine dennis weaver on the other hand religious fanatic helen soon sinks into despair and madness br br director curtis night tide ruby <UNK> working from a <UNK> script by henry farrell who wrote the book whatever happened to baby jane was based on and co wrote the screenplay for <UNK> <UNK> sweet charlotte <UNK> <UNK> a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt fear <UNK> and religious <UNK> running dangerously amok the super cast have a ball with their colorful roles michael <UNK> as a pompous <UNK> teacher <UNK> <UNK> as a stern fire and <UNK> radio <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> overbearing mother of a <UNK> wannabe child star logan <UNK> as a <UNK> detective and timothy carey as a creepy bum an elaborate talent <UNK> set piece with <UNK> <UNK> the voice of lucy in the <UNK> tv cartoon <UNK> serving as <UNK> and original friday the 13th victim <UNK> morgan doing a <UNK> <UNK> dead on mae west impression qualifies as a definite highlight david <UNK> spooky score a fantastic scene with reynolds performing an incredible tango at a posh restaurant the <UNK> depression era period atmosphere <UNK> <UNK> handsome cinematography and especially the startling macabre ending are all likewise on the money excellent and effective mgm presents this terrific gem on a nifty dvd <UNK> with whoever slew <UNK> <UNK> both pictures are presented in crisp widescreen <UNK> along with their theatrical trailers
<START> oh dear oh dear br br for <UNK> fans this was the nail in the coffin as far as her a list hollywood career was concerned after solid turns in girl can't help it <UNK> bus the <UNK> and rock hunter it seemed <UNK> was well on the way to becoming one of <UNK> town's <UNK> stars however an obsession with <UNK> publicity and an appearance in this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> namely cheap euro <UNK> outs until fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity br br this movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone's time with the exception of <UNK> parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material many people blame poor <UNK> and her grating performance for this film's poor returns at the box office and while she is a pain in this film she can only do her best with the material after all cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he after a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turns <UNK> takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress by <UNK> simply for the sake of appearing with grant to portray this <UNK> idiotic menace her character of alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a <UNK> suit her every appearance in the film <UNK> your nerves we all know <UNK> could do so much better than this <UNK> and yet here she is <UNK> around like a prize <UNK> a real shame br br steer clear of this so called comedy it's more depressing than funny
<START> even though the plot was very well detailed and the story line was understandable the fact that steven <UNK> voice was dubbed with some one else's through out most of the movie was <UNK> as you were unsure who was talking there were many parts where he would start to talk in his deep <UNK> voice and then the next some one else's voice was doing the talking for him i don't know the reason however if he had difficulty with his voice during production of the movie i think they could have re shot the events that did not contain his own voice when he had <UNK> i have rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film when one pays for a movie whether or not its at the theater or on dvd this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged i have been a long time <UNK> of steven seagal and all his movies that he has done over the past years to date i think this is one of the worst ones we have seen yet
<START> after an initial release of 4 very good <UNK> titles redemption has managed to <UNK> the bottom of the barrel with the <UNK> leads the dance i found no <UNK> anywhere in this movie br br the story is simple a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation after some <UNK> sexual <UNK> the girls get decapitated one by one who is the killer who knows there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday br br the pace is excruciating the story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific either br br give this one a miss
<START> <UNK> <UNK> what can i say br br the opening scene maybe we see a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> with bad make up jump off the walls of some ruins they sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily <UNK> captive girl the dude runs off the <UNK> follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her then the dude still on the run sees a horse and tries to steal it <UNK> a blond god like looking hero with a bad wig appears saying that's my horse the mighty deathstalker just made his appearance the <UNK> arrive deathstalker kills all of them including the dude on the tunes of some rather inappropriate <UNK> western score this is supposed to be a swords <UNK> flick so what's with the <UNK> <UNK> and then goes up to captive girl and exposes both her breasts he starts to rub them and captive girl seems to like it she starts liking her lips and <UNK> deathstalker just when they are about to get down to it this old dude appears <UNK> what could have been the end of a perfect day for deathstalker and a possible perfect ending for a short film br br now tell <UNK> isn't that the point where either a feminist would <UNK> switch off the movie or any other male viewer would say this is going to be one hell of a good movie the plot is as simple as throwing a <UNK> from the balcony deathstalker must obtain the sword of justice and use it to steal the <UNK> of life and the <UNK> of magic from the evil <UNK> <UNK> br br aside from <UNK> <UNK> random bloodshed retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights this film also contains a massive amount of t <UNK> a shots i initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked <UNK> i could count after 9 points not even halfway into the movie i had to give up counting it was distracting me from the rest of the movie and the rest of the movie was worth it totally crazy stuff check out this mutant cat worm like creature <UNK> has as a pet and which he <UNK> <UNK> and fingers and here's an interesting question what would you do if a man in a woman's body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife the answer is simple you slap him around a bit take away the knife and then try to rape him then you discover that he's actually not a woman so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room it works out well i tell you deathstalker does it too and the deathstalker way is the right way br br deathstalker is a wonderful movie really as pointed out in other comments the villains are vile the women are delicious there's blood sex violence rape and tasty chicken there's a completely pointless <UNK> which just features a bunch of <UNK> beating <UNK> and <UNK> the crap out of each other my favorite weapon used in that <UNK> was a giant wooden hammer used to beat a poor <UNK> to bloody pulp and my favorite <UNK> undoubtedly was that one <UNK> with the <UNK> head reminiscent of the <UNK> guards from return of the jedi i won't reveal how the movie ends but just prepare to <UNK> in delight when i tell you a 4 way <UNK> is thrown into the movie's climax br br and of course there's a wonderful display of <UNK> throughout the whole movie see a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road and the next point of view shot shows him being dragged over grass no road see that awesome <UNK> on the <UNK> head magically change sides within the same scene on shot has it on the left side of his head the other on the right well after all <UNK> is a magician it's that or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like continuity simply don't exist br br as much as i enjoyed this and as much as i am looking forward to the other 3 <UNK> in this series i do have enough <UNK> of decency left in me to not let this movie pass i am prepared though to give it the maximum amount of minimal points just so i could be able to <UNK> a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow deathstalker might be a superbly fun trashy sleazy conan rip off it also is an <UNK> movie
<START> i had really only been exposed to <UNK> dramatic performances and those were mostly much later films than divorce in this film he is <UNK> of his <UNK> and <UNK> by sassy <UNK> <UNK> and plays the <UNK> divorce attorney with great charm
<START> i usually don't walk out of a movie but halfway thru i did this movie promised something different but i kept thinking haven't i seen that before spoiler alert back in 1 the spaceship crashes and lands on earth well all these years later with a super adult on board no less this thing still manages to burn up and crash what this advanced civilization can't seem to develop landing gear for an industry that's so liberal we get to see another woody allen movie no blacks please superman runs around saving people making sure he sticks to europe and the us don't go into <UNK> areas please maybe i could stomach this about 30 years ago but now now
<START> the line is funnier in england where away from <UNK> 's native america the word <UNK> has a whole new meaning sadly it's the only laugh you'll get in this terrible sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny br br oddly <UNK> with painted on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> acting ability zero is a <UNK> who <UNK> after her own brother but rejects his black friend while making <UNK> remarks about <UNK> as if in revenge he asks her if she would go with a <UNK> <UNK> reference is also made to making it with monkeys <UNK> ability to shake and <UNK> with <UNK> pleasure at the slightest touch is matched only in it's lack of appeal by her seduction dance  which involves a <UNK> and a <UNK> personally i preferred the <UNK> br br for <UNK> this was pretty tame stuff and <UNK> the controversy it attracted at the time a character claims to be getting stoned though it's only on <UNK> and for one of the original x <UNK> there's no full frontal nudity just six years later we would be getting timmy <UNK> and his <UNK> but here we have to make do with topless shots only <UNK> final seduction of her own brother really shocks another activity for <UNK> is where she helps settle the sexual problems between a married couple by sleeping with them both the two women clearly aren't enjoying acting out their scene together and make a poor effort to disguise it after <UNK> <UNK> out their <UNK> the romantic husband concludes of his wife i guess she's got it coming to her br br the only near worthwhile segment involves an unusual discussion of cuban communism it seems out of place with the rest of the film though is spliced with shots of <UNK> breasts to rope it in to continuity this then leads into a vague anti vietnam stance which is commendable though dropped in the middle of such a <UNK> film it seems trite and <UNK> not to say downright tasteless incidentally the part of would be communist <UNK> brooke is taken by harrison page the same harrison page who played captain <UNK> in amusing comedy <UNK> hammer page must be embarrassed by his back <UNK> which also includes <UNK> beyond the valley of the dolls though meyer <UNK> would have you believe the terrible dialogue lousy acting sloppy direction and dire editing are not just part of the charm but wholly intentional as a <UNK> it fails to hold water br br the irritating incidental music  a cross between the tunes they play in cinema restaurant ads and <UNK> used by tv stations when the <UNK> breaks down  is <UNK> and <UNK> while even the silly <UNK> <UNK> camera angles can't generate interest a wonderful world of jazz <UNK> where women have been asking for it black men  or shines  aren't good enough for anyone and rape is an acceptable form of revenge absolutely abysmal
<START> a prison cell four prisoners <UNK> a young company director accused of fraud 35 year old <UNK> in the process of his transformation daisy a 20 year old mentally challenged idiot <UNK> and <UNK> a 60 year old intellectual who murdered his wife behind a stone <UNK> in the cell mysteriously pulled loose they discovered a book the diary of a former prisoner <UNK> who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century the diary contains magic <UNK> that supposedly <UNK> prisoners to escape <UNK> is one of the <UNK> and most intelligent horror films i have seen this year the film has a <UNK> shadowy feel influenced by the works of h p <UNK> which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere there is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed it's a shame that eric <UNK> made truly horrible remake of one missed call after his stunning debut 9 out of 10
<START> when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film i know it is bad i wanted to claw my eyes out i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for <UNK> the last shred of dignity he had this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to <UNK> if only it were possible the other films being <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> both which are better than this crap in the hat br br i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this <UNK> on the good seuss name br br to mike myers i say stick with austin or even <UNK> <UNK> world just because it worked for jim carrey doesn't mean seuss is a success for all <UNK> br br
<START> lame cliched superhero action movie drivel i had high hopes for this movie and the genre of hk buddy cop <UNK> is one that i don't despise but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was this would have been forgivable as it always is in these kinds of movies when the action <UNK> unfortunately it did not the action does carry the trademark <UNK> and over the top nature of hk action but it's not very involving <UNK> gory and in fact often completely incoherent perhaps this is due to re editing for american release it does show signs in many places of <UNK> i was very disappointed
<START> as i work at a video store i found it to be my <UNK> duty to talk about the worst movies i've ever seen and warn my friends and co workers of it amidst one day of particularly <UNK> debate of what is the worst movie my friend <UNK> me to watch b t k killer even stating that if i could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever then he'd watch it i lost i believe that even i made better videos than this in high school and those were hardly great <UNK> of a young genius this film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder although it is surprisingly clear but also in acting wooden hollow and pathetic don't scratch the surface as well as just generally bad movie feeling i can remember a scene where i heard glass smash suddenly i was reminded of some bad high school plays i know that i reference high school too often here but this film did seem very juvenile both in terms of the set which seemed far too fake but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script not entirely sure what was actually going on my review doesn't do this film justice because i can't describe how utterly horrid the time i spent watching this was it's almost ironic that i do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie
<START> i am never a big fan of <UNK> movie production as opposed to korean <UNK> or even china strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film i don't consider myself as hard to please audience as i am in fact a fan of indie movies however this movie shows weak plot and slow pace i found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going the acting certainly does not make it better <UNK> acting is sub par as she <UNK> <UNK> trying to be <UNK> and cute although i have to admit she is a pleasure to look at <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused sad <UNK> extremely reserved character overall i find this movie is a disappointment
<START> i was fortunate enough to meet george pal and still have my <UNK> <UNK> poster <UNK> by him at a convention shortly after the release and asked him why he chose to do the film camp before he could answer two studio <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> me on how the studio knew best and how no one will take such a film seriously i had been reading the <UNK> <UNK> for a couple of years thanks to a friend <UNK> <UNK> of the 1970s will recall <UNK> and his band i was in a couple of years of that with him and had higher hopes than what we got br br the <UNK> insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously and so doing <UNK> was the only way several other fans jumped in on my side with pal listening as best he could at the end of the little event pal came up to us and <UNK> wishing he could have done more and better br br star wars put the lie to the <UNK> and a year after <UNK> death spielberg and lucas proved that doc savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise if it hadn't been for the <UNK> br br tear out the memory or history of doc and the film would have been worth a 6 10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn <UNK> br br but destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the <UNK> br br doc savage can still come to the screen and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill informed to indiana jones but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to <UNK> the glory that we should expect from the first american superhero br br <UNK> yes there was a second script for <UNK> of evil and it's a lot more serious yes there was <UNK> footage shot but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors and yes there is a one sheet of ron <UNK> <UNK> over a brick wall and <UNK> at something over his shoulder with a specially built <UNK> pistol <UNK> wearing a <UNK> over a button down white shirt with a <UNK> tie and the words doc savage <UNK> of evil coming next summer <UNK> if anyone knows who the studio <UNK> were that accompanied george pal in 1975 to san diego for the convention <UNK> the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are at the time they were doing <UNK> and fu <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> pants and carrying paramount <UNK>
<START> the fight scenes play like slow motion jackie chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic worst pun by far guess what this time i heard you coming the stars are a <UNK> pair brandon lee despite the terrible lines he has to say actually shows <UNK> of charisma and screen charm things that dolph lundgren is completely free of at least in this movie note to the director in the future please stay away from any love scenes especially when your main actress won't do any nudity and you have to rely <UNK> on a body double 1 2
<START> this is another one of those <UNK> vs insects <UNK> <UNK> features a theme that was popular in the late 70's only you can't really call it horror there's zero suspense and no gruesome events in other words this movie is pretty lame it's not that it's really bad or something it's just very boring a construction site near a hotel <UNK> a big nest of ants later on we learn that probably due to different sorts of <UNK> used in the past their bite became <UNK> some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what's going on robert <UNK> figures it out first and then you can see him go <UNK> with a digging machine for what seems like several hours then they flee in the house waiting to get rescued and man you should see all the efforts they make for <UNK> them i won't spoil too much but at one point they even use a big helicopter all the time when i was watching this i sat there thinking come on people you all got shoes on just run out of the building i'm sure a bunch of ants won't catch up with you it's all pretty ridiculous br br of course lots of close ups of <UNK> ants are shown throughout the whole movie ants in the garden ants in the garbage ants in the kitchen ants on the roof ants in the bedroom ants in the sink and the best part ants <UNK> on people's faces while the actors are breathing through <UNK> but when you see groups of ants in wider shots they indeed look like black rice the set <UNK> glued to the wall br br one small surprise came near the end no it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot it was just that brian <UNK> made an appearance as a chief <UNK> <UNK> what more can i say this movie is called it happened at <UNK> <UNK> but the box art of my copy read ants and the title during the opening credits was panic at <UNK> <UNK> there you have it now since this is a made for tv movie from the 70's i'll be once again extremely mild in my final rating now the savage <UNK> another <UNK> vs <UNK> tv movie from 1976 was much better than this one i even feel i have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ants lacking suspense action thrills shocks and creepiness the only thing you'll be left with after seeing ants is an annoying <UNK>
<START> first what i didn't like the acting was not really up to the hamlet standard branagh was really over the top doing a lot of yelling mostly in my opinion those actors who were not big name celebrities generally did a better job though i would except billy crystal and robin williams and charlton heston too but i wasn't sure if he was playing at being a hack a lot of the <UNK> in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacks br br what i think speaks very much in this <UNK> favor is that it is accessible shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays many people are not even inclined to try because of its reputation as serious literature and its <UNK> english if they see this film they will understand clearly at least one man's interpretation of the play they will be seeing it more as shakespeare's audiences saw it a play with sword fights and battles and mighty kings and <UNK> murder and incest and evil schemes and ghosts and great art if one cares to look for it but in shakespeare's day most didn't any more than most people do now branagh's overacting and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer may detract from shakespeare's art somewhat but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it rather than nothing br br i've got to say one more thing though some people are complaining that it's set in the 19th century and that wasn't shakespeare's time well in shakespeare's time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays shakespeare may have said it's in the days of ancient rome or medieval <UNK> or whatever but he didn't dress his characters up like they were he used the costumes of his own time for the same reason his plays are full of <UNK> for example in king john the english and french have <UNK> in robin <UNK> day in <UNK> <UNK> they talk of <UNK> which wouldn't be invented for another thousand years and in henry iv they talk about <UNK> who wasn't even born yet then so i think this <UNK> is silly you might as well complain that the play isn't in danish after all they live in <UNK> don't they
<START> please see also my comment on die <UNK> part 1 <UNK> br br the second part of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> production of the <UNK> saga continues in the <UNK> <UNK> and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor however whereas part one was a <UNK> portrayal of individual acts of <UNK> part two is a chaotic depiction of <UNK> on a grand scale br br as in part one director fritz lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands these pictures should only be watched with the note perfect <UNK> <UNK> score which fortunately is on the <UNK> dvd now with this focus on mass action lang is presented with greater challenges in staging the action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed but now he simply makes them part of that <UNK> flow with the level of activity on the screen <UNK> up like an orchestra br br but just as part one made us witness <UNK> adventures matter of <UNK> and without excitement part two presents <UNK> as devastating tragedy in both pictures there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters that's why lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action never allowing us to feel as if we are there and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of <UNK> work that's also why the performances are <UNK> theatrical with the actors <UNK> around like <UNK> <UNK> br br nevertheless <UNK> revenge does constantly deal with emotions and is in fact profoundly <UNK> the one moment of <UNK> is when <UNK> holds his baby son for the first time and lang actually <UNK> the <UNK> of this scene by building up to it with the wild frantic ride of the <UNK> the point is that lang never <UNK> us into taking sides and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the wagner opera the climactic slaughter is the very <UNK> of a rousing battle scene why then did hitler and co get so <UNK> eyed over it a fact which has unfairly <UNK> the reputation of these films because the <UNK> racial ideology of the nazis made them automatically view the <UNK> as the good guys even if they do kill babies and <UNK> their own <UNK> for hitler their downfall would always be a <UNK> tragedy not a human one br br but for us non nazi viewers what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of <UNK> and musical rhythm when you see these fully developed silent pictures of <UNK> it makes you realise how much he was wasted in hollywood rather than <UNK> him with low budget <UNK> they should have put him to work on a few of those sword and <UNK> epics pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally where it's the poetic operatic <UNK> that <UNK> us along
<START> with the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast nice starship cgi in places but their green screen needs some work anyone heard of <UNK> after effects 7 they should buy it get their <UNK> better br br stories are well thought out plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context but but the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode im not <UNK> but i cant help that i don't find men kissing entertaining dont mind women anyway for a fan series this is good stuff with minor improvement in their green screen brush up acting and some <UNK> ratings this series is stunning anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> if <UNK> was looking for his real father here he is darren <UNK> the first x files pity it was only one season long the producers of this show didn't know that they had the <UNK> of a classic on their hands and in 1993 along came chris carter with what i call the follow up to the night stalker the x files both will go down as classics is my opinion the two shows taking the viewers to a level of experience that only comes along once in a while and who should appear in the x files years later darren <UNK> as agent arthur <UNK> helping our two favorite hero s solving cases paying homage to the man i think so well done chris carter bringing back a forgotten tv show in the form of david duchovny as darren <UNK> if it wasn't for watching the x files and that particular show i would have never known about the night stalker
<START> this is a film that on the surface would seem to be all about j edgar hoover giving himself a a big pat on the back for fighting <UNK> going after indian killers hunting the famous gangsters of the 1930's fighting <UNK> in the us and south america during world war 2 and <UNK> in new york during the early 1950's of course in 1959 we did not know about mr <UNK> obsession for keeping secret files on honest americans <UNK> people like the <UNK> martin <UNK> king jr but worst of all his secret love affair with his deputy director clyde <UNK> if you want to know more about that subject i suggest seeing the film citizen <UNK> hoover aside this story of a life in the fbi as told by jimmy stewart makes for a decent but dated film vera miles as his devoted wife is also good but jimmy is the movie as much as hoover controlled production and always made sure the fbi was seen without fault jimmy stewart gave the film a human side quite an achievement considering hoover was always looking over his shoulder the background score is also pleasant i have read recent online <UNK> suggesting that this is a forgotten film jimmy stewart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten tcm was the last network to show it a long time ago and i hope they show it again
<START> ok so it may not be the award winning movie of the year type film apart from the brilliant soundtrack that i think won a few awards but it is a really great film about 'the <UNK> prince o take your pick and the happenings around him living in <UNK> playing his music the music is absolutely superb in my opinion you have to own this soundtrack it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion and the movie itself plays out a nice plot it's worth seeing over and over again <UNK> if you like prince o which i do of course
<START> i saw this on tv so long ago that i can't remember when it was but it still stands out as one of the scariest most unnerving films i've ever seen there is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame not quite clearly visible so that you feel like the <UNK> hero unsure whether its just imagination or not it is also one of the few films which has really made me <UNK> to keep watching production values be <UNK> good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using film actors locations sets music attention to detail and imagination a real gem
<START> this movie is horrible if you pay attention to it it's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen each one with no apparent connection to the next i rented this movie because i'm a david <UNK> fan and i really appreciate musicals in <UNK> <UNK> was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired the moral of the story was really <UNK> i couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in london in the 1950s or about not selling out for the first half of the movie i was <UNK> at how cheesy it was but i liked the <UNK> of the no selling out message when blacks started being murdered i thought my tape had gotten messed up maybe i rented half of two different movies nope there was a keep britain white song and dance sequence i'm sorry but wwii is not something you can write a musical about at least not a musical that could <UNK> be described as campy as i have several times in this review overall i'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors and put david <UNK> in it for longer <UNK> my grade c
<START> on the <UNK> of december <UNK> in the grand <UNK> in paris film history was writing itself while louis <UNK> showed his short films all single shots to a paying audience <UNK> <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> was the first film to be played and i wish i was there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audience br br we start with closed doors of the <UNK> factory apparently since the image seems a photograph people thought they were just going to see a slide show not something they were hoping for but then the doors open and people are <UNK> out heading home first a lot of women then some men and one man on a bike with a big dog when they are all out the doors close again br br whether this is the first film or not some say <UNK> <UNK> train <UNK> la <UNK> was the first film <UNK> recorded it is an impressive piece of early cinema being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons one simple reason it is only fifty seconds long but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here you don't get to see historical things like this every day
<START> when i started watching fay grim i had no idea that it was a sequel to henry fool now the latter was not a movie that i <UNK> as having a sequel but one has arrived and it's quite good i assume that you've seen the original so i won't explain it this one starts with fay parker posey living with her son whom she had with <UNK> henry thomas jay ryan simon james <UNK> is still in jail one day the son gets <UNK> for bringing a pornographic toy to school but this is no ordinary toy it holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie and this secret <UNK> deeper into <UNK> than <UNK> br br i must say that i'm quite impressed with what hal hartley has accomplished here maybe this one doesn't quite reach the <UNK> quality but it certainly takes a good look at what's going on in the world and the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel br br also starring jeff goldblum
<START> and all through the house is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first season but this episode was the first one i saw i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in south <UNK> on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the crypt right then and forever i had always been a fan of horror suspense series and liked monster movies and with this series started by hbo i again had <UNK> pleasure this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist and all through the house has a nice <UNK> setting on a snowy christmas eve which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday <UNK> well anyway you have mary ellen <UNK> who by the way plays in several warner brothers works usually small parts as a greedy <UNK> wife who takes care of her <UNK> while waiting on some money and a new romance only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve the odds are greatly <UNK> when a maniac dressed as santa escapes from a local nut house making for a late holiday <UNK> on christmas eve as from the old e c comic lessons you learn bad people get what they axe for well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured joan collins this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all time
<START> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient greek theatre to the screen his own screenplay an adaptation of <UNK> tragedy was far from easy compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed the story has been very carefully <UNK> from <UNK> version and placed in a logical strictly <UNK> <UNK> better <UNK> to the modern methods of cinematic story telling <UNK> also added some characters to his film that do not appear in <UNK> tragedy <UNK> <UNK> and the army this was done in order to make some of <UNK> points regarding war the church and government <UNK> finally <UNK> <UNK> ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to <UNK> br br the film was shot on location at <UNK> the director of photography <UNK> <UNK> shows us a rugged but beautiful <UNK> where since the <UNK> days time seems to have stood still he takes advantage of the bodies the <UNK> land the ruins the intense light and the darkness the <UNK> of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters the camera uses the whole gamut of available shots from the very long <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of the landscape as well as the human scale involved to the extreme close ups <UNK> and <UNK> deep into the soul of the tormented characters in particular the film's opening with a bold <UNK> tracking shot along a line of <UNK> <UNK> followed by an <UNK> view of the many thousands of soldiers lying <UNK> on the beach is a very effective means of <UNK> <UNK> awesome political and military responsibility br br no word but sublime can describe the stunning performances of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> irene <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the classical <UNK> tragedy <UNK> character is extremely down to earth and his powerful look into the camera more than his words reveals the unbelievable torment <UNK> his soul irene <UNK> is the modern <UNK> of classic greek plays in <UNK> she is terrible in her anguish and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance <UNK> <UNK> in her first role on the screen is outstanding in her portray of the innocent <UNK> which <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> depiction of her father <UNK> br br <UNK> is faithful to <UNK> in his representation of the other characters <UNK> is a sly scheming politician <UNK> a vain <UNK> warrior <UNK> is self centered obsessed with his honor eager to be <UNK> and to have his wife and property restored br br the costumes and sets are realistic no hollywood there <UNK> quarters resembles a <UNK> he dresses as do the others in <UNK> hand woven simple <UNK> <UNK> royal <UNK> is made up of rough <UNK> wooden <UNK> br br the music is by the prolific contemporary music composer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> score <UNK> the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy and <UNK> its <UNK> and <UNK> br br this film and the story it <UNK> offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient greek thought that was the <UNK> for so much of our modern civilization it teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures <UNK> questions the value of war and <UNK> when <UNK> against the simple virtues of family and love and reflects on woman's vulnerable position in a world of <UNK> violence in his adaptation of <UNK> tragedy <UNK> <UNK> all of these themes in a modern clear and dramatic fashion br br the relationships <UNK> the political <UNK> are clearly demonstrated war <UNK> and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer with the possible exception of <UNK> whose honor has been <UNK> by his own wife's <UNK> with her lover everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with <UNK> which has nothing to do with helen the <UNK> for power <UNK> greed the army <UNK> or glory <UNK> and so in a real sense helen became the <UNK> of the <UNK> war the war stripped of all <UNK> <UNK> and religious <UNK> was just an <UNK> venture <UNK> primarily by the desire for material gain all else being a convenient <UNK> br br another conflict raised in the film is that between the church and the state <UNK> who represents the church feeling the challenge to his <UNK> authority and wishing to destroy <UNK> for the insult to the <UNK> he serves tells him to sacrifice his daughter in <UNK> to the sacrifice the king comes closer to his moral <UNK> but in <UNK> loses his power over the masses his army who are <UNK> by religion of course for <UNK> it's a game the king must go along with the <UNK> whether he honestly believes in the gods or not until he realizes too late that he has <UNK> himself into committing a despicable <UNK> br br is it a sacrifice or a murder and how can we tell the difference between the two by focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice and worst of all the sacrifice of one's own child <UNK> <UNK> creates a drama that is at once deeply political and <UNK> personal it touches on a most complex and delicate <UNK> problem facing any society the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society in the case of <UNK> however as in the biblical tale of abraham and <UNK> the father is asked to kill his own child by his own hand what sort of god would insist on such <UNK> can it be just or moral even if <UNK> inspired finally does the daughter's <UNK> death <UNK> from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war these are many deep questions raised by a two hour film
<START> alicia <UNK> pre clueless plays a modern day crime obsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal <UNK> of a local girl pat <UNK> wrote and directed this b flick which isn't especially well made but is however surprisingly serious minded in regards to its leading character <UNK> is appealing and successful in <UNK> out an interesting young woman here despite the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the supporting cast including kevin dillon and michael <UNK> isn't bad though the violence in the last act goes overboard not a cheesy camp fest but nothing exceptionally memorable either 1 2 from
<START> the seventh sign borrows a lot from rosemary's baby and the omen it actually <UNK> the two stories even its title recalls <UNK> s the seventh seal br br nevertheless it begins well enough with all the <UNK> scattered on the whole earth and in parallel a seemingly distinct plot with moore's husband trying to save a poor boy who killed his parents who were brother and sister from death penalty this time both christian and jewish <UNK> are called to the rescue even the wandering jew is involved which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny have you ever been to sunday school but they taught me that god was love the best scene imho is the short dialog between priest john heard who does not seem to take things seriously too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid back acting is priceless and the young jew br br <UNK> moore probably <UNK> the same desire as ex husband bruce willis saving the world she does not save the movie for all that
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies ever made it's terrible but it's so good it's probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining because you're going to be disappointed however if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million <UNK> and <UNK> fantastic hair bad english you're in for a real treat the harder you think about the film the worse it gets unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes screw ups in which case you've got hours of entertainment ahead i'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die hard <UNK> fans and even then the latter should be a bit careful because <UNK> japanese fans were a bit upset about it they thought he was selling himself out he wasn't really not when johnny <UNK> who was the executive producer can do that for him
<START> fate stay night is an animated series inspired by a h game somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h stuff it couldn't have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it's <UNK> in this series and any <UNK> of that could only ruin perfection you'll understand once you see all the episodes br br despite a relatively slow start the producer took his time on presenting the characters things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid series the action gets so intense that <UNK> you to your seat br br the topic of the series concentrates on the war of holy grail that has been taking place in the <UNK> city for the last 50 years the pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on <UNK> is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and <UNK> a large portion of the city he <UNK> witnesses a fight between two servants that <UNK> his <UNK> holy mark to <UNK> one of the most powerful servants of the battlefield <UNK> his first contact with <UNK> left him stunned such <UNK> beauty i was at a lost for words br br you <UNK> compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot <UNK> offers much more than some cool sword fights good animation spectacular lights great soundtrack it offers excellent character and relationship development it presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events <UNK> the action reveals believable dynamic emotional and <UNK> <UNK> of the individuals not similar to the linear type other series use that are constantly <UNK> their personalities to reveal from under the mask of perfection flawed characters br br the <UNK> character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such you shouldn't watch <UNK> thinking that it doesn't present the viewer with the historic fact just remember that this is adventure fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can the ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes i would have watched them in the same breath
<START> i saw this movie at the <UNK> dallas festival most of the audience including my wife enjoyed this comedy drama but i didn't it stars lucas <UNK> brick <UNK> dog molly parker <UNK> the five senses <UNK> and adam scott first snow art school <UNK> the director is matt <UNK> who's married to molly parker all three actors do a fine job in this movie about 3 friends the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama and i thought it needed to be the other way around
<START> a classic cartoon always enjoyable and funny it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters road <UNK> is a show worth seeing it is a short 13 episodes and if you can ever manage a chance to see it you should unfortunately it is very hard to find i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all 13 episodes i would definitely buy it if they did and if they do you should buy it too if you have kids who like dogs they will love road <UNK> road <UNK> should have gotten more attention while it was being aired it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was
<START> this movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re <UNK> the dead he first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by his brother then <UNK> the other gang members in some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense the acting is mediocre but the story doesn't help the film the makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies the budget for this film i'm sure was very limited i believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget if you <UNK> to see a good zombie flick don't see this one
<START> want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a <UNK> center work just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight <UNK> outfits and have them <UNK> and <UNK> the floor like they are at a <UNK> club that's what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen but every time i was ready to switch the channel they'd add another scene with the <UNK> girls and i'd stay put as a slasher film killer <UNK> fails in every category i can think of as a showcase for beautiful girls working out it is a success strong recommendation to avoid unless the thought of half the film being a big t a show appeals to you

<START> i agree with most of the other guys a waste of <UNK> and valuable time br br nearly no joke is worth the paper is was written on the only highlight from my <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eh <UNK> this reminds of old times with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it is hard to describe the performances of the actors since most of them don't even seem to have a good time during production and just do their thing camera is ok plot is laughable i think you would be ashamed even if you discuss this with lots of beers br br apart from this i <UNK> all the time wondered about how a script like this could even be considered for production and waited for the end br br my 9 year old son was pleased but then he is pleased by so little at this age br br anyway a 1 point rating here nearly is 1 point too much
<START> this is a classic british comedy thriller i had always wanted to check out but no opportunity had <UNK> for that until now it's based on a popular stage play which had already been filmed a number of times previously most notably in 1931 by the same director but unfortunately this version seems not to have survived in its entirety for the remake under review the plot has been updated to the then current wartime situation br br anyway i was mainly familiar with early british comedians through the films of will <UNK> given that this one features a similar plot of legendary <UNK> <UNK> and enemy agents it's very much in that vein it was actually scripted by <UNK> regular writing team of <UNK> edgar val guest and j o c <UNK> the stranded <UNK> element then was an equally tried and true formula the star this time around is arthur <UNK> <UNK> by richard <UNK> none of whose films i had watched before who is as unlikely a hero as <UNK> himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating but one soon <UNK> up to him and <UNK> certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play and the 1931 film version was split into two here with <UNK> acting as the <UNK> straight partner br br the remote single setting the events of the film largely take place during one <UNK> night provides for some wonderful atmosphere the last half hour with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple raymond <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself is especially gripping and well handled also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is kathleen harrison as the stereotypical frightened <UNK> with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink
<START> i was curious to watch this movie a lot of people seem to be excited i also have my beliefs i believe in jesus christ but i'm opened for any kind of views or opinions it doesn't matter for me if jesus existed in the way it's written in the bible if maria was a virgin or not or all the other similar <UNK> <UNK> what matters for me is the idea of salvation the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this world br br what made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written for example they showed in this movie following sentence big those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them bring them here and kill them in front of me jesus lukas 19 27 what they didn't tell you is the context jesus told a story about an evil king there is no passage in the bible where jesus supports killing he is love after <UNK> the bible wrong they present us yelling people pseudo christians filled with hate the majority of viewers don't check the <UNK> presented so they start thinking jesus hate not good for me or for anybody else this is pure manipulation people please use your brain don't take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie we destroy our own basis our civilization if we start <UNK> jesus in this way and the message he brought to us you saw off the branch you're sitting on
<START> i should have trusted my instincts better no expectations no <UNK> instead however i expected to experience a similar masterpiece like <UNK> 1983 and was brutally disappointed <UNK> is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor and artistically it fails miserably it appears some producer gathered up <UNK> material from <UNK> <UNK> threw it together placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the <UNK> of philip glass to <UNK> throw together some banal background music which is <UNK> repeated where <UNK> entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes <UNK> is one long sequence of mundane images in slow motion if you view them on your vcr in fast preview mode you'll see what i mean what disappointed me the most however was philip <UNK> soundtrack i couldn't and still can't believe that these commercial sounding new age type <UNK> which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14 year old on a <UNK> <UNK> were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly <UNK> music for <UNK> all in all a big waste of time my advice forget <UNK> watch <UNK> again instead
<START> this poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well then <UNK> suspense with muddled and pointless special effects for example in the original one of the most chilling moments occurs when <UNK> and theo are lying side by side in twin <UNK> listening in terror to the noises outside their room <UNK> tells theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her <UNK> then looks across at theo who is several feet away and realises that it was not theo holding her hand in the latest version <UNK> is lying alone in bed when suddenly she <UNK> out and <UNK> across the floor it is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened and can anybody explain what <UNK> final words mean it's about family it's always been about family br br the one redeeming feature is <UNK> <UNK> performance but even this cannot save the film catherine zeta jones demonstrates once again that beneath her pretty exterior there is little depth in the original claire bloom subtly suggested her lesbian <UNK> zeta jones however has to spell it out for example by asking <UNK> if she has a boyfriend or girlfriend br br definitely one which should be <UNK> to the pointless remakes graveyard
<START> harsh yes but i call 'em like i see 'em br br i saw this in the late 80's and it was truly one of the most awful boring films i've ever forced myself to watch br br yes the cinematography is lovely the czech settings are truly stunning the political backdrop is <UNK> but unlike similar historically set stories e g dr <UNK> <UNK> this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even interesting br br sure <UNK> and <UNK> are beautiful but this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow i'm all for romance but this movie was so boring i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery br br i'm sure if i'd read the book the story would have made a bit more sense however life's too short to <UNK> any more time on this one
<START> this film was amazing it had an original concept that of a vampire movie meets <UNK> mob film it is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship love <UNK> death and happiness and comments <UNK> on society on the part of gackt <UNK> the role of sho was excellently delivered and hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire <UNK> i also laughed and cried at the happy go lucky character <UNK> who grew up with sho i loved each and every second of this this film especially moments such as the funny cigarette scene the fighting scenes and most of all the <UNK> ending
<START> years have gone by since don wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was <UNK> to destroy him he's also married to the blonde reporter <UNK> foster who led the rebellion in the first film now a new conspiracy is in the works one that involves look alike <UNK> who frame our two heroes and a corporation looking to rule the world there is no plot to back any of this up and <UNK> <UNK> 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie i admit that i have bought dvds from the bargain bin that were made by <UNK> <UNK> was a company that <UNK> in cheap jack action flicks like this which had tons of explosions little story and overall nothing but mean edged action some of these titles have been mildly enjoyable last man standing and the <UNK> however <UNK> <UNK> 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma less don wilson when comparing the protagonists of similar <UNK> efforts both jeff <UNK> and c thomas <UNK> are oscar <UNK> when compared to don wilson another telling sign is that this was directed by richard <UNK> who has none of the flair joseph <UNK> seems to have in <UNK> action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets then again though both c thomas and <UNK> are probably more expensive to obtain <UNK> <UNK> 2 is a rip off with a <UNK> r there are so many steals from better movies <UNK> terminator universal soldier to even halloween iii that it's almost as if richard <UNK> is trying to <UNK> a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless <UNK> of great action <UNK> <UNK> 2 falls flat there is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast <UNK> the only exception comes from tony burton who is miles better than the material also <UNK> foster looks like she could be better with far better material however <UNK> <UNK> 2 comes off mainly as <UNK> bland and lackluster as its leading man however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on all there is is lots of cars <UNK> over and that alone is no substitute for the <UNK> of ambition expressed here br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
<START> i have no idea what people are complaining about i saw this movie yesterday and i really liked it stone once again delivered a great character she was just as good as she was in the first basic instinct she still has those smart but <UNK> answers although sharon may be 48 years old she looks amazing i don't care if she's as fake as a <UNK> she looks good and that's that basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first sex violence and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it so don't listen to them
<START> i found this episode to be one of funniest i've seen in a long time the south park creators have done the best spoof of a romero film i have ever seen they have truly touched on romero's underlying social commentary that he has made with each one of his films i would love to know what george romero's opinion was on this episode i'm sure it was purely positive keeping his true vision for his zombie epics fully intact most spoofs deal with the pure gore without making the viewer think as romero tries to do with his films i think that if a zombie <UNK> did happen we may actually worry about our property values before our lives as shown in this episode
<START> dan duryea a perfectly decent b movie actor who made lots of <UNK> <UNK> in the 1940s can't do much with this one young man is accused of murdering an <UNK> married singer when he's sentenced to die his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead woman's husband after a dazzling opening shot flick quickly <UNK> into b movie formula it certainly looks good but the twist finish is <UNK> handled and the cast including peter lorre and <UNK> crawford is just a bit stiff based on a <UNK> <UNK> novel and passable for a single viewing br br from
<START> i actually saw this movie in the theater back in it's original release it was painful to watch peter sellers embarrass himself so badly the story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow and the ending was ridiculous it was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen i won't say that i'm a huge peter sellers fan but i did thoroughly enjoy the pink <UNK> series and i felt that he gave a strong performance in being there but this film should never have been made from what i've read he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him fine but that still doesn't excuse the studio actually releasing the film
<START> gregory <UNK> acting was excellent as one would expect and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic moment but the rest of the film was <UNK> and hard to watch for me anyway i tried to like it but had to fast forward through the last thirty minutes or so i feel i wasted a couple of good hours had it not been for gregory peck i wouldn't have lasted fifteen minutes 4 10
<START> was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie the character leon is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore some movies can get away with the sexual jokes and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie scary movie was stupid and american pie <UNK> have done well without the sexual jokes the only role besides leon that had some humor that followed was will ferrell the character really was dumb and that was all the dumb humor was all that had me watching the movie was ok and nothing else i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show the skits last about 5 minutes and if they can make a movie off a 5 minute skit then what is the world coming to molly shannon had superstar <UNK> <UNK> had scary movie but she <UNK> a leading role and will had <UNK> but that was good but he did some dumb movie but i cant remember and mike myers with wayne's world how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals seen only one guy break through but only in like 2 movies and a tv show with andy dick but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue funny or not this movie is not good but had some positive humor what a waste of film and people's money d d

<START> when people ask me whats the worst movie i've ever seen its this one its not even close to mst3k level <UNK> or midnight viewing at a theatre or even as disney channel late night filler the only time i've ever wanted to jump off a ride at disney world or disney mgm studios in this case was to grab dick <UNK> jacket off the <UNK> rip it to <UNK> and ram it down the tour <UNK> throat saying eat this eat this <UNK> coat of darkness i've never been so mad at a movie not even nutty professor ii the <UNK> or flash gordon you want pretty colors and cinematography ain't here babe reviewers keep saying oh but its too look like a comic book well to me its the color of a <UNK> after several weeks in the sun about as enjoyable too beatty wanders around this landscape jumping around and talking to his watch himself and occasional at the other actors hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin shooting to be fair i have only seen this movie once but my pain <UNK> is that of a man not a god
<START> the story of ned kelly has been <UNK> in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand and this film is no exception what <UNK> ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him during several battles he <UNK> out wearing <UNK> of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would <UNK> <UNK> indeed it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadn't <UNK> up his legs that he was captured and <UNK> the story has been told in schools and <UNK> of australia for so long that some <UNK> of the story have ironically become boring the more the stories try to portray kelly as some <UNK> or <UNK> monster the less people pay attention br br which is where this adaptation of our sunshine a novel about the kelly legend excels rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as <UNK> as the <UNK> he wore the film quickly <UNK> him as a human being indeed the <UNK> of the popular legend showing the corruption of the victorian police and the <UNK> situation of the <UNK> goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd here ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it no i am not making that up about the only area where the film <UNK> is by <UNK> the irish versus english mentality of the battles while the kelly gang were distinctly irish australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied <UNK> have mixed together almost <UNK> a scene with some chinese <UNK> highlights this br br heath ledger does an amazing job of <UNK> <UNK> most notorious outlaw it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow and geoffrey <UNK> appearance as the leader of the police <UNK> at <UNK> goes to show why he is one of the most <UNK> actors in that desolate little island state but it is <UNK> <UNK> appearing as julia cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kelly's life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here indeed a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze <UNK> than <UNK> once the element of police corruption is established in fact the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed br br unfortunately most of the film's strengths are not <UNK> upon rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits <UNK> for <UNK> and the rest of the cast come off a little like <UNK> i can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this but that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact one scene manages to do the speech making thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a <UNK> of moments with no <UNK> after a while if one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the say so of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at <UNK> annoyingly the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll br br that said aside from some shaky camera work at times ned kelly manages to depict some exciting <UNK> and it has a good beginning for that reason i rated it a seven out of ten other critics have not been so kind so if you're not impressed by <UNK> with unusual elements and what could more more unusual than full body <UNK> in a colonial shootout then you might be better off looking elsewhere especially if you want a more factual account of ned kelly's life
<START> this was a hilarious movie and i would see it again and again it isn't a movie for someone who doesn't have a fun sense of a humor but for people who <UNK> comedy like chris rock its a perfect movie in my opinion it is really <UNK>
<START> this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies br br the starting point of the movie was almost like episode iv spacey <UNK> music and thoughts of a <UNK> place where the seriousness of mobster <UNK> the <UNK> was getting even more serious he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bone <UNK> teeth of <UNK> who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark <UNK> jedi powers eventually finish the monster off adding to the <UNK> rescue of han solo who was frozen alive at the end of episode v <UNK> was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the <UNK> pit outside br br but all of the star wars good guys especially <UNK> <UNK> had other ideas and those other ideas <UNK> off <UNK> execution in the end most of <UNK> soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to <UNK> choke <UNK> to death br br like in episode iv the death star in episode <UNK> makes its appearance as i <UNK> the rebel fleet attacking the <UNK> fighters around the death star the star <UNK> <UNK> i guessed <UNK> up the <UNK> of the main laser using the <UNK> fighters as a <UNK> the 20 25 star <UNK> that <UNK> up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise once it fired the rebel <UNK> only hope was that the death <UNK> <UNK> shield was going to be knocked out and this affected <UNK> so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out and it was taken out with <UNK> increasing <UNK> br br like in episode v the <UNK> <UNK> make their menacing appearance with their twin <UNK> killing at least one of the ewoks but the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them for instance <UNK> as well as another <UNK> was able to <UNK> one of the <UNK> and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the <UNK> and the other ewoks used <UNK> to knock out two other <UNK> br br it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light <UNK> like for instance the scene on <UNK> where luke <UNK> <UNK> laser shots from a storm <UNK> <UNK> bike and using the <UNK> to knock out part of the bike or in a climax using the <UNK> to break off his own father's arm during the final <UNK> fight with <UNK> vader br br you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown complete with a short display of fireworks <UNK> on the <UNK> of victory e g storm <UNK> masks and luke finally meeting up with leia after <UNK> own nemesis darth vader now dead is burned on a <UNK> the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy that even with the strong respect of film composer john williams br br on the home movie version i think lucas himself wanted a different ending in addition to the celebration on <UNK> he wanted shots of <UNK> scenes on the several surviving rebel planets including a <UNK> laser shot that destroys the statue of the <UNK> the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative <UNK> piece he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death <UNK> destruction balance had been restored to the rebel <UNK>
<START> darkman 3 die darkman die is directed by <UNK> may the same guy who made the first darkman sequel too darkman 3 is worse than darkman 2 and is nothing special in my opinion larry drake is no more as a main villain who is now played by great jeff <UNK> whose character once again wants to get <UNK> work and create this time some ultra strong humans in order to get the <UNK> of the whole city the film is pretty much the same in plot and execution as darkman 2 but i was mostly irritated by the presence of many scenes from darkman 2 these sequels were made in short time and with little money so these kind of decisions had to be made couple of scenes are pretty stylish and <UNK> but still this is pretty tired film and often <UNK> stupid too the characters scream and laugh too much and it is very annoying there is no any philosophical depth in the film and this is like a remake of darkman 2 which it still cannot equal darkman 2 had many great scenes and stylish camera work and larry <UNK> ability to play great villain darkman 3 offers only some nice scenes and moments but mostly this film is tired and full of cliches the few positive things in this movie are flashback edits <UNK> nightmares and couple of truly surprising plot turns and tricks and worth mentioning is also pretty nasty death scene of the main villain which was pretty comic book like and inventive without any gore far more interesting than the death of main villain in part two br br darkman 3 is worst in the whole series and we must remember that these two sequels were made directly to video and they don't come even close to <UNK> original darkman with liam neeson darkman 2 was okay <UNK> with plenty of great scenes and suspense but this last entry is tired and often stupid and boring piece of sequel it has some merits as mentioned but overall feeling is that this should not been made in the first place may is talented director so hopefully he can get some more noteworthy projects in the future br br 3 10

<START> as soon as it hits a screen it destroys all intelligent life forms around but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesn't fall into any known movie category it deserves a brand new <UNK> of its own it's a <UNK> drama it <UNK> and <UNK> every single <UNK> inside a person's brain br br it's the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one it drives you speechless all you members go <UNK> your mouth falls open and remains so and the most strange <UNK> of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf br br no small feat for such a sort of a movie br br the only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage
<START> veteran director and producer allan <UNK> whose huge string of films includes both the utterly forgettable and the <UNK> shown for example john wayne in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> tried his hand at a big musical with i dream of <UNK> <UNK> a lead cast of singers with little past film experience and as it turned out virtually no future he <UNK> a fictional and in no small part offensive story about the great american <UNK> stephen foster br br bill shirley is the young <UNK> foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for an injured little black boy his intended is <UNK> mcdowell muriel lawrence whose <UNK> younger sister <UNK> <UNK> christy is slowly realizing she's in love with the nearly <UNK> song smith foster is in love with <UNK> who is <UNK> by the <UNK> number 1 on the <UNK> hit parade tune o <UNK> enter <UNK> <UNK> p christy ray <UNK> to help launch the profit making phase of <UNK> career br br this is by the musical film standards of the early fifties a big production the sets are lavish in that special hollywood way that portrayed <UNK> with all the <UNK> the singers aren't half bad and the foster songs are almost impossible to ruin br br but this is also a literal <UNK> of the <UNK> south the biggest number features black face for all on stage an historical <UNK> and a contemporary piece of <UNK> racism were these portrayals of blacks anywhere near reality the <UNK> would be rightly condemned for <UNK> with so <UNK> an institution br br i dream of <UNK> apparently <UNK> into the <UNK> vault with barely a death <UNK> now <UNK> by <UNK> video for a mere 4 99 it's a period piece with charming songs and repulsive <UNK> about the victims of america's great crime slavery br br this was what hollywood was putting out two years before brown v board of education must have <UNK> the hearts of some <UNK> who wore their bed <UNK> to the theater
<START> i watched the dvd called black widow in the u s a and felt afterward that it was indeed a truly awful movie but they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film or i missed a lot the sex scenes had very little <UNK> and no nudity not even a breast but i've read several other comments on imdb com mentioning the <UNK> and something about a <UNK> i did not see anything like that just a bad boring film with unlikable characters and a trite <UNK> plot <UNK> <UNK> is either <UNK> from the mouth up or <UNK> to the <UNK> and <UNK> an expression touches her face and her name makes me think of super <UNK> a <UNK> at <UNK> bell i'll have the <UNK> <UNK> it was actually kind of fun it was so bad i got to play like i was in my own mystery science theater 3000 noting things like the fact that <UNK> skin is too big for his face it's really like silly <UNK>
<START> rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of grace elliot an <UNK> who stayed in france during the <UNK> of the french revolution one always suspected that rohmer was a conservative but who knew he was such a red blooded <UNK> if you can put aside <UNK> <UNK> defense of the <UNK> and that is not an easy thing to do given that for instance the french lower classes are portrayed here as hideous <UNK> this is actually an elegant intelligent and polished movie lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century france rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted <UNK> it is a blatantly artificial <UNK> but it somehow works and newcomer lucy russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be
<START> this lifetime style movie takes the middle aged <UNK> victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon like absurdity br br here the 40 something stay at home ex wife of a successful lawyer protagonist daughter away at college is starting a new life after her divorce helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise <UNK> deal she has even started up a friendship with her attractive slightly younger perhaps landscape architect <UNK> who's black but then horror of middle aged women's horrors another 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to starts <UNK> over her life br br what this new younger woman threat really does is mildly <UNK> with the <UNK> and offer him a glass of wine that gasp really <UNK> to the <UNK> she runs up the <UNK> bills by not turning down the <UNK> and backed up the toilet and leaves old food gone bad in the <UNK> and hangs her pieces of african artwork in the living room and so on well she may have killed the cat as well yeah ok the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough but its more than a little ridiculous especially as it turns into a campaign the character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular <UNK> woman insane so why did she rent the room and to horror of horrors a much younger woman br br supposedly this increasingly arrogant <UNK> younger woman has a <UNK> for <UNK> control and our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil and <UNK> hot looking of course 20 something but there's this problem anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her power and just <UNK> or has sex with some guy and escapes the consequences well there actually is something to that <UNK> of good looking 20 somethings it just isn't generally used in quite this sort of way br br the premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something <UNK> the <UNK> into <UNK> their room rental deal with a written <UNK> produced by her of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things and the 20 something has had help the <UNK> actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period with <UNK> thrown in at the fixed price even though an <UNK> <UNK> is soon <UNK> the 20 something soon gets a temporary <UNK> order against the older woman supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something you know the judge is sympathetic to all the <UNK> is me of the sexy sweet young thing finally the 40 <UNK> heroic battle back for the house then begins <UNK> br br the only realistic or <UNK> thing in this movie is how <UNK> easy <UNK> or orders of protection are for women to get on nothing more than her <UNK> say so although they are generally only this easy against men they are sometimes just as <UNK> and just as motivated to <UNK> control of a home as it is here indeed girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them <UNK> from their own homes or <UNK> on the basis of no proof whatsoever but only an <UNK> claim of <UNK> and sometimes without even hearing his side even when there is a hearing it is <UNK> impossible to <UNK> claims of <UNK> to prove a negative when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused rather than the <UNK> this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true and it's a <UNK> outrage of feminist <UNK> and the failure of any organized group to resist the <UNK> of course that's not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime br br the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic and isn't taking her medicine even so it makes no sense she isn't after the successful lawyer ex husband though she does con his help to the ex wife's fury in her quest she's after the house technically to drive the <UNK> out of it during the period of the <UNK> this second younger woman is after all that's left after the divorce after affairs with other 20 somethings stole her husband the ex husband seems <UNK> and basically <UNK> after his <UNK> doesn't matter he still <UNK> br br the protagonist is good enough looking for her age but her <UNK> attitude and focus is so small minded <UNK> and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her well a core group of lifetime fans care i guess judging by the average score the small number of <UNK> gave it i kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal i couldn't resist seeing just how far they'd take it br br spoiler if such a thing is possible with this flick br br well here's a clue the movie ends with the 20 something getting <UNK> out of jail by promising to listen to her 20 something male co worker and sometimes lover and do whatever he says and let him take care of her he means get her to keep taking her medicine and then <UNK> him and returning to the house there she climbs the stairs with a knife <UNK> stalking her nemesis 40 something who is taking a bath by <UNK> secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life there's a struggle and the 40 something mom wins by sticking the 20 something with a <UNK> <UNK> full of anti psychotic medicine she had found she then begins <UNK> her mom like and the two women have a bonding female <UNK> moment how sweet
<START> from what critics and audiences <UNK> birthday girl had to be a big fat <UNK> still because i love nicole kidman i decided to rent it last night it proved to be quite worthy of watching sure it isn't your basic american comedy and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie but that's why i liked it it was a change from all the other movies around a breath of fresh air sure there were some plot holes but overall it worked first off kidman was fabulous again in a very different not very glamorous but still quite sexy role she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn't know it was nicole kidman you would never question her authenticity harrison ford should have taken note in k 19 overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz
<START> fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days br br as has already been pointed out this is hardly a real zombie film but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers while there are necessarily some bloody scenes there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented feel good 50s style i can't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by fido his fellow <UNK> br br while the cast is generally good i felt that moss and nelson stood out the humor is not in your face but rather subdued there's a lot of attention to detail and i caught myself smiling <UNK> several throughout the movie this is certainly no masterpiece of cinema but it doesn't <UNK> to be instead <UNK> succeeds in delivering a heart warming black comedy
<START> fairly amusing piece that tries to show how smart <UNK> are but in the meanwhile and quite oblivious to them makes the audience feel stupid by making the most ridiculous film richard harris plays <UNK> i'm sorry that's wrong he plays captain nolan a <UNK> who catches sharks for a living but is <UNK> by the big catch and tries to catch a killer whale when the capture of a female killer whale goes awry don't ask it's mate don't ask goes on a rampage don't ask and starts stalking captain nolan don't ask soon captain nolan realizes that they have something in common don't ask pretty amazing film making here folks i got to tell you though the beginning with the whale noises and nothing much else is pretty haunting and the end credits with the most <UNK> song is pretty entertaining
<START> pleasant story of the community of <UNK> in london who after an <UNK> ww2 bomb explodes find a royal <UNK> stating that the area they live in forms part of <UNK> br br this movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to them a solid cast of british <UNK> especially stanley <UNK> makes this more believable br br there are some very nice moments in the film such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other <UNK> on the other side of the <UNK> start throwing food and other things over to them br br even though you always knew <UNK> would become part of the uk again the people of <UNK> and as a consequence the viewer doesn't mind when this happens leaving a nice happy feeling br br it's amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in london still remain so popular over fifty years later the producers must have got something right
<START> previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on tcm but it was a severe disappointment <UNK> <UNK> is great but doesn't get enough screen time frank morgan and eugene palette play familiar but promising characters but the script leaves them stranded br br the movie revolves around the ego of lee <UNK> character who is at best a self centered physically and <UNK> abusive jerk the reactions of the public are poorly thought out and unbelievable making the <UNK> seem like <UNK> of a bad writer and it <UNK> <UNK> that the <UNK> <UNK> character could fall for him br br the <UNK> one liners mentioned in another review must be <UNK> on the <UNK> since i didn't even notice that an attempt was being made
<START> this is a very well made film <UNK> directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving for example the scene with the loyal but <UNK> sidekick cop and his wife the plot is convincingly worked out and exciting the gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost <UNK> role in the life of the hero it's made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters br br a couple of slight <UNK> i found the ending slightly one sided as it <UNK> the hero's successful <UNK> into the structure of the police and justice system which <UNK> the ambiguity of the police characters which has been <UNK> up to that point also i found the lead female character somewhat weak little more than a <UNK> for the salvation of the hero all she seems to do is <UNK> and <UNK> as the tough guys battle it out
<START> the most <UNK> fat guy in martial arts does it again an early sammo film that has him imitating his character's hero bruce lee sammo is amazingly lee like in his actions and fighting the way he slips into <UNK> style and then back to his own more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and <UNK> he is at his art throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all comedy some unintentional like the fake black guy action and some incredible fight scenes br br a great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time
<START> first off i dislike almost all neil simon movies but there is something about this that is unique that draws me in and i would say it is among the most entertaining comedies i have seen the second time i watched it the connection was clear when did neil simon meet my <UNK> br br ah afraid they might sue so he changed them into men and how dull would it be if they were only <UNK> show <UNK> stars is more fun well this is a personal review and my still living grandmother at age <UNK> she even <UNK> walter <UNK> magnificent <UNK> of her would deny it but some of you must find <UNK> in these characters br br secondly i have little tolerance for george burns but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall and my late grandmother even enjoyed it although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character br br very ethnic in flavor and over the top you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off for me the pleasure <UNK>
<START> this film is really bad so bad that even christopher lee cannot save it a poor story an even <UNK> script and just plain bad direction makes this a truly outstanding horror film the outstanding part being that it is the only horror film that i can honestly say i would never ever watch again this garbage make plan nine from <UNK> look like oscar material
<START> the <UNK> movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the <UNK> of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the <UNK> of hardcore porn it's peak years were between 1968 and 1972 one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica <UNK> who had a small but fanatic cult of followers she was actually able to act unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks and her subsequent credits proved it and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only <UNK> her <UNK> br br gary <UNK> the director was also a talent probably too talented for the <UNK> genre and his skill combined with monica <UNK> screen presence makes sandra the making of a woman a pleasantly enjoyable experience the film never drags and you won't have your finger pressed on the fast forward button
<START> the film transported everyone back to october 20 1944 where we seemed to be part of the great <UNK> 'i shall <UNK> landing <UNK> it was on that <UNK> shore where general macarthur <UNK> his <UNK> br br above all gregory peck <UNK> in his portrayal of the great <UNK> it is the <UNK> the set of the shoulders the <UNK> it's what both men have had in common intensity total <UNK> <UNK> with macarthur it was for the <UNK> with peck it was for the challenge of <UNK> an academy award winner for to kill a <UNK> an oscar <UNK> for keys to the kingdom the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and twelve <UNK> high <UNK> has played everything from an apparently homicidal <UNK> to a <UNK> journalist from a troubled <UNK> to an obsessed attorney from biblical david to captain <UNK> <UNK> he has brought to them all his own unique insight his character his sincerity warmth and love and especially his <UNK> br br there is a scene where <UNK> stands on deck with the <UNK> of the <UNK> ' we can hear the dialogue general i hope the water isn't too deep says the <UNK> ' because my people will find out i can't swim then come <UNK> <UNK> voice and my people are going to find that i can't walk on water br br as macarthur peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film <UNK> through him we felt <UNK> emotions we knew his anger his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole <UNK>
<START> if there is a hell it contains a screening room in which grand canyon is playing over and over again on an eternal loop one would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors danny glover <UNK> <UNK> kevin kline mary louise parker would help make up for the <UNK> of mary <UNK> whose <UNK> is to watch her own films for all eternity but no apparently they <UNK> those other actors with a serum made from <UNK> the entire affair is pretentious overblown insulting if you are deaf or know anyone who is be prepared for your blood to <UNK> at the ludicrous <UNK> scene grand canyon is filled with obnoxious self involved people but never gives us a reason to like understand sympathize with or even tolerate them with rare exception they are <UNK> losers that the gene pool would be better off without there's no plot to speak of no character development these people won't ever develop no break out performance and the most arch writing you'll ever encounter in a film the best thing about grand canyon its title this is one large hole of a movie
<START> well it's been a long year and i'm down to reviewing the final film for 2004 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> call of the river placed second in the recent <UNK> <UNK> film festival as expected it didn't do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common <UNK> especially since <UNK> is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies br br it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in <UNK> or english play out in the screen i thought <UNK> <UNK> did a good job both as a star and director his great vision and creativity really helped this film he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film also performing well was young actress rebecca <UNK> she did a great job portraying <UNK> the younger sister of <UNK> i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps <UNK> into other genres i think that the fact that this film was in her local <UNK> really helped her br br some of the camera shots in the film were done very well the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different br br in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have <UNK> further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film i certainly won't be raving about the story of this film
<START> magnificent and unforgettable stunningly atmospheric and brilliantly acted by all br br i really cannot understand what sort of people are <UNK> this masterpiece and giving the <UNK> of votes as 8 and nine ones br br this along with <UNK> of wrath is john ford's greatest movie i would say that long voyage home is next in line though quite a way back br br rating 10 it deserves a 12
<START> discovery channel animal planet must be ashamed of themselves this fantasy is <UNK> after the walking with <UNK> series even though this is 100 fantasy it is presented in the same factual and <UNK> way even mixing the fantasy dragons with t <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say sci fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show br br on its own the show is about an 7 5 10 far as entertainment goes but the way in which it is presented i have to give it a 1 10 don't get me wrong i have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong i can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real br br i also think this <UNK> the great walking with <UNK> series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini series
<START> i just can't agree with the above comment there's lots of interesting and indeed amazing <UNK> imagery in this one it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it's effective use of silence what's more it explores the odd <UNK> of suicide in a very frank way not pulling any punches in what it shows yet not <UNK> and over <UNK> the subject matter it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art house cinema and deserves a place amongst the <UNK> of <UNK> horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring both of which it <UNK> and could well be an <UNK> influence on it's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror cinema
<START> the tv productions at the <UNK> start were between weak and bad before marks like <UNK> lost prison break desperate <UNK> or monk the tv didn't have the right hit yet which could capture the attention and the interests of the <UNK> viewer titles like <UNK> hunter mutant x the lost world <UNK> or even <UNK> hawaii weren't <UNK> for you to watch and follow or at least weren't that captivating and interesting all the time as what <UNK> them special unit 2 was no exception in fact it's men in black meets the x <UNK> spoof as if these were the special unit 1 but even according to this brilliant formula it didn't work well it was promising at the time there was some <UNK> out of the supernatural cases after a decade of many x files already so the natural spirit to lampoon it <UNK> too imagine <UNK> as <UNK> however special unit 2 wasn't the strongest in this or a strong when it comes to make a comic sci fi show it was highly ridiculous where for instance every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgusting one it enjoyed that bad taste <UNK> michael <UNK> was non charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian his chemistry with <UNK> lee as well as any supposed sexual attention was all <UNK> sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work it's clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea among <UNK> <UNK> 's other works as a co writer and a co producer like seven days before or 24 later this must be a low point despite the distinctive personality it managed to be a silly <UNK> for most of the time therefore if that was there goal so they made one of the <UNK> indeed and truly it would be one of the <UNK> times to be thankful for the <UNK> of a show after 19 episodes of it only
<START> the early career of <UNK> lincoln is beautifully presented by ford not that anyone alive has seen footage of the real lincoln but fonda wearing a fake nose is uncanny as lincoln with the voice delivery walk and other mannerisms exactly as one would imagine lincoln to have been ford in the first of three <UNK> films he made with fonda is at the top of his form perfectly <UNK> early 19th century america the story focuses on a pair accused of murder that lincoln <UNK> and the courtroom scenes are quite well done the supporting cast includes many of ford's <UNK> this was alice <UNK> last film as she died months after its release
<START> in all honesty this series is as much a classic as television goes as the original poem is to the world's literature far from being <UNK> exploitative it is a beautiful and <UNK> rendering of one of the western <UNK> defining <UNK> br br i was moved by the plight of <UNK> and his followers touched by the drama of the fall of <UNK> which was felt but not seen intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of <UNK> it should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creatures <UNK> around on their <UNK> wings or poorly cast fashion models in <UNK> as in <UNK> work they act through mortal agents or rarely are represented by classical <UNK> br br it's a pity it's not available in dvd especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores
<START> this movie is a perfect example of a film that <UNK> people into 2 groups those who get the joke and those who don't people usually attack what they don't understand this film has a comic style and charm that has been <UNK> since it's a great comedy and a great romance it's a perfect date movie a perfect movie for someone who wants a good lighthearted laugh and if your perspective is too tense maybe this movie isn't for you and you may need <UNK> it is an injustice that paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 80's having never seen the light of day on dvd yet they feel an urban version of the <UNK> is a good idea i find it odd that my two <UNK> favorite romantic comedies have never been released on dvd the other being gene <UNK> the world's greatest lover which fox has sat on since the early 80's as well yet from justin to kelly is in nearly every video store in the country there is no justice in the world maybe those who took the time to bash this will enjoy from justin to kelly i'm sure that one is watered enough for them to get sometimes with age people lose their sense of humor or sometimes it just goes stale and they find comic satisfaction in reruns of full house
<START> for starters hobgoblins tries to ape the more successful <UNK> that's bad enough but they don't even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here instead it's more like a bargain basement everything must go <UNK> of embarrassing scenes inappropriate sound fx acting as bland as <UNK> <UNK> and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws 'em down the old tube <UNK> br br the plot <UNK> <UNK> kids track down <UNK> like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by <UNK> their fantasies sound cool does it well see that wall on the other side of your room run right at it top speed face first see that is <UNK> than this movie br br you dare to doubt quick name something else one of the leads has been in other than this what other scripts have the writers done since hobgoblins name another rick sloane <UNK> effort how many hobgoblins action figures do you have see thank you br br i cannot believe i took so long to write about such a horrible film i'd rather write about more important things like the <UNK> of church and state economic <UNK> in europe that kind of thing but no hobgoblins it is and it is bad bad like your <UNK> <UNK> bad as pink <UNK> on your lawn bad like underwear that says home of the <UNK> and i think we'll stop there br br well mike and the robots fight <UNK> but try as they might they can do only so much with hobgoblins before they realize that yes the director does need kicked in the shin br br real real hard br br one star for hobgoblins seven stars for the mst3k version
<START> one of the finest films ever made why it only got a 7 6 rating is a mystery this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece if you think whoopi <UNK> work is about homer and eddie or hollywood <UNK> think again don't miss this movie which should have won the oscar and read the book too
<START> the british <UNK> <UNK> industry is out of control there's nothing wrong with filming classic novels but why must they all be filmed by talentless <UNK> this film rips the guts out of <UNK> tough novel turning it into a harmless <UNK> romantic comedy <UNK> may not be <UNK> best work but no one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty <UNK> <UNK> not only the cold and the <UNK> but the <UNK> of being poor in the novel london is a bleak grey cold heartless city and <UNK> <UNK> for it to be <UNK> away by a <UNK> of <UNK> but this film <UNK> out anything that might be in any way disturbing and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s london in which everything is lit with <UNK> of golden <UNK> and even the <UNK> of <UNK> are <UNK> and filled with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and happy prostitutes <UNK> <UNK> about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbish <UNK> streets seem completely out of place in this chocolate box world worst of all is the <UNK> relentless <UNK> ancient jokes and <UNK> dialogue it's so frustrating because richard e grant is the perfect person to play gordon <UNK> and the film is packed with great actors but it's all for nothing this film made me so angry <UNK> literary history is something to be proud of for its <UNK> complexity and power and what do we do with it we employ bland <UNK> to turn it into soft <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for people who want to feel that they are <UNK> some <UNK> while they drink their <UNK> and quietly <UNK> off
<START> i agree with jerry it's a very underrated space movie of course how many good low budget ones aren't underrated if i remember correctly the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation but not rip off of 2001 because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man who had somehow been turned into a computer and like hal they tried to <UNK> his mind but not the mechanical parts of him and as with hal it led to disaster there is at least one funny moment when the christopher cary character who can't find any food finds the abandoned pet bird there's a kind of ominous moment but then the obvious thing doesn't happen after all
<START> every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies i'll mention titanic and at least a couple people will <UNK> i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie and they're too embarrassed now to admit it br br i just <UNK> titanic for the first time in a long time expecting to simply enjoy the story again i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years i cried again in all the same places it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall yes even more than star wars and today many people won't even admit they enjoyed it folks let's get something straight you don't look cool when you <UNK> this film you look like an out of touch <UNK> br br no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly however none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film br br <UNK> <UNK> and kate <UNK> are wonderful leo is one of the fine actors of his generation wait <UNK> you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy kate <UNK> was so strong in this film the movie really was hers and she held it together beautifully br br james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by <UNK> a completely believable titanic the sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me i was utterly <UNK> br br this film is one memorable scene after another titanic leaving <UNK> in <UNK> rose and jack at the bow flying iceberg right ahead the <UNK> hanging unbelievably out of the ocean the screams of the doomed after she went down and that ending that brought even the <UNK> man in the theater to tears br br the music which has also been a victim of the film's success was a key <UNK> james <UNK> score was simply perfect and the love theme was beautiful and tragic too bad celine <UNK> pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many br br i confess i am a titanic buff as such i <UNK> the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it in all its beauty perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i've had such an interest in the ship all my life however i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never <UNK> the tragedy the film was made with such humanity br br another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic and you will not be disappointed
<START> revolt of the zombies proves that having the same director <UNK> and <UNK> an idea doesn't necessarily make lightning strike twice br br the <UNK> brothers responsible for the horror classic white zombie made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close ups of <UNK> eyes from that previous film there was a court battle with the white zombie film's rights owners who didn't want the <UNK> to be able to use the word <UNK> in this title that word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word <UNK> appear in the title knowing what victor <UNK> was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting it seems he never directed another horror film after this <UNK> the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead but simply <UNK> victims br br wanna create a mind controlled army of zombies be ready to crack a few eggs including your own br br the lame plot man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend whom she loves jealous this sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn't worth spit br br this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments i've ever seen you'd have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming the acting isn't even good this movie makes the <UNK> <UNK> king of the zombies which appeared on the same double bill dvd i bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic it makes the atomic age sci fi alien zombie cheese fest invisible <UNK> seem like a serious drama this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan <UNK> south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama the credits list the ironically named company favorite films i'm not sure whose favorite film this would be but they're obviously an idiot br br not recommended for fans of zombies romance or classic films
<START> it's a colorful slasher movie that's about it br br it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies but i never care for such things <UNK> out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway br br the death scenes were inventive and <UNK> bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th br br another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to <UNK> the surviving girl unlike in scream and <UNK> where it was obvious br br people who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie as simple as that i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same br br <UNK>
<START> i don't know where to begin this movie feels a lot like one of those cheap saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties sort of like captain power or the power rangers it's full of bad digital <UNK> and really cheesy sounding secret <UNK> and villains br br the acting is so bad that it's not even funny the direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity it seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot br br perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car for some reason even though the device is clearly stated as being remote <UNK> the bad guys decide to chase her down on their <UNK> as she drives away this chase carries on all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts standing up on the <UNK> doing <UNK> and so on at one point a crash happens and one of the <UNK> is thrown from his bike we see the bike clearly cgi thrown over the agents car but the rider has <UNK> then a few seconds later the rider and bike return apparently <UNK> by the crash at this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it the <UNK> choose to shoot the agent while driving past then blow up her car which was also clearly done with cgi sound confusing it is and so is the rest of the movie br br i might point out that when i say cgi we aren't talking about lord of the rings type cgi here we're talking the cheap cheesy power rangers type cgi actually i think it would have been done better on power rangers br br why <UNK> and todd did this movie i will never know i can only assume they did for money as a favor to someone or because they were <UNK> into it probably the last one
<START> i think that people are under <UNK> this incredible film people are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1 10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have stephanie <UNK> this is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10 10 for the pure entertainment of the film br br the general view on this movie is that it has bad acting a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this but i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining
<START> i sat through this turkey because i hadn't seen it before and because the premise sounded like it had potential it was mildly entertaining until the <UNK> sequence at the height of the storm the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house yet the trees in the background are perfectly <UNK> and not a <UNK> is moving in fact when the characters move outside the house bright <UNK> is visible <UNK> the <UNK> at that point whatever <UNK> the filmmakers had developed <UNK> faster than the highly <UNK> rain in their film too bad all <UNK> aren't like this one it would surely help our <UNK> insurance rates here in the sunshine state
<START> this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie the acting is excellent considering the script the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding the gore is well done and used <UNK> look out for the excellent <UNK> wire death the action is <UNK> when used it's true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times but compared to other movies on the same or bigger budget it's hardly noticeable at all overall this is recommended trust me it's better than it appears 8 10
<START> although well past the target audience i've always had a soft spot for ya fiction so i was naturally intrigued by the return of nancy drew to the screen br br this is not a bad film the central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with <UNK> of <UNK> for the young sleuth nancy and her friends never take the <UNK> seriously so young audience members will not be upset br br what i really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience br br emma roberts is great as nancy drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery
<START> i watched this on an 8 hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the <UNK> i actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mild br br the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fiancé falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they don't get together but eventually she lets them do it sadly the actual film wasn't as good ok there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on i think the whole gay but not gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasn't really very funny br br in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call
<START> this is very much a television version of the tale the film starts out like an episode of <UNK> ' with little meaningful dialog or character description it does get a bit more <UNK> after a while but all characters are still cartoonish br br <UNK> is the exotic beauty richard harris is an evil and sexually repressed <UNK> <UNK> to bust a nut up in <UNK> the other characters including <UNK> are quite forgettable br br its also a sorta liberal version of the story <UNK> is a <UNK> of enlightenment ideals like the <UNK> in <UNK> of the <UNK> and <UNK> is a champion of liberty the shadowy side of the <UNK> character is ignored though he does pour <UNK> led on people he is really only an <UNK> in that he looks different and enjoys playing with <UNK> more than the average person br br perhaps the film is intended for children but i doubt it considering <UNK> <UNK> himself bloody to <UNK> wanting to <UNK> his monkey a mostly uninteresting and forgettable but not awful and sometimes entertaining rendition of the tale
<START> the movie opens with a flashback to <UNK> county high school on april <UNK> day a group of students play a prank on class nerd marty when they are <UNK> for playing said prank they follow up with a bigger prank which par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class <UNK> goes ridiculously awry leaving marty simultaneously burned by fire and <UNK> by acid for the sake of being <UNK> fast forward five years where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion we find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion <UNK> to the <UNK> of <UNK> from the flashback scene as all of the <UNK> are being stalked and killed by a mysterious <UNK> mask clad murderer in increasingly complicated and mind numbingly ludicrous fashions it doesn't take sherlock holmes to solve the mystery of the killer's identity as it is revealed to be none other than a <UNK> marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and <UNK> in order to <UNK> the school for his revenge scenario the film takes a turn for the bizarre as marty finishes <UNK> his revenge on his former <UNK> only to be haunted by their ghosts marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life finally the film explodes in a <UNK> of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as marty wakes up in a hospital bed breaks free of his <UNK> stabs a nurse and finally <UNK> his own face br br the script is tired and suffers from a <UNK> case of horror movie logic the only originality comes from the mind numbingly convoluted ways that the victims are <UNK> the absurd it was all a dream ending feels tacked on it's almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dream br br technically speaking the film is atrocious some scenes were filmed so dark that i had to pause the film and play with the color on my television the acting is sub par even for slasher films i can't help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them can't bother to keep their accents straight through the movie br br all of this being said if you like bad horror movies you might like this one too it isn't the worst film of the genre but it's far from the best
<START> before the release of george romero's genre defining night of the living dead zombies were relatively well <UNK> creatures they certainly had much better table manners in the old days but social <UNK> aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie going public judging by this film none whatsoever br br the story is about an expedition to cambodia whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of <UNK> one of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army br br this film is basically a love triangle with zombies but seeing as this is a 30's movie the said zombies are more like <UNK> than the flesh eating variety we think of today they seem to respond to mind control rather than <UNK> <UNK> and quite frankly the <UNK> is somewhat <UNK> too the whole thing is really very dull aside from the lack of horror there isn't any over the top melodramatic <UNK> to keep us entertained it seems unlikely that this could've provided much entertainment even 70 years ago see it if you have to see everything with <UNK> in the title but otherwise i would advise skipping this one
<START> <UNK> lamas stars as jack <UNK> kelly an ex vietnam vet and a <UNK> cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods <UNK> atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron <UNK> is third billed and yet has 3 minutes of screen time and even those aren't any good overall a terrible movie but the scenes with <UNK> lamas and <UNK> bell hanging from a tree <UNK> and <UNK> are worth a few unintentional laughs followed by an improved sequel
<START> i just saw dick tracy and i thought it was terrible the paintings in the background of the cities looked awful also the mob characters looked too weird warren beatty didn't do an awful job as dick tracy but it was <UNK> not one of his better performances madonna should just stick to singing <UNK> <UNK> did a good job in this movie i gave this movie a 2 10 just because of the amazing acting by al pacino it wasn't a high note in his career but he still did a good job
<START> one of those thank god i don't live there documentaries this one tells of two <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and the surrounding peoples of <UNK> br br guns drugs and death run rampant the guys no older than 22 not in the middle of fighting a war are in jail the girls  not women girls  always react the same way when one of them is killed with tears and screaming you scratch your head what did they expect really i don't know what's more disturbing the <UNK> shoot outs and civil <UNK> or that everybody just seems to <UNK> accept things as are or seeing that boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer being all of what 10 if you were to take these any of these young men out of their situation and put them some place where they had the opportunity to do more be more how many would choose not to stay br br based on this documentary all i'm afraid
<START> <UNK> moore's character in the movie was selected for the <UNK> because of her looks that was a bad start and the movie went down from there the plot was totally unbelievable the will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough this movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required br br trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence the differences between the <UNK> are what makes life interesting
<START> very smart sometimes shocking i just love it it shoved one more side of david's brilliant talent he impressed me greatly david is the best the movie <UNK> your attention for every second
<START> i'm a <UNK> and grew up in the sixties most of the us series were shown over here original language with subtitles and batman was one of the first i was keen on unfortunately over here it caused a panic <UNK> amongst the mothers because batman was considered as too violent <UNK> compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays so because of my the over protective mothers from the 60s i only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes i got so frustrated i started to collect the comics and <UNK> cards still got them to compensate i even got the view master <UNK> i had an urge to see the <UNK> <UNK> all kids need some kind of hero br br years later i finally got the chance to see the re runs as an adolescent and i enjoyed it tremendously the tongue in cheek acting would have escaped me when i would've watched it as a kid but i understood it at the age of 17 yeah i've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet <UNK> episodes because they haven't released the series on dvd to my knowledge br br this evening i enjoyed return to the bat cave it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside jokes to see adam and burt was a delight and this tv movie is simply fantastic in every aspect they play themselves as they played their parts in the series br br <UNK> to the people who produced this great nostalgic feast i'm gonna watch it again my advice to all batman fans is see it rent it lend it from a friend buy it i'd never expect myself to rate this as 9 10 very well done
<START> <UNK> alley looking a bit <UNK> but only a bit is in this mess along with a man who is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> blond hair and all the premise of the movie is about an older woman 50 who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age <UNK> so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for <UNK> character and why this is included is a mystery the actor who portrays <UNK> brother is so wooden and miscast it was torture to watch their scenes what is there to say about this film avoid it
<START> i saw this movie in 1976 my first year of living in new york i went on to live there for the next 26 years but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie it was part of a <UNK> series as i recall and i've never forgotten it br br there are no sex scenes to speak of just delicate moving extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement all set within a conservative boston i think world war 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war and did not seek out a career and financial independence frances lee <UNK> is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no <UNK> br br there has to be a video of this movie sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video
<START> i have to say although this movie was formulaic throughout with a plot stolen from films like friday the 13th i know what you did last summer this movie wasn't that bad in fact it wasn't as bad as most of the horror films hollywood has released recently the killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that original the cast was mediocre which is to be expected from low budget features but much better than what that much bigger studio <UNK> lions gate has been offering my only real complaint that wasn't due to the film's budget which must have been small was the contrived twist ending i'm sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me the ending was just stupid and tacked on before that i was a little bored but actually enjoying it 4 10
<START> <UNK> space prisoner on space death row manages to <UNK> a space <UNK> and escape to the woods of america where he along with some new found friend try to escape from the <UNK> a female cyborg killing machine made one year after the best movie of fred <UNK> <UNK> career hollywood chainsaw <UNK> this one can't help but feel like a bit of a letdown just as low budget as that earlier film but not nearly as fun as i had with it none of the actors really stood out at me the film is alright for the <UNK> viewer during a rainy saturday afternoon but that's pretty much all it's good for br br my grade d br br where i saw it showtime thriller
<START> since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in <UNK> but first some <UNK> notes from a movie critic br br this animated series is one of those that i grew up with it made my childhood <UNK> it made it awesome miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don't see as much as we did back in the days well on to the review br br <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> which it is called in <UNK> is a great animated series it is much like chip and <UNK> <UNK> and a lot of those old ones so it has that weird feeling surrounding it i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it br br but in my opinion it was very great it came with some kind of message not that wild of a message however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven br br now i don't want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons today we see something like ed <UNK> and eddy or anything else weird like that we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that yet i feel like that we don't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days br br now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like <UNK> being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones give me back my childhood cartoons give them to the kids i have some day give them again
<START> oh man why six degrees is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone if focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions br br when i first heard of this show it didn't caught my attention at all it seemed too ordinary actually then i saw some episodes and loved it first of all the characters they are all well written and different from each other there's a alcohol addicted a woman whose fiancée <UNK> on her a woman who just lost her husband a driver who has a troubled brother and so on unlike what we're used to most of the characters interact with each other in <UNK> like in our daily routines great my favourite ones are mae carlos and <UNK> br br then the cast they are all great jay <UNK> from hostel shows here his acting <UNK> in a more 3d character than his previous work as paxton the other ones give great performances too specially campbell scott who plays steven and bridget <UNK> who plays <UNK> br br well when i came to imdb after watching some episodes i couldn't believe that it got cancelled seriously i can't understand the low ratings br br it's too bad it didn't have more than one season it would really be a good show to follow
<START> i thought i should qualify my position after reading other reviews the movie is not great but it has a lot of great elements the lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great the story is slow and weak but entertaining the acting is bad but no worse than you will find on the <UNK> channel the music is pretty good and the gore is good it has the great leather face in the film and is produced by bruce campbell i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable it was still enjoyable the women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children 13 and up there was no sex scenes i gave it 7 out of 10 and i think that is fair i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do the gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film the devil is quite creepy
<START> lost is the best tv series there is first of all it has great actors and wonderful directing the writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary but after season 3 the writing became highly complex for instance who is <UNK> why are there polar bears on the island what's the fog how did the island disappear who is richard <UNK> a lot of people think that the writers are lost and that they have raised a lot of questions and mysteries that they can't explain i believe these people are wrong i have confidence in the writers i think that if the mysteries are revealed from now all the charm of the series will be gone anyway lost is undeniably the greatest tv series and it will continue to be for a long time
<START> this is a german film from 1974 that is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that i can't really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is i can tell you that there's several women who also <UNK> as servants at this particular castle who strip put on body paint and <UNK> to <UNK> like they were at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> though and that seems to be a good portion of the run time of this film yeah there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires and there's some girl on girl stuff etc but the main focus seems to be the painted babes <UNK> away in the basement i did rather like the eye rolling of one of the main <UNK> devil <UNK> that <UNK> an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evil looking was that <UNK> the evil lesbian as billed in the credits no matter if you aren't too <UNK> about your lesbian devil <UNK> movies you might like this otherwise it's pretty dull stuff and i couldn't even finish it i was so bored 3 out of 10
<START> although i had heard this film was a little dry i watch whatever scott <UNK> is in at the start of this film i had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable scott gets girl ending and until 20 minutes before the end it was going great the plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever i kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible <UNK> right up until when the credits rolled and i realised that there was not going to be a happy and <UNK> ending unfortunately i was left <UNK> that i'd watched it and <UNK> putting on some quantum leap to <UNK> my faith in the goodness of the great scott
<START> as is often the case films about self loathing characters do not usually make for good drama <UNK> <UNK> is no exception it's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet br br the protagonist is nancy maria <UNK> who is married to albert <UNK> <UNK> albert is a successful <UNK> <UNK> who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully <UNK> to various bars and bar <UNK> unlike most human beings albert has virtually no positive attributes except for his ability to be successful in the business world throughout the film albert has a grim and <UNK> expression on his face he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and <UNK> to <UNK> prostitutes when his wife asks for sex he <UNK> her by <UNK> in her presence instead br br nancy is equally one note as a character not only has she had a <UNK> 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film her self loathing takes the form of self <UNK> and a result she's forced into therapy however she has such contempt for her <UNK> that no progress can be made br br finally nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet he's sort of a <UNK> <UNK> who has sex with women for money while <UNK> massive amounts of pain to boot it's revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them the children's mother no longer wants anything to do with him br br <UNK> plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her there's a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while <UNK> her <UNK> area with a broken piece of glass these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club it seems that louis has a two <UNK> plan in going to see albert 1 <UNK> him for his treatment of nancy and 2 enjoy the beating he receives it takes awhile before louis will reveal <UNK> <UNK> he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future <UNK> fate of course is that louis finally ended up <UNK> her to death but showed some <UNK> first as he made it clear that he had some <UNK> for her we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for <UNK> murder br br what exactly are we to take away from a film such as <UNK> nancy are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence is that the main point of the film is sympathy for nancy actually <UNK> i don't think so the film's writers create a straw man in the character of <UNK> who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for <UNK> decline but are people so one dimensional in real life i think not they have the repulsive louis a man who makes a living by <UNK> pain come over and <UNK> albert for <UNK> nancy furthermore his expressions of love towards nancy before he kills her is supposed to show his <UNK> <UNK> br br in the end it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their <UNK> lie with the various characters in the film they are so bent on <UNK> their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence that <UNK> nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography
<START> i admit not being that fond of oliver as a young child it's long and the story is a little slow moving because of all the musical numbers as a teenager i discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of oliver twist think of it as a celebration of the classic story the adaptation is loose at best but really if you're watching a musical you ain't there for the story br br the music is the core of this movie and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy most or all of the cast was involved in the stage version of the musical and it shows in their performances and i consider this a plus the performances are all in a more <UNK> style of acting typical of much older films and they are very entertaining the exception is the kid playing oliver whose job seemed to be to look cute and stay out of the real <UNK> way br br fagin and the <UNK> are the real stars of this movie oliver reed also does a fantastic job maintaining an <UNK> screen presence as the menacing bill sykes even <UNK> dog <UNK> puts on a good performance br br this movie isn't for everyone people who hate musicals will despise it as will those who take musicals too seriously <UNK> over <UNK> historical details or <UNK> exaggerated stage type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone's enjoyment just sit back and enjoy the entertainment it's much better if you remember that as a musical it's a fantasy loosely organized around the book not a strict adaptation
<START> i didn't really go into reign over me knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story the plot was easy enough to understand i suppose this guy's whole family died in 9 11 and he <UNK> the world out of his life alright i didn't know if it was going to use the <UNK> of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it and it really doesn't on a very obvious level so if you're scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours i wouldn't worry about it i think the writing even made a point never to <UNK> mention september the <UNK> br br overall i was impressed it was a very moving picture the movie has a sense of humor and it is very sharp but it is definitely a drama where it counts i typically don't like to think that comedic actors are incapable of actually acting but sometimes let's be honest they are adam sandler is definitely capable of it and though i think so you may disagree jim carrey is also very well rounded sometimes <UNK> portrayal of charlie <UNK> took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable i read many reviews that criticized the writing of alan <UNK> don cheadle in another excellent role if not one that seems similar to a few of his more recent pictures wife who is played well by <UNK> <UNK> smith calling her static and dull but that is completely untrue br br she has depth but some of it gets hidden behind the main story which does drift in and out of focus occasionally which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie with a weird make everything out of focus <UNK> after about the first 40 minutes they aren't used anymore maybe it's significant for the characters <UNK> artistically or maybe they just realized how irritating it was the film gradually begins to reveal to us the point one of several but definitely the most explicit of the story which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way maybe it seems <UNK> to us maybe it seems downright <UNK> but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget to just exist the films soundtrack was excellent and it used music to pursue and <UNK> <UNK> rather than establish them which gives credit to the actors and the writers br br the movie takes it's name from the song love reign <UNK> me off of the who's rock opera <UNK> the song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story but it is used <UNK> in the movie over the course of the climax and at the very end the movie is paced well and does not feel like it's dragging anywhere in it's length which is a little over 2 hours if you can accept adam <UNK> portrayal of this deeply <UNK> and broken down man you will enjoy the movie you will become <UNK> in the story and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it it is not the best movie of the year and there's nothing groundbreaking or positively amazing in it but it's a very enjoyable watchable movie all in all
<START> saying a film is depressing isn't necessarily a bad thing i'm very willing to watch a depressing film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one it's the often heartbreaking story of a chinese man and his family as they experience many years of both <UNK> and plenty but i must warn you that this might just be about the most depressing film to come out of hollywood in the 1930s because <UNK> life in china was tough to say the least be prepared to watch segments about <UNK> death and disease br br about the only negative other than the <UNK> tone of misery is that the lead is played by paul muni while he was an exceptionally talented man it's just a real shame that hollywood always cast people of european descent to play asian leads during this era if you are paying attention at all it's pretty obvious that muni is wrong for the part
<START> i stumbled upon nine dead recently and read the current reviews thinking i could deal with an average movie this movie however was slightly below average yet watchable the script was poorly written and the acting was at average for a b level movie with a couple standing out as pretty good the plot borders on that of saw teach people what they did wrong in a situation and try to make them appreciate life more but that is really where the comparison ends nine dead tries to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new the main fault that i found in nine dead was the slap in the face to the viewer of flashbacks that occurred 3 minutes before in the film and were completely unnecessary and a completely <UNK> ending that people won't see coming in a bad way <UNK> any spoilers i have seen the worse of bad movies and even they didn't end this poorly decent flick bad acting and ending though
<START> i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in 1969 it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x of course at that time x meant maturity since i was only two years old at the time of the movie's release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then however when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution the title itself was <UNK> for a male prostitute homosexuality loneliness physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release it is worth noting that in the 1970's midnight cowboy was <UNK> to an r rating and even though it is still rated r some of the scenes could almost be rated pg 13 by today's standards br br i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city <UNK> rich women he <UNK> cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy con man named <UNK> ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager once again joe is <UNK> and before long is homeless however joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a <UNK> apartment without giving away much more of the plot i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams i e joe making it as a <UNK> and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health br br i want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is excellent especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes in fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny i find them amusing for example there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over dustin hoffman <UNK> on the cab and says hey i'm <UNK> here i'm <UNK> here i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named <UNK> what is amusing is that at first we think <UNK> is there to <UNK> <UNK> and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that <UNK> is nothing but a religious nut in addition to the two scenes i mentioned i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only <UNK> <UNK> and joe says in self defense john wayne you gonna tell me he's a <UNK> what i like is the delivery in that scene br br i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late <UNK> much of it rings true today that's because although the area around <UNK> street in new york has been <UNK> up in the form of <UNK> in the last several years <UNK> is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams <UNK> as was the case with the jon voight character one thing that <UNK> me about jon <UNK> character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie he had <UNK> a great deal and that ratso dustin <UNK> character was a good influence on him br br in conclusion i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on for example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings also what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon <UNK> character and the people who were in his life in texas even the ending while i don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather open ended
<START> ok i caught this film halfway through but oh dear god it sounds like they're all reading from scripts br br especially that guy who is now in teachers and the book group although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a <UNK> of bad film making both in terms of acting scripting and general <UNK> it quite clearly appears to be a cash in on human traffic but whilst that is not the best film ever it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest yet hopeless <UNK> students trying to get a pass grade not so much as human traffic as a bit of a car crash
<START> can we say retarded this girl has no talent what so ever nothing but complete garbage you people are just <UNK> 10 stars because you know most people hate this pathetic woman if its such a great show then why did it get canceled after 6 <UNK> episodes exactly people that support her please seek help you do not know what is funny her stand up comedy is just so stupid seriously how do you find this trash funny the show tries to poke fun at <UNK> types and other things that are not funny at all carlos <UNK> is funny and to that stupid poster he actually has fans and his show is on the air so i'm sorry your a redneck who <UNK> get his jokes please give me my 20 minutes of my life back
<START> for 50 years after world war 2 the united states was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests at the same time because of the draft and wars everyone in society had served or was connected to someone who had br br this allowed for a <UNK> based on the notion of american <UNK> in the midst of an <UNK> military machine sometimes that machine was non us military for example in prisoner of war situations once removed are stories in other machines science fiction and corporate but they always reference this military genre and indeed the <UNK> shots of action even reference their comic sibling br br you can trace it i think perhaps starting in the comic meaning <UNK> sections of the great escape which immediately <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> then a second wave <UNK> by catch 22 and mash both of which had been real life then books then movies and in the mash case then <UNK> br br but before all that there was the phil <UNK> show about a sergeant <UNK> and this followed from mister roberts a happy con man who only committed harmless crimes and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life this was in the day when <UNK> shows <UNK> you absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to <UNK> about it wasn't particularly clever in any way except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom br br its one large zone where americans worked out how they think about forgivable even endearing lies in a military context a zone that has been <UNK> by one of our political parties here br br because its big it sometimes pays off in laughs <UNK> was pretty darn funny i thought it had the twist of the <UNK> actually <UNK> serious <UNK> sort of <UNK> in some dirty dozen and sexual adventure br br now this well before the cultural wars <UNK> it tries to touch that sweet spot like other remakes that <UNK> steve martin it is so unfunny you actually root for the army to be the stronger player yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power br br ted's <UNK> 1 of 3 you can find something better to do with this part of your life
<START> i have seen about a thousand horror films my favorite type this film is among the worst for me an idea drives a movie so even a poorly acted cheaply made movie can be good something weird is definitely cheaply made however it has little to say i still don't understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film something weird has little to offer save yourself the pain
<START> this movie is really funny the general is keaton's finest work but there are many of his works that are more hilarious in this one are multiple sight gags and creative humor we watch it over and over and it only seems to get funnier
<START> not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts br br makeup that a child can do acting was over done poor directing editing was very choppy many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous sound was badly dubbed music was highly inappropriate casting was extremely off must have been on crack zombies that talk let alone drive dance work just <UNK> me off and the bad guy holy crap as horribly casted as he was he was the best looking zombie of all which doesn't say much br br the cover art was good but very <UNK> as was the main menu of the dvd great artwork and music br br don t bother
<START> reviews for this film were <UNK> at best while expectations were sky high a big budget tons of popular faces a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves the end result is a disaster alice <UNK> supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it's audience i didn't hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation going through it's page thin story line and one dimensional characters without a single spark not a sign of the magic it wished it had the 90 minutes of film here are <UNK> with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn't seem that great an idea on the set let alone on paper <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> of comic sketches linked together with a very thin <UNK> of good ideas avoid or boredom will haunt you
<START> this was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues it dealt with issues of <UNK> and class but it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself this movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny it also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society what others think of you is not important i believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it the actors i think were able to convey each character wonderfully i just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was at a just <UNK> look you wouldn't see how deep the movie is but on further look you see the <UNK> meaning of the movie
<START> ugh what can i say other than ugh i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires this movie could not have been any <UNK> lacking not only in plot but the acting is atrocious combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch many times i <UNK> my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark here's a <UNK> of the <UNK> aspects br br spoilers br br professional <UNK> insists on sleeping <UNK> by himself at night he wakes up to a woman crying sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere he immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance she goes from crying to <UNK> him and he lets it happen with obvious results br br one of the main characters is <UNK> was bitten by a vampire but as long as she takes these experimental <UNK> she got in mexico city she's fine although her body <UNK> is below room <UNK> br br guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires hero leaves the next day he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left br br avoid this movie
<START> i'm not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james <UNK> novel the <UNK> always rings twice i'm not even sure if <UNK> acquired the <UNK> rights but the resulting movie is definitely interesting it is not the best version of <UNK> story i like the 1981 version best but thanks to <UNK> excellent direction and the casting of clara <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> a very sensual couple it is a must for noir fans visconti mixes <UNK> with noir sensibilities to great effect the film is not perfect though my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good the story moves at a very slow pace i don't think visconti was very good at editing his films i think film noir works better with a short running time fortunately <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> actors that keep the viewer interested anyhow as much as i like this film and the remakes i think no one has made the definitive version of <UNK> much praised book
<START> kate beckinsale is as good if not better than gwyneth paltrow as emma in this movie although i really liked gwyneth paltrow in the other emma version they're both good in different ways kate beckinsale as emma seems more interesting almost though and i liked the woman who played harriet smith in this movie better too she was more <UNK> sweet and sentimental there are certain things i like better about the gwyneth paltrow version though like how the humorous side is more apparent
<START> this movie barely followed the story line of the movie all of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie they ended up turning it into a cheesy <UNK> disney movie crush story between meg and <UNK> it was so bad it should have been <UNK> duff playing the part or one of the likes this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and <UNK> of the book i can't believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap basic rendition if you've ever read the book i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of lord of the rings <UNK> this movie should have never been able to use the title of a <UNK> in time poorly done
<START> of all the kung fu films made through the 70's and 80's this is one that has developed a real cult following with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story an aging kung fu master tells his last <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about five <UNK> he has trained in the past all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently their <UNK> in kung fu is the name they have adopted like lizard snake <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants <UNK> to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target <UNK> does not know what they look like so he has to <UNK> in society and try and figure out who they are <UNK> has discovered that the snake is hung <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and along with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is the <UNK> they kill a family to find the map a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the <UNK> but know one knows who he is a local policeman named ho <UNK> sin philip <UNK> <UNK> the murders along with his partner ma <UNK> <UNK> sun sin has a friend called li ho <UNK> lo who is the <UNK> and they do know of each others identity the snake <UNK> the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed when sin finds out he teams up with <UNK> and together they go to combat <UNK> and <UNK> br br this film was directed by <UNK> chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films chang was not your run of the mill kung fu director and his films always had a special quality to them while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of <UNK> stories were in a class all by themselves i wouldn't exactly put it in the same league as enter the dragon because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he <UNK> were more authentic looking this film still has some impossible <UNK> like <UNK> to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn't necessarily about fight scenes its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved that alone makes this different from all the other kung fu films very well made with a unique story
<START> this movie was one of the funniest movie i've seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me not since my big fat greek wedding 2002 has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense easily has intricate as last year's mr and mrs smith 2005 in its use of parody espionage in mr and mrs smith and sex in my super ex girlfriend director's <UNK> <UNK> balance between comedy and drama between crazy and downright ludicrous is great never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy at the same time this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance in some ways it's so evident that it's great to see how it plays out just like in real life sometimes the truth is so evident that one can't really see it easily eight out of ten stars <UNK> up there with <UNK> 1982 possibly a nine depends on how it appears on a second viewing
<START> after witnessing his wife linda hoffman engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy the already somewhat unstable dentist dr feinstone corbin bernsen completely <UNK> which means deep trouble for his patients br br this delightful semi original and entertaining horror flick from director brian <UNK> was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror <UNK> that was passed out in the late nineties although <UNK> <UNK> is intended to be a cheesy fun little film <UNK> <UNK> that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to <UNK> despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days the movie is intriguing generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest even during the more ludicrous of moments <UNK> <UNK> suffers on occasion from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel there are only <UNK> uninteresting moments and in general the movie follows itself nicely br br corbin bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic deranged and <UNK> dr alan feinstone the way bernsen is able to <UNK> <UNK> his lines especially with regards to the <UNK> and <UNK> of sex particularly <UNK> is something short of marvellous while many actors may have trouble portraying a <UNK> obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable had <UNK> <UNK> not been intended to be a fun almost comical horror movie <UNK> performance would probably have been much more powerful sadly the rest of the cast including a pre fame mark <UNK> failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick br br <UNK> <UNK> is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable particularly i would presume for fans of cheesy horror those who became annoyed at the number of <UNK> 1996 <UNK> from the late nineties may very well find this a refreshing change as i did a seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some <UNK> direction helps to make <UNK> <UNK> one of the more <UNK> cheesy horrors from the 1990's on top of this we are presented with some particularly <UNK> and on the whole realistic scenes of dental torture which should keep most <UNK> happy far from perfect but far from bad as well <UNK> <UNK> is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once my rating for <UNK> <UNK>  6 5 10
<START> i wouldn't give this movie a rating it's not worthy i watched it only because i'm a <UNK> fan i love her and would watch anything she made even in this dud she didn't disappoint every scene with her in it kept the viewer watching waiting for something to happen but nothing ever did it had some good story lines but they ended abruptly as soon as it started some of the other characters had potential but nothing became of it br br <UNK> was <UNK> when she made this film and at her most lovely the wardrobe and set was surprisingly good br br i can watch mostly anything and rarely come across a movie i can't find something to like about it but this was a dud i don't understand br br the worst thing about it all it had a big cliff <UNK> at the end it had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow this film is finally going some place then the credits roll good grief br br i agree with the review that said 99 would have bought 3 <UNK> of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting well said actually that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well i too wasted 99 cents on this dud dud dud
<START> this movie seems to send the wrong message there can be morality without using christ <UNK> of other <UNK> i believe can get into heaven i am a catholic who goes to church every week but i do not agree with such christian arrogance this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i've seen <UNK>
<START> this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen yes it's even worse than <UNK> and dragons and any film starring kevin <UNK> br br chris rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film and his supporting actors didn't even look like they were trying to act chris rock is a wonderful stand up comedian but he just can't transfer his talent to this film which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture br br if you haven't watched this film yet avoid it like the plague go do something <UNK> and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall br br for <UNK> efforts i give it a 2 10 br br
<START> well what can it be said about this disaster i watched it because it aired on cable i regret for wasting my time but at least i didn't waste money br br the creature is the <UNK> you can get please you need to be very generous not to get <UNK> by the cheap halloween costume oh well there are also displays of horrible acting f x and dialogues the confrontation with the creature is unbelievable you can't get a more pathetic scene br br this is the worst you can get from direct to video flicks creature unknown makes full moon pictures movies look like halloween br br avoid this one at all costs please the only positive thing about this trash are the sexy women
<START> roommates sugar and bobby lee are <UNK> by menacing <UNK> while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on all that just pretty much <UNK> a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a <UNK> family br br this one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank <UNK> who truly deserved much much better as much as i didn't like <UNK> that's on the same dvd i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kane br br eye candy one pair of tits they might belong to kirsten baker br br my grade f br br dark sky dvd extras vintage ads for various drive in food and trailers for <UNK> kids features nudity the <UNK> girls part time wife features nudity psychic killer eaten alive the dvd also comes with <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is an insult to all <UNK> it was stupid it appeared to have been written by monkeys the acting was absurd if this is the view most people have of the navy then i <UNK> for our defense this movie was awful i put it below voyage to the bottom of the sea as far as submarine movies go gene hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap denzel washington must have been high little in the plot makes any sense and the ending for a <UNK> to be rewarded for his crime only hollywood would think of this garbage if you haven't figured it out yet i didn't like it and if it wasn't for all the pro comments i would not have bothered to post
<START> the film adaptation of james <UNK> <UNK> is excellent the actors the voice overs the direction it all captures the feel of the novel without <UNK> its own merits the milo <UNK> does an excellent job as leopold bloom the <UNK> man married to the sassy molly i absolutely love this picture
<START> steve chris hoffman <UNK> a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother wes went missing while they are there a <UNK> creature in the shape of a man reminded me a lot of the <UNK> from creature from the black <UNK> <UNK> in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one a biker ellen <UNK> type time female bad ass <UNK> chase masterson has an underground military <UNK> she practices experiments in while it also serves as a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage <UNK> knows more than she's telling she also suffered the loss of a child but there's another novelty twist most of the group have no idea of this creature might just be more human than they realize and it's former identity might shed some light on a deception only one other person has been hiding since <UNK> death <UNK> holds the key to many of the mysteries that <UNK> as the group remains near the cabin br br thankfully a large portion of the film stays away from the creature which leaps in the air while we also see a <UNK> screen when we look through it's eyes the film has <UNK> creek type <UNK> which often <UNK> any real tension that needs to build in a little monster movie the direction is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of <UNK> scares the cast is rather life less and uninteresting pretty maggie grace the fog remake might be the only draw for this film
<START> this movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent i've lived in <UNK> for <UNK> years and i know that people don't have a southern accent here this movie is about a guy who does <UNK> and i don't know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about it has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it's really insulting so see these people use <UNK> like it was sugar i lost my brother to <UNK> and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it <UNK> the drug the movie makes it look cool to use the drug but i was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line i also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don't want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day the movie is just wrong in all directions i would suggest the basketball <UNK> if i was going to suggest a movie about drugs
<START> of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film from that point of view it is utter fantasy but who cares it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane <UNK> <UNK> and all the other films the <UNK> tell us we should be watching films like this are worth a hundred citizen <UNK> it is about what cinema does best great camera work great settings and great performances br br the three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented keeping the best till last br br i will gladly watch this film again and again and again and
<START> thanks to the bbc for this show i used to suffer from an <UNK> complex i hated leaving the house talking to new people and i had an overwhelming sense that people hated me however after watching one episode of 4 non <UNK> my <UNK> started to change after episode 2 i started <UNK> for new jobs wearing <UNK> clothes and i actually felt talented when the series had finished i was running the sales department at work <UNK> a <UNK> of women and frequently won the <UNK> competition down my local if you ever have a confidence crisis and don't know where to turn then take a trip down to <UNK> and pick up the dvd it's only <UNK>
<START> why panic never got a good theatrical release is easily seen it's much too smart and audiences would have probably had a difficult time with it comparing it to american beauty in its <UNK> of a <UNK> crisis and sopranos and analyze this in it's study of illegal goings on amidst family life though panic may seem to <UNK> from unoriginal material <UNK> <UNK> characters coupled with <UNK> dialogue and <UNK> direction make the film a realistic look at the <UNK> of a middle aged man br br william h macy stars as alex a <UNK> who works for his father's sutherland contract killing business he leads a double life with his wife <UNK> and son unaware of his real trade in his middle age he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life under his calm <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> repressed <UNK> for his father's controlling grasp on his life when he meets a young woman campbell he feels <UNK> and decides it's time to quit the family business br br the fact that writer director henry <UNK> decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contract killing is <UNK> he could have easily <UNK> it with any <UNK> profession his characters are so well developed and believable scenes handled so smoothly and <UNK> and dialogue written so <UNK> and naturally that the focus falls on <UNK> conflicted character rather than his job as a <UNK> <UNK> script feels like a shakespearean tragedy with a definite theme of destiny running throughout br br in alex macy creates a tragic easily sympathetic character and turns in yet another brooding great performance as can always be expected donald sutherland is also effectively <UNK> and abusive as his overbearing father and <UNK> dramatic turn as <UNK> wife is a welcome change for the comedian consider a scene in a <UNK> shop where her mood subtly <UNK> and peaks in an affecting scene of emotional confusion br br henry <UNK> first feature panic is a film that is well crafted in its sincerity with a first rate cast a plausible script <UNK> dialogue and nice direction this character study is hopefully just a taste of <UNK> <UNK> for creating characters that seem real br br 8 out of 10
<START> this makes the third errol morris movie i've seen and i'm increasingly not liking his style he seems to find very interesting and varied characters great personalities to create documentaries for and then with tongue in cheek editing make fun of everything they are about it's never really a direct <UNK> of them and morris seems most of the time to be saying but no no these people are really fascinating really but there's always these subtle little <UNK> angles and not so subtle editing techniques that show that morris seems to be mocking them behind their back br br this movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of <UNK> <UNK> a man who studies african <UNK> <UNK> to find that they are amazingly <UNK> like a lion <UNK> a man who keeps a garden full of animal shaped <UNK> and a robot designer the general theme of the film seems to <UNK> around the question of what <UNK> animal human and life features so the title of fast cheap out of control doesn't really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie right except of course morris seems just a little disturbed by these <UNK> passions he might call them <UNK> making <UNK> designs on life i share not that fear and honestly don't appreciate some of the connections morris makes in the film br br but i stress his subtlety with no voice over narration and leaving the words entirely to the <UNK> it's not as if morris ever pounds that anxiety onto the <UNK> collective head instead he mixes circus footage and <UNK> footage together often at times when they're taken out of the context of the circus and the ants showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about i don't find them absurd i find them all very neat and interesting individuals br br unless of course he didn't intend such <UNK> which means he's just a bad <UNK> instead of a silent <UNK> considering none of this films i've seen so far have particularly impressed me i don't really care to find out what he's trying to do br br <UNK>
<START> this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and <UNK> and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen the film is superbly shot i love the cinematography in this it feels fresh and original plot wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall dark city and the matrix and its pretty <UNK> sci fi stuff morgan sullivan jeremy northam is a <UNK> who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for <UNK> a large technological corporation he meets up with a <UNK> officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and <UNK> him on what he has to do it basically involves going to <UNK> of rival companies and recording them via a satellite <UNK> device disguised as a pen it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife after his first job things become strange his <UNK> change his personality begins to <UNK> and he suffers pains in his neck and <UNK> as well as nightmares he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster played by an <UNK> cast lucy liu he takes an instant attraction to however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the <UNK> all work for <UNK> the <UNK> are all covers to allow the company men to <UNK> their spies sullivan whose alternate name is jack <UNK> has been given an <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> and while the rest of the spies at the latest <UNK> drift off into what seems like a brain dead day dream while the <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> send all the <UNK> to sleep via <UNK> messages suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at <UNK> come in shining lights in all the <UNK> eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and <UNK> the <UNK> into believing they are someone else <UNK> are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while <UNK> their own existence sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack <UNK> <UNK> want to steal information from their rivals <UNK> and they want their own puppets to do it they now effectively control what these spies do except for sullivan when <UNK> get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been <UNK> they decide to use him as a <UNK> to spy on <UNK> make sullivan a double agent they know that <UNK> have sent <UNK> to them to work his way into <UNK> and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to <UNK> important company information that could shut the company down <UNK> realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with <UNK> and allow <UNK> to <UNK> their <UNK> but they will give <UNK> a dodgy disc that will ruin their system the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a <UNK> he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him when a mysterious third party becomes involved the person it is revealed that foster works for sullivan must decide whether to go to this <UNK> agent who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for the tension all builds to a <UNK> climax as it seems just about everyone wants to <UNK> of him once his <UNK> has <UNK> the cast are great northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent he brings a great visual aspect to his performance his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to <UNK> lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact the rest of the cast are also good br br director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci fi flick cube has a real visual flair he <UNK> the film superbly as well and has given it a great look for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn't great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film <UNK> the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci fi films it is up there with them the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this that is where the <UNK> and lynch influence is evident the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states 1 2 br br
<START> i missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look so when i saw it on the shelves in dvd i thought time to watch it big mistake br br a long list of stars cannot save this turkey surely one of the worst movies ever an incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented perhaps it would have made more sense if i'd read <UNK> novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel and with robbins <UNK> in the screenplay i doubt it the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well br br i hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately dvd <UNK> take for example pat <UNK> even thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times br br save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile like <UNK> your <UNK> or <UNK> out your <UNK> <UNK> even when you see it in the under 5 throw away bin at your local store resist the urge
<START> <UNK> most lavish production sacrifices little of his talent for <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> of suffering in long mobile takes that somehow also act as social <UNK> here it's much more overt since the story takes place in war torn germany at the end of wwii and the central character is a woman <UNK> <UNK> as maria who <UNK> on <UNK> both economic and gender related to <UNK> herself up the ladder of a prominent <UNK> <UNK> that makes <UNK> goods like <UNK> available to <UNK> workers as she once was married amidst allied air <UNK> maria and her new husband <UNK> are allowed a brief honeymoon before he's <UNK> out to the russian front in his absence her despair is great she spends most days at the train station waiting for him to return when he is reported dead she abruptly stops <UNK> and takes a job as a <UNK> prostitute at a <UNK> <UNK> to american <UNK> br br when he returns things get plenty messy as circumstances and his sense of noble self sacrifice <UNK> to keep them apart the message is <UNK> m o <UNK> large <UNK> is <UNK> than death ' but not only is maria <UNK> with her own sanity and a husband largely incapable of loving her but a country in deep <UNK> with no discernible light at the end of the tunnel fassbinder is making some kind of statement on post war germany selling out to the highest <UNK> but as with all his films i tend to block those elements out and focus on the unbearable passions on display <UNK> as <UNK> through his characters his actors' as <UNK> through their real life connections with fassbinder taken together his films can be either unbearable or <UNK> <UNK> often at once this falls somewhere in between although definitely closer to the latter while i didn't like it quite as much as the bitter tears of <UNK> von <UNK> or <UNK> maria <UNK> certainly has a greater scope and what's more i could feel its passion and authentic detail to human emotions
<START> this movie is trash poor it has horrible taste and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real events which doesn't add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out of place not sure what robin williams saw in this character or story to start williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship <UNK> nor is the relationship itself interesting what's worse his character is compelled by an ugly <UNK> story that is base and has no place as a plot device you have an older <UNK> culkin <UNK> <UNK> d <UNK> <UNK> in good fun which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the williams character finally you have sandra oh as a guardian angel <UNK> to williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end toni <UNK> character is just plain annoying and a re <UNK> of her <UNK> sense performance with <UNK> direction very miss able
<START> this is not a love song br br my one word summary of this film would be <UNK> br br it probably won't appeal to the mass movie watching public  it's a br br film that forces you to participate you observe think and question br br comparisons could be made with deliverance topic theme and br br perhaps with the blair witch project for overall filming style br br however this film stands unique against both br br the cinematography effects <UNK> freeze frame <UNK> etc br br have been seen before but they are used most effectively in this br br film to <UNK> the natural tension of the story br br acting is raw menacing and utterly believable br br the real theme of the film is about friendship the title really gives br br the game away it's probably not the kind of friendship that most of br br us have experienced or indeed would want to br br it is a love song
<START> this is the best film version of <UNK> classic tale i've seen it over and over on vhs and recently acquired the dvd version which is <UNK> for tv not wide screen what i find interesting about this <UNK> is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films shows in north america since 1984 my biggest surprise is edward <UNK> the <UNK> as the ghost of christmas present
<START> i originally saw this very dark comedy around 2000 or so on cable tv what a surprise and delight everyone is <UNK> armed in this movie dreyfuss plays the mental don remember the new york don who was supposed to be <UNK> art <UNK> life or vice versa diane lane and ellen <UNK> are at their most beautiful and not to be <UNK> with thus proving that beauty and <UNK> do go together then there is the great <UNK> scene between <UNK> and jeff goldblum rita and mickey where they <UNK> play off the world <UNK> this film is both subtle and bald for all the shooting it can be a very quiet film and you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or near final roles joey bishop richard <UNK> henry <UNK> it is not a film for everyone but if you like a film that has a lot of word play and keeps moving without blowing up everything in sight this is the film for you roger ebert <UNK> on this film he's flat wrong this is a fine fine film maybe just not one for ebert i consider it as a 10 because of how well it is done and how funny the script can be while not really being a straight comedy kind of film i like it so well that i bought it on dvd because it just doesn't get shown very much on cable tv now it's all mine
<START> michelle <UNK> was made for this movie when i first saw her in fast and the furious you could tell that she was a tough woman with this movie she has not only <UNK> her acting but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie she is more a bad girl and that's what i like about her this movie is about a troubled girl living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family as she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers <UNK> to train her even though they don't think she has the potential they get to be shown <UNK> wrong br br i think this movie was a little slow at the ending but was well done it shows that people can do anything even if they don't think you have the potential i recommend it to be seen
<START> i am oh <UNK> glad i have not spent money to go to the cinema on it it is nothing more than <UNK> of elements of few other classic titles like the thing final fantasy the <UNK> etc framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario i really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless moreover there is nothing to watch the <UNK> look like there were taken from a second hand store you generally saw all of them in other movies but it is definitely a good <UNK>
<START> this movie was a long build up with no climax people whom refer to the <UNK> in the end as great must either be out of their minds or have none way too often this movie got soft i am not saying that soft movies are bad but no matter how fond you are of sugar it should have no space on a t bone <UNK> this movie was supposed to be about vengeance for crimes committed against a culture but it ended up being a petty bar <UNK> and there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was tim <UNK> character and yes he plays him well rob roy was a weak hero with no knowledge of how to use a sword and the way he won was a disgrace as a drama this movie had it's periods but the best performance in it has to go the nature of scotland this is one tad breath short of being <UNK> as soap in my book
<START> an excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman one of the cop <UNK> killed her but all the <UNK> seems to <UNK> the other <UNK> the unlucky <UNK> <UNK> know who is the other lover that could have killed her and <UNK> <UNK> know either that <UNK> had an affair with the girl <UNK> must absolutely find the killer and what a great ending highly recommended
<START> if you want to make a movie like this have the threat be real don't surround your <UNK> with a bunch of <UNK> there is no credibility here the plot is dull and unbelievable the acting is even worse i thought that i was watching arthur lake <UNK> who is one of the worst actors in history when i saw the main character oh well at some point he has to face the music and get fighting mad i don't care do you there are all these long scenes set in this <UNK> office the furniture made out of cardboard or <UNK> people talk and smoke and don't do anything most of the action happens in a five minute sequence after that it's over don't bother
<START> in my honest opinion everyone should see this movie at least once it really put things in perspective as i watched it though it was fictional this movie is about something that could happen to your children br br it shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school and their plans to murder innocent students this film would not have worked in any other format they pulled off the hand held camera perfectly br br it reminds us of april 20th 1999 when eric harris and dylan <UNK> murdered 12 students and then themselves it also reminds us of the media storm that followed after everyone wanted to see the <UNK> video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes br br this movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true we get to see the kid behind the monster br br the only bad thing about this movie is that it did not do well on the market and few people even know it existed if it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about zero day br br i believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it the shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film because it mostly focuses on cal and andre and what they did up to that point br br if you have not yet seen this movie go rent it and watch it i guarantee that when it is finished you will be speechless
<START> ok me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b movies since we do them ourselves anyway the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with <UNK> and stuff and tom <UNK> there is just no way this movie can fail right wrong it just seems like such a waste there was really no story the dialog was terrible is anyone there x 1000 the characters were well they really lacked any kind of personality the effects were terrible and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff we were sitting the whole movie waiting for something anything to happen but no oh here comes the <UNK> great oh they're kissing again and now for the violence ok nothing really happens again oh now they run around and the closeups of eyes again oh <UNK> tom <UNK> oh he died right ok maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen no oh cool a severed head the end oh crap and finally since i'm so full of myself i'll tell you this give me a van six actors a weird looking house tom <UNK> a couple of naked girls with <UNK> and <UNK> of blood and i could make the coolest movie you've ever seen i've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects better acting and a better script than this what is this <UNK> guy doing making cool movies is easy it could have been so great i'm really upset
<START> vince <UNK> high school has a new principal the evil ms <UNK> mary <UNK> she <UNK> to <UNK> rock and roll music all together she <UNK> head with riff randall p j soles who loves the ramones also the head of the school football team vincent van <UNK> can't seem to connect with any girl not realizing cute kate <UNK> <UNK> young is in love with him br br an instant midnight movie this was put in general release and almost immediately bombed but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s i remember attending more than a few of those when i was in college it was like a party people were singing along with the songs laughing <UNK> at every joke and generally just having fun br br seeing it now as an adult i can't imagine why i loved this so much the script is juvenile and full of <UNK> that i couldn't believe i was hearing characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place what saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by soles and <UNK> who is really enjoying herself also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles way over the top as they should as for the ramones i was never a fan i do like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me if you're a ramones fan you might give this a higher rating br br spoiler warning this is mostly for kids it has a pg rating who will probably find it silly but fun i especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up spoiler end br br so if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this otherwise stay away i give it a 7
<START> i watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend i got my judgment teeth pulled out so i didn't feel very good br br i ended up liking it big time it's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship <UNK> betrayal power money drug traffic and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail br br the acting is on it's prime level two of the women that i lust the most star and that's a good thing claire danes is as cute and charming as always while kate beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance bill <UNK> is also great and demonstrates his <UNK> qualities br br there are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience plus it shows the difficult times at thailand br br this is an underrated movie not many films like this one have come up in recent history it should make you <UNK> about many things
<START> i rated this a 3 the dubbing was as bad as i have seen the plot <UNK> i'm not sure which ruined the movie more jet li is definitely a great martial artist but i'll stick to jackie chan movies until somebody tells me <UNK> english is up to par
<START> this is definitely one of the best movies i've ever seen it has everything a genuinely touching screenplay fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch an actually elegant romance it's a shame that that kind of romance just doesn't seem to exist anymore lovely songs and lyrics especially the final song an artistic score and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them the ending was only a disappointment in that i was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant end but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there definitely check this movie out over and over again there are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look
<START> did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from <UNK> 1 2 god was behind everything what has god got to do with sci fi god is only the answer when you can't think up a sensible explanation for something in fact this is exactly the problem with the series finale they obviously couldn't think up sensible explanations for the <UNK> of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how <UNK> <UNK> come back from the dead in a brand new <UNK> how her old <UNK> and <UNK> body ended up on earth 2 why <UNK> has an imaginary 6 in his head why 6 has an imaginary <UNK> in her head etc so they explain it with angels or just don't explain it at all br br the plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a <UNK> through for example why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl <UNK> particularly after <UNK> said there was no way he'd attempt a rescue because they found out the location of the <UNK> base that's not a good reason to sacrifice the <UNK> lives and how did <UNK> know the location and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters' lives before the war it's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment br br the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series feels like the script writing was take over by <UNK> christians on a mission to spread 'the <UNK> forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot the important message the writers wanted to get across is don't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction god is your ultimate salvation tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment br br imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no force instead a jedi actually gets his power from jesus then they fly their <UNK> into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks would this be a good ending no it <UNK> wouldn't
<START> i am a big fan a <UNK> tale theatre and i've seen them all and this is one of the best it's funny romantic and a classic i recommend this for all ages it's great for little kids because it's well cinderella and great for adults and teen because it's funny and not over the top i watched it when i was little and i still watch it now it has great lines that my family and i quote all the time the acting is great and it never gets old if you like fairy tales and romances you will love this i've watched many a cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them all sorry disney i highly recommend this movie and all the <UNK> tale theatre shows they all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining
<START> let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of <UNK> at least twice i do not consider myself a <UNK> or <UNK> those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors the acting was better than average but the plot held no surprises they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation now as to the historical errors if you call them that the first <UNK> to pilot the enterprise was commander april then capt <UNK> jim kirk etc according to a statement made by both <UNK> and kirk we <UNK> the <UNK> and educated them and gave them the technology that's the reason a prime <UNK> was created but like i said these are no reason to <UNK> this fine series i hope the plots will get deeper and then special effects can take a <UNK>
<START> despite of the success in comedy or drama the turkish directors are failure in horror thriller <UNK> d <UNK> are good examples for the awful horror turkish films br br but if you watch gen you will understand that it is a strike the atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark also the special features are colorful and not cheap the <UNK> fit the movie but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary br br as a result gen does not add any difference to horror movies but it does not disappoint thriller fans in this respect it is a success for <UNK> and turkey 7 10
<START> this movie really deserves the mst3k treatment a pseudo ancient fantasy hack n slash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective iq of hot water character names that seem to have been derived from a mad <UNK> book and such classic lines as hold her down and <UNK> her belly the <UNK> crosses over into the so bad it's good territory

<START> the only other film besides soylent green that has such an air of <UNK> is on the beach both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made <UNK> on the beach with nuclear war and soylent green with the <UNK> <UNK> of the planet br br maybe there's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we haven't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now new york city still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the <UNK> as described in soylent green <UNK> always <UNK> this film as showing the consequence of global warming for myself it also shows the right to life <UNK> run <UNK> obviously there's no family planning in this world either br br charlton heston is an <UNK> detective who lives with room mate edward g robinson who's old enough to remember the earth before catastrophe struck there's been a murder committed joseph <UNK> an executive with the soylent corporation a multi national concern that has come up with a food product some kind of <UNK> in many colors to feed the world's population it's latest product is soylent green br br the investigation finds charlton heston getting his man but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the soylent corporation and the future of mankind as heston shouts in the end that soylent green is made of people that we've become a race of cannibals the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative we've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive br br this was the farewell performance of edward g robinson and in his <UNK> heston spoke <UNK> of robinson even though they had <UNK> political views a few weeks after robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by <UNK> <UNK> he passed away in real life not many did but heston knew that robinson was <UNK> and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them br br though the <UNK> was off it doesn't mean that the world <UNK> by soylent green may not come to pass hopefully we'll have not just the intelligence but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening
<START> wow i went to the video store tonight because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie and i found this gem i looked at the cover and i thought it looked like just the movie for my mood i brought it home and put it on br br this movie was not the b horror movie that i had in mind this was much worse i wanted a bad movie but what i got i didn't know that crap like this existed amongst man this movie seemed like a 5 year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it br br i am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies he needs to work at a garbage dump <UNK> crap where he belongs br br if you are thinking about renting this or buying it i will tell you the same thing that i would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide don't do it it's not worth it i really have nothing nice to say about this movie don't do it
<START> imagine being so <UNK> by a <UNK> that a one man spends 8 year's of his life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself the murder technique is clear but a government unwilling to admit the truth let's a monster destroy dozens of lives when i think my job is <UNK> i merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick the devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by rea the comic and almost tragic at times relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years the catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat while not nearly as well advertised and talked about as silence of the <UNK> the plot was just as suspenseful rent or buy this movie today
<START> this movie sucked plain and simple okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist the rapist is a <UNK> but the girl victim is partly to blame i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff but when the rapist tries to have sex with her she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything but when it comes to the rapist getting raped it's a pretty long rape scene there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching br br 3 2 10
<START> am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on showtime the film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography but the screenplay was stilted and wooden the acting was fairly bad thought the two female leads were <UNK> you never really believed anything the supporting actors said though there were the stereotypes bible <UNK> <UNK> without a hint of nuance <UNK> captain hot headed soldier etc i am sorry to say that based on these <UNK> i <UNK> it straight away as canadian without knowing it to be such the <UNK> canada end credits gave it away i know i'm a horrible person br br maybe i missed something in the beginning but the <UNK> towards the girls is never explained here they are <UNK> in a <UNK> by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy <UNK> two young women for no reason focus people there's a bit more of a <UNK> situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians that's just my <UNK> for the <UNK> directed towards them if they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them the question of their immortal soul can be resolved later br br also i guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy these girls are supposed to be the protagonists one of them murdered the indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives i guess one is just a victim of her condition who can't be necessarily blamed for her actions but the other is just a murderer who doesn't deserve her happy ending
<START> hey everyone br br there really isn't much to say for this movie at all the basic plot is that a guy brandon takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work after picking up a girl on the way there things start going badly wrong for all of them br br the storyline alone written by the actor playing brandon i believe although i could be wrong here is unlikely and unconvincing and is acted out <UNK> the clown killer himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer far from being a dark mysterious but most of all intelligent predator we are instead offered a rather clumsy <UNK> rhyme singing <UNK> who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis the only thing that <UNK> the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film the quality of the film led me to <UNK> some enjoyment out of such things br br in short this film falls below every possible set standard admittedly i was sharing a few beers with a close friend as i watched this so we managed to <UNK> together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that s i c k did fall just shy of a two rating however in reality and with the benefit of <UNK> the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film br br 1 star out of ten
<START> hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres in a bit of type casting jeffrey combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human hammerhead shark creature <UNK> this being is in fact his son who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer or something br br a group of associates are invited to the <UNK> private island they end up being used as shark bait or shark mate for some unknown reason the head of it has been brought along as part of this team who knows why luckily he turns out to be a <UNK> if somewhat overweight <UNK> hero i'm working on the <UNK> that he <UNK> how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support a normal day for this it man presumably involves <UNK> someone's network connection followed by a call to gun down gun <UNK> evil <UNK> or perhaps a call to fix someone's pc has to be <UNK> between physical <UNK> with land based human shark <UNK> anyway he's amazing and saves the day he even <UNK> the girl br br the shark man is a slightly lame creation but ok i guess judging by the effects in general in this film and the movie moves on at a decent pace it's complete <UNK> of course but if you buy a movie called hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a land based killer fish then really you have no one to blame but yourself as it is there are guns gore girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter it's rubbish but not as bad as some might say
<START> kurt <UNK> <UNK> like performance coupled with john carpenter's flawless filmmaking makes this one without a doubt one of the finest <UNK> tube <UNK> ever aired it holds up too the emotional foundation is strong enough that it'll never age carpenter has <UNK> for <UNK> the power and ultimate <UNK> of the life of the one and only king of rock and roll i'd been a borderline elvis fan most of my life but it wasn't until i saw this mind <UNK> moving movie that i looked beyond the image at the man himself it was quite a revelation elvis remains one of the top ten made for tv movies of all time
<START> i think that this movie was <UNK> good it's kinda weird that now the olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all i enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on full house anyway the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names it's just kind of an older version of it takes two
<START> since its release in 1983 a christmas story the jean shepherd narrated story of his alter ego <UNK> has become a true classic my summer story however still has shepherd as the narrator but it has absolutely none of the charm and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film br br my summer story is basically a <UNK> of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories which include <UNK> neighbors and battling tops charles <UNK> who i normally like is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father more <UNK> handled by darren <UNK> in the original and his character never seems anything but forced <UNK> culkin is a poor substitute for <UNK> and the little brother is all but forgotten here only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that's because she <UNK> a cinema manager with a <UNK> boat when he pushes his luck too far with <UNK> <UNK> on free dish night br br the stories in this are mostly <UNK> and stretched paper thin may appeal to the extremely <UNK> but as a sequel to a christmas story it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time 2 out of 10
<START> holes 2003 <UNK> andrew davis br br when stanley <UNK> iv is <UNK> convicted of stealing he is sent to <UNK> green <UNK> at this camp the warden and her two henchman mr sir and dr <UNK> command the <UNK> to dig holes after hole after hole but for what reason stanley plans to find out br br i never really had any intention in watching <UNK> and i must admit i only really watched the film because i'm such a fan of <UNK> <UNK> but even if you are not a fan of him then it doesn't matter <UNK> is one of those disney film that the whole family can enjoy the story is lovely written and <UNK> a wonderful idea of including flashbacks to the past these are not distracting and really gives a great back story all the cast are great the young stars act well and the addition of jon voight and <UNK> weaver are a joy <UNK> <UNK> shows that even at 17 he can act without any flaws this is one disney film you definitely would enjoy as a family br br i learn from failure stanley <UNK> iii henry <UNK>
<START> ok but does that make this a good movie well not really in my opinion there isn't a whole lot to recommend it i found it very slow <UNK> in fact it's also predictable pretty much through and through number one and two were somewhat predictable but not as much i also felt this movie was quite campy at times which i didn't really think fits this series and the character jeff <UNK> plays the main bad guy in this installment he's a decent enough actor but i felt he played his character too over the top i guess that fit with the tone of the movie which would have been great if i had liked the movie plus there were some pretty bad one liners arnold <UNK> returns in the title role but is given little to work with in this movie the character has not really evolved as i had hoped oh well this is just my opinion anyway for me while this movie is not abysmal it is pretty bad my vote for darkman iii 3 5 5
<START> i was really excited about seeing this film i thought finally australia had made a good film but i was wrong br br this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever i feel sorry for molly <UNK> having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie br br the acting was terrible especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent and the plot was also pretty bad br br when i first heard about this film coming out i thought that the title was pathetic because it sounds like the cheesy film stab in scream 2 but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie br br warning major spoilers br br probably the worst thing about the film was the ending i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was but the killer wasn't even human which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie br br don't see this film you'll probably be disappointed
<START> people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie and this movie is no exception some movies i love did poorly at the box office but i'm glad to say this movie isn't one of them over nine million dollars which i don't think was bad for back then the characters were fun the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern too which is unusual for an animated movie i didn't think professor screw eyes or his scary <UNK> was too scary for little kids the targeted audience for this movie but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids' movie overall this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved <UNK> for years
<START> dude really where have you guys been the past 20 years this is shocking in all kind of ways horror this is a joke there is nothing wrong with being low budget but this is a laugh if you want to look at the classics freaks of <UNK> <UNK> the victims of dracula and frankenstein the <UNK> monster ernest <UNK> paul <UNK> the <UNK> and the passengers of the ghost train you can't compare it it gives it a bad name bad acting bad screenplay etc total <UNK> of money and free time have watched a lot of movies were as horror is my all time favorite i really am speechless have nothing more to say that please don't do the effort to watch something so <UNK> please understand
<START> this is a typical perfect crime thriller a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught the result is like every single episode of columbo or murder she wrote the director himself refers to the <UNK> story by showing the police officer watching an episode of <UNK> this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all <UNK> minutes filling with every cliche in the book skip this one you are not missing anything
<START> saw this in the theater in <UNK> and fell out of my chair laughing more than once <UNK> what do you know about <UNK> <UNK> he's the best damn baseball that ever lived br br you know how it's going to end but it has a great time getting there the training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when jack and reno are attempting to watch the <UNK> v <UNK> monday night football game while attempting a make up dinner with their wives br br williams and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it's too bad that it's overlooked as a top notch comedy
<START> i watched this movie to the end and that was really not easy it is so boring bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from blair witch project that you can't believe the makers take this serious even harder to believe is how this product made it onto vhs and dvd br br so if want to see a horror movie just watch scream but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability watch dark area
<START> a horribly pointless and worse boring film stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way br br will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim <UNK> truman show and <UNK> his usual shouting routine admittedly very funny if you <UNK> <UNK> nights for well pretty much nothing br br emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating that some reviews i've read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable whilst maggie <UNK> does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of <UNK> to become a baker because she liked making people happy please that she ended up falling for <UNK> <UNK> is utterly ludicrous br br marc <UNK> attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with br br i had the choice of either going to watch the <UNK> for the third time or seeing this i wish i'd <UNK> for the <UNK>
<START> eva hedy <UNK> has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not desire her her disappointment with the marriage and the <UNK> of love makes eva returning to her father's home in a farm leaving her husband one afternoon while bathing in a lake her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker <UNK> and gives them back to eva they fall in love for each other and become lovers later her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home eva refuses and fortune leads the trio to the same place ending the affair in a tragic way i have just watched <UNK> for the first time and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian <UNK> video network the movie has only 75 minutes running time and it seems that it was used different <UNK> of film there are some parts totally damaged and other parts very damaged therefore the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale the film is practically a silent movie the story is very dated and has only a few lines consequently the characters are badly developed however this movie is also very daring with the exposure of hedy <UNK> beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty another fantastic point is the poetic and <UNK> used of flowers <UNK> the <UNK> between eva and her lover the way the director <UNK> the scenes to show the needs and <UNK> of eva is very clear the non <UNK> end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie i liked this movie but i hope one day have a chance to see a <UNK> minutes restored version my vote is eight br br title brazil <UNK> ecstasy
<START> i made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome on paper the script seems hopeful and the choice of actors leaves one with hopes i liked pacino in <UNK> of a woman and have seen <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in several french and other films of the 70s 80s but i had forgotten how important a part dialogues can play in a film and in this film they are absolute trash the filming locations were also attractive but the hopeless pretentious and forced dialogues pulled the whole thing down to sub zero level in addition to that i am pretty <UNK> to the world of <UNK> racing and find no interest in this sport even the <UNK> dialogues in love story were better than the ones in this film and that's saying something i was really expecting better from this film and was very disappointed to have been let down so much
<START> a bunch of women who can't act sit around talk smoke pot they have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is <UNK> and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some store bought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers we don't see them killing anyone suddenly there is a body on the floor covered by a <UNK> sheet i can't eat <UNK> cover by a sheet anymore because of this just the thought of <UNK> cover by a sheet is enough to <UNK> the same <UNK> fit brought on by trying to get through all of this movie occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is hunting them by way of torturing some guy he <UNK> to a chair is his basement why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the sit on the couch sisters is never explained there are also scenes of some <UNK> guy freaking out he p <UNK> blood and punches through a wall but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the story br br there is no action no special effects no story if you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking then here's 90 minutes of that because except for a scene where one chick does some <UNK> on a street corner and the <UNK> random scenes absolutely nothing happens yawn oh i almost forgot you get to see them move some stuff including the <UNK> sister when they move to their new apartment its one of the few times they're not sitting on a couch or lying in bed
<START> ok where do i begin this movie changed my life the plot was <UNK> james <UNK> has out done himself initially after a first viewing i was disappointed that i hadn't seen it on the silver screen however this was before exploring the dvd's many features oh my god <UNK> <UNK> commentary of the film was almost as flawless as his acting he told of industry secrets used in the film that you only get with experience br br i was so impressed by the other actors the scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the <UNK> reminded me of some of my favorite blue pornographic movies i am certainly with <UNK> when he expresses his disappointment with no sequel br br i am still blown away with each viewing of the martial arts skills involved matched only by the sign <UNK> the location of the library at the school and possibly the guy playing a <UNK> all in all a timeless classic and the best film to come out of europe in years where my oscars at dawn
<START> i loved this mini series tara fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying helen graham a beautiful young woman hiding along with her young son from a mysterious past as an <UNK> who loves romances this movie was just my cup of tea and i would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the england of the <UNK> i also must mention that toby <UNK> who portrays the very <UNK> gilbert <UNK> is reason enough to watch this wonderful production
<START> three teenage girls in an <UNK> <UNK> relation the base of the triangle is barely there at the <UNK> is marie a serious short and lean <UNK> with a <UNK> like facial structure her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite <UNK> <UNK> i dare say fat and <UNK> for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter because of her <UNK> boys don't seem interested and it pains her br br the other leg of the <UNK> is a beautiful <UNK> fatale blonde <UNK> she is deeply involved in the sport of <UNK> swimming performing at <UNK> level marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool marie <UNK> herself into the life of the <UNK> using the desire to become a <UNK> <UNK> as an argument the <UNK> has a reputation of being a whore making out with any young male that <UNK> around her marie is not <UNK> out by that reputation put a stress on reputation br br the first half is set up we get to see a lot of <UNK> swimming as we become familiar with the three girls eventually the narrative leaves <UNK> swimming behind and concentrates on the <UNK> <UNK> relations among the three that's when unexpected things start to happen br br it is a trademark of french films to drop <UNK> of wisdom on the viewer this one is no exception here it is about <UNK> and the dying see the film to learn more br br the director says that the use of <UNK> swimming is <UNK> that women only sport is a metaphor for a girl's life pretty and feminine on the surface while hard working and <UNK> underneath a number of scenes drive this point elegant moves and smiles for the public legs kicking <UNK> underwater the title in french is also suggestive <UNK> or <UNK> suggest an individual having to <UNK> many <UNK> simultaneously
<START> with all the excessive violence in this film it could've been <UNK> 17 but the gore could've been pg 13 and there were quite a lot of <UNK> when the mum had the original jackass bad <UNK> boy friend there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people the violence was overly excessive and i think the <UNK> was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off but the teacher who called him white trash and <UNK> though the character lester is anything but a <UNK> not even close i know <UNK> and am part hood they don't draw in class they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters but was just stabbed in the back there were two suspenseful scenes in the film but didn't last long enough to be scary at all as i said the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off if the gore was actually fun to see then it would've been <UNK> 17 two kids describe a body they find in the <UNK> they describe it as a lot <UNK> than it actually was they explained to the cop that there were <UNK> <UNK> around in the guys intestines his stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way <UNK> were in his stomach though i would've liked to see that the acting was pathetic characters were losers and the scarecrow could do a lot of <UNK> stunts i suggest renting this movie for the death scenes i wont see it again anytime soon but i enjoyed the excessive violence also don't bother with the sequel i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death it sounds good but isn't the original scarecrow actually kept me interested
<START> to anyone who hasn't seen this film yet i have a friendly warning don't watch la <UNK> <UNK> expecting any demons at all because you won't find them here this film is not a third installment to the demons series and it has nothing to do with it whatsoever except the fact that <UNK> <UNK> directed them as a matter of fact <UNK> <UNK> the church is also known an <UNK> demons 3 and it's a <UNK> title in that case as well so go figure it is obvious that due to the demons films success they tried to <UNK> the audience with misleading titles even though it is obvious that this is a <UNK> story having said that i think it's unfair on the other hand to say that la <UNK> <UNK> is not worth the look honestly the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations i thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole nevertheless i think it's fair to say that the story somehow tries to <UNK> lucio <UNK> the house by the cemetery of course that's just a <UNK> i have but i think i have my valid <UNK> for instance in both films <UNK> <UNK> is the man of the family in both films there's an irritating little son named bobby in both films the woman of the house is a beautiful thirty something who seems to be the only one to see that there's something really wrong in the new house and in both films there's something really really wrong going on in the basement i'm sorry but i can relate both films very easily and i'm not saying that as an <UNK> for the contrary my point is that those who enjoyed the house by the cemetery are probably going to enjoy this movie as well keeping in mind of course that la <UNK> <UNK> is far less pretentious less scary not nearly as atmospheric but the formula is still there br br in la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her husband tom and their little son bobby go on a vacation trip to an old deserted castle <UNK> in the heart of an italian villa called <UNK> leaving aside the beauty of the place shortly after their arrival <UNK> starts to have the feeling that she has been there before which is impossible considering that she had never been to <UNK> before sadly <UNK> can't get over her <UNK> <UNK> and the worst part is that her visions come along with the image of a horrendous creature going after her tom who is not a very patient guy to begin with <UNK> her to leave the nonsensical hallucinations aside and enjoy the vacation however the woman's visions become more and more real and the peace and quiet that they were supposed to enjoy suddenly turn into a living nightmare the old nightmare from <UNK> childhood becomes real and this time she won't be able to escape without confronting that menacing ogre first br br as it is expected the plot somehow turns out to be a little bit simplistic and as a consequence it is hard to fill an hour and a half this means that la <UNK> <UNK> offers more than a couple of sequences with nothing but total silence and the image of the main character walking around the castle for several minutes <UNK> the images of her childhood and nothing else it gets rather tedious from time to time but overall it's nothing serious like many italian horror films that came out throughout the late eighties this movie is pretty stylish and effective but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moments that make the movie unforgettable in a way for instance the part in which <UNK> is brutally slapped by her husband and instead of going to her bedroom crying like i would have expected she strikes back against him by <UNK> him on the face really hard and running away to the woods like a maniac the funniest thing however is the fact that two minutes later they're a happy couple again as if <UNK> each other like that was the most natural thing in the world i know it's silly but i myself found it absolutely hilarious the ogre which is obviously the villain of the story looks creepy and funny at the same time too and let's face it a villain who can freak us out and make us laugh a little bit it's twice as welcomed it reminded me of michael jackson in thriller but much more natural and human of course but if focusing on the genuinely good aspects that i mentioned before the music composed by simon <UNK> is one of the high points and even if it pretty much always the same it fits perfectly and it helps to create a rather dark atmosphere during the moments of tension so if i have to give my final statement regarding this movie i'm going to have to say that i can't help loving it including the small flaws and most people who enjoy these typical italian horror movies from the late eighties won't be disappointed by this one it has all the typical and always well received clichés like the crazy old man who actually speaks the truth the <UNK> local woman who is said to be a witch a creepy castle a huge dark basement with a terrible secret and the local folks who try to prevent the tourist with their <UNK> to stay away from the infamous lands i would say that la <UNK> <UNK> deserves two thumbs up and a punch at your <UNK> face as a way to pay tribute to the heroine of the story take this movie for what it is and enjoy it
<START> this film for an after school special isn't that bad and that's the problem nothing happens you feel as if you're still in class a guy teaches a bunch of young <UNK> how to be good paint ball players we never get to see these <UNK> doing badly as the good player is training them they all of the sudden turn into good players by <UNK> also there are too many characters and no character development too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids this could have had a <UNK> news <UNK> feel the original since there was a girl on an all boys team but there wasn't any feel to this movie at all it has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it is not fun to bag on not fun to watch and is just kind of there plain boring something you'd watch after school before your pre evening <UNK> as dull as the day is long and it's been a long long day watching this movie
<START> greta <UNK> american film debut is an <UNK> of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions as in a <UNK> causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way br br greta plays <UNK> a poor <UNK> girl in love with <UNK> <UNK> character don <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> is in love with her too but is too easily influenced by his <UNK> mother <UNK> ends up homeless and travels to paris where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman in reality part of her attitude is <UNK> over <UNK> <UNK> br br she returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts <UNK> surprisingly no one knows that she's the famous la <UNK> and garbo acts up her role as the <UNK> she truly was and re <UNK> with such cool <UNK> in her later portrayals br br <UNK> cortez reminds one a lot of <UNK> in looks in this part and he was <UNK> to be a <UNK> clone by mgm though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right he is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak <UNK> <UNK> boy and allows himself to age realistically but <UNK> at the end of the movie he fails to win <UNK> when she returns home and later when he follows her his courage is <UNK> br br this movie is beautifully shot with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting spain at the time are authentic looking there are also some fine secondary performances by old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> marshall and mack <UNK> br br although this is a story of lost love and missed chances i don't think <UNK> and <UNK> would have been happy together as he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman and i don't think would have been happy in a small village the ending is true to life and pulls no punches br br see this one as <UNK> american film debut and a <UNK> of things to come
<START> i was amazingly impressed by this movie it contained fundamental elements of depression grief loneliness despair hope dreams and <UNK> it wasn't merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find <UNK> within his music he finds a companion who comes with her own issues claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst br br des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star yet he has musical genius he also has an event in his past that has made him <UNK> while things around him literally go to ruins his focus is creating his whale music in fact it becomes an obsession for him br br claire is the <UNK> kid that needs a place to stay she finds hidden talents while being in des company she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her she learns to trust him over a period of time br br these two find love with one another not the mind blowing sex <UNK> kind of passion but a love where friendship and understanding means more for two people who have been hurt they find trust together
<START> chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos <UNK> performances rock solid writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever br br all of the cast are strong but <UNK> and gandolfini earned every inch of those <UNK> anyone who doubts this need only <UNK> a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james gandolfini is absolutely fierce absolutely terrifying and you still find yourself loving him <UNK> by him br br many people that i've spoken to about the sopranos who haven't seen it yet will say i'm just not a fan of mafia movies shows whatever run don't walk and get it those same people usually love e r but i bet they don't much care for <UNK> it's not about the context
<START> fred <UNK> ray is a lousy director even as far as b movie directors go but <UNK> <UNK> is probably one of his better films yes it does butcher the great poe story <UNK> <UNK> and yes it is badly paced and uneven throughout but it is also pretty entertaining scream queen <UNK> stevens is better than usual as a pretty fragile housewife whose worthless husband jay richardson is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster played by robert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a veteran of many early 90s soft core movies actually gives the best performance in the film as a <UNK> mistress you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic robert clarke as a doctor and michael <UNK> in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes the ending didn't make much sense
<START> dr <UNK> is terrifying i would not recommend any adult or child see this unless they are <UNK> murderers already there is so much filth in this movie it hurts my yes speaking of eyes there are eyes in the sky against a backdrop of stars only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing i rented out every copy i could from local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound <UNK> that movie should remain locked in a <UNK> behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting <UNK> of hell that is where this movie belongs i suggest if you want some <UNK> entertainment go and rent all dogs go to heaven or angels in the <UNK> those movies are worth seeing if you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies you need to see dr <UNK>
<START> i don't know anything of the writer's or the director's earlier work so i hadn't brought any prejudices to the film based on the brief description of the plot in tv guide i thought it might be interesting br br but <UNK> was <UNK> upon <UNK> each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed gruesome makeup or special effects br br the score was professional and <UNK> <UNK> seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing it was positively repulsive br br i will not go through the <UNK> of the narrative but i'll give an example of what i think of as an excess of explicit gore br br chris <UNK> goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim <UNK> out of the deep freeze <UNK> had killed <UNK> by biting a <UNK> out of his neck now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in <UNK> demise what are the cops going to do measure his bite <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> head and neck from the <UNK> bag it's in takes an <UNK> and begins to chop off <UNK> head <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the bit of the <UNK> keeps <UNK> away at <UNK> neck the air is filled with <UNK> of flying frozen flesh one of which drops on <UNK> head he <UNK> it off when he's done <UNK> then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire he's built he sits the head on the ground <UNK> next to it takes out some photos of a woman he's just killed and shows them to <UNK> head remember her we could have really made it if it hadn't been for you guys he tells the head duke you've always liked <UNK> haven't you he asks then he places the head on the fire we only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat <UNK> in the flame br br i don't want this sort of garbage to be <UNK> i'm only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuff br br there's no reason to go on with the rest of the movie well i'll mention one example of an <UNK> since i brought the idea up <UNK> has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack he knows he's going to be <UNK> half to death in the following days he's literally invited the <UNK> to do it what would you do in this poe like situation here's what <UNK> does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life he finds a <UNK> <UNK> with a pin up girl on it and <UNK> successfully give that man the <UNK> of freedom br br a monster who looks like pizza the <UNK> is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks the camera is often hand held and <UNK> the dialog has lines like life is a piece of s or else it's the best of all possible worlds it depends on your point of view use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into <UNK> masks a house blows up in an explosive <UNK> at the end while the hero <UNK> walks towards us in the <UNK> br br some hero he is too he first kills a man for 13 000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue then a <UNK> plant before finally <UNK> a <UNK> over onto the body this bothers him a little but not enough to keep him from <UNK> on <UNK> then i hope i have the order straight he kills <UNK> by ripping out part of his neck then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the <UNK> for it although by almost any moral <UNK> they had nothing to do with it next he burns the head <UNK> baldwin alive then having disabled the two lesser <UNK> he deliberately blows them up though one of them isn't entirely unsympathetic and we're supposed to be rooting for <UNK> br br these aren't cartoon deaths like those in the dirty harry movies either bang bang and you're dead these are slow and painful the first one the murder for 13 000 is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life it isn't really easy to kill another human being as hitchcock had demonstrated in torn curtain but that scene leads to no place of any importance br br some people might enjoy this especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies some <UNK> stuff on screen here
<START> if you have read the book do not set your hopes high if you have not go read it and never watch the film it is strange to learn that toby young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script as he claims himself in the post script of the book because the film is very different from the book br br what the film seems to be aiming at taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and <UNK> it so that everyone would understand it it achieves with perfection the film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had br br you are better off not seeing it
<START> spoilers of both this and the matrix follow br br i liked the original matrix a great deal it was not a deep movie despite <UNK> attempts to <UNK> but it was fairly well paced fun and i have a soft spot for hong kong fights br br in the original neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker anderson by day corporate <UNK> and by night brave <UNK> eventually he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions does he become an outlaw fighting the machine or does he go back to the safe forgettable world he started in interestingly he discovers that once one is <UNK> of <UNK> life rather sucks he has his girl by his side and his <UNK> companions but he eats <UNK> <UNK> dresses in <UNK> and lives in a truly <UNK> bit of <UNK> still the truth makes him free br br at least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the what if it were me questions raised in the viewer's mind what if i were capable of the impossible what if i were the one it does not even matter that much what you are the one example of with a cool title like that br br further agent smith made a wonderful bad guy as he <UNK> all of the fear of authority that we carry with us he was as <UNK> as a terminator and as <UNK> br br at the end of the matrix neo must return to the matrix to share his good news of freedom br br this movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie and it does so with such lack of gusto such poor <UNK> and such poor editing that i cannot believe they had planned these changes when the dialog is at a fifth grade level with various long words dropped in randomly i find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying br br my short list of characterization failures br br the <UNK> goes from mildly helpful if <UNK> to utterly <UNK> without any real reason br br major personalities of the matrix are introduced without need the <UNK> for example was a cute idea but just not that interesting a character br br fishburne loses his <UNK> role and gets nothing to replace it with br br the people of <UNK> are not particularly likable nor would you really want them running the world br br special effects problems br br the fight scenes are pointless and <UNK> in the matrix you felt neo could lose and that he had to become something greater in order to survive in the matrix <UNK> he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game br br the fight on the <UNK> looked quite fake and not that interesting br br pacing problems br br as i mentioned above the fight scenes were interminable br br the rave went on too long everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch not because we mind good dancing and good <UNK> but because we did not know about the people <UNK> nor did we care br br whatever hack wrote the <UNK> <UNK> should be <UNK> from the business it <UNK> used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand and was a waste of time and a pacing killer the <UNK> speech could have been done in a <UNK> the time and with more peril as <UNK> exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the matrix there are now too many people who do not believe the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it further the earth cannot support even the people in <UNK> let alone these others you may choose one person from <UNK> to form the new <UNK> while i wipe the memories of the people currently in the matrix br br instead we got a long drawn out bunch of <UNK> if someone <UNK> that it is deep ask for a <UNK> and try breaking down the sentences each one is too long by several <UNK> and uses words with <UNK> shorter <UNK> br br so in summary not worth seeing br br i have seen the third one and despite what a number of reviewers have said skip it it does not save this turkey br br the reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were deep should go see some truly deep movies perhaps read a book or two on <UNK> and debate and perhaps a bit of philosophy this movie is just not hard to understand but it is hard to stomach br br scott
<START> what a piece of junk this movie was the premise was okay but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people even the effects in <UNK> was better i knew this would be bad but the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs it's completely incoherent silly and stupid i felt like it had been written by some <UNK> <UNK> in creative class and gotten a d i want to slap casper van <UNK> and the other actors for following this movie through br br i've had my share of cheesy and bad movies i love the tremors series but this i do not recommend it at all it's silly and the totally <UNK> bad dialogs will make you cringe
<START> this movie is likely the worst movie i've ever seen in my life <UNK> the previous most god awful movie <UNK> of <UNK> which i saw when i was about 10 br br bad acting stilted and ridiculous dialog incomprehensible plot <UNK> cut scenes even the music was annoying did i leave anything out well the special effects weren't bad but cgi does not a decent movie make br br i can't believe i actually spent money to see this movie if anyone has the contact info for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the director please forward it to my user name at <UNK> and i'll contact him to personally demand a <UNK>
<START> a new side to the story of victoria and albert is brought to life by director jean marc <UNK> most people's <UNK> thoughts of queen victoria is that of woman who <UNK> for several decades and lived her life in mourning emily blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective she portrays victoria in her youth <UNK> to the throne and early years <UNK> victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film her strongest scenes are with albert rupert friend and lord melbourne paul <UNK> all the actors <UNK> themselves well including miranda richardson in what could of been a throw away role br br though this is not a story of dramatic <UNK> and <UNK> acting moments the story is still interesting enough to make it worth viewing there are a few historical liberties that has been taken by the screen writing the film tries to stay true to the relationship between victoria and albert and of the social and royal structure of the time period the set design and costumes are outstanding br br this film will be most appreciated by those drawn to history period dramas and of blunt and the other actors <UNK> recommend br br grade a
<START> i dislike this movie a lot if you've read the <UNK> books or at least have watched very closely the two first movies specially the first one you're going to agree with me br br compared with the <UNK> saga presented by <UNK> novel the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous the characters and the relationships among them are distorted the story ends up reaching nowhere although it appears to go to some direction during the movie br br it is understandable that different times should be expected for the <UNK> saga in the 90's and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before but in the other hand i don't know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies in <UNK> when they didn't fit why this it sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film's qualities br br what will never be understandable is the fact that mario <UNK> coppola and al pacino joined together to make this a man who directed pieces like apocalypse now and godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies so does al pacino for being the actor he is but mario <UNK> shouldn't have written this how come he damaged all his previous work what a shame my friend the <UNK> novel the last don is a 90's story about the mob and it is great we can never tell the same about the plot for the godfather iii

<START> anchors aweigh sees two eager young sailors joe brady gene kelly and clarence <UNK> brooklyn frank sinatra get a special four day shore leave eager to get to the girls particularly <UNK> lola neither joe nor brooklyn figure on the <UNK> of little navy mad donald dean <UNK> and his aunt <UNK> kathryn grayson <UNK> in the ways of females and <UNK> brooklyn quickly <UNK> joe to help him win aunt <UNK> over along the way however joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend how is brooklyn going to take this betrayal and does joe end up with <UNK> who loves him too br br the first and second times i saw anchors aweigh i also saw it at the same time as i did on the town the kelly sinatra collaboration from 1949 both times i felt that anchors aweigh was the better film in terms of plotting and structure all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot and they develop the characters and story rather than <UNK> them yet both times i came away feeling that on the town is the better film overall having now seen both films a third time i still stand by that judgement somehow on the town as a film and a piece of entertainment is just lighter <UNK> purely and simply happier the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh i'm not quite sure why this is the typical argument is that the latter film is over long at almost two and a half hours this is certainly a valid criticism to make i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it however it's also a film that grows on you the more you see it the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical <UNK> involved in its making and yet something just doesn't hang together quite right it feels almost as if the script was <UNK> over and every single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted and that's exactly what happened no opportunity to <UNK> a musical number in was given up and that's probably the film's biggest weakness it has 16 numbers give or take a few and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra this really starts to turn one <UNK> after a while contrast this for example with the ten numbers in on the town you might well feel that each song each dance can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking and that's true but that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place br br all this long <UNK> doesn't mean there's nothing good about anchors aweigh the musical is <UNK> with great songs <UNK> out all over like the <UNK> between kelly and sinatra <UNK> hate to <UNK> 'i <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> you knew <UNK> the singing of sinatra <UNK> makes the <UNK> 'the charm of <UNK> and the best of all 'i fall in love too <UNK> and without a doubt the always inventive always breathtaking dancing of kelly it's also hard to miss with a cast of this <UNK> grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening jose <UNK> role is written <UNK> and he does a great job with it even <UNK> own brooklyn pamela <UNK> is cute and charming as close as one could get to betty <UNK> without being <UNK> herself sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and <UNK> of his and plays the innocent boy man wonderfully a role he <UNK> in on the town his singing is as usual simply <UNK> from <UNK> through to timing and <UNK> his solo numbers might seem to drag a little but when you've got the voice of a century <UNK> it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film br br gene kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively anchors aweigh really is kelly's film his joe brady is a believable real character he's tough on the outside <UNK> and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal but he's actually the biggest <UNK> on the inside kelly makes this charming rather than <UNK> but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast <UNK> in his hands and the dancing again the film suffers from the <UNK> much of a good thing <UNK> the <UNK> syndrome as it does with sinatra's singing but once again if it's gene kelly doing the <UNK> or <UNK> across the screen in a <UNK> outfit or dressed up as a <UNK> chief might as well <UNK> on the side of <UNK> it all of kelly's dances are breathtaking be it the <UNK> down simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to 'i <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> hat <UNK> with the sweet wide eyed little girl or his lavish spanish influenced dance <UNK> <UNK> of course the classic image left in <UNK> minds for all time would be kelly in his red white and blue sailor suit dancing with jerry mouse of <UNK> <UNK> fame a well deserved golden film memory to be sure it's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945 given the <UNK> of cgi in the contemporary film market but gene and jerry still look great with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look it would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself in cover girl and a cartoon animation br br it's <UNK> that this first daring inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs but it's also notable for being the first of three kelly sinatra film <UNK> and though rather too drawn out still a great couple of hours of entertainment watch it first then again and maybe again it'll grow on you before you realise it 7 5 10
<START> the plot is plausible but banal i e beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a <UNK> with a psychotic hunk then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and <UNK> her but what develops from there is <UNK> illogical despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence our <UNK> hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic their attorney and local police who say they can do nothing at their <UNK> while they <UNK> with suspense and terror they have no private security staff only a fancy security system that they <UNK> household or grounds staff <UNK> etc not even apparently the <UNK> to hire private round the clock <UNK> to care for the hero when he suffers life threatening <UNK> leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a <UNK> and our hero a <UNK> behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner the production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors <UNK> <UNK> and don murray what were they thinking and shame on lifetime tv for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering
<START> john <UNK> pink <UNK> pecker is the best movie i've seen in a while it gives the viewer a surreal image of life in <UNK> i live in nearby washington <UNK> with a <UNK> like use of color exaggerated motions and emotions pecker becomes larger than his town can handle and he is separated from his loved ones including a sexy <UNK> by his man loving art manager the picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth kind of like a fresh <UNK> ice cream on a hot summer day and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic it only made the whole thing more profound and critical it is a celebration of life liberty and the right to bear arms and everything else this country stands for juan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> road to <UNK> can be summed up by thomas <UNK> score it's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to <UNK> other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of <UNK> of a woman meeting joe black and the <UNK> redemption you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen as the <UNK> drive round america trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of the <UNK> irish gangsters is <UNK> crossing whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by coppola and <UNK> gangster epics despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of sam <UNK> film which i repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and i was slightly confused as the events that caused michael sullivan to be betrayed but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director <UNK> is br br road to <UNK> is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances i've never been all that keen on tom hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role probably better paul newman plays a character with an irish accent but at no point did i believe i was watching an american screen legend putting on a false accent <UNK> performance works due to the subtle body language his character is torn up by guilt but newman never <UNK> it or goes over the top while never <UNK> newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two brit supporting actors craig and law are also very memorable as american gangsters and while law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how daniel craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become james bond a role which <UNK> the end of an actors career
<START> i watched this movie and the original <UNK> way back to back the difference between the two is disgusting now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script now maybe it's just me but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didn't know rise to power is just a movie that has carlito's name there should have been at least a few characters from the original movie the ending makes no sense in relation to the original in the end of this movie he <UNK> with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie and his woman isn't even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original i would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self with a few decent bits but it <UNK> when held up to it's big brother don't lay awake at night waiting to see this watch the original one more time if you really need a hit
<START> spoilers included br br with a title like bleed you know the creative <UNK> weren't running on high when this puppy was conceived the movie is your basic run of the mill low budget slasher movie oh sure it tries to be creative with the premise of the murder club but we learn that was just a joke anyways okay for those who really care about these things the basic plot is that new girl in town starts dating her co worker he invites her into his circle of friends and at a party they tell her how they have a murder club and they murder people blah blah blah well we learn that it was all a joke but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage now the members of the murder club are being killed one by one oh and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a <UNK> by that time you won't really care though br br in retrospect the first 10 or so minutes of this movie make no sense the motivation for the killings in the beginning of the movie is never explained i would say that it was a way for the director to pad out the film but on the dvd there are deleted scenes i'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the feature length version of bleed but apparently the people behind the dvd thought the viewers would be <UNK> for more on the box it says there are <UNK> eggs but why the hell i would want to waste my time looking for extras on this movie is beyond me br br i was expecting a bad movie and bleed delivered on that front it wasn't a fun bad movie though everyone looks good in the movie and there's plenty of nudity but the acting is just awful my least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer i think he's supposed to be funny and amusing but he just ends up coming off as a tool i think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage in a hilariously unconvincing death heroine <UNK> the women into the parking garage <UNK> pole and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing and she <UNK> out a <UNK> of blood and dies br br for those who think that movie making is an intricate creative process done by professionals check out bleed it will change your mind and you'll realize any hack get can a movie made br br otherwise don't waste your time or money on this
<START> this film is a <UNK> attempt to cash in the success of sex in the city and four <UNK> and a funeral in fact if they'd called it sex at a funeral they might have done better at the box office br br but the film falls between two <UNK> and can't get up the characters <UNK> <UNK> bright dialog but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human one <UNK> senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot and one soon <UNK> of the <UNK> of the whole enterprise br br <UNK> <UNK> gets points for acting her little heart out but the performing <UNK> are stolen by <UNK> <UNK> as of all things a police detective don't they have a height <UNK> over there ms <UNK> seems unable to make a false move would that we could say the same about the writer director br br if <UNK> hill annoyed you as being bogus stay away from this one <UNK> <UNK> on the half shell
<START> this has to be the worst movie i have seen madsen fans don't be drawn into this like i was he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t v had been destroyed
<START> in the year 1985 my birth year steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young african american girl <UNK> debut role for whoopi goldberg whose life is followed through rough times the story begins from the year <UNK> when <UNK> is only 14 years old she has given birth two children for her father <UNK> has a younger sister <UNK> with whom she is <UNK> a widower lays his eyes on <UNK> but their father gives <UNK> to him it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling women are inferior of men and especially being an african american woman their rights are less than a zero <UNK> story is a true survival story br br the color purple is a master piece and <UNK> film of spielberg he should make more drama which the color purple and <UNK> list are good notion br br the cast is amazing whoopi goldberg is known better as a <UNK> funny <UNK> but the introducing role as <UNK> is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama danny glover was surprisingly nasty mister i have never seen him in a such an evil role the talk show icon oprah <UNK> is brilliant as a strong <UNK> <UNK> br br warning prepare to have a number of <UNK> with you when watching this film you can really connect to the story of the strong <UNK> especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sister br br big <UNK> to mr spielberg
<START> i've never really considered myself much of student when it comes to watching films i watch them form an opinion and that's it but unhinged changed all this this film is without a doubt the most inept attempt at film making i've ever seen every kid who rocks up at university thinking they're gonna be the next spielberg or tarantino needs to be handed this film with a <UNK> titled how not to make a film not only is there no story to be had the film makers weren't even competent enough to make a film worth watching it's been a while since i saw it but all i can say is watch the <UNK> tracking shots in the opening scenes they are never ending it's almost like having your teeth pulled only not as much fun
<START> the movie was a huge disappointment especially since it was directed by <UNK> it was sad to see such dismal standards poor screenplay almost non existent and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer some of the scenes were funny but it <UNK> to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration the editing was pathetic dismal overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident in fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the <UNK> br br one wouldn't miss anything at all if you don't watch the movie not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie wait till it appears on tv
<START> nothing 3 outta 5 stars another weird premise from the director of the movie cube this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void there is literally nothing outside of their small two story house intriguing to be sure but i thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get go was extremely ill conceived there needs to be some humour certainly and i have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes their final showdown was definitely a hoot but i really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more <UNK> in reality in the beginning after watching the movie i watched the making of feature on the dvd and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the <UNK> comedic aspects making it look like a completely different and slightly better movie the last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together similar in a way to the recent movie <UNK> the actors are fine when they are not <UNK> the comedy <UNK> they are really quite believable in their more normal moments i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the <UNK> point but it won me over by the end and keep watching past the credits for the final scene just don't ask me to explain it
<START> every time i watch this movie i am more impressed by the whole production i have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made everyone involved is perfect script acting direction sets and editing whilst james stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance and the supporting cast are magnificent it is margaret <UNK> who reveals what an underrated actress she was her tragic personal life give <UNK> to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take breathtaking
<START> i enjoyed the movie very much emotionally intellectually and visually it contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects and doesn't need them one bit holding my attention the entire time with the visuals story and interspersed words of wisdom br br however 1 some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear understand 2 there is unnecessary <UNK> of swearing especially the f word which is the only reason this movie was rated r 3 the movie is balanced with humor and emotion but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film except the final resolution last minutes is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss living in the depths of <UNK> and depression for too long 4 i will not recommend this movie because of 5 seconds of background narration which did not add one bit to the side character it applied to or the film it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward the main character's mother of german <UNK> when watching old wwii movies secretly roots for the germans there would be no local color or art if the <UNK> won the war i don't know of any germans today except radical <UNK> who think the world would be a better place if the <UNK> won wwii
<START> hi i consider just cause one of my favorite sean <UNK> movies it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the cast especially connery it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies so the dialog is pretty good in this one it also has one of the best scenes in movies ever when sean interviews ed <UNK> character in prison is just fantastic i enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough really do not miss this one do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last 30 minutes suck it was as intense as the rest of the movie i really find just cause a very entertaining movie
<START> i cannot say this movie is a disappointment because i read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as i thought it would have the bar was not set that high so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much br br the good the city of new york if you live in the city like me you'll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting rather one of the main characters there are genuinely tender moments humorous conversations and plot twists left and right which all keep things interesting br br the bad the first thing i thought after leaving the theater was that i wanted more but not in the positive leave them wanting more fashion certainly the good skits scenes <UNK> the bad but there are a lot of skits that fall within the in between category too many in fact which is what ultimately brings the movie down also new york city's diversity though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie is never really realized or <UNK> to the point of doing the city justice for example many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites i mean i know the city is home to many of the said <UNK> but come on paris <UNK> plot and character diversity makes new york city look like <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> really white it is just disappointing to see the city <UNK> on its <UNK> like that br br still even after having said this i would recommend giving new york i love you a view who knows maybe you'll disagree with my opinion and maybe you won't you will never know until you see it for yourself this review is not meant to <UNK> anyone from watching this movie as everyone's opinion on art <UNK> i'm just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect
<START> i saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema i thought the film gave a good soldiers point of view it gave a realistic account of men at war the storyline moves at a nice pace showing a group of men behind enemy lines and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner the characters are well developed and believable br br david <UNK> is a good actor and plays the leading role with conviction as does alan <UNK> as german <UNK> i was surprised that i have been unable to find this film on vhs or dvd and i feel it has become the forgotten film which is sad as it is superior to many other war films i have seen
<START> <UNK> <UNK> fans <UNK> this first season of this series is now available from network dvd and i've recently got my copy although very much an ensemble piece of key <UNK> <UNK> floor characters <UNK> <UNK> does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or <UNK> plot line the cultural mix english irish american german polish of head <UNK> wendy <UNK> played by joanna phillips lane group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and to most people seemingly <UNK> subject of financial <UNK> reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast in fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather <UNK> and old fashioned senior management of <UNK> <UNK> as represented by lee wolf richard le <UNK> and james farrell <UNK> <UNK> i suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by <UNK> team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> peter <UNK> <UNK> his thirty per <UNK> stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy relaxed modern way of business become a reality to a certain degree <UNK> i am led to believe immediate <UNK> leonard <UNK> john <UNK> follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his <UNK> for wendy rather sees him <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> on most occasions the main interest in the series i believe <UNK> from the <UNK> romantic attraction between douglas <UNK> <UNK> and the cool self assured blonde haired german <UNK> michelle <UNK> played by <UNK> mcdowell which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship <UNK> that they <UNK> have br br looking forward to <UNK> through this title and hopefully the second season of thirteen won't be too far away
<START> <UNK> if anyone who loves laurel and hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it you're a better person than me this movie while a great attempt at <UNK> laurel and hardy through appearance sound and routine falls very short of <UNK> them or even being a movie of any substance i blame larry <UNK> dialogue is torn from old l h movies and planted in <UNK> the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co stars <UNK> accent was bizarre for stan and while <UNK> did an excellent job with <UNK> accent he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was mr hardy where was a good musical number editing is choppy acting is stiff lines are horrid physics are <UNK> although perhaps they were trying to give it that feel of cheap sets and overall it's a terrible thing to witness it's even more painful to watch than <UNK> k where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography do yourself a favor and watch as much of the original laurel and hardy films as you can and learn how things were you know what a <UNK> is don't you stan laurel did not <UNK> <UNK> with semi moronic <UNK> at every sentence br br i pity anyone who thinks that this was a decent update honor of the boys where was the classic theme song why ruin <UNK> another fine <UNK> why skip <UNK> the <UNK> why was there a pointless <UNK> of co stars why miss <UNK> from the wizard of oz why must larry <UNK> be in it why <UNK> and did the learning channel help <UNK> the thing br br i mean really fart jokes for god's sake br br fart jokes
<START> this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen without a doubt the only thing interesting in this film is the cameo appearances from some great genre directors and king himself the film has a great premise but falls apart about 15 minutes into the story i did like <UNK> <UNK> in this film and think she could have a very good career in film
<START> another variation and <UNK> on the famous and beloved children tale la <UNK> 1975 aka the beast tries to imagine in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way what actually happened between beauty and the beast i am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie i would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration longing <UNK> or satirical <UNK> of the catholic religion i would not even call it a horror erotic movie it's more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it's got some shocking moments in all <UNK> that sure will stay in your memory br br the long way too long scene between an <UNK> young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable i've ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive well <UNK> is set to the <UNK> music of <UNK> and is hysterical my husband and i both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter the moral of the scene is beauty can and will defeat the monster the question is who is the target audience for the film for an erotic picture it is too <UNK> for an art movie it's got too many jaw dropping scenes of sheer madness and i'd say an abrupt ending imo the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama as a parody of art house horror <UNK> it is funny and certainly original have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning this story of the curious <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> certainly is not recommended for co viewing with the children the opening scene that may shock an <UNK> viewer much more than the infamous scene of <UNK> can be successfully used on discovery channel for the program like in the world of animals <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of horses
<START> <UNK> is a god damned legend make no mistake until recently i worked for a uk <UNK> video <UNK> chain running their testing department we would go through many new starters they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various <UNK> that returns as non <UNK> in one way or another from the stores now to <UNK> test the resolve of these new staff members we would issue them with a copy of going overboard we had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of <UNK> dvd player that had this film as a free gift got round to sending their dvd player back they never failed to send <UNK> back also our new staff would be forced to use only going overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with br br now as to why this film is so bad where do i begin br br adam sandler who can be so so very funny as in happy <UNK> or the wedding singer must have been having one hell of an off day the rest of the crew <UNK> and what is it with billy zane his name <UNK> up in several of the worst movies of all time and he is a decent actor crazy the production quality is absolute zero br br i would have been inclined to give this a zero if i could because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on release even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far sandler has come and just how low he can go
<START> elvis <UNK> plays a half breed native american indian who has to defend his <UNK> from nasty business <UNK> everyone likes to get drunk fight and make children fighting wrestling and <UNK> out each other replace the stereotypical hand raised expression how br br although he does have make up on it's obvious elvis is <UNK> than he appeared in prior films possibly he was getting ready for his famous comeback it couldn't have been because this movie's script was anything to get excited about joan blondell trying to seduce elvis and burgess meredith in war paint should be ashamed br br the best song is stay away actually green <UNK> with different lyrics the most embarrassing song is <UNK> love song to the bull dominic there are some surreal scenes but it never becomes <UNK> enough to succeed in that genre though stay away joe might provide some laughs if you're in the right mood br br otherwise stay away br br stay away joe 1968 peter <UNK> elvis <UNK> burgess meredith joan blondell
<START> i think this is a lovely family movie there are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart warming moments to be had throughout the movie the actors are great and the effects well executed throughout danny glover plays george knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'the <UNK> and is great throughout the film also fantastic are the young actors joseph gordon <UNK> and <UNK> davis jr christopher lloyd is good as al 'the <UNK> and the effects are great in this top notch disney movie a touching and heart warming movie which everyone should enjoy
<START> wow this was another good spin off of the original american pie not as good as band camp but definitely a lot better the naked mile dwight and <UNK> <UNK> lead the comedy in this one but i actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked mile the script was written a lot better and the comedy <UNK> more smoothly however most of the comedy came from sex but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies anyway right br br the midget rock also had a really good cameo considering the intense effort given by him in the naked mile his scene with <UNK> was awesome and had me laughing my ass off when i saw it br br the movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile if you liked any previous american pie films you should like <UNK> house unless you view all of the american pie spin offs a waste of money
<START> sure he became rapidly uneven after this film but from knife in the water up till the tenant roman polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique despite many running themes alienation paranoia no two of his films are really alike the story of this is somewhat similar to his own <UNK> from ten years earlier but the tone is completely different the tenant manages to balance darker than dark absurdity i'm a bit <UNK> on calling it humor even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny with some truly suspenseful paranoia polanski was always a master at building <UNK> and moments in this film are almost <UNK> creepy the overall weirdness of the film is also a plus br br in addition to <UNK> exquisite as usual direction the rest of the cast and crew offer great <UNK> polanski the actor is often overshadowed by polanski the director but his performance here truly captures his characters <UNK> and sense of being an <UNK> the themes of social <UNK> make this film more than just <UNK> for the sake of being strange the rest of the cast offers strong performances also especially isabelle <UNK> sympathetic turn and <UNK> douglas and shelley <UNK> appropriately annoying ones the tenant is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both <UNK> and rosemary's baby but its just as brilliant as either of those classics 9 10
<START> actually this flick made in 1999 has pretty good production values the actors are attractive and reasonably talented there aren't a bunch of <UNK> running around <UNK> away <UNK> hundreds of rounds but never hitting flesh nor are there wild car chases crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are <UNK> <UNK> br br the interiors look <UNK> modern <UNK> and the equipment looks up to snuff well there is that high tech computer room <UNK> with what look like <UNK> from a <UNK> <UNK> lab and the <UNK> make up on the corpses <UNK> me up not <UNK> make up in the conventional sense but what looks like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over their exposed skin this is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have <UNK> though how the virus would accomplish this <UNK> is an exercise left for the student viewer br br ah yes the virus i would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci fi horror flick i know of but i can't a computer virus that is <UNK> via a television or computer <UNK> screen and becomes a lethal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a break <UNK> drives a la star trek are one thing but <UNK> becoming <UNK> this is so silly the desired fright factor just isn't <UNK> the flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive or have a cat jump out of the closet or something because the <UNK> <UNK> isn't doing it br br one <UNK> robert wagner has the same excuse for playing in this <UNK> that lord oliver gave for some of his later trashy <UNK> he needed the money no other comparison between the two should be <UNK> however
<START> we should all <UNK> uwe boll he's done the <UNK> he may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on imdb he's like some kind of cinematic <UNK> no matter how little talent he has and no matter how bad these movies are he manages to keep making them i know he <UNK> them all himself through some kind of bizarre german <UNK> but even so his ability to keep making movies despite absolute complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe br br it wouldn't be so bad except that video game <UNK> keep giving their best <UNK> to this guy i really enjoyed the alone in the dark series of games even the latest one the new nightmare was good for a few hours of game play there was a good movie to be made out of edward <UNK> adventures but this is not it now uwe boll has gotten his hands on <UNK> and hunter the <UNK> what's next silent hill doom i can only imagine the <UNK> that this guy is going to cut through game to movie adaptations if he's not stopped someone needs to take away his line of credit or these video game <UNK> need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise no one is interested in that title any more br br think about it is house of the dead or alone in the dark a <UNK> game title anymore no way a new house of the dead game comes out for x box and <UNK> gonna care the title is dead and all because of uwe boll so if any of you out there work for a game <UNK> or know a game <UNK> or have access to a game <UNK> please warn them br br this movie itself is not even worth reviewing i can't separate what i didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it literally everything about it sucks the writing the acting the music the cg effects the editing i thought that if i waited until it came out on dvd and then rented it with low expectations i wouldn't be disappointed boy was i wrong never <UNK> <UNK> ability to turn out a big steaming pile of boll sh t
<START> spoilers strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film allow me to add balance by pointing out the following br br script dreadful as tom and dan are getting to know each other <UNK> about films the talk is clearly that of one person and i suspect it was the director who carefully worked his words to sound intelligent at one point dan asks have you heard of the hiv virus and it sounds about as natural as asking have you <UNK> with the nine alien races br br acting white teeth do and a <UNK> face do not a sensitive performer make <UNK> did well enough with what he was given i suppose but <UNK> was terrible unsympathetic unbelievable and downright smug and smarmy throughout his <UNK> there is an <UNK> to his performances also see <UNK> 60 br br plot spare me the moments of half escape were not thrilling but irritating and weak recall <UNK> pretending to try keys in the door and then throwing them down they don't work man <UNK> <UNK> and beware the semi black and white flashbacks which are <UNK> with some <UNK> sound taken from <UNK> and other crime dramas br br most important of all most dangerous evil and offensive is the <UNK> <UNK> or internal you decide in a film in which hiv is considered a weapon tom says that dan may have taken off the <UNK> or not used it at all excuse me where was tom while they were having sex there is some <UNK> of the <UNK> partner which comes off as a <UNK> of the gay man in general br br in sum beware
<START> the first one was the best the second one sucked because the dialog was terrible although the storyline wasn't so bad in fact all story lines are good and bad throughout the movie i <UNK> off a few times i know that jackie chan is a great martial arts expertise but not a good actor in rush hour 2 chris tucker too wasn't good and zhang <UNK> what can i say a few lines terrible acting but that's based on her script all the characters there were not that good but some of the things i like in rush hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes i know that jackie chan doesn't do those things which is good for him
<START> maybe i'm really getting old but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely surely there must be something powerful wrong with this <UNK> that's me <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> what i would give to see the light firstly that phil <UNK> manic energy wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life if you will although it is possible that the series first titled you'll never get rich 1955 <UNK> could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt <UNK> it is very hard to picture any other actor comedian in the business wearing those master <UNK> <UNK> br br such a strong <UNK> is <UNK> though not the same sort of career <UNK> <UNK> of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys like <UNK> more the lone ranger george reeves the adventures of superman and charles nelson <UNK> uncle <UNK> block br br one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and <UNK> such a work from the 1950's tv screen to the 1990's movie going public is our collective memory without being sure about what <UNK> of the crowd remembered the <UNK> character from seeing the original run and early <UNK> <UNK> and their numbers were surely considerable even a large segment of the young had seen <UNK> reruns in recent times it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles or even light years apart br br so as not to be thought of as a totally square old <UNK> please let's consider some other points br br right here today the <UNK> day of november in the year of our lord 2007 let me swear and <UNK> under <UNK> that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years furthermore i've enjoyed the wit and talents of <UNK> <UNK> co stars dan <UNK> and the late phil <UNK> after all it was the talents of guys like this and so many others <UNK> of nbc s saturday night and second city tv that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing but a <UNK> re make it just didn't click br br perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy always liked 'em but without the <UNK> show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by <UNK> old guys like me br br so we've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately what's next <UNK> about somebody doing hal <UNK> world war ii army comedy series of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and tv's 1st cartoon series <UNK> rabbit remember where you heard it first <UNK> <UNK>
<START> for anyone who may not know what a one actor movie was like this is the best example this plot is ridiculous and really makes no sense it's full of cliched situations hackneyed lines melodrama comedy you name it br br but amitabh bachchan can make anything convincing and this movie is by no means an exception everyone turns in a decent performance <UNK> kapoor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but it is the <UNK> who <UNK> everyone with his <UNK> presence without him this movie would have been a non <UNK> the story is about <UNK> mistaken identities <UNK> love hate loyalty good vs evil everything really <UNK> is a brilliant performance on all counts in an otherwise silly film and did i mention that it is ridiculously funny
<START> beforehand <UNK> i'm sure someone is going to <UNK> me of playing the race card here but when i saw the preview for this movie i was thinking finally i have yet to see one movie about popular african influenced dance be it popular hip hop moves breaking or stepping where the main character was a black woman i've seen an excessive amount of movies where a non black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it <UNK> <UNK> 2 save the last dance step up but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop african influenced dance and breaking was with blacks and <UNK> in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn't always men who performed it so i felt this movie has been a long time coming however the race does not make the film so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot the dancing be entertaining and interesting to watch br br pros i really enjoyed this film bringing <UNK> culture i can't recall ever seeing a popular mainstream film where all the main characters were <UNK> had believable accents and weren't stereotypical with the <UNK> the <UNK> family friends and even the thugs were all really intelligent realistic people who were trying to love live and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive even when the audience was made aware that the main character's sister chose an alternate lifestyle it still didn't make the plot stereotypical i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed i loved the stepping the romantic <UNK> relationship going on between two <UNK> the trials that the main character's parents were going through and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with <UNK> in a barrel i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time and so many other <UNK> in the film were handling themselves in the step world they were all just as excellent as the <UNK> i don't see that in too many movies nowadays at least not those that would be considered black films br br cons i'm not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this but i question whether they've been to real step shows whenever the <UNK> got ready to perform some hip hop song would play in place of the <UNK> hand feet beats at a real step show there is zero need for music other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups and then when hip hop songs were played sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the <UNK> hands and feet it was awkward i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus <UNK> the yard another great stepping movie because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys in <UNK> the yard <UNK> good got all of a few seconds of some <UNK> <UNK> and hair flip and the <UNK> let out a <UNK> and a few steps and were cut immediately even when there were very small scenes the ladies <UNK> it up especially in the auto shop and it was without all that music to <UNK> out their physical music i know <UNK> have to be sold but the movie folks could've played the music in other parts of the film br br i'm not a <UNK> cole fan so every time i saw her all i kept thinking was is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks she looked uncomfortable on screen to me i thought they should've used a host like free or <UNK> instead <UNK> davis was funny as usual though also i <UNK> when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto like stepping couldn't possibly happen anywhere else hollywood as usual however only a couple of people were portrayed as <UNK> ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers which mainstream movies tend to do br br i would've given this movie five stars but the music playing killed it for me i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs
<START> gone with the wind is one of the most overrated movies in history it is a film loved by mothers <UNK> and shut ins who go to the movies once every five years as a zombie movie it blows there isn't a <UNK> corpse in sight and it's terribly light in the gore department zombie 3 on the other hand is big on <UNK> corpses and quite generous with its blood <UNK> therefore it is better than gone with the wind it is also not overrated most reviewers are under no <UNK> that it is rubbish it is however not boring rubbish after a terrorist steals a virus he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter and the <UNK> <UNK> into the ground the terrorist who has been exposed to the nasty <UNK> hides in a hotel room where he slowly <UNK> into a flesh eating zombie one of his first <UNK> is a cleaning lady once she's bitten lucio <UNK> brand of hell breaks loose as usual for a fulci flick the acting is atrocious the storyline is <UNK> with plot holes and the gore is <UNK> turns out the film was directed by fulci and bruno mattei so that explains its rather <UNK> nature it is badly shot too poorly edited and the sound design is flat still it is saved by its <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> of murders and its <UNK> pacing definitely worth picking up if you're an undead <UNK> or don't like gone with the wind undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time
<START> as usual sean connery does a great job lawrence <UNK> is good but i have a hard time not seeing him as <UNK> turner
<START> i saw this movie with my dad i must have been pretty young around 15 it was on star movies one afternoon the movie started a bit vaguely but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score it really caught pace after the first half hour br br all the actors are great especially <UNK> and lou diamond i guess it's the ensemble they just play so well together i can watch this film anytime i think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score the jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious br br a perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon
<START> i remember watching this film back in <UNK> when it first came out what an awful film the acting was atrocious the plot was so flimsy it would or is that should have blew away in a breath of wind i think it put me to sleep on more than one occasion i was not tired that i remember please avoid at all costs better still have all your teeth taken out with no <UNK> <UNK> that would be more entertaining it's just a pity i couldn't give it a zero or a negative score i wish i had not wasted my money getting this one from the video shop all i can say was that the tape it was on was still brand new practically hardly surprising as the film was so poor if i remember right i sat watched it with a girl i really wanted to go out with the fact she was sat next to me was still not enough to keep me awake thats how bad this film was
<START> spoiler alert br br i love tim roth i really do and he does his best with an unbelievable role i can see how this is a movie that might look good as a script but it's convoluted unlikely and ultimately silly i saw the fake death ending coming a mile away <UNK> z tries hard with an <UNK> part and so does patricia arquette the detective whose name i can't remember the one that's not chris penn is a big <UNK> over actor see it if you're not smart enough to <UNK> between a movie being so clever you can't follow it and so confusing you can't understand it see it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you <UNK> see it if you love to watch tim roth work with an <UNK> script see it if it comes on late at night for free otherwise rent the usual suspects
<START> this alec guinness <UNK> is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry and a light eccentric character study as well br br the pacing is a bit slow for a comedy and none of it is really rolling on the floor type funny except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments but it does have its amusing moments and it is very <UNK> in its execution the big explosions segment is probably the most <UNK> element br br the union <UNK> are quite <UNK> very reminiscent of i'm all right jack especially the feminine <UNK> with a light romantic crush on <UNK> character the political <UNK> actually carry the story ernest <UNK> is very notable as a heavy br br i don't think this one works quite as well as the <UNK> or kind hearts and <UNK> but even light ealing comedy is better than nothing
<START> i love this film the songs and story lines are great fun and the song saying goodbye always moves me what a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever great voices and great talent why were all the other muppet films that came after this one so much less interesting moving and funny is it that mr <UNK> is just so very missed
<START> the name cult movie is often given to films which continue to be screened or to sell in home movie format more than a generation after they were first released <UNK> which was first released in 1973 now comes into this category its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film br br despite the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air <UNK> a career option which in the 1970's was <UNK> regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl and which also <UNK> her to <UNK> the traditional <UNK> who <UNK> has a wife in every <UNK> since she holds black belt status in karate she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence and is in no way <UNK> to any of her extensive <UNK> of male <UNK> this film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce its appeal to <UNK> is also <UNK> by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to <UNK> a <UNK> and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate to ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners the director has wisely <UNK> that is <UNK> <UNK> with eye candy br br <UNK> can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing it is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year's time despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come however the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 4 10
<START> this film is an excellent military movie it may not be an excellent hollywood movie but that does not matter hollywood has a reputation of <UNK> accuracy for good entertainment but that is not the case with this movie other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste but  as a retired soldier  i appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes <UNK> the story itself has been told and <UNK> several times over but it remains for a professional soldier  and an african american at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew and as it presents the us navy to the world the story of <UNK> work to become a navy diver and his life as a navy diver beyond his <UNK> is not the only story that is presented there i also the story of how master chief petty officer sunday <UNK> the illegal order of his commanding officer that petty officer 2nd class brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did and paid the price of a loss of one <UNK> and a change of assignment it also told the true story how brashear found the third <UNK> bombs lost in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain in the 1950's and how he saved the life of another <UNK> who was in the line of the <UNK> running line that would have <UNK> him in two if brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself this was a complex story that was worth telling and i will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story and i can tell from the deleted scenes on the dvd that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible as a professional soldier i was proud to see such a great story told in such a <UNK> manner and to see the traditions and honor of the navy <UNK> in such a natural and full manner
<START> disappearance is about a couple who take their family on vacation in new mexico and find themselves in deep trouble after taking a <UNK> off the main highway to visit a town that was seemingly abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons the town of weaver seems harmless at first and has tourist appeal until the family is stranded there overnight and they begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced their same <UNK> with fatal <UNK> the <UNK> watch a blair witch project esquire video diary left by the town's last victim which ironically demonstrates the best performance of anyone in this movie although <UNK> and <UNK> performances are much better than the supporting <UNK> their emotional affect seems flat to me throughout the movie br br disappearance has appeal for most of the movie as there is much suspense and good direction however the plot takes unexpected and implausible turns that seemingly make no sense worse yet it that there really is no understanding of what exactly is going on in the movie which makes the bizarre ending less tolerable it appeared to me that the movie makers were so focused on making a stream of suspenseful scenes that they threw away all the elements of good story making plot development <UNK> explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a cohesive solution outcome br br the most difficult aspect of the movie for me was that the first three quarter of it was spent building up tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were then suddenly <UNK> of as if we didn't deserve an explanation br br what was the significance of the indian symbols on the walls what happened to the original people of weaver what was the connection with the people at the dinner what did the sheriff know what did the missing boy discover if anything br br this was i believe a bad move since it <UNK> some <UNK> i had invested quite a bit of <UNK> into <UNK> some plausible explanations for some of these plot turns and strange events only to have the movie makers simply end it without giving an answer to any of these things these are some nice <UNK> for the ending of a miniseries that is about to pickup again next week but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending for a stand alone movie
<START> this film is unusual and bizarre and it is nearly unusual and bizarre in a very good way i give this short a 7 just because it is so unique and off the wall but much of the time it seems as though it is being bizarre just for the sake of being bizarre if the film had managed to <UNK> its more bizarre moments into some semblance of a plot then it would have been really fantastic br br the main problem here is that it looks as though the creators just <UNK> together a bunch of crap about <UNK> then threw in a whole bunch more crap that sounded as though it would sound funny coming from the mouth of a <UNK> br br this is definitely worth checking out but it is not top rate by any stretch of the creators wild <UNK>
<START> well not actually this movie is very entertaining though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be something in my eye routine the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he <UNK> in fact all the characters are great the movie is not overly funny or sappy good flick to go see with the wife br br all in all 8 10 note i am not an easy <UNK> thats all from <UNK> over and out
<START> let's start by the simple lines from the viewer's side there a couple of good director details some points of view at the movie scenes that are nice the special effects are good enough a good acting good scenery also but the story is way too simple it shows how a elite army bomb squad unit lives acts and sometimes dies it shows the drama of living in war in my movie experience as a serious action movie addicted guy i missed that click that gets my eyes and mind stuck on the screen one of the things that need to be present in a movie in order to i consider it a good one is the ability of <UNK> the viewer in the movie reality and time it didn't happened to me i stayed conscious for the entire movie br br honestly speaking i think that this movie gained its place in fame based on the <UNK> appeal of american <UNK> a healthy and genuine feeling but not the adequate use as a movie fame <UNK> more than a movie about war it grows its popularity based on that br br a simple thought if this was a world war ii or i movie only changing time with everything remained the same would it be this awarded sure not why because there are great ones that elevate the bar way to high br br compared against its rivals in the oscars i don't think that all of the <UNK> it won are correctly awarded
<START> fact stargate sg 1 is a cheesy sci fi tv series br br there's no escaping facts how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg 1 remains a cheesy sci fi tv series br br stargate sg 1 does borrow and steal ideas <UNK> special fx aren't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn't going to blow you out of the chair or couch for that matter either br br but and this is where i really think stargate sg 1 deserves all the credit it can get for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour tv episode br br in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies br br and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg 1 special br br i am very <UNK> with my <UNK> i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught br br so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg 1 as yet another tacky sci fi show don't stick with it and you'll see what i'm talking about
<START> it took us a couple of episodes to get into dark angel as a story and a series since we were <UNK> from the sopranos a very different mentality <UNK> but once we got with the <UNK> of the series we were very quickly hooked it's a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category dark <UNK> much more than your average tv series it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to mutants reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face and make everyday that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and <UNK> the anti <UNK> message from being <UNK> in our faces hence not ruining the fun for those who don't like to be <UNK> during entertainment but every event and human societal interaction remains relevant to the present we all make <UNK> face our own prejudices but in the end the question of who you are lies in do you sit back and shut your mind to it or do you get up and do something about it for those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice this series <UNK> them for those who've never had to face the question this series <UNK> in that message under the <UNK> of pure action entertainment it is much more well made and well written than most tv series i'm highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear
<START> i saw this film under the title of tied up in general i have enjoyed <UNK> movies so gave this one a try it wasn't worth it i have read some of the previous comments about the box <UNK> viewers don't be fooled this is a poor film at best the acting is nonexistent the plot what little there is of one is very predictable the movie in places seems to be chopped together this one just plain stinks the place up not even worth the price of a cheap night rental as a bit of a dolph fan i kept waiting to see him in action by the end of the movie you will still be waiting best to avoid this film and spend your time watching almost anything else
<START> pierce brosnan has <UNK> his last <UNK> and returns in an outrageous self parody as the aging foul mouthed <UNK> assassin julian noble who has a particular <UNK> for teenage girls <UNK> and tacky clothes during a job in mexico city he meets danny greg kinnear a straight faced denver suburban business man who's in town to make his deal of a life time in a hotel bar despite their completely different personalities and <UNK> crude and <UNK> remarks they become friends br br largely carried by the performances of pierce brosnan and greg kinnear director richard shepard revealed that he didn't write the film with pierce brosnan in mind but i can hardly imagine this without him he proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just james bond or cold war spies the scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar stunning sets and beautifully photographed really is a <UNK> piece of acting skills the scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and although it was probably carefully scripted the two actors are largely <UNK> but they succeed wonderfully it almost feels like a new standard in screen acting think of robert de niro and harvey keitel in mean <UNK> <UNK> and add one of the most subtle <UNK> of many genre clichés and the actors' own <UNK> <UNK> james bond in particular and you got one of the most delightful <UNK> in recent hollywood br br sadly the story wears thin after a while after an hour the film just runs out of steam nevertheless and i can't put my finger on it exactly i did enjoy this very much it just feels very fresh and original with some imaginative use of sets and lighting and some hints to <UNK> <UNK> and jean pierre <UNK> the other characters aren't given much to do but this film does offer something new in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in <UNK> all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof very amusing br br camera <UNK> 7 10
<START> i was so surprised when i saw this film so much underrated i understand why some of you dislike this movie its pace is slow a characteristic of japanese films nevertheless if you are absorbed in the film like me you will find this not a problem at all br br i must say this is the best comedy i have ever seen shall we <UNK> is often considered a masterpiece of japanese comedies it is very different from hollywood ones e g austin powers or scary movies in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes rather it is light hearted a movie that makes you feel good br br i love the movie because it makes me feel real the plot is straightforward yet pleasing i was so delighted seeing that <UNK> the main role has found the meaning of life in dancing before i watched the film i was slightly depressed due to heavy <UNK> i felt lost however this film made me think of the bright side of life i believed i was in the same boat of <UNK> if he could find himself in his <UNK> why couldn't i it reminded me of exploring my own future and discovering the happiness in my daily life br br it is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers while some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect i kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really alive learning to dance as the film goes on br br over all this film is <UNK> and heart warming as a comedy it does its job perfectly it definitely deserves 10 stars br br and yes <UNK> is funny d
<START> what a night perry mason then have gun will travel followed by <UNK> when it was a half hour and finally at 10 <UNK> came <UNK> <UNK> with its wonderful opening theme music and <UNK> boat <UNK> off to a new adventure terrific regardless of the story it was the lead character played by lloyd bridges strong honest sincere a man's man and a boy's man this brought on an interest in <UNK> that lasted for years why they don't show on cable or make it available on video no idea too bad
<START> i miss dark angel br br i understand not ever one likes it but as far as i'm concerned the show should not have been canceled especially for another space show mock up br br i'm reading the books now they are doing a pretty good job of explaining somethings but i still think we should get a tv movie or something br br the freak nation lives
<START> i loved it so much that i bought the dvd and the novel at the same time the chemistry between the actors including little arthur is amazing and thrilling br br it could have used a bit more screen time for the <UNK> <UNK> lawrence played by james <UNK> and gilbert <UNK> was amazingly on it from the very start of the movie br br the one who most thrilled me via surprising shock and awe and wonder was rupert graves as arthur <UNK> i adore him in <UNK> saga and all else i've seen him in but he <UNK> himself here as arthur in my <UNK> dreams i could not have <UNK> him playing a demented psycho such as arthur <UNK> but he does and i love it and i love him
<START> i'm glad that users as of this date who liked this movie are now coming forward i don't understand the people who didn't like this movie it seems like they were expecting a serious treatment c'mon how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously the filmmakers knew this was a silly premise and they didn't try to deny it the straight faced delivery of scenes actually makes it funny yes there are times where the low budget shows such as that explosion scene but i think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie so if you like b movies and the goofy premise appeals to you then you'll certainly like jack frost
<START> german filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he's <UNK> fellow <UNK> uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made br br <UNK> is truly the ed wood of the new millennium this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of <UNK> i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in <UNK> <UNK> fascinated to see just low the bar could be set the answer is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a pit and buried it br br the fun begins with the cast of international <UNK> only someone who has lived in los angeles where every auto mechanic doctor and <UNK> is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered could easily understand how <UNK> managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to <UNK> his ridiculous dialog with a straight face br br the main character a villainous beat cop is played by a german actor with a thick german accent aside from being a serial killer he is also the oldest beat cop in la despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners the <UNK> refuses to investigate going so far as to physically attack one of his <UNK> in a ninja style raid on his apartment br br the sets are excruciatingly bad the production <UNK> budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint <UNK> <UNK> on a cardboard wall br br since the actors were obviously <UNK> non professionals a sad assortment of european <UNK> possibly <UNK> if they acted in their native lands <UNK> <UNK> and desperate middle aged women and since little if any money was spent on sets special <UNK> locations or other production value it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms sadly they couldn't afford a police car the <UNK> cops cruise the streets in a shiny new <UNK> rental br br more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german <UNK> officer and the <UNK> efforts of two young <UNK> to stop him one of these young actors is especially <UNK> because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies the other fits right in with a <UNK> <UNK> and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated br br the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie as the victims of our killer are <UNK> after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo <UNK> to have a protective spell put on her don't ask why a girl from romania would resort to <UNK> in anticipation of being murdered just accept <UNK> logic and enjoy the absurd ride br br after much prolonged hand <UNK> out of straw covered <UNK> graves the zombie girls manage to make their appearance they look exactly as they did before death maybe even <UNK> with black <UNK> make up <UNK> <UNK> around their eyes looking nothing like zombies they look more like high fashion models ready for the <UNK> br br at this point in the movie <UNK> borrows a creative note from his <UNK> <UNK> boll and <UNK> large doses of cheesy euro trash <UNK> into the soundtrack we're talking <UNK> electronic <UNK> noise stuff they might have played in an <UNK> disco when <UNK> was still young enough to shake his <UNK> br br unlike other zombies <UNK> girls speak and function as normal er i mean as they did before becoming <UNK> this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog yes a golden shower it is br br i won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending all i can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece the spirit of ed wood lives on or should i say his <UNK>
<START> this happy go luck 1939 military <UNK> based rather loosely on <UNK> <UNK> memorable poem as well as his novel soldiers three qualifies as first rate entertainment about the british <UNK> army in india in the <UNK> cary grant delivers more knock about blows with his <UNK> up <UNK> than he did in all of his movies put together set in <UNK> india this six <UNK> yarn <UNK> on the exploits of three rugged british <UNK> and their native water <UNK> gunga din sam <UNK> who <UNK> with a <UNK> cult of murderous indians called the <UNK> sergeant <UNK> cutter cary grant of the last <UNK> sergeant <UNK> oscar winner victor mclaglen of the informer and sergeant <UNK> douglas fairbanks jr of the dawn <UNK> are a <UNK> trio of hard drinking hard <UNK> and fun loving <UNK> males whose years of <UNK> are about to become history because <UNK> plans to marry emmy <UNK> joan fontaine and enter the tea business naturally cutter and <UNK> drum up <UNK> schemes to <UNK> <UNK> plans when their superiors order them back into action with sgt <UNK> <UNK> robert <UNK> of the <UNK> steps out cutter and <UNK> drug <UNK> so that he cannot <UNK> them and <UNK> has to replace him half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to <UNK> each other without hating themselves director george stevens <UNK> the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes <UNK> with an army of <UNK> <UNK> joseph h august received an oscar nomination for his outstanding black white cinematography
<START> with the death of george <UNK> on 4 <UNK> 2002 i thought of this most interesting program which even though it had only a short run was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout generally unseen for over 40 years it would be worth viewing again the opening credits showed many <UNK> images one of which was a <UNK> of colonel john paul <UNK> riding his famed rocket <UNK> at the point where he was often referred to as the <UNK> man alive
<START> excellent plot within a plot within a plot shame about two of my film heroes having a good <UNK> must be my upbringing br br very well acted by all you never quite know who's going to out do who the last little twist at the end allows for all to get their just <UNK> br br recommend to all a harmless tongue in cheek thriller which if it has any faults is probably michael <UNK> over use of the word bloody but that's his signature isn't it br br 9 10
<START> come on they did that on purpose two of my current <UNK> on tv <UNK> from oz and l and o <UNK> and <UNK> from west wing hook up for a nice little sleeper character study <UNK> nothing fancy but the acting is right on the mark tim <UNK> shows up for some neat bits worth a look
<START> there is a scene in this film at about the <UNK> minute mark that is among the worst i have seen in some time as f scott fitzgerald gregory peck and <UNK> graham deborah kerr are <UNK> on the beach suddenly things become tense and <UNK> begins to cry at which point she tells her lover about her <UNK> past this dramatic scene becomes so terribly overdone and <UNK> i couldn't help but turn to my wife and <UNK> how stupid it all was as dramatic music <UNK> on the television as it all came to a phony <UNK> no one experiences moments like this no one now how much of the rest of the film is true i cannot say but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an 8 <UNK> and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct the film is a lot of <UNK> however i am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didn't seem to clear this up either br br just who were f scott fitzgerald and <UNK> graham and what was their relationship really like what i do know about fitzgerald however does seem different from what i saw in the film was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film well considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with graham and <UNK> like a fish i'd assume he wasn't was he as obnoxious and <UNK> as we later see in the film perhaps but if he was this bad and yet ms graham stayed with him then this makes her out to be a complete <UNK> and not someone you'd like to see featured in a film and if he wasn't then the film does a poor <UNK> to his memory either way it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience br br the sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people in a dark and <UNK> way some might find this all very entertaining but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way unpleasant but with glossy production values especially the music which was lovely but way over the top it begs the question why did they even choose to make this in the first place the bottom line it's a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time even if like me you are big gregory peck fan
<START> i originally gave this episode a rating of two i now wish i'd thought more about it i also wish they had negative rating <UNK> br br watching it i was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish i adore ron <UNK> and john carpenter so what went wrong last season episode 13 was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue i think that this season mr carpenter managed to make something so grey area that you can't immediately see if he is pro choice or anti abortion it was only after i sat and thought about it that i realized he is very much anti abortion you get this most clearly in the end when the <UNK> shoots the baby and kills it to the <UNK> of the <UNK> who walks off in grief leaving the mother <UNK> but you also see it in the way the ron p character is treated i hardly think that if someone has proved themselves enough of a threat in the past so as to have a <UNK> order against him that they would not immediately be <UNK> the police instead we have the guard almost <UNK> dealing with him only to pay for it in the end i don't mind someone having a strong view on something even if it isn't something i agree in but i do think its a bit lame not to stand by that view rather than trying to look like they're sitting somewhere in the middle br br but political issues aside this episode was beyond poor the music was retro 70's and just plain didn't work the acting other than ron p was poor the effects were dreadful it might have been better just to not show the monster at all rather than show the lame excuse for a monster they had br br all this being said i'm glad they have the masters of horror i don't mind sitting through some really poor episodes to find the good ones its a bit like renting horror movies from the video store every now and again you get a good one and it makes it all worth while i do agree with the poster that said maybe the name needs to change from masters some of these people just plain don't deserve the title let me stress tho even tho i hated this episode john carpenter totally deserves the title he is a master thru and thru
<START> to begin with i loved <UNK> <UNK> 1 it had a lot of classic jokes including that unlucky guy in the <UNK> who always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time he is still acting the same guy in the <UNK> <UNK> 2 movie but in my opinion hes performance is not as funny as it was in the first movie in fact you don't notice him much at all a thing that made me think bad about this movie is the choice of <UNK> in this movie there are only race <UNK> they sure is <UNK> but those do not make waves like the big floating <UNK> used in the first movie i liked the old ones better and these new <UNK> makes one of the last scenes look ridiculous when the man in the <UNK> suddenly jumps out of it to <UNK> the big waves from those small <UNK> <UNK> truly a minus you have to accept that we're not living in the same sweden as in 1974 anymore this movie also contains a bit more violence than the first one although the movie was great all in all i've just concentrated on some cons that i was disappointed in but the rest of the movie were up to my expectations so go see it it's worth the money
<START> i actually like asylum movies i've made it a habit to see as many as possible even the rip offs they've done have been cool like <UNK> and when a killer calls this is just plain lame i can't believe that the same people who made dead men walking and <UNK> curse actually made this movie too it's not even laughably bad like jolly roger or alien <UNK> which by the way are pretty bad this is just bad i mean i can appreciate and or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an asylum movie but this film takes itself way too seriously i really hope that snakes on a train is better now that's a movie i can't wait to see
<START> i'm kinda torn on dark angel the film appears to be a loving tribute to the greatest pin up to ever live but there is so little actual content that the film itself is virtually pointless i can't really see what the motivation or point of this film is as there is very little <UNK> information provided in the narrative so those who don't know much about bettie aren't gonna know much more after watching dark angel either br br the film basically chronicles the last few years of <UNK> career in bondage <UNK> almost the entire film is comprised of re <UNK> of some of <UNK> more famous photo shoots and <UNK> these re <UNK> take up literally 75 of the films run time and give virtually no insight into bettie as a person the film touches briefly on her short lived legitimate acting <UNK> and her subsequent decision to leave the business and become religious but all of this is pretty much <UNK> over in favor of showing long and drawn out re <UNK> scenes br br dark angel isn't a horrible film there's just no substance to it the other problem is that the actress that plays bettie only really resembles her in <UNK> away shots up close it's a no go the other thing that irritated me is that although bettie did several topless <UNK> shoots the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a <UNK> during the end credits the film itself is obviously extremely low budget but does what it can set and costume wise within it's limitations so no <UNK> from me there the acting is pretty wooden and <UNK> from everyone involved in fact the most memorable thing about the whole film for me was <UNK> during the end credits that the actor who played irving <UNK> real name is <UNK> <UNK> no joke check the cast list can't say that i recommend this one too highly unless you are a true <UNK> <UNK> and must own anything relating to her and if you are that bad off then you need to seek treatment anyway 4 10
<START> truly this is a <UNK> <UNK> film it won the george <UNK> award winning over roots so that may tell you something of the essence of this film i am looking on the internet how to order this movie since my former father in law eugene logan the co writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so i no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him i would love to have his only grand daughters my daughters see this film as well as to pass this wonderful story on to his great <UNK> my oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was aired on television and i since have been looking forward to seeing it again one of my friends said it was her favorite movie i won't <UNK> this movie for you
<START> this first installment of <UNK> <UNK> personal <UNK> <UNK> asks you to think a little and so can't be recommended for any viewer who doesn't want to sit and puzzle over <UNK> imagery or follow the surprisingly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of his narrative to the more casual viewer yes it's probably going to come off as a confusing <UNK> mash of odd startling and disturbing imagery for <UNK> sake br br you get the sense that glover doesn't mind that this is the case and he'll almost as gladly listen to why someone hated the film as to why they enjoyed it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for and about his work and how audiences interpret it is strongly <UNK> not only through the film itself but also through the unusual question and answer sessions that he frequently <UNK> following <UNK> he clearly hopes that people will continue to think about what he has presented br br the <UNK> way to interpret and dismiss the film is to label it as <UNK> or <UNK> a juvenile attack on the modern movie industry from an actor who's worked both without and within but there's a reason why glover performs his <UNK> before showing his movie and it's not only to sell books his books <UNK> and create a narrative from images and text that glover <UNK> together and what is it does similarly with imagery drawn from western culture br br what is it is an endearing and compelling film in ways one hardly expects while viewing much has already been made about <UNK> use of actors with <UNK> syndrome and indeed that is one of the most initially striking aspects of the film so jarring in fact that many seem to interpret it as some sort of far reaching <UNK> to see a more realistic and or <UNK> portrayal of the disabled in movies and <UNK> on the absolute other end of the spectrum as a kind of direct exploitation of the disabled but it's not either and maybe that's part of what makes this film so uncomfortable for many the underlying agenda is not a political one or one of hatred but one of looking beyond the mainstream culture into a kind of <UNK> <UNK> it's not a film about <UNK> syndrome but it is a film that is owned by the actors with <UNK> syndrome who appear in it br br i'm the sort of person who is entirely <UNK> ho when it comes to <UNK> and <UNK> being portrayed so <UNK> that it is beautiful happily for me this is pretty much exactly how what is it presents itself to viewers glover uses the strange images of <UNK> death and the disabled in part because he wants his audience to feel <UNK> at either the sheer <UNK> of the imagery or the visceral reaction one has to the dying screams of an <UNK> <UNK> in some ways the <UNK> compelling and occasionally downright grotesque elements of what is it remind me of the work of the painter francis <UNK> he of the infamous <UNK> yes and the odd <UNK> of the human figure that inevitably make viewers cringe and want to look away like <UNK> paintings <UNK> film manages to be <UNK> and humble grainy and polished chaotic and well <UNK> and the <UNK> help to make it all the more <UNK> but still this is not an entirely serious film and it largely manages to <UNK> the greatest <UNK> of <UNK> through the use of humor that for the most part <UNK> from the use and <UNK> of familiar items images and names of popular culture and when what is it is funny it is very funny br br overall what is it is an impressive first film from glover as a director and writer and his presence as an actor in the film proves not to be nearly the distraction one might expect it to be watching it is like being an <UNK> in the kind of dream that isn't exactly good or bad but just <UNK> and that leaves you feeling slightly <UNK> when you wake up if that's the kind of art you enjoy what is it is likely to <UNK> your expectations and be well worth the effort of catching it in the theatre along with the big slide show and glover himself all in all it's an experience you're unlikely to forget any time soon
<START> i'm not a fan of the left behind book series the books are written at a <UNK> grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science technology and politics while the books do manage to remain faithful to <UNK> their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous an example is their explanation for the russian arab invasion of israel also the books have an <UNK> preachy tone that will turn off <UNK> rather than bring them to the <UNK> still i found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of revelation for a similar reason i watched this film adaptation i am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film <UNK> on poor the acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over acting the script is rather bad though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis the characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped events feel scattered and <UNK> the dialogue sometimes sounds rushed at least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory here the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book the pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow <UNK> that makes it feel padded the music is <UNK> at times it successfully <UNK> the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture at other moments it reminds me of sitcom and mini series music and still other bits remind me of a <UNK> mtv soundtrack that just doesn't belong in the film i can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane but that's it the other scenes involving the disasters after the rapture are far from compelling the film also suffers from the <UNK> <UNK> although its message isn't quite as in your face in all i found the movie just as disappointing as the series this is not the film to <UNK> christians around it i hope that this film does not get any attention at the theaters next year it would be more unnecessary bad publicity for christianity for an example of a compelling intelligent well <UNK> series based on revelation that presents a realistic and christian world view without <UNK> the <UNK> reader who after all should be whom a christian is trying to reach read the christ clone trilogy by james <UNK> it's a great read and is a much better choice for <UNK> or <UNK> who appreciate quality
<START> i don't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site i'm a big <UNK> fan and am very familiar with the story this showtime original film <UNK> beyond belief but even if i wasn't the poor acting very poor casting sean <UNK> as the brilliant athletic and all around individual harrison the guy's completely generic and sub standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable someone pointed out how cute that <UNK> culkin line was if you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance sadly it probably was the most intentionally funny part of the movie maybe you'll like this movie but if you're a <UNK> fan or not completely insane don't see it please
<START> the thief of bagdad is impressive in the shape of the evil magician <UNK> conrad <UNK> he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its <UNK> <UNK> the young king ahmad and a gorgeous princess from her father br br he falls victim in the end as all <UNK> do in books and legends to love and of the common man whom he ignored here <UNK> by the little thief <UNK> br br the <UNK> of good and evil black and white are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms br br the script is poetic simply and very beautiful the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds attacking suddenly in the night to <UNK> destruction and create terror br br the <UNK> hero wears white <UNK> and <UNK> and his princess is dressed in <UNK> and pale blues br br for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before while through its use of color it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before br br with flying carpet and flying white horse with a giant genie excellently played by rex <UNK> with evil <UNK> and with the good acting of <UNK> and <UNK> the thief of bagdad captures the quality and true atmosphere of the <UNK> nights br br the 1940 version remains the <UNK> finest fairy tale
<START> an <UNK> casper van <UNK> stumbles accidentally upon an ancient 40 foot mummy well <UNK> underground in the <UNK> desert they are determined to keep this a secret and call in a jewish <UNK> to assist in <UNK> out the history of it the mummy as explained at the beginning is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in those days in order to save his son from a devastating <UNK> which was predicted to kill everything he <UNK> his son <UNK> him with several servants for centuries planning to <UNK> him years from then in our present the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is <UNK> and a ritual is expected to take place most of the movie is slow having to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple lousy air <UNK> fights the mummy is decent looking but isn't shown nearly enough it should have had more to do with that but it dragged on a great deal so eh don't bother
<START> star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between <UNK> behind the <UNK> br br mike <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> making his way in the wild west when he spots a group of men <UNK> a lady being a gentleman he naturally steps in and puts a stop to this and in doing so kills the son of a nasty <UNK> this is just the beginning of a all guns blazing battle to the finish from which there will be only one winner br br m <UNK> is an action star who's never truly managed to take off with me maybe i discovered him too late and after the other film i saw with him in it last monday the human shield it was just another dud ha ha added to the list but i have a thing for westerns being films that just sort of transport me to a different time and place and provide real <UNK> entertainment and with this <UNK> has picked one of his better scripts as his films go anyway br br the film hits a few low points in the shape of a <UNK> central villain sounding like a blank marlon brando and some generally <UNK> acting from some of the cast along with the obligatory cheap looking sets but if for some strange reason your life ever <UNK> on watching a <UNK> film this would be one of your best choices
<START> the fact that i did not like the music is a very personal opinion the historical <UNK> are not i do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary but some important aspects are missing <UNK> if other people comment <UNK> because of it br br <UNK> <UNK> was the mastermind of this operation which was staged and <UNK> due to discovery on board the <UNK> in order to free 50 terrorists from israeli <UNK> one of which was <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> terrorist whose story you can find by searching for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was responsible for many other terrorist <UNK> even if he never set foot on the <UNK> <UNK> ben laden never set foot on the planes that hit the <UNK> did he br br possible spoilers br br the movie almost excuses the <UNK> actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived always <UNK> and <UNK> how much the <UNK> have done to hurt them however they never portray the hurt that the <UNK> have ever caused to the <UNK> the movie uses quite horrid images from the <UNK> and <UNK> horror and nothing is said <UNK> the general belief that it was israel who was responsible without ever mentioning that it was a <UNK> les <UNK> army who <UNK> the massacre br br the acting was generally very bad but i guess that's what can be expected from opera singers br br on another note i am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent <UNK> against the armed terrorists and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a <UNK> of <UNK> imagine how unsympathetic his wife was spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea i hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> my girlfriend is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank she has a lovely scene with <UNK> seth in a restaurant there's more information on her website at having stated my personal interest in the film i have to say that i think it is a beautiful movie moving funny and beautifully filmed
<START> why was this film made even keeping in mind the generous tax <UNK> that australian film <UNK> were given there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go ahead for goodness <UNK> the actors cast in this film are aussie b grade <UNK> not actors people like john michael <UNK> <UNK> the original drummer from the band in hey hey its saturday and the voice over guy in <UNK> but in saying that this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves none the script is bad even for a self <UNK> b grade horror and the acting and film quality is worse it often looks as though it is a home movie but even a home movie has <UNK> anyone interested in australian cinema please for the love of god pretend this film was never made
<START> another trashy grade z <UNK> from the prolific albert <UNK> tim <UNK> 13 inch clint eastwood like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head to earth and gets involved in a gang war in south <UNK> mercifully short but <UNK> dull with the <UNK> effects since attack of the <UNK> woman they should have fired the continuity guy too note how <UNK> <UNK> disappears and <UNK> in every second shot laughably bad but <UNK> why we watch these movies <UNK> it sequel <UNK> vs demonic <UNK> is reportedly even worse if <UNK> possible br br 0 of br br
<START> if you are a <UNK> glover fan you must see this if you are a sean penn fan you must see this if you are a movie fan in general you must see this if you have no idea who <UNK> glover is and you have no idea who sean penn is this film will probably still have a lot of value but the more work you've previously seen by <UNK> or sean the better br br this movie is so funny but it is also pure genius there is nothing that i know of that resembles this film it is its own genre i doubt that anything like it will ever be made again i cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that br br in response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review i ask that you view the film again in reality there is no point at which this film could fairly be called boring this is possibly the funniest most entertaining and least boring film ever made and it only gets better with age and repeated viewings a timeless classic that unfortunately very few will be able to claim to have seen br br <UNK> trilogy is the brilliant work of director <UNK> harris also responsible for the amazing <UNK> and ed which <UNK> glover also stars in br br unfortunately copies of this film are rare and hard to find i managed to find a vhs version after some <UNK> searching though and there are a couple of ways to find it that i know of but i really wish someone would put this onto a dvd
<START> what a thrill ride twisted and thought provoking once again sharon stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous <UNK> character of author catherine <UNK> <UNK> the original basic instinct takes place in san francisco the sequel takes place in london where catherine has now <UNK> both <UNK> cities known for excitement <UNK> <UNK> and a perfect place for someone like catherine <UNK> to take <UNK> david <UNK> <UNK> plays the smooth role of psychiatrist dr michael glass the character david <UNK> plays as roy <UNK> with scotland yard is a refreshing departure from his role as <UNK> in the harry potter series flashy cars designer clothes sex drama humor tension all of the basic instincts mind <UNK> throughout great screenplay from the climactic opening scene to the surprise ending this film is anything but boring everyone in the theater was glued to the screen
<START> was the script more fitting for a 30 minute sitcom yes but they still make it work i thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise bland script especially jack black and christopher walken most people on the board seem to really hate this film i personally can't see how that could be but envy is just one of those film that you either love it or hate it much like <UNK> dynamite and every leslie <UNK> movie ever made you either think it's one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest don't avoid this movie because of the reviews watch it and see if you're one of the ones who really like it if you do i guarantee it's worth your money if you don't like it well now you know
<START> oh cgi a <UNK> when used properly a sin with it's used by people who have no idea what their doing sadly that's not the only thing that's used poorly in this <UNK> jaws rip off br br ok anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things 1 i like low budget horror movies and 2 if there is a cute guy in said low budget movie i'll usually point them out so let's just get this out of the way right now this is one low budget horror movie i didn't like the acting for the most part is horrible effects laughable and the script rivals battlefield earth as the worst i've witnessed this year as far as the resident cute boy <UNK> miller <UNK> wins that prize hands down this boy is hot and surprisingly he's not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt he can actually act well as much as he can in this <UNK> film now that we have the <UNK> <UNK> out of the way let's get on with it br br in cliff notes version here's the story don't worry i'll try not to give anything away br br a film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers established cute boy and his buddy who surf with sharks unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island croc shows up mayhem ensues and people are eaten roll end credits br br as i said earlier this film pretty much blows it started pretty well but soon <UNK> into being silly and stupid a main character becomes lunch in a rather humorous way and our remaining <UNK> utter one liners at the victims expense also if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water what's with all the sharks around if this thing can eat a 40 foot boat i don't think a few skimpy sharks would stick around the fx is some of the worst i have ever had the <UNK> to see the cgi is horrendous and they've even managed to screw up the <UNK> <UNK> attention filmmakers national <UNK> discovery store the croc hunter they know what <UNK> look like you obviously didn't reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film and what's with the pirate drug <UNK> gang did you just need another reason to rip off a woman's top br br it's funny how we get little sub genres in the movie world with alligator and it's sequels lake <UNK> crocodile and now blood surf it now looks like over sized crocodile alligator movies should now get their own category at blockbuster alligator was good lake <UNK> was good i even thought tobe <UNK> crocodile was good blood surf sucked br br my grade d
<START> one used to say concerning <UNK> <UNK> that his failures were more interesting than his <UNK> i believe that the same remark could suit to <UNK> <UNK> pictures and especially this one br br it apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie it's <UNK> the script because of censorship sounds <UNK> yet this movie gets also some good points good <UNK> <UNK> music i married an angel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> la good acting with e e <UNK> and <UNK> owen br br anyway if you may dislike it you can't forget it this strange movie actually leaves a very strong <UNK> impression and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days maybe for weeks why in the thirties and the beginning of the forties movies didn't have the same mean than today it aimed like a dream to <UNK> the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality of all the the dream movies that was made in that time this one stands as particularly powerful br br in short let's say that the better way to appreciate this movie is to watch it without wondering whether it's good or bad to watch it like you would watch a dream
<START> when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5 br br the acting is superb <UNK> <UNK> and kate <UNK> are at their best i don't think anyone could have a better job than kate br br if it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much more br br if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now you won't regret it br br
<START> i am a big fan of the original book and this adaption is simply bad first of all it had trouble deciding if it is a kiddie <UNK> or an adult one that caused a strange mix of an adult story and some pretty violent scenes with a silly little duck that keeps giving funny moments in the beginning br br but that's hardly important the film is simply boring <UNK> and not true to the original story it simply fails to transfer to the picture all the points <UNK> tried to make to his book br br spoiler br br second revolution haven't they guys learned anything who be the next <UNK> then benjamin
<START> this film <UNK> the fine line between satire and silliness while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony it certainly can't promote winning bridge so the satire didn't work for me but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and <UNK> <UNK> near the end of the film it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match not only is the <UNK> for the contest <UNK> off in a square area like a boxing ring there is a <UNK> <UNK> between the contestants and radio <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> delivers <UNK> <UNK> on the happenings at one point he even <UNK> one two three four as though a <UNK> of four <UNK> was a <UNK> event and people were glued to their <UNK> for it all a common event for championship boxing matches that spoof worked very well indeed br br unfortunately few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire paul lukas doesn't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank <UNK> weren't given good enough lines glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a <UNK> blonde at the start of the film but she practically disappears thereafter what a waste of talent
<START> it's somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on imdb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire imdb career and yes you've guessed it that film is <UNK> i've often suspected <UNK> good reviews on imdb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as <UNK> marketing but it seems fairly transparent in this case br br that's not to say <UNK> is terrible but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be br br on the plus side it has a great baddie in patrick <UNK> who does a brilliant job <UNK> menacing and evil i could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with <UNK> <UNK> there are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences in fact if the film had decided to explore that <UNK> more it might have been something better the actual concept of <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> is great too br br although i understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for <UNK> in any good story it's the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that if you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly then the story is losing you and that's what kept happening to me with this film other reviewers have mentioned this here and i don't want to get into spoiler territory but i will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life br br all in all there is the <UNK> of a great idea here in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special
<START> i watched <UNK> two nights ago on dvd at a friends house the premise of this film is quite promising jack black and ben stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential but it completely fails to deliver i watched it with about five friends and no one laughed for the entire film the jokes which are few and far between are not funny in any way the story line is crap and they never answer the question where does the sh t go of course the answer to that is no one cares this film lacks any sort of comedy value and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is christopher walken as the j man none of the characters are developed the plots so thin it's nearly transparent and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny
<START> this is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit it's set in the modern day as we see a base in afghanistan get destroyed by a <UNK> right at the start br br and that's exactly where the movie jumps the shark <UNK> aren't armed they could be but i don't think it's ever been tried for real we get to see the computer that has <UNK> this operation called r i p l e y we are introduced to <UNK> will farmer he's good at chemistry <UNK> which doesn't make him a computer <UNK> his love interest annie <UNK> 1st attempt at <UNK> is not only a complete failure his <UNK> address is also <UNK> and annie guessed who it was we also meet <UNK> mom who works for a chemical company br br <UNK> taking money from his <UNK> bank account mr <UNK> isn't a hack he helped him set up the account we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing global <UNK> war they play the dead code the trace the <UNK> office are running is not on will but on <UNK> pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against will br br exactly why <UNK> shut <UNK> machine down isn't explained he's only playing an online game also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a <UNK> target is extremely questionable as for <UNK> <UNK> his mobile phone i think not it wasn't connected to the pc and the message wouldn't play unless he actually answered the phone so there's more bad <UNK> science there too br br <UNK> agents arrive at <UNK> home take him away will is given a <UNK> which turns out to contain a lot of money will searching for the <UNK> plate of the car that took <UNK> isn't a hack as you never see him break into the <UNK> computer the <UNK> agents who grab dennis in the airport as he's looking for will have no authority to arrest or <UNK> him <UNK> mother hadn't been stealing <UNK> bio agents either and even if she did they had no right to arrest or <UNK> dennis <UNK> act or not br br i don't know why will was worried about being arrested for any crime in canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the us br br the computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against will his mother dennis wasn't <UNK> by a government agency the phone <UNK> we see will do is the 1st show of any <UNK> skill in the movie we also get a hack into <UNK> which seemed too easy for such a powerful system br br the guy who ran into annie at the airport was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with <UNK> the laughable notion that <UNK> could track a <UNK> whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips br br another reference to the original movie when they mention stephen <UNK> as the designer of the system <UNK> replaced the joshua project we discover that the guy who ran into annie is <UNK> not played by the original actor sadly who <UNK> his own death br br we also get to see <UNK> as what's going to help them beat <UNK> and they kept the same voice used back then <UNK> <UNK> are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all the same explosion should kill will annie the russian it's also unlikely they'd create a self contained computer system that has the ability to <UNK> or drop chemical weapons on the country it <UNK> out of br br the whole <UNK> plot idea are totally unbelievable those kinds of orders would have to go through the president or joint <UNK> of staff so yet another laughable unbelievable idea br br the <UNK> <UNK> against <UNK> aren't done by will he just contacts one of his friends who suggests <UNK> the idea it's <UNK> laughable that will would get a <UNK> just from increasing <UNK> operating <UNK> having joshua as a <UNK> into <UNK> especially after it had been blown to bits is an incredible cop out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with br br there is an awful good where <UNK> is playing dead code and we see a <UNK> saying 17 minutes then <UNK> says <UNK> in 30 minutes how crap is that when they can't even keep up with their own <UNK> <UNK> attack mission against philadelphia is <UNK> far too easily in my opinion and it decides to attack joshua in its internal <UNK> and <UNK> the missile aimed a <UNK> to washington where <UNK> is <UNK> the idea of the nuclear exchange to make <UNK> realise what she's doing won't work surely she'd already know if she had joshua <UNK> her as he'd already <UNK> this lesson in the original movie is yet another nod back to the original movie br br their cop out at having <UNK> repeat <UNK> exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with br br if you want to point fingers for bad stolen ideas the men to blame are randall <UNK> rob <UNK> this is an awful movie and is best avoided
<START> when i had first heard of <UNK> crisis then got a load of the cast i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before then i saw it br br now i know br br for a movie that <UNK> outer space the sun vast <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> this is an awfully <UNK> and claustrophobic feature it feels like everyone is <UNK> close together so the camera won't have to pull too far back br br and the effects while good are pretty <UNK> we're talking about the <UNK> destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot <UNK> a deadly <UNK> <UNK> but other than shouting <UNK> and a red glow about everything there's no real feel of <UNK> br br don't get me started about the cast what heston palance <UNK> boyle et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone's guess makes you wonder who else's <UNK> aren't paid for in hollywood br br and as far as the end goes well let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too little too late in an effort like this if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film maybe i would have heard of <UNK> crisis sooner br br two stars mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves br br i wonder how alan <UNK> keeps his job doing junk like this
<START> rock <UNK> roll high school will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party flick portraying a bunch of high school students using the <UNK> music as inspiration to rise up against their <UNK> principal mary <UNK> of eating <UNK> fame the whole movie is a mile a minute it's basically a big excuse to have fun and i'm sure that you will <UNK> <UNK> check a <UNK> music teacher paul <UNK> also from eating <UNK> check exploding mice <UNK> br br anyway this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living even for someone like me who doesn't know the <UNK> music it's pure pleasure with roger corman executive producing and joe <UNK> co directing how could we expect anything less too bad that director allan <UNK> later <UNK> into fare such as <UNK> ii br br also starring p j soles vincent van <UNK> clint howard <UNK> young dick miller who has appeared in every one of joe <UNK> movies and many of roger <UNK> don steele and of course the ramones a real treat br br it seems like <UNK> and <UNK> always co starred they also co starred in joe <UNK> hollywood <UNK> and the slasher flick <UNK> mall also starring dick miller in which they <UNK> their roles from eating <UNK>
<START> more than just a kids' movie holes looks at how past incidents still affect us today whether we know about them or not when teenager stanley <UNK> iii <UNK> <UNK> gets sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day long he discovers a number of things about the camp and his personal connection to it through flashbacks we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize you'll understand this better when you see the movie <UNK> does a pretty good job as do the other cast members <UNK> weaver jon voight tim blake nelson henry <UNK> patricia arquette and <UNK> <UNK> a very interesting movie
<START> to all the <UNK> out there <UNK> a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages that being said i was a huge fan of bsg thought it was some of the best tv drama not just sci fi on the air but it was time for it to end and the story to move on i liked the bsg <UNK> the plan but it raised as many new questions as it answered so i eagerly anticipated caprica and i was not disappointed br br i was hoping it would not try to be another bsg and i was pleased that caprica is something different and i personally found the story exciting in a different way than blazing space battles explosions and sci fi special effects don't get me wrong i like that stuff too eric <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> give solid performances and <UNK> was just wonderful i can't wait until next week
<START> how is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better <UNK> movie <UNK> express 1986 there are also some characters in <UNK> express put together without having really a relation to each other jean de <UNK> the <UNK> the two taxi drivers the street singer roger guy <UNK> and gilbert of course tom <UNK> is a star and luc <UNK> wasn't that should not be a reason to <UNK> the flaws in the script if there is a script of anyway the wind blows the joke the only one at the party about the ice in the <UNK> is taken from that great <UNK> movie de <UNK> 1934 where de <UNK> is putting too much salt on the <UNK> some <UNK> happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after tom <UNK> delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres another missed chance for <UNK> cinema
<START> i was very interested to see this movie when it first came out in the theaters however i wasn't able to get around to it so finally it hit the shelves and i picked it up not knowing exactly what to expect i <UNK> the dvd in the player settled in the for an evening of murder and pressed play what followed was one of the more engaging flicks i've seen in the last couple years br br some spoilers br br this is the story of the wonderland murders which led to the <UNK> parts of la and straight to the biggest porn start of the 70's john holmes val kilmer br br i was hooked from the beginning and the feel of the movie held me all the way until the very bloody end i was surprised to find that the movie focused less on the actual murders and more on the events before and the investigation after aside from a few blood <UNK> walls in the beginning and the actual showing of the murders towards the end the movie was more or less an engaging show of great <UNK> and great acting val kilmer all but sells me as a <UNK> porn star and even the beautiful but that's it <UNK> was a joy to watch and just for her looks mind you br br i personally felt the best aspect of the movie was as i mentioned its lack of outright showing the murders it was shown in a very dark atmosphere so you couldn't completely see the brutal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the sleeping <UNK> furthermore the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to <UNK> my <UNK> they were being beating with lead <UNK> there's not much more that needs to be said br br my only real problem was carrie <UNK> brief <UNK> her portrayal of the overly religious figure was i think a bit too cliche of her <UNK> maybe that person was actually part of the story maybe not but i wasn't sold and for some reason fisher seemed a bit too <UNK> in her portrayal br br overall an excellent movie worth the watch even if once br br 8 10
<START> what a <UNK> fest br br of all the bits of nostalgia that hollywood has decided to remake and update this is by far one of the most pointless this was a totally pointless show in the first place and we really don't need a <UNK> update br br never mind the <UNK> and <UNK> inherent in the system from the beginning so many advances have been made socially since the show ran that the entire point of the show if it ever had one has been lost br br also what is the point of having a character named boss <UNK> if he's not overweight
<START> un <UNK> believable meg ryan doesn't even look her usual <UNK> lovable self in this which normally makes me forgive her shallow <UNK> acting <UNK> hard to believe she was the producer on this dog plus kevin kline what kind of suicide trip has his career been on <UNK> <UNK> finally this was directed by the guy who did big chill must be a replay of <UNK> hollywood style <UNK>
<START> this shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the <UNK> runs the asylum it is sad how the <UNK> of these young people were rolled down a <UNK> table when neither <UNK> <UNK> nor the people of iraq god rest the souls of the <UNK> 000 plus that have been killed had anything to do with terrorism nor al <UNK> br br following this movie the <UNK> viewer will need to pick up or <UNK> a copy of loose change this movie is available free on the internet until the bush <UNK> locks it down by <UNK> up the very title as <UNK> in <UNK> br br god save our country this will not be done by following the <UNK> <UNK> that controlled the <UNK> of <UNK> for over 10 years prior to november 2006
<START> <UNK> <UNK> anne of green <UNK> brings <UNK> for happiness into the lives of a lonely old sister brother on prince edward island br br lucy <UNK> <UNK> well loved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie excellent production values a <UNK> script and first class performances gives the story exactly the touch of quality it deserves br br taking her professional name from the character she portrayed actress anne shirley is a joy as the red headed <UNK> year old orphan who completely <UNK> the lives of her new <UNK> completely assured in her starring role miss shirley is a delight entertaining the viewer with <UNK> <UNK> imagination quick temper and not so secret <UNK> br br playing the stern <UNK> who gives the girl a home helen <UNK> also completely <UNK> her role the viewer will enjoy seeing this sharp <UNK> woman slowly <UNK> to <UNK> affection and child like innocence australian character actor o p <UNK> gives one of his finest performances as <UNK> shy gentle brother who <UNK> anne into his heart from the moment he arrives to <UNK> her from the <UNK> station br br tom brown most <UNK> plays the <UNK> who quickly grabs <UNK> attention sara <UNK> is appropriately <UNK> as a <UNK> neighbor <UNK> <UNK> makes the most of his few moments as <UNK> doctor
<START> it's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself the paragraph long plot summary written on the movie page has details i could not <UNK> from watching the actual movie i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the <UNK> was going on alas to no <UNK> this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story if you could call it a story it's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our <UNK> <UNK> to the the creators i paid to watch you make a movie i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free and rosario dawson this is somebody i've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face and i can see why she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie a or b i figured okay maybe she didn't really want the role just got a <UNK> offer for a movie she wasn't into wrong she was listed as one of the producers next time you produce something don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act if you really can then create a decent character for you to become also somebody here mentioned the white latino issue yes i hate to say it but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college age males who wear baseball hats that's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to <UNK> the watcher to latino characters the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist as for the <UNK> character she didn't seem like a real person anyway i'm ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made
<START> excellent view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything even the <UNK> has a <UNK> the way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a little town it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh light and funny comedy i couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a <UNK> br br i love european films and with movies like this one my opinion grows stronger a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is waking ned <UNK> br br saving grace a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself you will love it
<START> i hate how this movie has absolutely no creative <UNK> i know they're going for realism but to be frank i just don't want realism realism is boring if i want to see daily life i'll <UNK> live tell me an interesting story and we'll talk i can deal with the low production values hell i'm a sucker for low production values but at least work in some good ideas the direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit but obviously i'm supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out i can only conclude this is not drama not by a long shot we get to see <UNK> walking to <UNK> <UNK> working in a <UNK> <UNK> eating a <UNK> <UNK> carrying around <UNK> of far <UNK> walking back home <UNK> walking <UNK> it's just not that entertaining there isn't really a deeper meaning either i got so bored i started looking for some <UNK> on life in this movie but it's just plain realism the most overrated quality in the business i guess i'm supposed to love this but come on there's nothing in there
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> et le <UNK> makes a perfect companion piece to peter <UNK> la <UNK> paris <UNK> both films screened at this year's toronto international film festival ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the <UNK> of the tale ironic given the tragic events that were taking place in the u s during the festival br br set in paris during the french revolution the movie based on grace <UNK> lucy russell <UNK> is a first hand account of how she survived those <UNK> but dangerous days she also details her relationship with the duke of orleans played by jean claude <UNK> who in contrast to herself is a <UNK> of the revolution br br true to form you don't know whose side of history rohmer is going to come down on one of the earliest of the french new wave filmmakers rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative after all in the midst of the <UNK> youth <UNK> <UNK> days of the late 60s and 70s he was filming romantic little <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> but don't sell the old boy short folks he's always been a student of human nature not an <UNK> and <UNK> et le <UNK> continues to bear this out br br <UNK> characters are never the bad guys nor the good <UNK> they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of <UNK> a full range of human <UNK> and limitations that's why his movies are always provocative and this film is no exception br br now for the technological nuts and <UNK> br br rohmer though making his way into his 80s is still on the cutting edge of cinematic <UNK> the look of <UNK> is like something you've never seen before you guessed it the old guy like several of the <UNK> directors this year has gone digital br br all of the movie's exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original <UNK> <UNK> settings as a matter of fact you may get so distracted from <UNK> at the authenticity of the film's look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film's psychological and yes i'll say it political insights br br toronto features some of the world's <UNK> young filmmakers this year as well as some of the world's oldest and the old masters are standing there on <UNK> cutting edges right alongside the young ones br br long live youth long live old age and long live <UNK> rohmer br br
<START> i'd give it a 2 10 br br i was really really disappointed br br the storyline was poorly developed for instance the incidents were too short and brief hence the moral was not clearly brought out i thought brenda song did a fine job but shin <UNK> seemed to have a difficult time handling his role i could see the need to put in western elements in the show however there are certain parts where chinese elements were needed too the villain for example his physical appearance <UNK> a robot instead of something out of the chinese culture the final and the worst flaw were the incorrect and distorted facts placed in the show br br others may point out that this is a <UNK> <UNK> and hence there is no need for the such high standards however there are other disney shows such as <UNK> <UNK> which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation br br in conclusion i feel that disney movies should be better <UNK> and better planned a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on
<START> this is my favorite jackie chan movie and in an interview jackie said it was his favorite as well it contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well this movie was a favorite of brandon lee who used parts in rapid fire and was also lifted in tango and cash which used some of the opening scenes br br jackie plays a policeman in hong kong the story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a <UNK> town and continues as jackie <UNK> down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil <UNK> who is one of the greatest villains in any jackie chan movie you can expect some very funny scenes as jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend played by maggie <UNK> his job is to protect <UNK> secretary who has enough information to take him down but even that poses many problems jackie is at his absolute best here the last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone period it was the most intense fight i have ever seen jackie do and <UNK> in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights all in all one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin <UNK> off his hands he was fortunate he was not <UNK> as the person in charge of the stunt used high <UNK> instead of a lower <UNK> br br all in all another chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies by the end of this movie you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his <UNK> so many of his <UNK> were injured during this movie that nobody would <UNK> them anymore jackie had to take responsibility himself there are no gimmicks <UNK> or stand ins it is all true life action that is a treat to watch it is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will <UNK> people 100 years from now if you have not seen this movie and are a fan of jackie chan or action in general give yourself a treat and watch this movie it is truly sensational
<START> this film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the vietnam war as if upon hearing some kids were doing without <UNK> in cow dung <UNK> the president was going to immediately change all us foreign policy br br the worst thing is that while dangerous the concept of a policy based on if the <UNK> and us went to war it could mean the end of the world worked the us and <UNK> never went to war br br had we only conventional weapons the notion of yet another war a win able war in europe and asia was not <UNK> br br not that i think they should get rid of this movie it should be seen by film students as a splendid example of how not to make a film br br it should be 0 stars or maybe black holes
<START> i didn't even know this was originally a made for tv movie when i saw it but i guessed it through the running time it has the same washed out colors bland characters and horrible <UNK> music that i remember from the 80's plus a <UNK> <UNK> that practically screams <UNK> special <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> thank you <UNK> and monsters was made in the <UNK> of <UNK> dragons a pen and paper <UNK> that took the hearts of millions of <UNK> around america i count myself one of said <UNK> tho i have never played d d specifically i have <UNK> in one of its <UNK> m m was also made in the <UNK> of d <UNK> major controversy that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality be <UNK> satan without knowing blah blah i suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point if extremely rare but it dates this movie <UNK> br br we meet 4 young college students who play the <UNK> named <UNK> and monsters to <UNK> and have a little time away from mundane life except that m m as presented is more boring than their mundane lives none of the <UNK> of <UNK> is presented here and jay <UNK> request to take m m into 'the real <UNK> comes out of nowhere it's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also though at that point we don't really care jay jay <UNK> kate and daniel are supposed to be different but they're all rich <UNK> <UNK> who have problems no one really has br br but things just continue getting worse in more ways than one the low budget comes dreadfully clear i love the <UNK> sign and cardboard <UNK> to the forbidden <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shows why he's not a warrior in the <UNK> stabbing scene ever and the payoff <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is unintentionally hilarious tom <UNK> <UNK> jay jay what am i doing here made me laugh for minutes on end definitely the low point in his career br br don't look at it as a <UNK> satire just a laughable piece of 80's tv trash and you'll still have a good time that is if you can stay awake the majority is mostly boring but it's all worthwhile for <UNK> breakdown at the end at least tom hanks has gotten better not that he could go much worse from here
<START> never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely dick powell scott blair who had a great <UNK> voice and ruby keeler <UNK> thorn james cagney plays the role as <UNK> kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing <UNK> which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie <UNK> during the 1930's <UNK> has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs joan blondell <UNK> <UNK> gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career enjoy
<START> this is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave <UNK> kind of like billy jack i guess however whereas billy jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> as such we are introduced to the star who is described as having learned <UNK> in the marines i was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing i really don't remember any emphasis on <UNK> as a result the antagonist james macarthur makes reference to the <UNK> when he offers an excuse for why he a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated lame
<START> the film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are <UNK> the idea behind his art project is to <UNK> the ridiculous culture that we are <UNK> in naturally the film takes place in los angeles orange county he attacks stand up comics <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rock bands models blockbuster hollywood films and touches on many other <UNK> eventually he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion the film is five years old and rings more true every day it's the best description of post punk anger i've ever seen it's also one of my top 10 favorite films
<START> this reminded me <UNK> much of michael <UNK> crappy <UNK> <UNK> with it's awful english low budget feel br br firstly i must say i am a fan of both exploitation and serious film i appreciate say <UNK> for it's <UNK> and <UNK> house on the <UNK> for it's sheer <UNK> brutality and any number of inventive and increasingly brutal italian spin offs br br this was just pointless though kind of like a british budget director thought <UNK> remake i spit on your grave without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with hostel br br the whole thing just doesn't hang together or have a point what's with the <UNK> daughter why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras crappy
<START> after just 15 minutes into this film i began to miss zhang <UNK> earlier more <UNK> films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious <UNK> in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation <UNK> with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john <UNK> film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some <UNK> i'm sure my opinion is different from many others as i'm coming from a different background <UNK> like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and it's certainly not a <UNK> <UNK> film there are no sword <UNK> or <UNK> elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story all 3 the <UNK> murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do <UNK> features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang <UNK> plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck there's an air of <UNK> with this film that's really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete <UNK> of it really makes you wonder if zhang <UNK> was making a film per se or simply a showcase i e an ego <UNK> for zhang <UNK> the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually <UNK> not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasn't extended past her ability to play a naive w <UNK> she's so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though she's reading her lines from a <UNK> it's so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a <UNK> forest they're tricked into thinking it's brilliant film making <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> choreography while still <UNK> his trademark style editing and <UNK> lacks the <UNK> and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon <UNK> and duel to the death sadly to say the <UNK> in this film is really <UNK> and if there's <UNK> obvious <UNK> then you probably shouldn't have filmed it at high speed the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct b movie feel to them <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and <UNK> as though there's a little pilot inside i know that logic doesn't really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you don't want to <UNK> a mass amount of <UNK> from your audience then you should probably work on your <UNK> a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what <UNK> you with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fu it's obvious that zhang <UNK> is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market just as <UNK> did after watching hero and <UNK> i've come to the conclusion that if zhang <UNK> wants to make hollywood films he's definitely off to the right start <UNK> is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero was bad
<START> stupid stupid stupid i think that angelina jolie is probably one of the most talented <UNK> today but a movie like this isn't just worth her time she deserves better and so does everyone else in this movie talent is just wasted sorry but i don't feel like writing a review for this br br i give it no stars out of
<START> it was difficult to sit through this horrible <UNK> adaptation of sherlock holmes apparently matt <UNK> was cast because he is tall and skinny his skull like face made for a good zombie in the dawn of the dead remake but as sherlock holmes he looks like a scarecrow not only does <UNK> have a <UNK> <UNK> walk that is hard to watch but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical holmes <UNK> that he is wearing not only that but while the coat is gray <UNK> they apparently could not find a matching cap so his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of <UNK> whatever the cap was made of it looked very new and artificial jeremy brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits but brett did not have to dress up like sherlock holmes in order to look the part <UNK> on the other hand is painful to watch even in the full holmes outfit he does not carry himself like sherlock holmes br br <UNK> <UNK> face <UNK> all the time as he <UNK> on and on in a very bad upper <UNK> british accent is painful to see and listen to to say that <UNK> is overacting is an understatement after he finishes each sentence with some kind of <UNK> hum he then <UNK> as if that were some kind of british <UNK> when i started watching this i thought it might be a comedy featuring <UNK> the jack russell <UNK> i thought <UNK> had been cast as some kind of foil for <UNK> but sadly there is no dog in this movie except for <UNK> <UNK> would have made this movie a lot better br br not only does <UNK> version of sherlock holmes never stop talking in that awfully artificial british <UNK> accent but he is much to friendly and kind <UNK> is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to and he is so polite and <UNK> that he could be teaching at a charm school instead of being a sleuth perhaps since this is a hallmark channel production they are trying to make a children's version of sherlock holmes <UNK> was better at that too that was <UNK> and <UNK> whatever the point of <UNK> interpretation of sherlock holmes it is <UNK> than a <UNK> and easily the worst version of sherlock holmes that i have ever seen including the previous worst by charlton heston br br overall the tone of this film is awful it reminded me of a typical episode of <UNK> jones or murder she wrote or <UNK> murder all the suspects over acted <UNK> and <UNK> at the victims before they were killed holmes and watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie even on murder she wrote there is less exposition br br this sherlock holmes does not even compare very well to jim <UNK> of the <UNK> files and it is miles below columbo the awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer it is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little <UNK> with sherlock holmes especially the bbc version with jeremy brett this movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of little house on the <UNK> the fact that the actors seem to be <UNK> when they <UNK> their lines in their fake accents does not help br br the only minor bright spot is ken walsh who plays doctor watson with some dignity walsh does not ham it up compared to <UNK> and when he is often <UNK> witnesses his demeanor and <UNK> style are much more natural and credible unfortunately the rest of the cast is amateurish and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other to show they are suspicious is something that i had not seen in any modern movie
<START> being a slasher film <UNK> i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my <UNK> which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain i will say while channel surfing the other night <UNK> camp ii happened to cross paths with me of course i wanted to check it out as i had heard of the <UNK> camp franchise but have never actually seen any of them for shame i know i will note that since i have not seen the original my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the <UNK> own design br br now i'm assuming that the franchise of <UNK> camp is in itself a joke on itself hell even the name comes off as an intentional joke sleep away camp it's good fun i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value but that's about as far as i can go the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the 13th look like <UNK> doing a rendition of <UNK> campy requires bad acting but come on pamela <UNK> as the evil out of touch with reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast as far as comedy goes there were a few times where i <UNK> but it was few and far between br br ultimately <UNK> ii is pretty boring and i really did want to sleep away the camp the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them if you're looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp i recommend club dread if your channel surfing takes you across this one check and see what else is on
<START> first of all really kim basinger your rich <UNK> husband leaves you alone in your beautiful most likely paid in cash for home and you can't even put on a decent shirt i'm a woman and yes i'm going to come right out say it clean something starting with your hair and while you're at it it's christmas eve buy your kids some presents or at least a christmas tree don't drive 40 minutes to the crowded mall park your car 3 miles away and cry about it the whole walk in and simply buy <UNK> paper also the next time you decide to leave someone a nasty note don't sign your name i refuse to feel sorry for della obviously due to the fact that kim basinger is this <UNK> executive producer she wants you to feel bad for the poor white blond woman we get it alec baldwin is a jerk but seriously don't model horrible films after your own life also you're in you 50s you definitely wouldn't have 8 year old twins and those names terry and <UNK> way to let your kids grow up with any decent chance of ever <UNK> themselves it's also pretty fantastic to hear the characters in the film constantly call her beautiful or refer to her as a girl obviously ms basinger had some say about what goes in the script it's also pretty awesome how none of the criminals can fight back apparently <UNK> magical ninja skills are impossible to beat her driving skills are pretty nifty too this film is so cliché it hurts <UNK> they spelled your name wrong on the tea cup or your husband put a hole in the wall but all you can think about is buying nail polish when you're at the mall instead of maybe some <UNK> and paint or the woman you went to high school with bought the teddy you were looking at <UNK> the fact that she refuses to take off that bright <UNK> coat while running through the woods screaming and breaking everything in her path proves my point this woman is a moron who thinks to grab the <UNK> out of the car but not their purse full of <UNK> <UNK> such as your address i have never wanted the bad guys to succeed as much as when i watched this film and did anyone else happen to catch the african american shirt the black guy was sporting oh yes <UNK> and feast your eyes on perhaps the most <UNK> stereotypical prop in a film yet don't waste and hour and twenty minutes of your life instead go do what della couldn't figure out how to do take care of your kids and maybe brush your hair that powerful <UNK> at the end though was pretty impressive singing i'll be home for christmas in the rain while your bloody arm <UNK> oh so tightly to your <UNK> paper is about as emotional as it gets thanks della
<START> although this seems to be quite an old show 2002 i watched my first ever episode last night and i have to say it has to be the worst show ever br br i am not one for placing comments but i was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to <UNK> to and i am only assuming that this was their target audience children under 12 years old or people with a less than average iq br br the episode i was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines tried to include every possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to <UNK> about friendship family religion and politics br br basic story that they covered in the episode frat house <UNK> gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol death turns out to be <UNK> son who wants fbi to investigate death is actually murder by <UNK> <UNK> senator thinks it could be his <UNK> enemy and childhood best friend who did this because senator was taking money for his votes for <UNK> but eventually got a conscience and said <UNK> to mean <UNK> millionaire everybody a suspect but all have the usual <UNK> ex girlfriend student <UNK> a married teacher so had to lie disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience <UNK> enemy did not pay desperate student to kill <UNK> enemies son he gives money <UNK> to lots of broke students all the while the heroine of this <UNK> has her niece staying who is <UNK> that <UNK> and has a crush on a boy who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her <UNK> but only to dump him because the <UNK> girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she <UNK> him don't worry she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the <UNK> girls drop her <UNK> also explains that god is the only one who truly she can rely on i was almost sick at this point br br this <UNK> gets even better when sue and her fbi team find out who the killer is your gonna laugh at this i sure did br br it is one of the frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an international terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and <UNK> bomb at funeral br br the characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain br br why the writers of this show have tried to pack in every <UNK> into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors <UNK> to carry off a simple plot line watching this show is like watching <UNK> action <UNK> with arnie killing <UNK> people with a tooth pick except arnie is a better actor wow never thought there would be a day that i would say that br br in the words of the simpsons beloved character <UNK> book <UNK> br br worst tv show ever
<START> lars von trier is never <UNK> in trying out new techniques some of them are very original while others are best forgotten br br he depicts <UNK> germany as a nightmarish train journey with so many cities lying in ruins leo <UNK> a young american of german descent feels <UNK> to help in their <UNK> it is not a simple task as he quickly finds out br br his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the <UNK> <UNK> line his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers when the shoes are polished a <UNK> mark is made on the soles a terrible argument ensues when a <UNK> shoes are not <UNK> despite the fact they have been polished there are many <UNK> to the german <UNK> of <UNK> to such stupid details br br the <UNK> journey is like an allegory representing man's <UNK> through life with all its trials and <UNK> in one sequence leo <UNK> through the back <UNK> to discover them filled with half <UNK> bodies appearing to have just escaped from <UNK> these images horrible as they are are fleeting as in a dream each with its own terrible impact yet <UNK> br br at a station called <UNK> leo jumps from the train with a <UNK> bomb in view of many by <UNK> he <UNK> the bomb to the <UNK> of a <UNK> he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock later he jumps from the train at high speed and lies in the cool grass on a river bank looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at <UNK> speed to board the train and stop the clock if you care to <UNK> the situation it is a completely impossible task quite ridiculous in fact it could only happen in a dream br br it's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of <UNK> hanging on <UNK> and <UNK> away with the <UNK> of the train br br despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed i prefer lars von <UNK> later films breaking the waves and the idiots the bomb scene described above really put me off perhaps i'm a <UNK>
<START> this is one of the best movies i've ever seen it has very good acting by hanks newman and everyone else definitely jude <UNK> best performance the cinematography is excellent the editing is about as good and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie the production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special to me it takes a lot to beat godfather but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest definitely a best picture <UNK> in my book
<START> <UNK> is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects jason scott lee is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself if you remember him he was from the movie dragon the bruce lee story ' jason london is funny as luke the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal <UNK> body from the <UNK> diane <UNK> is good as the woman who steals <UNK> body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend and stephen <UNK> is great as dracula himself giving a better performance than gerard butler did the count in the original film roy <UNK> rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie and he does a decent job as the mentor of jason scott lee's character this is the second sequel in the trilogy and they are off to a good start it's up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note
<START> hello again i have to comment on this wonderful exciting and believable tale of romance and intrigue the music in wonderful and memorable very good colorful movie another movie i liked as well later on was high society with bing crosby wonderful music thanks for listening <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reno <UNK>
<START> this movie is one of the worst ones of the year the main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible paul rudd is the only one that has any talent and the only one that is not annoying i have never watched <UNK> <UNK> so i don't know how eva longoria is on that show but in this movie she was horrible it's like she knows nothing about acting all her character does is <UNK> throughout the film and she can't pull off being a b and still be entertaining and the other girl lake bell displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them br br as for the story it is so cookie cutter it goes from point a to b with little surprise so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost the plot should have <UNK> more around her and the things she does as a spirit br br final verdict it's not worth watching
<START> ok let me again admit that i haven't seen any other <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> films nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director so my capacity to discuss before the <UNK> outside of analysis of the film itself is <UNK> with that <UNK> let me begin br br before the <UNK> is a different kind of movie that doesn't know which genre it wants to be at first it pretends to be a romance in most romances the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character is separated from the supporting character and is sometimes united with his or her partner this movie's hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her his name is henry <UNK> and her name is <UNK> and they <UNK> in southern india during the <UNK> days of the raj british <UNK> rule henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid despite his legal marriage and child overseas what could be better than that they often sneak away for intimate <UNK> until some children notice them word <UNK> to <UNK> husband who questions her involvement with <UNK> she <UNK> any contact with him but <UNK> asks her to leave the area <UNK> refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film the film changes tone and becomes a crime drama in its final portions br br <UNK> body is discovered right as <UNK> family comes to visit the alleged <UNK> is <UNK> english educated assistant t k t k knows of his <UNK> affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened once he is <UNK> innocent he attempts to regain his honor by killing <UNK> t k is too <UNK> and leaves him in a dirt path as the <UNK> fall br br i want to warn you this isn't a romance film the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and <UNK> man <UNK> in an <UNK> <UNK> setting this image is captured directly from the film's opening but quickly disappears then it's over it seems like an effort to capitalize on western <UNK> on forbidden love it isn't effective at all not only is the movie not a romance but its characters lack any personality they are <UNK> of walking clichés <UNK> is an arrogant white man who doesn't recognize his indian friend t k 's intelligence t k is torn between his own <UNK> and his <UNK> background <UNK> is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life oh and of course <UNK> family is <UNK> into <UNK> death but still slightly racist to indians if the tone wasn't so serious i would be willing to overlook these problems but it isn't the film is presented with a <UNK> <UNK> which highlights its poor character development br br no this film isn't terrible other than the laughable screenplay it isn't poor the actors are all experienced and perform well here <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> was part of wonderful indian drama water even director <UNK> has an impressive resume he recently <UNK> the terrorist which is part of roger <UNK> great movies collection what happened here why is this movie so bad well <UNK> mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red <UNK> apparently the story was timeless and <UNK> sought to create a similar experience set in 1930's india i don't have any problem with that approach but i think <UNK> may have been too motivated this time the actors cinematography and set design are acceptable but unless you share <UNK> aura you'll probably not enjoy it my recommendation is that you presume you aren't in <UNK> with him and watch something else final <UNK> and <UNK> out of
<START> man this was hilarious it should be under comedy or stupid it would have made realizing what a pile of <UNK> this was much easier seriously i want anyone associated with this movie <UNK> effective immediately for everyone who is thinking of watching this movie <UNK> go over a few plot points oh wait there aren't any there is literally no plot i think casper van <UNK> was bored and he decided to film something with some random <UNK> and miraculously it somehow got on <UNK> this movie is literally the worst movie of all time don't believe me go watch it do it man i dare you but be prepared to <UNK> your eyes out if you can sit through this without blowing a cow you are very strong and courageous
<START> i've been disappointed if not surprised at the lack of appreciation this film has received once again billy zane proves he's more than just a hollywood pretty boy in a silent performance that combines <UNK> slapstick with understated pathos calling this a silent film is inaccurate as there's a lot of music and sound it has a manic pace and is full of the goofy <UNK> that ed wood is finally beginning to be appreciated for look at the cast listing and realize that everyone shines no one is there just to show their face i believe they're all in the movie to show their appreciation of wood and to do a broad physical kind of acting not seen much these days br br but today reviewers try to guess what's going to become a hit much more than they show any kind of <UNK> appreciation for a movie and <UNK> has no <UNK> target audience it was made mostly out of love for <UNK> script even after his death the trendy social <UNK> have dealt him another serious blow and <UNK> the world of a minor classic this is a highly entertaining and a genuinely experimental film that really deserves to live at least on dvd
<START> <UNK> <UNK> semi <UNK> film 2002 is a gentle poignant comedy set in the <UNK> diverse community near <UNK> airport in west london br br like the <UNK> which constantly arrive and <UNK> from <UNK> we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters jess <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jules paxton <UNK> knightley as they strike up an unlikely friendship which <UNK> around their mutual passion for soccer and their technical <UNK> with david beckham br br much of the comedy grows out of the <UNK> of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds br br somewhere in the middle as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> joe jonathan <UNK> myers team coach for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in times of crisis while at the same time remaining the main object of affection of both the main characters br br eventually and not without many obstacles and <UNK> on the way we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer <UNK> <UNK> away to realise their dreams br br with great performances from bollywood veteran <UNK> <UNK> mr <UNK> <UNK> khan mrs <UNK> juliet stevenson mrs paxton and frank <UNK> mr paxton this really is a film that captures the <UNK> passion of <UNK> and crosses all ethnic <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are struggling their own struggles but nevertheless contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film br br in it's own special way this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football it <UNK> the evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the <UNK> ability of the young to teach the old
<START> this is a very bland and <UNK> production of one of shakespeare's most vibrant plays i can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to shakespeare before by doing this though by making every line clear and every intent obvious they have <UNK> the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature somehow it is actually boring a very hard feat given such wonderful material br br the acting is forgettable at best sam <UNK> as <UNK> and douglas watson as don <UNK> others however do not fare so well april <UNK> hero is a <UNK> breathless <UNK> that frequently <UNK> <UNK> jerry <UNK> don john is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of <UNK> <UNK> though <UNK> was much more enjoyable br br f murray abraham you know the guy who killed <UNK> is not in this version unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits br br given that the producer joseph <UNK> is basically a theater god this production is not only disappointing but head scratching as well br br don't bother with this watch branagh's much <UNK> instead his version is <UNK> with <UNK> and humor to say nothing of wonderful performances
<START> this is a good movie a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book you will be very very disappointed i was somewhat disappointed because i read the book a few times when i was in <UNK> school br br this is about a new kid in town named billy he makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most <UNK> billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins br br the acting is ok probably the worst part of the movie the kid actors over <UNK> on many things they think it's apocalypse if billy does not eat the worms <UNK> <UNK> did a magnificent job though br br the plot line is good as a movie but it sucks as a book adaptation i was able to watch this movie without looking at the time sometimes br br overall this was a good family movie with some weak points i rate this movie 7 10
<START> although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic <UNK> of <UNK> it is in fact nothing of the sort it is a political and cultural allegory of <UNK> post <UNK> odyssey as even a passing glance at <UNK> history will <UNK> br br in contrast to like water for chocolate <UNK> expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work a good starting point is to see the grandmother character as spain proud <UNK> <UNK> and above all else <UNK> down with history br br the ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the outcome of history i e the present is always obscure since we are too close to it for honest <UNK> <UNK> to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director given the ambitions of the film br br <UNK> is gorgeous a big screen experience would be ideal if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening but if not vhs is better than never seeing it at all
<START> the world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war 2 br br the 24 episodes cover the war and what it was like in the countries involved in it the first episode tells us how the hitler came to power and how he was able to build up one of the strongest <UNK> in the world they also <UNK> on the military actions taken during the war and the holocaust one of the strongest and best documentaries ever made all of you must watch this perfection 10 10 br br
<START> i see that someone already thought of a similar <UNK> which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after i watched this movie they said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot besides the sexual scenes which <UNK> on child porn which i feel could have been edited out or been presented more <UNK> in nature rather than <UNK> i would <UNK> this movie to a recipe that's been torn in half it's kind of like being handed a list of ingredients with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product from the start character development and story development are lacking unfortunately many times in this monotonous drivel we are <UNK> with bits of plot and we think <UNK> ok finally we are going to find out something more about why this scene is going on or who this character is or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more or understand and get involved more with this inter character relationship etc but no such luck on the contrary many times i was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the <UNK> was <UNK> only to find that whatever mini plot within whatever mini plot and that poorly presented was just a <UNK> why i stayed with it till the end is a mystery other than usually <UNK> has better <UNK> and they gave it 2 1 2 stars another mystery it's not that the characters aren't likable to some degree or that you can't identify with them or their <UNK> at all it's just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort i notice this was shot around santa <UNK> and find myself wondering if it was someone's film school project i wish i could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half
<START> i liked batman dead end a dark edgy film noir setting for batman was perfect batman dead end is good this is not br br first of all let me start off with the acting none of it is really that good the best would probably be clark <UNK> as batman but that isn't saying much he is good at first glance and then you realize he is what he is a body <UNK> who happens to be a tolerable actor but mainly the problem is that batman doesn't belong in the daylight he looks like a freak running around in a bat suit instead of a horribly <UNK> man trying to make up for past mistakes the daylight also reveals an irritating <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> face which never leaves and <UNK> in batman dead end probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer <UNK> seems to think that <UNK> and <UNK> shaking his head is acting it's not it's quite the opposite it's called posing something real actors avoid like the plague br br something i never understood why <UNK> casted body <UNK> as the leads it makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it instead of a <UNK> who can kinda manage it but hey he looks so much like the comic of course they might have done better if <UNK> <UNK> didn't leave much to be desired br br the entire trailer yes trailer there will not be a full length film is more centered around superman then batman but everything on the superman side is corny <UNK> and amateur michael <UNK> superman is one of the worst actors i've ever seen he stands around smiles says his lines that's about it although i'm not surprised since he is just a <UNK> they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons once again i say to <UNK> cast actors not <UNK> actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they don't look exactly like the comic book br br the costume is what you would expect superman to wear as for the batman suit well i guess it only looks good in the dark i say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a halloween gift shop br br superman flies in this movie but that isn't a good thing these shots look especially amateur this and a lot of the entire film looks like it was shot in their backyard with a vhs camera br br the best shots are a shot of superman catching a car in his hands and the final shot of two face and batman at the very end for those of you who have seen the trailer you know what i'm talking about now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer br br finally i ask why if you're trying to show your ability as a director would you make a trailer as a short film this proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story my only piece of advice for <UNK> here is there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing br br batman dead end didn't feel amateur i can't figure out where this went wrong
<START> i remember watching this in the 1970s then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library br br with a nearly 30 year <UNK> i have come to another conclusion most of the principals interviewed in this series some at the center of power like <UNK> <UNK> hitler's secretary karl <UNK> head of <UNK> navy anthony <UNK> uk are long gone but their first hand accounts will live on from <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> russian civilians concentration camp survivors all are on record here br br i can remember the lord <UNK> interview killed in the 1970s br br this is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was <UNK> by queen elizabeth for this work well deserved br br seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set br br this is the only 10 i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine it is more appreciated with a little time
<START> this story is a familiar one in the long running tom and jerry cartoons especially in the 1940s the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened to be <UNK> if they don't catch the mouse jerry tom has an <UNK> buddy butch living in the house with him so this really <UNK> <UNK> two shoes who can't believe that they have a mouse despite two cats in the house br br anyway the one who catches jerry can stay while the other gets the boot so the competition is on br br even though it's familiar territory i still enjoyed this because the cartoon had enough original sight gags to make entertaining you not only had the cats competing against each but jerry in the <UNK> as well so there were enough good gags to definitely recommend if you are a tom jerry fan
<START> yesterday i went to the <UNK> <UNK> flea market that comes to town i really have no interest in such things but i went for the <UNK> of friends who do have such an interest looking over the hundreds of <UNK> passing many of them quickly i spotted someone selling vhs tapes and dvds most of the films he had on dvd were rather recent the oldest one i noticed was the 1940 cary grant irene dunne co <UNK> my favorite wife but the vhs tapes by their nature were mostly older films i couldn't resist buying something since they were being sold at 3 tapes for 10 00 what a bargain as eddie murphy used to say i came across one film that i had heard about for years but had never seen john <UNK> opening night 1977 well i certainly wanted that being a fan of gena rowlands and i had heard that this film contained one of her finest performances he also had faces 1968 i had seen this about 20 years ago a time when i probably had not had enough life experience to appreciate it thoroughly and i wanted to take advantage of the bargain so i grabbed that one too my other choice was <UNK> <UNK> 1970 br br when i got home i decided to put aside the work i had planned to do so that i could watch opening night i was totally enthralled by this film it focuses on myrtle gordon gena rowlands a famous actress of stage and screen who during out of town previews is having personal and professional problems coming to terms with both her character and the <UNK> theme of facing aging after one rehearsal an avid fan and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her with cries and tears of i love you i love you a few minutes later this fan is hit by a car and killed this begins <UNK> descent into herself where she must face her own fears of aging the future of her career as a mature actress and the <UNK> she finds in the play itself written by a much older female <UNK> played by joan blondell throughout the film she sees the dead girl an obvious symbol of her past drinks almost constantly and receives <UNK> support from her director ben <UNK> the producer paul stewart her <UNK> john <UNK> himself and the <UNK> actually they're more concerned about how her behavior will affect them and their careers <UNK> lines on stage <UNK> new lines generally cracking up on stage and arriving for the broadway opening totally drunk br br this story functions not only to address the issues of aging but also to promote <UNK> <UNK> with mainstream movie making as i watched the film i was at times surprised confused amused <UNK> but ultimately involved entertained and satisfied <UNK> really had a great sense of humor cared very much that his audience understood what he was <UNK> and wanted them to be emotionally involved in the story he makes <UNK> to all about eve with the use of the avid theater fan even dressing the young girl in a <UNK> and hat similar to the one worn by anne <UNK> at the beginning of that film this <UNK> functions most obviously to support his aging theme the contrast of the older and younger woman he also obviously uses the contrast as a symbol for <UNK> confronting her own lost youth at first i felt the symbolism was too obvious but then i realized that that was <UNK> intention he doesn't want his audience <UNK> what he's getting at if they did it would <UNK> with their emotional involvement this <UNK> of youth <UNK> myrtle attacks her and wants to destroy her myrtle eventually kills her but before she can really come to terms with herself and the play she must reach bottom another <UNK> death so <UNK> has her get so drunk that she can't walk and must crawl to her dressing room the night the play opens on broadway she <UNK> herself helping yourself out of such situations is also important to the film's theme and makes the play a success by giving a great performance and changing the direction of play for the better by <UNK> so that it contains some ray of hope for the aging character she's playing these scenes are funny and interesting <UNK> and rowlands actually did the play in front of live audiences who did and did not know they were going to be part of a movie the play they're doing also acts as contrast it's mainstream and self serious about the issues it <UNK> that is until myrtle changes its denouement in doing so she also <UNK> the work of her co stars the natural evolution of interaction achieved through <UNK> between and among human beings <UNK> realism and universal truth these were <UNK> concerns in making films br br gena rowlands is amazing throughout of course she has that great face and <UNK> <UNK> in love with her throughout their marriage treats us to numerous closeups of it so that we too can feel her emotions and that we know what's going on inside of her she makes you care so much about this character that you want to see her work her way out of this crisis of the soul and this is what holds your attention for the 2 hours and 30 minutes running time the film is deliberately paced at times and requires constant attention but anyone with interest in good film making and great acting will be rewarded someone else said that this is a movie for people who love movies all others be <UNK> br br seek out opening night if you've never seen it everyone in it is excellent and it's one of <UNK> best films
<START> <UNK> isn't a single scorsese movie i'd place on a list of my favorite movies but this is the best thing i've run through my dvd player in about five years <UNK> patient <UNK> of favorite film moments and how hollywood works is incredibly <UNK> calm and intelligent br br it's 3 dvd sides worth of material it would have to be a british production since everything about american corporate culture would have <UNK> the quiet <UNK> no <UNK> put the focus on the content approach that is taken here and an american production would have <UNK> he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites i wish everyone took a page from his love of movies you should love the movies you do for personal <UNK> and specific reasons not just more me too votes for the godfather etc people have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies if they did movies would be more interesting than they are scorsese does know what ideas are being explored and that makes him a compelling involved <UNK> on the topic i really appreciate his <UNK> generous interviews over the last decade br br on a negative note scorsese is best when he's excited to show you some obscure movie rather than when he's <UNK> teaching you something well established about film history and i do wish he <UNK> those three <UNK> out of the bridge of his nose it's very distracting
<START> back in the day if marion davies had had her <UNK> and didn't just listen to william randolph <UNK> she'd have done more films like show people and been a lot happier in fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy she'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like when <UNK> was in flower and <UNK> meredith br br what you're seeing by all accounts in show people is the real davies a gifted <UNK> a superb <UNK> and a generous good hearted person she could really identify with the character of peggy pepper aka patricia <UNK> she put up with her share of <UNK> in her hollywood stardom br br if the plot of show people was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a <UNK> story i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in hollywood like so many others looking for that big break she wants to drama but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the <UNK> comics she gets her share of pie and <UNK> in the face but learns her trade and also wins the heart of young comic actor william haines br br she does get her first big break but it doesn't come for haines as well and marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor paul <UNK> playing andre <UNK> a pretend no account count of <UNK> somebody here was taking a shot at actor lou <UNK> lover and husband of sarah <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and others and to hear tell of it one of the most <UNK> people in cinema br br show people was one of the first films to have the <UNK> cameo appearances of stars as themselves you will get to see folks like charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart mae murray john gilbert <UNK> <UNK> etc just being themselves in and around the film colony that in itself makes show people a film worth saving br br show people also made good use of standard tin pan alley songs like ain't we got fun i'm sitting on top of the world you'd be surprised california here i come as the film came out on the <UNK> of sound being introduced a song called <UNK> was introduced in it it's not a bad number but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack i guess since they're not seen it was felt no billing was necessary still i'd like to know and i'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see show people br br it's easy to see why marion davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite she looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of <UNK> shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience
<START> this was just a terrible movie it hurt me to watch it almost every action was <UNK> within the context of the movie the acting was really poor p <UNK> was the best actor which really says something about the movie and the plot was generally predictable some <UNK> to carlito's way were okay for example his dream of one day moving to the <UNK> but on the whole they were weak the love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's <UNK> anyways i really wasn't expecting much before watching the movie and i guess you could say even those expectations weren't met i feel bad for jay <UNK> because he actually is a decent actor friday night lights he's lucky though because i'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie i generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so i'm gonna go ahead and give this one two stars better luck next time and yes i did enjoy carlito's way
<START> i enjoyed this movie haven't seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly i've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he's versatile br br i wasn't troubled that <UNK> anxiety disorder may not have been <UNK> from a psychiatric <UNK> there are <UNK> of whatever <UNK> and <UNK> and these can take on a broad variety of <UNK> and <UNK> forms she is clearly a sensitive with extra <UNK> powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any <UNK> it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and <UNK> eccentric br br although this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems also <UNK> twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the <UNK> action together in a <UNK> it's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out i don't remember exactly when i thought that it was alright for a ben stiller movie this movie isn't for a person without a good sense of humor like most of ben <UNK> jokes you have to think about them or like i said you have a good sense of humor from a couple of people on this website i saw that people didn't have anything good to say about it and it didn't get a very good rating but i would have given it a larger one this movie i thought was very good and it should have gotten a better rating maybe this isn't a movie for you i'm just giving you another person's opinion
<START> ok it's very rare that i complain something i got for free so i guess this movie pushed me over that limit i saw it at the hollywood cemetery for free and walked away very very disappointed one audience <UNK> question to the director about using the native american references just as <UNK> instead of being <UNK> into the movie better basically says everything that this movie failed on br br native american references the native american references felt really out of place and contrived it's obvious that this director and writer tried <UNK> an <UNK> they never played in before they should have stuck to the old <UNK> of write about something you know if they are in fact <UNK> in this it certainly did not show on the movie or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice br br clichés and on the nose i agreed to see this film on the basis that it was an indie so i held it to higher expectations little miss sunshine was an indie and saw it before it became so popular before it even came out to wide release i was already raving how it's going to be a hit unfortunately i could not say the same about <UNK> date sunshine took us to cliché incidents but the filmmakers were so clever at their approach that the outcome would take us to a different direction avoiding the trap of being a cliche this movie on the other hand had no way of not falling in the trap because it was already trapped from the start the psycho mom's antics the <UNK> couple etc br br i hate to say it but the best and worst movie i've seen this year were both <UNK> little miss sunshine being the best and this movie being the worst i wish i could say otherwise br br but i do <UNK> the filmmakers for having such a good turn out from their family members at the cemetery
<START> in all the comments <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a <UNK> powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite <UNK> i give this an 8
<START> easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time i first saw this movie when i was around nine years of age and i have to say that it scared the hell out of me now that i'm all <UNK> up however i see this movie for what it really is a work of genius everyone or at least everyone with any taste has <UNK> of seeing a snowman going around killing people even if they won't admit it i have always found something genuinely frightening about <UNK> so naturally for a horror <UNK> such as myself <UNK> was a dream come true some people say that this movie is silly or otherwise void of any intelligence it's a movie about a serial killer snowman what the hell did you expect anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too uptight to sit back and have a good laugh at stupid one liners and cheap gore i love this movie for what it is a comedy and until the movie industry <UNK> up and makes a serious horror flick about a killer snowman which seems impossible unfortunately i will forever hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart
<START> this movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has <UNK> shown the cross cultural love story <UNK> by the politics mid 20th century pre wwii india where the british and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true indians are good surely such clichéd depictions of the british are rather <UNK> now br br apart from the drama that <UNK> the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable the acting is pedestrian and two dimensional and the directing obvious and unimaginative br br the story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have <UNK> from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in br br all in all rather uninspiring oh and <UNK> <UNK> just cannot do tragedy going cross eyed with emotional pain just doesn't work for me
<START> this cartoon is short on plot but is a visually stunning piece of work there will be very very minor spoilers br br this short has a story that's incredibly slight <UNK> underground are responsible for the return of spring each year yet must <UNK> with a winter not yet ready to <UNK> both the <UNK> and the storm have their own songs that's pretty much the plot such as it is but this cartoon isn't about the plot it's about the color and animation the visuals are exceptional back in 1936 such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here br br my favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the <UNK> colors through <UNK> at more than one point there are a series of <UNK> <UNK> in a row from the <UNK> to the <UNK> and the colors move through the <UNK> and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a <UNK> <UNK> br br the visuals of the battle between the <UNK> <UNK> and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed these types of shorts were things which hugh <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are noted for but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from mgm because this cartoon probably went over budget and mgm finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than <UNK> and <UNK> were br br this is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing it's available on the dvd attack of the <UNK> characters recommended particularly if you like good animation
<START> as others have noted this should have been an excellent hammer style film and it seems to me that that's how most of the actors were <UNK> to play it but the screenplay is so <UNK> poorly paced and filled with a lot of dull <UNK> poor timothy dalton is <UNK> with most of them that it's all too overblown and self important this is an <UNK> weak performance from dalton although he quietly nails the climactic scene where dr rock finally realizes what he's done the only actor who comes off really well is patrick stewart who is a most welcome sight <UNK> francis may have been a great cinematographer but he was a lousy director
<START> if you haven't figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes <UNK> is a widow she has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out she has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger while checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never <UNK> the <UNK> where she can belly dance in skimpy <UNK> outfits while men throw money at her the film is very <UNK> it's portrayal of men is dismal which is rather odd as <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> around for them not for money but just for the hell of it when she succeeds in <UNK> them it makes her feel like a woman again she does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention the other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short lived not short enough i say she does find romance however brief with you guessed it no surprises here we didn't see coming though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way maybe this film just isn't <UNK> my <UNK> 30 male
<START> the opening 5 minutes gave me hope then meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie absolute lowest common <UNK> humor painful viewing a complete chore written no doubt in less than a week just like the first one give meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with adam sandler and will farrell and don't let him out until he's developed a decent script for something anything he has it in him these austin powers things are just embarrassing br br let <UNK> sink without trace
<START> von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world so as viewers we think we watch a true story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated often to the point that the movie works disturbing dancer in the dark or painful the idiots <UNK> of course the <UNK> films acted only as a vehicle for this theory besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trier br br the story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic seems to balance his relations with everybody else but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves the <UNK> inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist mankind is spoiled and <UNK> only leads to self destruction these elements were also very <UNK> in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark the movie is also full of cynical even humorous undertones about the role of the germans and americans in post war germany br br as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and <UNK> washed out colors screen <UNK> action on different <UNK> with the shooting of the soon to be mayor as the most interesting in this movie we can see how good von <UNK> handles film as a technical medium in his later works he seems to step down from this as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available
<START> if you want to see a retarded homosexual karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe mexican gangsters repeatedly for an <UNK> then this is the film for you if not then choose another dvd from the <UNK> bin which is the only place this film belongs the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end the cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap b grade gangster film along the lines of 2 <UNK> and a key bloody <UNK> and menace i would not buy or rent this film unless you are <UNK> to get stoned and plot editing and acting really don't matter to you it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity
<START> i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had <UNK> trailers while it was being promoted so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that it is the directorial debut of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who wrote the screenplays for <UNK> 1 2 and saif ali <UNK> son <UNK> makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback br br after watching it i understood that why their wasn't a proper trailer because there wasn't anything in the film to show the story was extremely <UNK> and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story line there was hardly any action and the camera <UNK> at every possible angle there is and it's difficult to figure out that who is killing who also the action was <UNK> unrealistic e g 1 man with a <UNK> managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns br br while i was watching tashan it reminded me of 3 films br br sin city during the opening credits br br <UNK> anil <UNK> terrible english like <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a <UNK> funny br br i also heard the budget is 40 <UNK> which is the same amount as <UNK> 2 and i don't know where all the money went to anyway if you did not like <UNK> 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan race was hot on heels and that is a million times better br br the only 2 good songs are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and both songs are shot in <UNK> at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film even anil <UNK> terrible english couldn't save this <UNK>
<START> i found this film to be the usual french slap in america's face the camera all too often focuses on fat people on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer the cinematography exploits and <UNK> them there were undoubtedly thin people to be seen in <UNK> and neat organized homes but <UNK> chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen br br i can only hope that some american filmmakers will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst elements i can assure you as a frequent visitor to france that all is not well there foreign immigrants are not readily <UNK> thus creating severe social <UNK> but americans are not eager to <UNK> the french for their prejudice toward their own <UNK> and their envy toward the u s so we're not likely to see films on the subject
<START> i love all types of films especially horror that being said survival does not live up to any of the hype surrounding it br br i can't give it any points on originality there is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes or <UNK> what others have done it has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods a crazed killer and as of lately throw in some crazy family on those lines i have to compare it with the likes of texas chainsaw wrong turn though the twist in that one is obvious and others survival falls up way short against comparable films the plot was just not original in any way some films can get by with a weak and way over done plot with superb acting special fx or a slew of other factors <UNK> doesn't have any of that to bank on if you will note the following the acting in the movie never took off i don't knock or blame the actors for that nor the director the dialogue was at best mediocre and the actors involved never showed not saying didn't have the talent to pull it off i mention 2 <UNK> the leading man in this film certainly has the look but i seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film the actor who portrayed greg also had potential but we never got to see any of it watch the movie to see why you won't believe it br br the grainy film look ah yes that little <UNK> bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of <UNK> films in today's film making that has become a gimmick it either works or it doesn't in this case it just does not work there are too many other flaws going on so it winds up distracting from the film not adding to it that being said i think they did a good job of adding that grain that is some good quality grain i think with a different script better direction and possibly actors they should try another <UNK> attempt they will probably pull it off br br as far as the tech aspects in my opinion they never quite <UNK> for me either better care could have been taken with audio sounds like it was fed directly into the camera but there is nothing wrong with that and for being shot on <UNK> it was too soft for my taste br br that is all i have to say about that
<START> the man in the moon is a warm and moving coming of age drama <UNK> around a <UNK> family in the 1950's the main story follows a 14 year old girl reese <UNK> who develops a crush on a 17 year old neighbor jason london who ends up falling for her older sister emily <UNK> and how an unexpected tragedy <UNK> this family's dynamics forever the 1950's are lovingly <UNK> here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately <UNK> already begins to show the oscar winning talent she would develop in this early role and london makes a charming leading man <UNK> lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well kudos to sam <UNK> and tess <UNK> who play the girls' parents and <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> mom i was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that <UNK> up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase family ties
<START> i saw dick tracy when i was very young i didn't know who any of the actors were and i didn't know the movie would turn out different than the way it was <UNK> i sure loved it though br br warren beatty stars as the crime fighting 1930's detective dick tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city this time big boy <UNK> al pacino has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless <UNK> madonna who has her eye on tracy it becomes even worse because a new criminal is <UNK> and the worst part is this criminal has no face he or she is very unknown plus the famous <UNK> are back from the comic book collection br br i thought that this movie was very colorful and creative it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child warren <UNK> was just like james bond of the 1930's the way he played dick tracy br br an ensemble cast of the film includes charlie <UNK> glenn <UNK> william forsythe dustin hoffman james <UNK> ed <UNK> ross tommy lee jones mandy <UNK> charles <UNK> plus more br br dick tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy take my word for it
<START> it's nice to see a film with real people with honest feelings sissy <UNK> is so absolutely convincing as a simple yet nice daughter to robert farnsworth br br who finally in his last role gets to show what a fine actor he was it is hard to believe that this is a david lynch film it is slow and even sweet and moving one of the best unless you like car chases sex scenes and violence
<START> story of ireland in the 70 s this film is a beautiful <UNK> of small time ireland in the 1970 s all the gang are there see below master boyle the boys the cannon <UNK> <UNK> senator <UNK> <UNK> rose <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> see this film feel ireland as it was br br
<START> <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> 1975 was obviously received in different ways some were appalled some were shocked others <UNK> the courage i however am completely <UNK> bored and cannot stop asking myself why the display of incoherent inconsistent images which vaguely <UNK> around a central theme are considered an intellectual journey br br what was this movie actually about growing sexuality in a woman i've seen great films on this subject but this is not one of them how can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to <UNK> her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream in the nude of <UNK> where there are no characters there is no character study the woman <UNK> by the beast was not adolescent the girl having sex with the black butler is he also <UNK> as a beast has a very grown up attitude to sexuality so where is the <UNK> is it a movie about religion if yes we would need a bit more <UNK> material than a priest without function character and charisma but with a strong desire towards two young boys br br is it about <UNK> the <UNK> feel of the movie <UNK> any realistic examination of <UNK> especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters so no real <UNK> here some <UNK> beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of <UNK> enough for a college <UNK> on the topic i don't think so br br is it about sex is it about anything i don't know i only know that showing a fired gun doesn't make a film a war movie dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own <UNK> with the theme br br so look across the controversy don't be scared by the <UNK> nudity <UNK> masturbation and stuff i am not look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made poorly edited poorly acted really poorly written okay some pictures are quite nice and the main character is a really good looking girl cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent it doesn't it makes it boring
<START> this movie is best described or compare to big fish the movie by tim burton but it's a less glamorous and more in you face tale and of course here it's not the father but his grandfather who tells the stories br br the movie's narrative also moves back and forth so the story outline here at imdb might tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie it's funny and engaging enough even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too it also surprises you here and there with things you wouldn't expect a nice little movie then that deserves your attention especially if you like movies like that o
<START> every once in a while eddie murphy will surprise you br br in a movie like the golden child especially this is a movie you'd figure would star maybe harrison ford or kurt russell or someone but eddie really does work he's smart he's funny he's brave kind <UNK> <UNK> clean and everything else a hero should be br br having been chosen to secure a <UNK> child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil <UNK> perfectly by dance eddie goes from california to <UNK> and back all while the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> lewis wonders if he's all he says he is and a crazy old holy man wong perfect as always knows that he is br br it's exciting breathtaking in spots shocking and of course funny eddie is the only action hero i know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart <UNK> remarks about ed <UNK> br br no problem with this child it's a golden find br br nine stars <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is a racist movie but worthy of study and enjoyment first time through it the natural <UNK> is to focus on <UNK> dad they have a relaxed peaceful thing going what with her still at home about to graduate from high school and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something second time through you realize how horribly the sister's husband is <UNK> by her friends in the backwoods blues bar he takes it it's the thing to do these days and the critical moment passes as if they were <UNK> about the weather in that same scene the sister's blues song is a real tear <UNK> if you're the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music her performance feels like the climax of the story a blues story with the good guys being people of color in their element in backwoods <UNK> meanwhile all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies that's cool long as you recognize it as fiction
<START> bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful to this end he drugs brides during their wedding <UNK> to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies i'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies i don't remember it ever being fully explained all i know is that he <UNK> something from them and <UNK> it in his wife i'll just guess that it's spinal fluid spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s you can pretty much guess the rest from here br br there are a couple well really more than a couple but i'll only write about two of problems that i have with this movie one is the way bela is used sure he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way btw the rest of the cast is simply abysmal but to have him hiding in the back of a <UNK> or having him creep into the female <UNK> bedroom to do nothing is just silly also why have him beat and or kill every henchman he has is it to make him look evil well someone who is kidnapping <UNK> brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil br br the second problem i have is the idea of <UNK> brides why brides wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do watching bela go through these <UNK> to get his victims i was reminded of the idiotic <UNK> in i still know what you did last summer in each case there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than <UNK> a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control btw an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides i guess that partially explains the need for <UNK>
<START> in a far away galaxy is a planet called <UNK> it's native people worship cats but the dog people <UNK> war upon these <UNK> loving people and they have no choice but to go to earth and <UNK> people up for food this is one of the stupidest f k <UNK> ideas for a movie i've seen leave it to ted <UNK> to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films it's like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of <UNK> how low can he go the only losers in the scenario are us the viewer mr <UNK> and his silly little <UNK> mustache actually has people who still buy this crap br br my grade f br br dvd extras commentary by ted <UNK> the story behind the making of 9 and a half minutes 17 minutes 15 seconds of behind the scenes footage ted <UNK> filmography and trailers for the worm <UNK> girl in gold boots the doll squad ten violent women featuring nudity blood orgy of the she <UNK> the corpse <UNK>
<START> six degrees had me hooked i looked forward to it coming on and was totally disappointed when men in trees replaced it's time spot i thought it was just on <UNK> and would be back early in 2007 what happened all my friends were really surprised it ended we could relate to the characters who had real problems we talked about each episode and had our favorite characters there wasn't anybody on the show i didn't like and felt the acting was superb i <UNK> like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas i for one would like to protest the <UNK> of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance give it a good time <UNK> don't keep moving it from this day to that day and <UNK> it so people will know it is on
<START> as a big fan of the original film it's hard to watch this show the <UNK> set <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sets rob any style from this remake the mood is never there instead it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies crenna is not a bad choice as walter <UNK> but his snappy wardrobe and <UNK> apartment don't fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting character he does his best to make it work but samantha <UNK> is a really bad choice the english accent and california looks can't hold a candle to barbara <UNK> <UNK> voice and sex appeal lee j <UNK> tries <UNK> to fashion barton <UNK> but even his performance is just gruff without style br br it feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is
