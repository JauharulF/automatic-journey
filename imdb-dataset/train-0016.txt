<START> almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and implausible it carries no semblance of a genuine human story dead and dull it is a parody of hollywood with <UNK> musical bits that remind you of a denzel washington movie <UNK> camera shots and focusing racist stereotypes absolutely unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in clothing <UNK> poses it is made to <UNK> for the <UNK> of zombies whose meaning in life <UNK> from watching celebrity names the only good thing in the movie is the end credits and funky song that <UNK> it i feel like an idiot for watching this save yourself
<START> i must admit at first i wasn't expecting anything good at all i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting <UNK> and <UNK> image but i'm glad to say it has much more to offer br br yes the acting is not that great but it doesn't suck either all the <UNK> well <UNK> and they bring enough strength to their characters effects lack <UNK> but action scenes are satisfying enough br br what really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline although it <UNK> fantastic elements it also displays a crude reality the developing of the characters their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think that's the key of this movie it puts you to think and it does well <UNK> all the angst br br it <UNK> any expectations for a good drama i would definitely recommend it to everyone
<START> she's not michael jordan br br think of all the marvelous <UNK> players whose career light has been <UNK> for no other good reason than the timing of their birth their names might trip as easily off the <UNK> lips as russell <UNK> <UNK> magic <UNK> oscar <UNK> the list goes on but the volume gets turned down a little for <UNK> and malone charles patrick and all the other great players who always lost the <UNK> to michael br br i've seen it written that gretchen <UNK> career <UNK> out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 vanity fair issue which predicted inevitable <UNK> for ms mol it was later said that she had been over hyped i disagree br br i still remember that for some time after i saw the devil's <UNK> in <UNK> or <UNK> i would get confused as to which actress played mary ann <UNK> was it mol or <UNK> oh yeah <UNK> <UNK> was the one in 2 days in the valley and mighty joe young and gretchen mol was in <UNK> <UNK> celebrity and <UNK> br br by the time i had seen the <UNK> floor mol and sweet november <UNK> i pretty much had them <UNK> out but i still put them in the same mental file <UNK> both were highly talented had sweet faces similar body types short blonde hair and so on br br <UNK> though was offered more work i loved her as sara <UNK> and as adele <UNK> her beauty was downright <UNK> br br in 2003 monster was released and from that point until the <UNK> of the oscar itself all of <UNK> knew who the best actress award was going to and deservedly so <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> the only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in <UNK> head and for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive <UNK> of br br then in 2005 the notorious bettie page was released <UNK> performance was extraordinary maybe she was standing in the shadow of ms <UNK> it was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing presidential candidate nobody came and nobody cared it was viewed as a <UNK> of an old tale once promising actress with a <UNK> career does a <UNK> part in a b movie ho hum no no no wrong no matter what you may think of the film and i enjoy films about the fifties if you pass on this one you'll be missing one of the better performances of that year ms <UNK> was every bit as much bettie as ms <UNK> was <UNK> unfortunately <UNK> to the film going public is the more sympathetic character for whatever reason an amoral <UNK> killer is less embarrassing to us than a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally <UNK> and completely exposed bettie page was one of the icons of the fifties her photos and films never sexual never pornographic but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky there was no sense of realism only parody ms <UNK> captured the very essence of the character she gained 20 pounds to add some <UNK> to her normally slim figure and when she <UNK> for various <UNK> in the film her body was <UNK> her full frontal lack of any <UNK> accurately fits everything which has been published about bettie cinematic nudity normally depicts <UNK> or sexuality in this film it's all about innocence seeing gretchen bettie nude didn't make me want to jump her but <UNK> a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can <UNK> on each other if you pass on this film you'll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years by the way shame on the mpaa for giving this an r rating
<START> rachel <UNK> writes and directs this award winning short film a heartwarming story about <UNK> with grief and <UNK> the memory of those we've loved and lost although only 15 minutes long <UNK> manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time bud <UNK> gives a touching performance as will a widower struggling to cope with his wife's death will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and <UNK> as he proceeds to take care of <UNK> pet cow <UNK> the film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost good cinematography great direction and superbly acted it will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one and survived
<START> dwight frye steals the show in this one as a foolish young man who seems to be mentally handicapped who gets himself blamed for vampire like murders especially after he reveals his love for bats which he likes to stroke and give to unsuspecting friends as <UNK> besides all of that there's an entertaining mystery tale involving the above mentioned murders underrated
<START> mad magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for it but obviously someone there had some common sense when the powers that be <UNK> this waste of celluloid the editing is el <UNK> the plot is incredibly thin and stupid and the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that <UNK> <UNK> takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shot i never thought i would feel sorry for ralph <UNK> making the decision to be in this thing but i do and i really feel bad for ron <UNK> and tom <UNK> gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece of film at least mr <UNK> had the <UNK> to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movie and he comes out ahead there are actually copies of this thing with <UNK> beginning sequence still on it if you can locate one grab it <UNK> it is probably worth something it's the only thing about this movie that's worth anything and a note to the folks at imdb com there is no way to spoil this movie for anyone the makers spoiled it by themselves
<START> artemisia <UNK> the daughter of <UNK> <UNK> showed an early promise as a painter taught by her father artemisia was born in an era that denied talented women the right to have their work seen side by side art created by men her tragic life is <UNK> in this <UNK> film directed and co written by <UNK> <UNK> br br having read the novel the passion of artemisia by susan <UNK> made us investigate more into the life of this woman her work and her legacy we also read mary <UNK> artemisia <UNK> which should be a must read book by all art lovers br br artemisia presents the <UNK> facts we have read about showing the early life of the young woman as she starts to paint she was clearly influenced by the work of her father by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> <UNK> of that period her relationship and love affair with <UNK> is the basis of the film artemisia unfortunately couldn't go as far as she could have because of the prejudice against women in the arts it didn't help either she caused a scandal where she is accused of being raped by <UNK> she had to go to rome in order to distance herself from that unhappy time of her life br br <UNK> <UNK> makes a beautiful artemisia she is a gorgeous creature who <UNK> passion in men michel <UNK> plays <UNK> her father <UNK> <UNK> is seen as <UNK> the man who wanted artemisia but ended up in jail <UNK> <UNK> appears for a moment br br the film has a glossy finish that the camera work of benoit <UNK> captures in all its <UNK> the <UNK> locales of the film offer an idea of what inspired that school of painting to show in their <UNK> the music by <UNK> levy serves well what we see <UNK> <UNK> directed with sure hand showing a visual style of her own
<START> this is the touching story of two families in israel and the relationships within each family each family has a gay son the stories are <UNK> at that point but this film is about all of the family members not just the two sons the <UNK> of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak
<START> this was probably the worst movie ever seriously i could actually do better myself it wasn't even set up properly it's like this movie had a 5 budget and left with change don't watch it i didn't even get all the way through this movie had to turn it off i've give this a 1 10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie but actually turned into a really bad comedy basically a bunch of girls crashed into a car broke a <UNK> and the owner of that car went after them the bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes off what the hell it must be some kind of cheesy porn movie as well
<START> the beginning of this movie was good it started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself i think if i came from a little town like that i would be offended after seeing this movie they made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy how could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day a lot of times these people were telling him ways to kill himself like they were <UNK> him to do it how can so many people have little respect for other people i also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie there were some good parts to this movie also some people might like it but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone
<START> what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters the major point is we believe in those characters and once they've met each other we want them to stay together it's simple and really efficient the background story is less important why does the screenplay go on the side of a half developed thriller it helps not to get stuck in those social <UNK> most french film <UNK> like to make not too much ambition right <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is only an entertaining french film with good characterization br br for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy it goes quite as easy as in rear window an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film but with a less compelling context where i am amazed it's to see that the character of the <UNK> officer has not been <UNK> he brings very little to the story when he appears alone we wonder if we've not missed a part before jacques <UNK> is not a new <UNK> yet strange and weird
<START> this movie is probably my favorite movie of all time <UNK> flynn is excellent as bunny <UNK> zane <UNK> as <UNK> is comic genius the rest of the cast is amazing and the film is really really funny a definite satire of horror films with a zany twist if you enjoy a fun comedy filled evening then go and rent this classic you'll laugh all the way through
<START> the movie is a bit thin after reading the book but it's still one of the greatest movies ever made <UNK> lee is beautiful and nick nolte is really <UNK> he makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as mother night does
<START> an interesting tv movie based on true fact betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters that of a prisoner <UNK> <UNK> plays his younger brother who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the <UNK> for his brother's death penalty but when he goes to visit him and enters <UNK> <UNK> the problem starts it has nothing to do with <UNK> acting ability he just looks like the version of a prisoner of <UNK> roots according to g q magazine with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars this realization came to me after meeting again an old friend whom i had not seen for almost 15 years which he spent in several <UNK> <UNK> the young man i used to know is gone not only because he is older but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the <UNK> system there are <UNK> and there are <UNK> one must say but this one prisoner in shot in the heart is definitely out of this world
<START> this interesting documentary tells a remarkable tale of an expedition to take blind <UNK> children <UNK> in the <UNK> but also of a personality clash between two remarkable people on one hand there is <UNK> <UNK> the first blind man to climb <UNK> and the team of <UNK> <UNK> who are <UNK> the kids on the other there is <UNK> <UNK> a blind woman who runs the first school for blind <UNK> who agrees to the expedition but subsequently has doubts about how it is <UNK> at some level <UNK> simply doesn't understand the <UNK> philosophy with it's emphasis on <UNK> she is probably right in <UNK> the <UNK> between the <UNK> goals and the desires of the children but her <UNK> in her own correctness makes her a hard person to <UNK> with especially as she has an effective <UNK> in the background to this reasonably well mannered clash we get an insight into the lives of the children themselves i enjoyed the film although it delivers a message clearly designed to be uplifting even though it details the <UNK> the film somewhat relentlessly <UNK> how amazing all those who feature in it are but it's hard to argue with that <UNK> even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat <UNK>
<START> this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldn't stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight despite the fact that i've seen all the episodes previously i've always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience i watch this show and i laugh a very large <UNK> of the time i can't say that about many tv shows can you this show is finally something new and interesting and most importantly funny this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out you owe it to yourself to watch this show i predict a long run for this series and just to be clear the people who are offended by this show just don't get it perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don't understand anyone who uses the word <UNK> in reference to silverman or who claims that she only aims to shock is way off the mark she's exactly the opposite just <UNK> her and you'll quickly see that she's a huge <UNK> of civil rights etc if you don't know that she's ironically <UNK> all of these outrageous <UNK> you don't get it and if you don't get it do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity
<START> i'm stunned that the reviewers imdb gave this tv film as a high a rating as they did it's an <UNK> sweet <UNK> <UNK> of a film that had two big names from the past in it both of whom did a decent job but this film <UNK> of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels i like a good romance as well as anyone but as my wife and i were watching this and before we saw the rating we said there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there's nothing in it to challenge their brains their faith their comfort level or their cultural <UNK> it's possible to make a good film like that and away from her is an example but this was amateur hour there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one truly another in a long line of woefully <UNK> holiday films watch the family stone it's miles ahead of this schlock
<START> two years ago at sundance i loved josh <UNK> directing debut <UNK> tunnel so i was looking forward to his brother and frequent <UNK> <UNK> the best thief in the world this is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower class area of new york the movie is not without its poignant moments but at times it is as if kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious life can be very difficult for some people and life isn't fair br br more subtle and more important is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat <UNK> cultural <UNK> and the anti social behavior they may <UNK> these characters have no <UNK> of goodness and humanity we can <UNK> at their language and their living conditions but we are cannot <UNK> their intent and in fact their struggles to maintain a family under such <UNK> has a certain <UNK> that most of us can barely appreciate kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and his compassion for the people is evident throughout br br having said all this the best thief in the world suffers from many painful flaws including the title the characters aren't very believable the writing is uneven and the plot line is barely discernible and for many the most disturbing is that kornbluth uses two young black boys <UNK> <UNK> rap between scenes to each his own but while i don't question the potential realism of this phenomenon it pains me to see 5 year old children <UNK> and talking about having sex with a line up of women it's unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest
<START> with an absolutely amazing cast and crew this might have been a classic instead it is a repetitive <UNK> of all the conspiracy theories <UNK> in 1979 about the <UNK> assassination <UNK> rather <UNK> on to a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of <UNK> president <UNK> in 1960 many superb character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do sterling hayden or eli <UNK> for instance or they are asked to go rather <UNK> over the top john huston jeff bridges and anthony <UNK> do manage to <UNK> themselves very well in their very different ways though br br the photography is gorgeous but does not justify an hour and a half of your life or the price of the dvd purchase
<START> very possibly one of the funniest movies in the world oscar material <UNK> parker and matt stone are hilarious and before you see this i suggest you see south park one of the funniest cartoons created buy it you will laugh every time you see it pure stroke of genius if you don't think its funny then you have no soul or sense of humor 10 out of 10
<START> this is an arnold movie now that you know that i've saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review if you don't like arnold then you wont like this movie if the case is the other then you will very probably like it it's as simple as that br br now if you're still reading this i expect you like arnold good for you he is quite good isn't he the running man is a very typical arnold feature it's got the usual retro future we know so well from 80's b sci fi it's got a bunch of terrible one liners lots of violence and explosions and a good looking heroine and a happy ending br br in this case the evil <UNK> is the all controlling <UNK> government which uses television as an effective crowd control with gladiator type game shows arnold of course ends up in one of these shows and turns it all up side down with a little help from his two <UNK> and the good looking <UNK> br br it's not a big budget movie but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future with some nice <UNK> paintings and sets to help it it's hopelessly 80's but i find that charming acting is varying arnold doing his usual <UNK> and shout thing with a helping of stone faced one liners heroine <UNK> is to put it lightly a bit stereotypical and the subtly named <UNK> <UNK> is a typical evil tv man br br in spite of all it's flaws the movie shows its message very clearly television is an <UNK> of the masses a good way to control people it also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience this does not seem futuristic at all today which is a bit <UNK> br br if you've seen arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one enjoy
<START> i am a dumber person for renting the dvd <UNK> chicago pictures who made this stupid movie never paid <UNK> media group to buy web ads on various <UNK> sites including mine which has an <UNK> rating of <UNK> they ripped me off on the deal and now i am out 16 000 and they wasted much of my personal time peter <UNK> of <UNK> media you know who you are br br please don't rent or buy this movie it sucks and the people behind it are ripoff artists br br <UNK> has a cast of losers and poor actors br br this movie is a joke
<START> the last hard men is a typical western for the 70's most of them seem to be inspired by sam <UNK> also this one but director andrew <UNK> is a john ford <UNK> and this can be obviously shown in many scenes imo the beginning is very good in a certain way <UNK> wanted to show the audience a travel from the civilization to the wilderness in the third part there are some illogical flaws and i complain a bit about charlton heston he has to play an old ex <UNK> named sam <UNK> but he is in a fantastic physical shape i never got the feeling that he really has problems to climb on a horse or on a rock for me he didn't looks very motivated as he usual do in most of his epic movies same goes to the beautiful barbara <UNK> who is playing the <UNK> daughter maybe both had troubles with the director or were unhappy with their roles <UNK> and coburn are not showing their best but they are still good if the scriptwriter had john wayne in their mind as sam <UNK> also michael parks as modern sheriff is a bit underused in his role on the other hand there is james coburn as outlaw <UNK> <UNK> coburn is a really great villain in this one he is portraying the bad guy between maniac hate and <UNK> his role and his acting is the best of the movie br br landscapes and <UNK> are terrific the shootings scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic <UNK> <UNK> and his gang had some gory and violent scenes what i miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie i would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar overall it's an entertaining western flick not a great movie but above the average because of a great coburn a very good beginning and some gory and violent scenes
<START> a complex story laid on the background of <UNK> of <UNK> an honest muslim who kidnaps an innocent <UNK> girl and an educated <UNK> who burns the <UNK> of a muslim man yet in the end you end up liking them both the story is powerful yet the screenplay and flow are <UNK> background music score and the songs are outstanding next comes memorable acting by veteran <UNK> <UNK> photography captures the time the violence and flavor of rural <UNK> very well others actors either did not act well or did not get a chance to act direction is really the weakest link the characters were not developed well not crisp in contrast to the earth where even a 5 line character leaves a mark the end is very interesting this story could have several different ending and all of them could have been equally good
<START> ho hum an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> deadly <UNK> weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands <UNK> his son luke perry has been working on the <UNK> all along enter cia agent olivia <UNK> and the cat and mouse car chases and <UNK> begins also in the cast are tom <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and an aging roger moore moore seems to <UNK> move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts perry fans will be accepting <UNK> is wrong for the role but nice to look at
<START> my friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out so when she brought home the convent a horror movie i couldn't wait to watch it given that it's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious i can say that in some weird way i like this movie br br yes the acting is bad and yes it's the <UNK> movie i've ever seen but it's so damn funny what are you smoking <UNK> rack i didn't know this movie even was ever released i figured it was too bad br br yeah so overall the movie is pretty bad you gotta admit that much at least but i promise you you will get a good laugh out of it br br this movie kinda sucks but it's good for a laugh especially that guy that holds the <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> we all have friends some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with people that you can say are like your brother or sister alice danes and <UNK> beckinsale are like that you can see that from the beginning they <UNK> together they go to parties together and they decide to go to <UNK> together when they were supposed to be going to hawaii they also get <UNK> for attempting to <UNK> drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster the rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope it also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone br br <UNK> palace is a very good film it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that i want to talk about but first i want to say what is good about the film and for starters the acting is top notch and you can look no further than the two leads danes and beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges but she seems more fun than <UNK> but sometimes that fun can get her into trouble <UNK> is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes it would have served the two girls better if her way was <UNK> to instead of <UNK> bill <UNK> is adequate as the american lawyer living in thailand the film is photographed very well also the inside of the prison while not the same as <UNK> or natural born killers or return to <UNK> but it does show the necessary but <UNK> <UNK> of the situation that they are in <UNK> <UNK> direction is quite good as well we see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day <UNK> palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive the other thing that i had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film it <UNK> and <UNK> the mood of the film to perfection the song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison you can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life and it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do we have it easy compared to some country's and believe it or not the music is a perfect <UNK> for reflection on this subject some of the music is done by a group called <UNK> i think but it is sara <UNK> wrong spelling but how do you spell her last name that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the film br br what i didn't enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit i won't say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you'll know what i am talking about also i didn't really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad it looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that <UNK> men doing time in a foreign country the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic but i didn't get that here br br overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question how far would you go for a friend that is a tough question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until put into the same situation let's just hope that it never comes down to that
<START> after you've seen this small likable and comical film you will for sure feel better cheer to <UNK> b <UNK> to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment that according to me will be recognized as a <UNK> movie of year 2004 for the <UNK> the actors isabelle <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all deliver a touching performance i would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that le <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> have given me so if you've like the jean pierre <UNK> magnificent film i would say that you should also like the first movie from <UNK> b <UNK> les <UNK>
<START> i first saw jake <UNK> in <UNK> 2005 a little while back and since then i've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just <UNK> from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some <UNK> roles he'll crack an oscar one day br br that's not to <UNK> this film at all br br it's a fine story with very believable people well it's based upon the author's early <UNK> with <UNK> a great cast  chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list  with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitement and the great sound track with so many rock n roll <UNK> to get the feet <UNK> br br but this film had a very special significance for me in 1957 i was the same age as homer <UNK> like him i looked up at the night stars to watch <UNK> as it <UNK> across the <UNK> like homer also i <UNK> with <UNK> in my backyard and used even the exact same <UNK> for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it was br br i didn't achieve his great <UNK> and physical heights though but that's what you find out when you see this movie br br sure it's a basic family movie but that's a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids you'll all have a lot of good laughs
<START> after stopping by the movie store to find something to watch we stumbled on this it looked appealing from the summary at least so we gave it a try and here's the <UNK> the first 20 minutes are interesting it's actually enjoyable oh wait spoke too soon br br somewhere in there the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental right wing christian brain <UNK> not entirely sure what happens but i think the screenplay writer found god somewhere in there finished writing this script and had no time to edit it because he had a <UNK> meeting to get to with his friends from the <UNK> church and his hood wasn't clean br br can they put <UNK> on this i refuse to support this religious idiocy much like video games have rating systems movies need some sort of symbol maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse br br unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story and will have your bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how you'll <UNK> your neighbors don't waste your time it's some of the worst junk that's come out in a very long time and the radical religious nuts don't need anymore funding
<START> i could only get through about 25 mins of it not one laugh in the 25 minutes i gave it one of the most painful films i've ever had to endure chris <UNK> is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him just a horrible movie
<START> this film really disappointed me the acting is atrocious unbelievable and it's about actors the story is incredibly obvious a group of independent actors stage a passion play and in turn they start to live out the lives of the characters they play i've been watching a lot of movies lately thanks to netflix and this is the first one i haven't watched all the way through in a long time i felt i didn't need to see the end we all know the end of this story br br for some it seems this <UNK> of the <UNK> is either <UNK> or <UNK> i cannot speak to any of this as i wasn't raised in the christian church that being said i was raised in the us and i live in an increasingly christian culture i'm curious enough about jesus and about the <UNK> of the religion for better or worse i haven't seen mel <UNK> version but i'm guessing that those who liked that one will like this except for the most conservative i just wish this was a better film br br lots of these reviews praise <UNK> direction and especially the cinematography i liked neither the film itself is rather <UNK> and preachy i didn't believe the characters' <UNK> and i was never involved with their on screen lives the play within the play is very much dated and would not i think carry it's own weight in a real time production but that's beside the point what i really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and <UNK> questions the film would like to be about and the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal br br there were two examples of this that come easily to mind firstly there is a <UNK> of the <UNK> of jesus driving the money <UNK> from the temple the lead actor who has fallen for the woman who will play <UNK> and who is also a model and dancer becomes <UNK> that she must <UNK> herself by <UNK> for a commercial with a wicked producer and plenty of <UNK> men in the audience with her pants off he <UNK> the place and chases them all out i guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach the romance between these two is entirely <UNK> and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a high school rendering of death of a salesman i e not well please stop hitting me over the head with this high handed significance the other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who eventually turns against them and betrays them to the nowadays corrupt church why why does she sleep with this guy it brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain ah the <UNK> whore and the lovable old <UNK> it seems to be just enough for <UNK> to <UNK> but not worth the trouble to <UNK> and <UNK> these characters they are going through the motions and i'm reaching for the <UNK> button br br feel free to write me off as bored jaded or just not interested feel free to watch this movie and see the passion in all its beauty sadness and inspiration delivered as an amateurish and <UNK> <UNK> feel free to have all your <UNK> ideas <UNK> and see any shred of artistic integrity <UNK> for monotonous drivel but don't say i didn't warn you
<START> another horror flick in which a goof ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over yes but the fact that this one was from canada gives it a slightly different feel the brain has <UNK> teenager jim <UNK> getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly brain can jim stop him i guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished they're entitled to make at least one ridiculous horror movie but still they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all br br the bad guy had a brain why didn't the people who made this movie
<START> credited by variety to be one of the greatest documentaries to ever come out of canada al pacino roger ebert neil simon matt dillon as well as a constant slew of <UNK> make this film a canadian classic the film is really best described as roger me meets the player watch as kenny <UNK> and <UNK> pitch their script to the big boys of hollywood called the only american film to ever come out of canada this film opened the toronto film festival in 1997 winner of the <UNK> indie film award <UNK> europe <UNK> was at the <UNK> <UNK> film fest in germany u s a <UNK> u s comedy festival <UNK> 1999 more information available at www <UNK> com
<START> clean family oriented movie i laughed i cried i loved it i was worried i wouldn't be able to see steve <UNK> as anything but goofy michael from the office boy was i wrong he should win an oscar for his performance i will definitely buy this on dvd when it comes out my husband enjoyed it and he isn't into movies of this type i saw it with 2 other couples in the 30 year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the <UNK> only 1 <UNK> word not even sure why it was <UNK> i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy drama romance and more
<START> the 60s 1999 d mark <UNK> josh hamilton julia stiles jerry <UNK> jeremy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> leonard roberts bill <UNK> annie <UNK> charles s <UNK> nbc mini series later released to video dvd as full length feature film about the <UNK> 1960s as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family the film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of <UNK> as <UNK> willie taylor and <UNK> <UNK> the storyline between the families however <UNK> character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull incoherent and downright awful 2nd half rating 4 out of 10 not rated later rated pg 13 for video dvd release
<START> i bought this dvd because it has <UNK> in it and the mpaa ratings said rated r for strong violence and sexuality nudity and language br br which correctly imo should state rated r for strong violence sexuality nudity and language br br the word sexuality should come after a <UNK> not an and because of the huge difference in meaning it make i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost non existent my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like vivid movie that is why i felt cheated story wise it was so so after all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous <UNK> was in it i know i don't br br of course this is only my opinion br br joseph
<START> watched both parts twice enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older patrick <UNK> as the hero he was very believable as the hunter alan <UNK> and certainly <UNK> the performance of richard chamberlain i do admit that i would have preferred seeing someone else as the lady in distress alison <UNK> should stick with modern and not period pieces she didn't have the look of the woman of the <UNK> the rest of the cast were terrific and followed the <UNK> very well i am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older age is inevitable but let's not hide from it a man at 50 can be much <UNK> and patrick truly is sexy then a green youth no matter how pretty <UNK> for character lines to go along with a great smile
<START> this is not so much film as big budget children's television as far as i can tell the villain is a giant <UNK> of chocolate covered <UNK> <UNK> this theory seems to be <UNK> by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as <UNK> when it's first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia i thought wow a <UNK> martial arts film but no such luck although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is <UNK> by an old man's long white <UNK> zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off that's not a good sign i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray <UNK> and <UNK> warrior princess primitive
<START> i was very disappointed with this film i expected more of a thelma and louise female buddy crime movie instead the women prison <UNK> in this flick had no sense of loyalty to one another they were an extremely vulgar pack of <UNK> who beat each other up double crossed each other and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film br br instead of being <UNK> thieves who stuck together to plan their escape and find the hidden <UNK> of money the women <UNK> were too selfish and vicious to trust each other for long these women weren't <UNK> in a positive sense they just ended up being a bunch of loose <UNK> incapable of respect for themselves or each other if you like 70s female crime caper films skip this bomb and see the great texas dynamite chase which stars <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> jones
<START> from the view of a <UNK> maniac like i am the movie is interesting you can see many race cars from 1983 even tough the racing scenes are not that much realistic but i have to admit that i haven't seen any race before 1995 because before that time they didn't show any <UNK> races in germany br br from the view of a burt reynolds fan like i am the movie basically is what we are used to see from reynolds in the 80's burt behind the wheel of a fast car like in his <UNK> movies br br if you love <UNK> and burt reynolds this movie is a must see if you only love one of this 2 things i also recommend to watch it if you like neither <UNK> nor burt reynolds you still should give it a chance but remember this movie was far away from winning an oscar academy award br br it is the typical humor of the 80's if you like movies like the <UNK> movies and police academy you will also like that one
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it's extremely boring with lots of boring dialog and has some very annoying characters and a laughable looking creature the only reason i watched this piece of garbage is because it was on that 8 disc horror set i got the plot is preposterous and totally stupid as is the finale no blood what so ever except a few bloody marks on the creature and a couple of bloody <UNK> wounds the acting is terrible richard <UNK> is terrible as the sheriff and was quite laughable plus his character is annoying <UNK> roberts is the comic relief and was not funny at all mark <UNK> is extremely annoying and was also not funny bob <UNK> is decent but not much more then that richard <UNK> is annoying and had no chemistry with <UNK> <UNK> what so ever <UNK> <UNK> is so so here and had no chemistry with richard overall avoid this piece of garbage at all costs bomb out of 5
<START> i watched this movie a couple of days ago in a small independent cinema in paris it was my last evening in the french capital and the best good bye i could have chosen these twenty episodes made me <UNK> the impressions i had <UNK> in paris in a heart warming manner without <UNK> off into <UNK> or sentimental <UNK> each episode is full of surprise strong emotions and suggestive pictures and each short film is directed according to the rules of a good short story to me this kind of movie demands a lot more talent and qualities of a director and a story board writer than any epic two hours drama and all of them succeeded in their task excellently the stories were chosen carefully with regard to their matching <UNK> and express the respective flair perfectly each episode was seen from a different <UNK> had a different topic a different style and still the twenty stories result in a <UNK> orchestra of films the most outstanding advantage with the concept of an episode movie in my opinion is based in the fact that you can switch in between a large variety of feelings and <UNK> without the danger of <UNK> just the other way round the <UNK> of sadness melancholy pure joy despair wrath anxiety curiosity or passion gives this movie a unique <UNK> and harmony and not to forget the all over topic of love love between the characters love between the characters and paris and also the love of the directors and actors actresses for this project i don't want to go into the details of the episodes since there are so many but i must highlight the range of world famous actors and actresses from all over the world and their approach to this project some played with their image some broke it completely and some interpreted the stereotypes connected with their home country or the roles they had played before so <UNK> was given all through the movie all in all i can absolutely recommend this great <UNK> and will be looking forward to its release on dvd
<START> what a pathetic movie br br i won't waste much time commenting about it i'm still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it br br let me leave it simply with <UNK> has no business being an actor or singer he is utterly without talent at both <UNK> it's a crying shame that <UNK> more talented people waste away in community theatres and <UNK> bars while <UNK> uses his name as a basketball player to <UNK> get cast in movies and cut <UNK> br br much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no talent that is <UNK>
<START> the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is beauty beauty is all around in actors' play <UNK> is superb as always in well designed shots and in <UNK> red line idea the love br br i think the <UNK> character is the only white spot in these three <UNK> otherwise boring and predictable life his interaction makes <UNK> character living as entertaining as it could possibly be when he's gone it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires br br the fact that <UNK> successfully <UNK> from this loss is nothing bad instead it shows that life <UNK> in any forms even in this small british village which is shown perfectly br br another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways all that houses and <UNK> and accents and <UNK> again is doing superb job it is a shame that this movie got such low marks 10 out of ten
<START> this almost unknown gem was based on a french farce which shows and i mean that as a compliment br br caroline lee is being <UNK> by a wealthy <UNK> <UNK> who asks her father for her hand in marriage but caroline is already married to anthony colman who has just arrived by plane and <UNK> immediately into an audience directed <UNK> about the last time caroline decided she was in love with someone else a <UNK> ish <UNK> <UNK> the film plays out the story of <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> caroline from her <UNK> and how that experience aids him with her <UNK> br br it is perfectly cast ronald colman is at his most sophisticated and charming <UNK> <UNK> is at his most <UNK> gilbert <UNK> is at his most exotic and anna lee is just deliciously whimsical the film is wonderfully directed by lewis <UNK> who also produced the whole production feels like a labor of love there are wonderful touches such as colman breaking frame and addressing the camera and exceptional use of a <UNK> bar <UNK> door it is a sin that it hasn't been released on dvd this is the kind of film that can <UNK> <UNK> interest in classic film
<START> i first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college <UNK> professor recommended it to me i was amazed that a movie from 1968 could so <UNK> and hilariously portray computer crime maggie smith is delightful and ustinov plays the retro <UNK> perfectly o <UNK> <UNK>
<START> every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie how great will be my joy br br where to begin my discussion of pain for starters there was a musical montage every five minutes there was no character development every character was a stereotype we had swearing guy fat guy who eats <UNK> goofy foreign guy etc the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation have the directors producers etc ever even seen a movie before <UNK> is getting worse and worse with every new entry the concept for this movie sounded so funny how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors but trust me when i say this things went wrong very wrong
<START> don't let the premise fool you this was one funny movie the problem it wasn't supposed to be a comedy the story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes even worse the set up is never explained you will leave the theater asking is that it i rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise but the finish leaves you completely flat nicholas cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role but he had very little to work with there are odd quirks and interesting turns everywhere which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie let this one come out on video before wasting your money
<START> you <UNK> to me 1987 is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who i have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor he has a heavy jones for taxi driver as tries to use that <UNK> to make it big when he learns the hard facts of life he does what everyone else does changes his image he goes from good <UNK> to a <UNK> up dude over night his friend can't believe the change but he scores with faith ford and <UNK> a cool paying gig can this young punk keep his street <UNK> whilst making it big br br this is a real lame movie that tries too hard to <UNK> too many things at once an interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution who knows maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers <UNK> the ball this time br br don't waste your time with this movie unless you want to see a hot faith ford and a young <UNK> from forest <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> the plot is so manipulative counting completely on the most <UNK> and <UNK> decisions of the adults in each and every <UNK> decision the children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines but as i say the whole plot depends on each and every adult being complete idiots and therefore in that case making more sense out of their actions and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total <UNK> why would <UNK> charming little boys take a baby from the shore how did the baby get to the shore and at the same time account for it being the last place to be searched why would the 2 boys never be informed an instead at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a <UNK> about them running around with food and <UNK> with all that <UNK> going on and literally every other place it searched there is just no possible justification to ask the audience to believe this asking to believe it would then do to trial even the <UNK> setting is too insulting to bare
<START> jean claude van damme plays twin brothers alex and <UNK> both whom are martial arts expert who team up to take down the <UNK> responsible for the murder of the parents in this empty headed martial arts <UNK> which doesn't have a plot that would make better use of the gimmick of having two jean claude van <UNK> some okay <UNK> but this is not one of van <UNK> best
<START> i won't add to the plot reviews it's not very good br br very improbable <UNK> on <UNK> br br cushing and lee at their height br br some nice scenery br br good for face <UNK> and i quote look at the mouth that is cassie from fools and horses br br otherwise a poor example of the british film industry br br <UNK> <UNK> was far better in <UNK> rock keith <UNK> was better in anything else and diana <UNK> did what she did best br br redeeming feature it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to <UNK> i won't be <UNK> on this effort
<START> okay the <UNK> promised a comedy and people few went to watch it being the first release of 2006 is not a bad thing or for that matter of any year because the first and last films mostly flop except <UNK> and some more br br okay coming to <UNK> <UNK> br br review in short the film is about <UNK> <UNK> doing his usual stuff sadly it's annoying this time after <UNK> it has an irritating <UNK> <UNK> and a flop <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> dialogues comedy scenes and badly handled drama and lots of <UNK> br br direction is bad <UNK> <UNK> is annoying here luckily now he is coming of age but post <UNK> and murder and some decent work in some more films the actor in him took a <UNK> and directors focused on his kisses and <UNK> image which sadly lost it's touch after <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are bad <UNK> is horrible
<START> with the rising popularity of the now iconic godzilla series like with any hit cinema event there was inevitably going to be a crowd of <UNK> trying to cash in on the success on the big lizard with godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the <UNK> giant monster genre many sought after success a few gained it one of the few that not only <UNK> but garnered popularity was gamera a giant turtle that could breathe fire in and out and fly by <UNK> flames from the <UNK> in his <UNK> as a means of jet <UNK> but unlike godzilla gamera was <UNK> as a friend to all children later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril and thus gamera became very popular amongst the <UNK> unfortunately that's about the only audience mainstream that the original gamera series will have any appeal to while the new gamera movies directed by <UNK> <UNK> are marvelous revolutionary monster movies the original series including the original is nothing special br br the first gamera movie titled in japan as the giant monster gamera was clearly a godzilla want to be even though the movie was produced in the era of color films it was shot in black and white why to imitate the first godzilla movie from the 1950s gamera also attacks tokyo because godzilla attacked tokyo in the first movie i don't know much about the japanese version for the version i am familiar with the <UNK> version where scenes were cut and new footage with american actors were inserted is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first godzilla film now whether this adds or takes away from the film i cannot say but <UNK> the <UNK> is really nothing more than a <UNK> bore that just <UNK> along like the big turtle himself br br <UNK> the <UNK> is a very routine <UNK> movie the characters are from a stock of science fiction standards the story is inane the monster has no real motive for attacking civilization the acting is laughable and so on and so forth the only thing that <UNK> it from the godzilla series is the ending of the movie but that's also a <UNK> since the plan that eventually <UNK> <UNK> rampage is completely phony and ridiculous now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description but this is a <UNK> <UNK> monster movie br br and although <UNK> <UNK> would later <UNK> gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the 1990s in the original series gamera was not an attractive screen presence he was neither scary nor sympathetic he just <UNK> around like a <UNK> <UNK> with each step and knocks <UNK> sets over as usual everybody wants to destroy gamera except for a little kid <UNK> <UNK> who was <UNK> left out of the credits though he plays a <UNK> role who thinks gamera is a nice turtle br br most movies in the genre that <UNK> the <UNK> is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure even in the company of many other godzilla <UNK> this gamera film is not a particularly good entry and as far as my cinema experience goes the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse like godzilla gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters and like godzilla he'd get cheaper and cheaper with every film until it was time to revive the series and make him serious again br br it's peculiar usually i recommend people to stick with the originals and pass on the remakes but in the case of gamera my verdict is just the opposite i strongly encourage people to watch the 1990s gamera trilogy directed by <UNK> <UNK> and to skip over the original series unless interested the new films are inventive well made exciting and above all fun the original series is a long stream of boredom
<START> william h macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without <UNK> his overbearing parents <UNK> much of the same territory as tv's the sopranos in terms of the mid life crisis of a criminal theme here too he visits a shrink but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from <UNK> i look forward to what this guy directs next an excellent script and all around great performances macy is excellent as always this is probably his best role since <UNK> donald sutherland is at his creepy best as the <UNK> father tracy <UNK> gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as <UNK> wife young david <UNK> is excellent as <UNK> bright and sensitive son many of his lines sound ad <UNK> and are wonderful even <UNK> <UNK> who i usually find <UNK> is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures <UNK> eye all of this is <UNK> by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath this film deserved a much wider release as i suspect it would have connected with audiences
<START> i've seen this film because i had do my job includes seeing movies of all kinds i couldn't stop thinking who gave money to make such an awful film and also submit it to cannes festival it wasn't only boring the actors were awful as well it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen
<START> i was <UNK> through netflix and stumbled upon this movie having fond memories of the book as a child i decided to check this out this is a movie that you should really pass on br br it is just not worth seeing it is very boring and uninteresting i feel that it would even be that way to small children it has no magic that the book contains this movie is not horrible but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it br br there are moments that just come off as weird the witch character is not very good the family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening i know this is a kids movie so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before br br the dvd that i had began skipping in the final moments of the film and instead of trying to fix it i just turned it off and sent it back to netflix i really didn't care how it finished skip this film and read the book instead
<START> i've read every book to date in the left behind series and the movie hardly does any of them justice sure i've seen worse movies but this was incredibly disappointing this movie would have made a good mst3k episode the script was a horrible adaptation of the book and it felt like the actors were reading their lines instead of actually saying them the characters were stiff and unlikeable the effects were cheesy and looked terribly fake the ending was awful first of all it didn't even go all the way through the first book second it made no sense if you hadn't read the book you'd have no idea what was going on it had to have been the most cheesy film student like ending i've ever seen in a movie i'm upset that i actually paid money for this movie if by some miracle it does get wide release they ought to totally <UNK> it and let hollywood take over those two wannabe film producers and the wannabe director should leave movie making to the professionals
<START> neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few <UNK> insist revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his <UNK> <UNK> but then nothing is more <UNK> than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew especially one using the gangster con artist movie <UNK> as might be expected from luc <UNK> name on the credits as producer there's a definite element of <UNK> de <UNK> about it set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain <UNK> it looks great has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and <UNK> style all of which mark it up as a <UNK> entertainment but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life the universe and everything if anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences a bit of <UNK> a dash of godard a lot of the principles of chess <UNK> and techniques <UNK> the screen with quotes the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of <UNK> over photos of corpses of mob victims and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie rather than a commercial for <UNK> it's really more a mixture of the <UNK> principles of <UNK> chess and confidence <UNK> that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the <UNK> accessible while hiding the film's central somewhat <UNK> con br br the last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason <UNK> takes on the enemy literally within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful <UNK> within the frame to contrast people's exterior <UNK> with their inner fear and anger but it's got a lot going for it all the same not worth starting a new religion over but i'm surprised it didn't get a us <UNK> maybe they found ray <UNK> intentionally fake <UNK> just too damn scary
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is something of a <UNK> the most tired plots <UNK> evolution come to life in his skilled hands even his occasional flop six days seven nights show signs of life and humor that make it worth viewing so i was disappointed that <UNK> could not take a fairly original plot man <UNK> superhero superhero gets <UNK> <UNK> revenge and shape it into something enjoyable girlfriend is an exercise in <UNK> the one trick <UNK> plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes the film can't decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama the result is a film the flip <UNK> between both with neither aspect being very well done uma thurman is tops as usual and luke wilson pulls off his role too though his <UNK> antics quickly grow tired what's even more <UNK> is that in certain scenes such as when a very turned on uma knocks a <UNK> through a wall you sense a witty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> practically screaming to get out but seconds later the magic is lost gone as quick as the <UNK> whose movies disappoints in almost every way
<START> this one is quite a nice surprise cute little story of the <UNK> quest very surprising <UNK> of the four eye <UNK> soon to be <UNK> type into a raunchy <UNK> cup sex queen br br visually a sight for sore eyes not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for most of the costumes and make up of the actors an unnecessary bit of <UNK> came in some ridiculous castle imitation br br back to the <UNK> the movie is <UNK> with some unusually explicit camera shots which you would not expect in a soft core loved that scene with the <UNK> absolute classics potential a slight minus only for very few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief br br 9 10 including an extra credit for the serious <UNK> effect
<START> this film is a <UNK> of punk rock fun from start to finish the ramones <UNK> <UNK> of late 70s punk rock appear as themselves <UNK> soles stars as riff <UNK> the rebellious high school girl who lives and <UNK> rock <UNK> roll riff is obsessed with writing songs for the ramones her favorite rock band she keeps the school <UNK> and encourages her fellow students to join her in her <UNK> antics br br meanwhile the school that riff <UNK> has just hired a brand new principal named ms <UNK> she's a tall <UNK> amazon of a woman and she <UNK> to make the students <UNK> the <UNK> she even has a couple of the students act as <UNK> who report back to her with dirt on their classmates ms <UNK> is especially determined to <UNK> riff and put a stop to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but riff has clever ways to foil <UNK> at every turn br br kudos to the superb performance of mary <UNK> in her role as principal <UNK> mary is a legendary b movie actress and in this film she plays the fascist ms <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> soles as riff turns in an <UNK> performance clint howard as the <UNK> <UNK> has lots of fun with his role br br the ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film and so the viewer sees why the ramones were so influential in the 70s punk rock scene certainly this is a good film for ramones fans but even if you're not into the ramones or punk rock this movie is a terrific blast literally of energetic fun
<START> utterly brilliant powerful and <UNK> the most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war it's tone offers a stark contrast to the often <UNK> ho attitude towards world war 2 that the media <UNK> rather than <UNK> for screaming about the horror of war it allows sir laurence <UNK> quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war corpses everywhere explosions terrified citizens and soldiers broken men indifferent politicians mistakes that cost thousands of lives the suffering of the <UNK> most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of <UNK> are removed there is something distinctly <UNK> about man in a true state of nature he will return to a more <UNK> form capable of crimes that will still shock and <UNK> 60 years on perhaps there could be a follow up series called the century at war for the <UNK> century was truly the century of horrors i feel it is an irony of immense <UNK> that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this
<START> i wish spike lee had chosen a different title for his film summer of sam conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer david <UNK> it's not it's a gritty <UNK> portrait of nyc street life during the hot summer of <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> that city br br the film follows several young fictional characters in an italian american neighborhood and their reactions to the son of sam threat there's <UNK> and his wife <UNK> there's <UNK> and ruby and several other characters br br the problem is that these characters are not likable they are <UNK> annoying and at times unbearable lee then <UNK> their high energy chaotic lives which are filled with anger lust and general turmoil there are at least two <UNK> fight scenes between <UNK> and his wife redundant disco dance scenes countless <UNK> over and over i kept wondering where's the film editor br br meanwhile with all that bulk the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread <UNK> from the son of sam menace which is too much in the background lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace that <UNK> from neighborhood vigilante groups br br the acting is uniformly good that combined with 70's disco music and lavish attention to costumes and production design make you really feel like you are in an italian american neighborhood in nyc in 1977 br br the film's atmospheric authenticity however is not nearly enough to <UNK> a rambling overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people
<START> to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible every <UNK> of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid fire images through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero but every frame is real the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york jules 28 and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> day want to make a documentary on new york city <UNK> beginning with a <UNK> from the academy and follow him through the nine month <UNK> period to full <UNK> <UNK> seeking the help of their close friend actor james <UNK> <UNK> an actor and <UNK> at station 1 engine 7 the <UNK> <UNK> through the <UNK> at the academy and find one tony <UNK> to focus the bulk of their documentary on br br tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close <UNK> family <UNK> have a <UNK> about <UNK> it is that they are either white clouds or black clouds meaning that with the latter all kinds of fires follow the <UNK> the former means that very little fire activity follows but one day there will be the mother of all fires tony is a white cloud after some initial growing pains tony <UNK> into the <UNK> as if he were a seasoned vet then the <UNK> occurs br br september 11 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas <UNK> not far from wall street because jules has had little camera experience <UNK> hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief t k pfeiffer arriving at about 8 <UNK> the <UNK> begin to use their gas <UNK> over a <UNK> then the sudden <UNK> of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene and as jules pans <UNK> we see the first strike of the day american <UNK> flight 11 <UNK> into the face of the north tower of 1 world trade pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center once there jules asks to <UNK> the chief into the tower pfeiffer tells <UNK> to stick close to him once inside the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives br br <UNK> <UNK> decides to leave the <UNK> and walk down to the impact area once there he captures the impact of the second plane united <UNK> flight <UNK> with 2 world trade he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers watching and capturing the <UNK> reaction to the <UNK> <UNK> begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan inside tower one jules records the last view the world or loved ones will have of their sons fathers <UNK> <UNK> husbands boyfriends friends as one by one each <UNK> carrying 60 <UNK> of equipment begin the long <UNK> climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother kevin as he leaves to do his <UNK> duty also caught on video is the <UNK> sound of falling bodies hitting <UNK> from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact <UNK> sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke but jules is <UNK> never once does he capture a <UNK> moment the money shot his work is professional through his <UNK> of fire he also catches the sight of <UNK> falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the <UNK> <UNK> civilians from the building then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken father michael judd the <UNK> for the fire department then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the <UNK> of the collapse of tower two tower one begins its <UNK> collapse br br what results is a <UNK> poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and <UNK> work <UNK> to document that day not knowing if either is alive each <UNK> the worst as each <UNK> arrives at the <UNK> they <UNK> each other with <UNK> <UNK> at having made it back and in one moment of overwhelming emotion jules and <UNK> are reunited as jules cries on his brother's shoulder <UNK> <UNK> his younger brother as <UNK> makes the filmmakers the subject there is one <UNK> moment when tony <UNK> who left the station with a former chief is believed to have been lost but returns to the <UNK> this <UNK> has <UNK> himself br br shown with only three <UNK> 9 11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking it ranks up there with the <UNK> footage in showing history as it unfolds the <UNK> are to be <UNK> for their <UNK> handling of the subject in lesser hands the tendency would be toward the sensational but the <UNK> temper their eye toward dignity and compassion narrated by <UNK> we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september 11 robert de niro <UNK> the program in a <UNK> restrained way he never seeks the camera for his own glory rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see i also <UNK> cbs for their bravery at airing this special <UNK> for their attempt at grabbing ratings they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who <UNK> this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true <UNK> is it isn't about <UNK> a basketball or selling an album of hate lyrics 9 11 is about humanity at its best <UNK> at its finest and the cost of freedom br br
<START> this is probably my favorite movie of all time it is perfection in its storytelling it will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through you feel for <UNK> because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time
<START> some things need to be <UNK> the picture of mark <UNK> is not the mark <UNK> who starred in this movie i know that because he was my dad please remove that picture also mark <UNK> was the writer at least one of them i have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again it has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of <UNK> a copy that would be great the movie wasn't all that bad and trying to compare it to todays world of star wars and other high tech sci <UNK> it <UNK> if you watch it just enjoy it for the <UNK> and humor it possesses <UNK> up on being movie <UNK> and enjoy some less creative and <UNK> films
<START> the fully rounded character of the principal role of this movie that of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self destruction so clear to the viewer is unique for its time 1950 br br along with the haunting music and the well written plot the film is a prime example of film noir at its best close ups of <UNK> eyes reveal the anguish within karl malden excels as his boss who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the <UNK> br br otto preminger made this type of movie just about his own if there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of gene tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop their scenes in the <UNK> however are wonderful and ring true br br tom <UNK> in the bit part of her father is perfect as is gary <UNK> as the hood great lighting and mood setting the building where the deadly deeds take place highly atmospheric i love the old woman in the basement br br 8 out of 10
<START> this movie had the potential to be far more than it was but it not only fails to deliver it brings up <UNK> self righteous preaching at the same time br br john cusack is even <UNK> than he was in midnight of the garden of good and evil the difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent which he <UNK> loses several times each scene br br al pacino does his <UNK> but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck he's good as usual but hardly standout br br supporting cast throw in female romantic interest which added little if anything to the story speaking of the story a convoluted who really cares tale where cusack is the self righteous <UNK> boy who just has to search for the right thing to be done br br people don't act this way <UNK> character loses all credibility at the end of which without revealing it is <UNK> and <UNK> the final scene makes the <UNK> silliness seem profound it's also completely inaccurate but i won't get into law br br this is a bad by the numbers movie it seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a preachy <UNK> self righteous film for the last hour better off with mindless crap than this pile of junk
<START> the odd couple 3 outta 5 stars br br like most people i will always feel that jack <UNK> and tony randall are the definitive odd couple their incredible work on the tv series from the early to mid 70s was a <UNK> mark for television at the time easily <UNK> the stage and screen versions of the tale nonetheless how can you go wrong with a jack lemmon walter matthau pairing matthau is in especially good form as oscar the <UNK> lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as felix particularly if you have previously seen tony <UNK> outstanding performance the script is good definitely neil simon's best i will go on record here as stating that neil simon is probably one of the worst most over rated <UNK> of american theatre the storyline is simple felix a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with oscar the <UNK> who needs some help saving money for <UNK> <UNK> their living <UNK> becomes much like a marriage as well culminating in some amusing <UNK> and <UNK> lots of fun and some great one liners
<START> i think i agree that a lot of the comments here must be fake even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average dark remains is basically a ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you the movie starts off already with 2 stories loosely inter <UNK> which even later are not tied together a couple loses its child which is found <UNK> in its bed they move to a country house to flee their past and guess what the house is haunted kind of from here on dark remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed the first ghost appearances are nice and the <UNK> sequence also worked very good ok then woman sees ghost of daughter other ghosts of people died in <UNK> or <UNK> appear man tries to solve secret of houses past woman gets depressed strange neighbors appear its pretty much all been there but the premise of it being their own emotions is nice so you wait for the twist there is no twist you are just confused by a haunted house history story the strange neighbor a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter thrown together with a photo idea reminding me a lot of the <UNK> the end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie this slow and with piano music its pretty lame to include some <UNK> of ghosts at once which look like a zombie flick of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music br br to make it short dark remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script was not trying to go everywhere and arriving nowhere too many stories <UNK> together which just don't make any sense and <UNK> in the basic atmosphere of the movie and beside please never use abandoned <UNK> again its so worn off and in this case it even makes no sense at all hey there is this creepy prison <UNK> lets shoot there i guess a lot of ingredients in dark remains were thrown in the mix like this
<START> this is one of the first films i can remember or maybe the first one exactly the beautiful kind of film than introduce a kid <UNK> into the world of violence and <UNK> were we live a little bit of babe casino and <UNK> all this well mixed into a <UNK> and we get this i don't know if its truly rated for kids but i think it was very cool very funny and interesting i hate when a film <UNK> a <UNK> can have a good end and its ruining because every character must have a happy end even if it sounds weird im not a bitter person but this was ok he simply goes heaven and they let it in that way br br all this is just a critic its a good movie an something new very touching and i gotta go
<START> i love and admire the <UNK> brothers how come i only got to see this great movie 3 years after it's release it made me laugh it made me cry and it <UNK> <UNK> my heart big time it's hard to describe in my rotten english but i have to try anyway br br the cast is excellent throughout from the lead to the supporting roles the acting is great the dialogs are great and the film is perfectly directed and edited br br i think that the <UNK> brothers movies are often <UNK> they are not light comedies they're <UNK> they talk about what life is all about i won't tell you br br in my case this movie <UNK> to me what relationships are all about br br if you love somebody set them free let them be try to share the passion and the pain and always be true to each other br br i'm not a sports <UNK> but definitely a sports ignorant but in this movie the <UNK> get you i could smell the atmosphere of baseball finally this movie explained to me what being a sports fan can mean to you and what cool fan families there must be out there br br thanks so much pete bob br br p s if you haven't seen it please check out <UNK>
<START> version universal hong kong legends <UNK> dvd release <UNK> english subtitles br br once upon a time five years ago the world was obsessed with 'the <UNK> and i was perhaps one of the few fifteen year olds left who still believed that <UNK> was better than <UNK> i was but a simple teenage boy looking for a good action movie and then there was a shining light on a tv station i had never really watched a little station known as <UNK> one night i noticed in the tv guide that a movie starring jackie chan <UNK> <UNK> would be on later being fifteen and having only seen <UNK> in the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i said wow awesome and sat down to watch it and continually <UNK> wow awesome as the movie progressed two weeks later after <UNK> had shown the <UNK> <UNK> trilogy i knew i had found my new favourite actor br br jackie plays chan <UNK> <UNK> a hong kong cop who <UNK> a major drug lord <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> secretary <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lin is being held by the police as a witness against <UNK> and chan is assigned to protect her things go bad <UNK> bad when <UNK> case is <UNK> and he decides he wants <UNK> and chan dead br br <UNK> <UNK> is one of the greatest action movies ever and certainly one of my favourite jackie chan films it starts off strong and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed everything in between is great however some of the funny parts may seem a little tasteless to more than a few people br br as a story this is still one of <UNK> better efforts for an action movie the story is pretty good and jackie is a much better actor in this than he is in the acting plot <UNK> <UNK> police <UNK> this isn't <UNK> but maybe that's a good thing br br <UNK> <UNK> is one of <UNK> finest works it got me hooked on jackie chan movies and should provide a nice start for any potential jackie fans the bad news for anyone who sees this first is that jackie chan movies don't come much better 10 10
<START> steve mcqueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there he certainly was a charismatic fellow one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew but even mcqueen can't save this turkey of a film shot with what looks like a <UNK> camera in the actual locations in st louis br br <UNK> a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang there's more than a broad hint that there's a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke he's not liked at all by the other heist members mainly because of his lack of criminal resume br br steve also has a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something <UNK> especially when he starts hanging around with <UNK> <UNK> and james <UNK> as well as clarke all pretty rough characters that would certainly get my <UNK> <UNK> br br the great st louis bank robbery had two directors charles <UNK> and john <UNK> <UNK> did mostly documentaries and <UNK> didn't do much of anything one of those two <UNK> decided <UNK> performance was best served by doing a bad marlon brando imitation br br this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen i'm willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because i can't believe they would have if they saw this br br or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey
<START> this is a terrible remake of a <UNK> but well liked movie from the early 70's i have seen the original at least 6 times the 1997 version is a 20 minute movie <UNK> into 2 hours or whatever the runtime is cheesy storyline which by the way is completely different than the original the major government involvement was far fetched there is no flow from one scene to the next in the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up br br it only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car it takes many times longer than that in real life car guys notice this stuff also the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 <UNK> and abuse a 1970 <UNK> should be shot in the <UNK> with a dull bullet the fact they aren't <UNK> <UNK> is painfully obvious and their passing will not be <UNK> br br the actors lacked any emotion everything was cut and <UNK> one step above a <UNK> a <UNK> is more exciting and energetic br br last but surely not least the radio dj made the statement that the <UNK> hit the <UNK> at <UNK> or <UNK> that is total garbage can you say <UNK> or lack thereof <UNK> this movie is a joke don't waste your time watching this one
<START> the only thing great about the movie is its title in this case snake on a plane is example of not judging the book by its cover the title says nothing about the movie when i went to the theater i wasn't expecting citizen kane i was expecting independence day a movie that's pure popcorn fun but instead i got that horrible roy liotta movie called <UNK> yes this is how bad soap is the only thing make soap better is its title and it's not even the <UNK> title for the movie the wasn't even a glimpse of snake or plane 40 minutes into the movie what a false advertising if it wasn't for its title soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b grade summer movie and the r rating it has to be the most <UNK> r rated movie of all time the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r all of the violence are kept pg 13 level you know what's really r rated the r rated superstar edge see him at <UNK> instead of waste your money on a snake
<START> this movie is absolutely pointless one of the good <UNK> how <UNK> <UNK> never got one decent role after clockwork orange this one may be one of the worst though no story crappy special effects shot in 4 3 or even worse <UNK> on dvd just avoid it
<START> being a fan of silent films i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time i was pretty disappointed br br as has been mentioned the film seems to be one long long commercial for the <UNK> <UNK> br br perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is i may have enjoyed the film more but it got old very fast and while i recognize that reality is stretched many times in films without <UNK> a viewer's enjoyment what was with the mexican <UNK> i mean they are chasing a car through the mountains a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour yet they can't catch up to it
<START> supposedly a social commentary on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970's nightmare is full of bad southern stereotypes complete with <UNK> accents not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most american <UNK> this <UNK> piece of work comes off as just a <UNK> disguised babe in prison movie especially in its uncut original version nevertheless acting is generally above average and the late chuck <UNK> in particular does a good job of making viewers hate him even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes there's also a change of pace role for the late robert reed who appears as the <UNK> warden and tina louise previously ginger of <UNK> island made a rather believable sadistic prison guard my grade d br br
<START> the straight story is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named alvin straight who rides his <UNK> across the country to visit his estranged dying brother but that's just the basic <UNK> this movie is about so much more than that this was <UNK> <UNK> last role before he died and it's definitely one that he will be remembered for he's a stubborn old man not unlike a lot of the old men that you and i probably know br br the straight story is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives it will reach down and touch some part of you at least if you have a heart it will
<START> psychotic <UNK> <UNK> murders the patient angie dickinson of a prominent doctor michael caine and then <UNK> the high <UNK> prostitute nancy allen who caught a glimpse of <UNK> in the elevator liz allen comes under suspicion of the crime and teams up with the <UNK> son keith gordon to catch the killer br br it can be summed up in a couple of words it's very sexy dickinson and allen look great it's very bloody with the kind of gore usually reserved for splatter movies and boy is it well crafted writer director de palma's script is ok but it really takes a <UNK> to the man's film making abilities it is highly successful on a visceral level and i actually get involved interested with these characters i can notice the standard de palma <UNK> to <UNK> of hitchcock at least from one of the <UNK> pictures br br and to top it all off it has a professional and believable cast br br this was de palma's third movie with ex wife nancy allen after carrie and home movies br br by the way dancer turned actress rachel <UNK> was one of the production <UNK> there's a bit of trivia for you br br i wouldn't think a thriller could be classy and bloody at the same time but this picture pulls it off br br one of the best things about it is a typically striking <UNK> <UNK> music score br br 8 10
<START> terrible film with frank sinatra as tony rome here he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea br br rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman naturally it's the woman below the sea her room mate <UNK> kazan soon winds up dead on the floor br br an aging richard <UNK> plays a police officer and friend of rome when a local club owner gets killed the blame falls on rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene that's how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action br br <UNK> welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue her acting leads a lot to be desired br br martin <UNK> is a retired <UNK> whose son is trying to <UNK> him br br by the film's end you don't know why the girl was murdered don't even bother to ask
<START> laid up and drugged out as a <UNK> stone <UNK> its merry way through my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with absolutely nothing better to do than let the <UNK> <UNK> me into semi oblivion i happened to catch this movie on cable i wouldn't want anyone to think that i paid to view it in a cinema or rented it or  heaven <UNK>  that i watched it straight br br having played this <UNK> gruesome video game and <UNK> <UNK> the doomed rooms and dread <UNK> of the house battling <UNK> type 27 the <UNK> man type <UNK> and other impossible <UNK> my curiosity was <UNK> as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen br br it doesn't br br the banal plot revolves around a group of crazy kids  a la scooby doo  attending a remote island for a world shaking rave  whatever that is you kids today with your <UNK> <UNK> and your mini <UNK> and your pat <UNK> after <UNK> a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there a stupidity which begs its own network of <UNK> they find the rave deserted br br passing mention is made of a house  presumably the titular house of the dead  but most of the action takes place on fake <UNK> sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted <UNK> br br a fallen video camera acts as flashback filler showing the island in the <UNK> of a  party is that it oh so this rave <UNK> is just a party in the grand tradition of re <UNK> used cars as pre owned or shell shock as post traumatic stress disorder the word party is now too square for you drug <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br it is learned that the party was broken up by <UNK> zombies intelligent thought stops <UNK> br br i don't think the <UNK> who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the <UNK> behind zombie re animation zombies can't die  they're already un dead they do not bleed they know no pain unless their bodies are completely <UNK> they will continue being animated at least that's what my <UNK> witch <UNK> tells me br br which means that a 45 shot into their hearts is not going to stop them nor will a <UNK> to the <UNK> and a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly not bring forth <UNK> of blood at least in the video <UNK> logic the <UNK> <UNK> so many rounds into each monster that it is completely <UNK> leaving a <UNK> <UNK> that cannot re <UNK> itself br br yet each actor slash model gets their matrix <UNK> camera moment <UNK> zombies on all <UNK> with single bullets and karate chops to the <UNK> seriously these zombies are more <UNK> than the <UNK> from return of the jedi who get knocked out when ewoks trip them br br i suppose the film's writer mark altman having penned the not too <UNK> free enterprise felt compelled to insert a captain kirk reference in the character of <UNK> <UNK> who must have needed milk money desperately to have <UNK> to appearing in this <UNK> dung <UNK> there is also a reference to <UNK> <UNK> role in the magnificent <UNK> boot when one of the <UNK> b actors mentions that he looks like a u boat captain i wonder how many of this movie's target audience of square eyed <UNK> picked up on any of the <UNK> references to other films as when <UNK> declares say hello to my little friend <UNK> his machine gun moment br br aimed at a <UNK> who have not the <UNK> to comprehend the <UNK> <UNK> of the video game concept i e the game ends when you die  you cannot win this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart <UNK> everyone dies in due course except for a <UNK> pair of attractive white people br br a better use for this film's <UNK> yet <UNK> budget might have been to send the cast through acting school although <UNK> <UNK> left breast did a good job as did her right breast  and those <UNK> running scenes priceless i especially liked the final scene with <UNK> trying to act like she's been stabbed but looking like she's just eaten ice cream too fast br br attempting to do something more <UNK> with my time i pulled out my <UNK> restored <UNK> <UNK> special edition widescreen <UNK> dvd of <UNK> the hands of fate ah yes  the drugs were suitably brain numbing now here was some quality film <UNK> br br movie <UNK> visit www <UNK> com

<START> for starters i didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet i have not once seen it on tv before in my country and a lot of people do not usually know about this show it is a pity though because this is easily the most original and clever animation i have witnessed in years br br i don't hand out 10 points a lot but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids show though when the complete story unfolds itself you know that this is a real deep storyline with a spiritual message this spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit animals a old indian believe that has been <UNK> for many years this gives the show a original twist that you can't often find in animated shows br br the overall design is also something very different at times it resembles <UNK> a bit in terms of gritty design and other times it takes on a more <UNK> approach i believe david <UNK> who also created and directed cow and chicken animated a segment in the show as he also drew that segment in the comic br br if you are looking for a mind <UNK> show a show that takes on various subjects such as reality suicide <UNK> life then this is something you should not miss once you begin watching you are probably going to watch it to the end one minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic but this is not too annoying the only question remains though where is the dvd
<START> i'll make this short and sweet this movie sucked br br i watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever gave it 9 out of 10 stars so i thought perhaps part 2 and 3 would be good sequels i was wrong this movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one it had the plot continue and thats it it was like bad <UNK> from part one or something br br i love walken but i felt sorry for him here i was so happy about glenn <UNK> being in this film but don't blink you'll miss him there was a full cast full of crappy actors and people i don't like such as eric roberts and jennifer <UNK> however it was a breath of fresh air to see ethan <UNK> he's one of the funniest people on earth br br this movie will make you like the first one a little less so don't watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself being a fan of part 1 i am gonna wait a few days before i watch part 3 and i pray it is better than this crap br br the last scene of the movie with the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film fast forward or skip to that if you can't stomach the first part br br 1 out of 10 stars this was awful
<START> 10 items or less was made in two weeks on a <UNK> budget by writer director brad <UNK> just a little film shot in carson <UNK> that feels like the entire story was improvised in the best sense of the word <UNK> had the good fortune to pair veteran actor morgan freeman in between his big projects with spanish actress paz vega and the result is a dialogue between two people from different <UNK> who manage to enhance the life of the other br br morgan freeman plays himself yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years <UNK> a location for a little <UNK> <UNK> to get back into the flow of things his <UNK> is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in carson where he encounters among others one scarlet the girl at the <UNK> 10 items or less <UNK> line not only is scarlet tired of her static job she is also generally angry about her <UNK> husband bobby <UNK> currently sleeping with <UNK> lazy co worker anne <UNK> and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere the two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a <UNK> <UNK> that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other br br it is a simple story simply told but because of the tender bonding between freeman and paz it works very well this is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message it is well worth viewing and this is a dvd that has <UNK> that are touching informative and comic a pleasure to view grady <UNK>
<START> you like to solve mysteries you like complex <UNK> this is for you brilliant clever movie by francis <UNK> son of a legendary french canadian <UNK> felix <UNK> flashy photo and clever editing is the word of <UNK> strongly helped by roy <UNK> who's <UNK> in the lead role br br the plot is about alexandre <UNK> <UNK> in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being <UNK> by somebody unknown <UNK> is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a <UNK> <UNK> on the road throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him br br not spooky but very mysterious and well played movie i have my <UNK> on the ending i think the indian caused the accident but this ending was open to any explanations br br i strongly recommend it 9 5 10
<START> this film deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy while i found that world morally repulsive the film did best what storytelling should do and that is take us through an experience that we would otherwise never <UNK> tim meadows so convincingly portrays leon <UNK> and the story so drew me into the reckless world of leon that i <UNK> forgot that i was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against it <UNK> lies the film's <UNK> because its great and bold achievement in storytelling comes at the price of its own success understanding that the vast majority of <UNK> will respond only to the story of this film that lies on the surface and reject that story i hesitate to be misunderstood by them and admit that i loved it i loved it not only for its fascinating insights into the <UNK> mind of the playboy not only for its amusing portrayal of the idiocy of the human sex drive but also for its courage to <UNK> explore what is in the shadows of <UNK> besides it's just funny
<START> i watched part one two days ago and today i saw part two of course the two parts are worlds apart so i am a little <UNK> by all that i just saw i felt consumed by the knowledge of the <UNK> of che's death for me it <UNK> the entire movie i suppose that is exactly what soderbergh wanted us to feel the slowly <UNK> <UNK> of his death part two was so downbeat compared to again an <UNK> but in cuba it was positive and in bolivia it was so negative the politics of the movement in bolivia were only <UNK> to but rarely confronted <UNK> for me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film the confrontation with the <UNK> and the <UNK> talk with the <UNK> official where that official questions che about the failure of the <UNK> to support his revolution i had not considered the national differences playing as much role as they did in the conflict <UNK> versus <UNK> i thought soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle how do you get food without <UNK> the <UNK> who do not have enough themselves i was struck by how hard it would be to try something as che tried i guess it is all in the timing is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement in bolivia there wasn't che realized the terrible <UNK> of <UNK> in his letter to <UNK> read at the beginning of the film if not now when 50 years from now a very thought provoking and well done film make every effort to see it
<START> i'll tell you what happened some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on tv did we really need a big screen re make did they ask the fans i wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of rocky horror picture show with actors like <UNK> <UNK> steve martin britney spears and <UNK> <UNK> took out all the music and made it a drama do you think they would like that this movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had sure the original was a bit corny at times but bo and luke were always nice they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble and their main objective was to help people that passed through town none of that <UNK> to the people that made this film they might have never even seen the original show all the way through my big question is what will they ruin next
<START> sure for it's super imagery and awesome sound it's a great home theater show off <UNK> but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary the parallel stories that are <UNK> throughout this film will keep all viewers interested young old boys and girls alike will find that deep down we are all fans of the <UNK> especially the high performance <UNK> machines that are the result of generations blood sweat tears <UNK> and <UNK> the mark <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content i don't want to give away the ending but the final driving sequence to <UNK> jones' days like these just might bring a tear to your eye enjoy it
<START> one word can describe this movie and that is weird i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting well it was the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not very strange if you are a fan of animation science fiction you might want to check this out
<START> i'm sorry but even <UNK> <UNK> adrian <UNK> couldn't save this sequel i went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene notice that this is the only movie that patricia <UNK> directs and i sadly realized they were trying to be serious i did get a kick out of the fact that the <UNK> gang having lost their <UNK> due to their gambling <UNK> in the original grease were forced to use <UNK> in the second movie being <UNK> by that <UNK> character <UNK> i'd hate to see what they would resort to later maybe <UNK> br br i also never bought the hackneyed theme hunky australian boy can't fit into <UNK> dominated school <UNK> goes for tough guy with stupid biker helmet look it was disney story gone horribly awry br br so it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubble <UNK> <UNK> michelle pfeiffer in a musical the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it
<START> return to the <UNK> chamber is one of those classic kung fu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood and the protagonist gordon liu the counterpart to the <UNK> clint eastwood <UNK> <UNK> and a new print made for the fantastic film fest this is presented in shaw scope just like the good old days br br this film is a simple story of good versus evil told in 3 acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era br br act one sets up the premise workers in a <UNK> mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their <UNK> cut by 20 by <UNK> <UNK> gangsters they can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss at first they had a minor success in getting liu to <UNK> a highly skilled shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their <UNK> got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by <UNK> one too many times br br act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob however without real martial arts he <UNK> on a journey to shaolin temple to try and <UNK> and learn martial arts on the sly after some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the <UNK> whom he <UNK> but is disappointed at the teaching methods kinda like mr <UNK> style in karate kid but instead of painting <UNK> he gets to <UNK> <UNK> all around the temple nothing can keep a good man down and he <UNK> builds strength <UNK> and learns kung fu the <UNK> way br br act three is where the fight fest begins with cheesy sound effects each obvious non contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide <UNK> shots to highlight clarity and detail between the <UNK> partners and the use of slow motion only to showcase stunts in different angles you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his style being used ad <UNK> in hollywood flicks they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to return to the <UNK> chamber gets a repeat screening on monday so if you're game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for
<START> badly directed garbage a mediocre <UNK> sadistic <UNK> if you are the sort of person who likes that see a shrink even if you are that person it doesn't make this a good film the acting is really poor the story full of plot holes the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one i can see why people dislike uwe boll we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them which is really sad a complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just <UNK> horror films can be full of <UNK> they can be <UNK> works of art they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on seed is just really really poor
<START> the biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of <UNK> hannah rather than playing the stereotypical <UNK> blonde roles that she usually does she plays a street smart intelligent world weary character she doesn't have a huge role but she does a great job portraying lois <UNK> as a woman tired of although used to covering up for her <UNK> <UNK>
<START> one of the comedies of the 1970's also has the best signature tune of any comedy show the story is about three people sharing a flat living above their <UNK> george and mildred the comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing a man and two women richard <UNK> sullivan is <UNK> with paula <UNK> its played in a gentle and not a <UNK> way which is why this show was such a success br br the scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and <UNK> frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm the end titles contained visual jokes which went <UNK> in the early 1970's but concerned the flat <UNK> living <UNK>
<START> i used to love watching this i had no idea it was part of a larger series i must have been 6 or so at the time it was on tv i just thought it was funny and for some reason i had a deep fascination for something that was clear that was in the <UNK> pile of <UNK> toys my parents had taped this off of tv when it originally aired on nbc the tape even had the old <UNK> coffee commercial along with a few others i'm planning on returning home sometime soon and will try to record the tape onto my computer so that those who want a copy can do so if anyone of you would like to contact me i think you can do that through the imdb site feel free i will keep you updated and let you know when i have the show in a digital format
<START> this movie was heavily marred by the presence of steven seagal or as i should say steven so dull like before seagal is either too good or too stupid to re dub his own lines leaving someone to <UNK> his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be <UNK> a few films before this was he has done this too but i don't think to this extent to be honest the film looks pretty good the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie of course all told this film is pretty bad br br it would have been much better without seagal who has become a cartoon of himself don't bother anything over a buck for this one is too much i honestly think this is the last time for me and a seagal film what's taken me so long to realize this
<START> the <UNK> is one of <UNK> <UNK> most <UNK> books but in this animated adaptation the magic just isn't there this version remains pretty faithful to <UNK> original story so one can't lay the blame on john <UNK> script if anything the fault lies with the <UNK> animation the <UNK> pace and the generally <UNK> voice overs one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy vibrant fun filled movie instead the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a <UNK> classic br br young orphan sophie voice of amanda root lives in a none too friendly <UNK> under the cruel <UNK> of mrs <UNK> one evening she is <UNK> through the window when she spots a massive figure walking <UNK> down the village street the figure realises it has been seen so it reaches in through the window and <UNK> sophie from her bed placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country and fears that he will eat her but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the <UNK> voice of david jason the <UNK> refuses to eat people instead <UNK> himself to foul <UNK> <UNK> known as <UNK> however giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast every night as it happens on poor unsuspecting humans sophie and the <UNK> become great friends and soon they come up with a plan to <UNK> the other giants together they go to the queen of england voice of angela <UNK> with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man eating giants the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else br br jason voices the <UNK> quite well one of the few <UNK> in the film but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired with very little to bring the characters to life similarly the <UNK> is the only character that is <UNK> animated sophie lacks appeal and the giants are <UNK> designed and look almost <UNK> from each other even the places are <UNK> giant country especially comes up short being nothing more than a <UNK> <UNK> with occasional rocks and <UNK> at <UNK> minutes the film is not exactly lengthy yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the <UNK> handling of several sequences little of <UNK> mischievous humour is conveyed <UNK> one chapter in the book deals with the <UNK> love of <UNK> <UNK> and is laugh out loud hilarious in the film the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling i came to the the <UNK> expecting lots of <UNK> fun and enjoyment but what i got was pretty much the opposite this one is a failed misfire that simply doesn't match the <UNK> of the book in any department unfortunately therefore it must go down as one to skip
<START> this movie is a great <UNK> it follows the rap group <UNK> made up of ice cold tasty taste and tone <UNK> through their unique path to gangster rap <UNK> <UNK> and back to <UNK> through trouble with women <UNK> cops and <UNK> this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world as this movie goes to the top of <UNK> i know <UNK> favorite <UNK> is this is spinal tap for very good reason however i think that if in the right mood this movie is simply better the laughs never end even for someone not into the rap culture br br i'm a white guy that has no interest in rap music culture or anything else associated with it however i love this movie rusty <UNK> who wrote the screenplay songs and starred in it showed great potential and it is a shame that i haven't seen him since fear of a black hat however i have seen him one more time than you have and is that that i recommend fear of a black hat to you for quick laughs br br remember don't shoot to you see the whites of their eyes no don't shoot to you see the whites br br <UNK> and enjoy the movie
<START> my mother took me to see this film as a child and i long to see it every year as i do all of my other christmas favorites what i remember most was the silly devil and santa looking through his <UNK> i waited and looked through the t v guide each year after that to see when it would be shown i would usually find it playing on a saturday afternoon i only found the movie in english which took something special away from the film and have <UNK> to find a copy of it in spanish i hold this film dear to my heart and have never suffered from nightmares as others might suggest yes it is a different film about santa claus and that is what makes it special and unique i can't wait to get a copy of this film and watch it with my children as i explain to them my favorite parts and memories
<START> <UNK> but <UNK> and <UNK> mob boss <UNK> an excellent performance by richard dreyfuss gets released from a mental hospital several of <UNK> fellow criminal <UNK> who include <UNK> henchman <UNK> balls ben london a <UNK> manic and over the top hammy portrayal by gabriel <UNK> the smarmy jake parker a perfectly smug kyle <UNK> and vicious rival wacky <UNK> jackson a neat turn by burt reynolds all try to <UNK> <UNK> off meanwhile laid back and self assured hit man mickey <UNK> nicely played with low key confidence by jeff goldblum finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly <UNK> writer director larry bishop brings a <UNK> hip quirky and original <UNK> sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch black comedy about betrayal loyalty and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok the bang up cast have a field day with the <UNK> grotesque <UNK> gallery of <UNK> amoral and <UNK> <UNK> ellen <UNK> as tough <UNK> <UNK> rita <UNK> henry <UNK> as <UNK> reliable right hand man sleepy joe <UNK> gregory hines as philosophical <UNK> jules <UNK> diane lane as <UNK> sweet <UNK> mistress grace billy <UNK> as the slimy wells and christopher jones as <UNK> rub out artist nicholas <UNK> bishop makes the most of his <UNK> secondary role as lethal and <UNK> ace assassin nick popping up in nifty bits are billy idol as a <UNK> thug michael j <UNK> as the ill <UNK> red joey bishop as <UNK> mr <UNK> rob <UNK> as a jolly <UNK> and richard <UNK> as jimmy the <UNK> <UNK> delightfully insane <UNK> with singer paul <UNK> on my way rates as a definite <UNK> highlight a tense and amusing climactic mexican stand off likewise <UNK> the funny bone something hysterical frank <UNK> slick cinematography the outrageously nutty dialogue earl <UNK> <UNK> cocktail <UNK> score and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden <UNK> all further enhance the <UNK> peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one of a kind <UNK>
<START> this movie was one of the greatest movies ever made it had everything to make a movie great incredible acting awesome special effects oh wait i must be thinking of a good movie well this wasn't one of them it just plain sucked br br what i want to know is what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10 when i casted my vote there were <UNK> out there god knows what goes on in their head now as for any other vote a 8 or 9 was even too high but a 10 come on what made this movie <UNK> good to give it a 10 i know these are the same <UNK> that thought that jean claude van damme is a great dramatic actor
<START> in the immediate aftermath following world war ii sound minds in hollywood tried to distance themselves from the mindless flag waving that is a natural <UNK> in a war effort best years of our <UNK> and even <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the way americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war but <UNK> <UNK> pride of the marines beat them to it br br the film is about philadelphia smart alec john garfield who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a <UNK> with japanese soldiers <UNK> crying out at him and his buddies <UNK> tonight you die he is <UNK> by a hand <UNK> and <UNK> his girlfriend back home rather than have to depend on her after coming home br br <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> in his depiction on these men who are brave as it were almost by coincidence they are there in the <UNK> and when shot at they react so much for <UNK> but they get the job done and then comes the self pity the dark gloomy sense of humor garfield is in angry denial of his <UNK> and the film makes no excuses there's no free candy for anyone in this world as his buddy tells him the same guy a jew played by <UNK> clark reminds him in a war somebody gets it and you're it everybody's got problems when i get back some guys won't hire me because my name is diamond br br great movies are made with guts like these and if the first half hour of <UNK> of the <UNK> fails to rise to the occasion completely from then on it <UNK> into a true work of art you <UNK> and you <UNK> you <UNK> and you hope against hope well simply art br br
<START> this film is something like a sequel of white zombie since it is made by the same man <UNK> and features zombies <UNK> the george a romero of his day fails to deliver with this one though br br we have a man who can control the minds of people in cambodia and a search to destroy the source of his power so the zombies can be sent free also a love interest for the evil man br br where this film really excels is in the imagery the <UNK> <UNK> and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers unfortunately we don't really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film though this has a valid plot reason later on br br i would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk but this film just did not deliver and no strong villain like bela lugosi was waiting to do battle against our heroes and the use of <UNK> eyes a nice effect but misleading as he is never in the film why not recreate this with the new actor's eyes overall a film that could be a great one with a little script re working and could someday be a powerful remake especially if they keep it in the same post war time frame heck if they can fix up the hills have eyes then this film has hope
<START> i enjoy movies like this for their spirit no pun intended its a decent clean movie about a baseball team that's falling behind and a young fan wishes for them to win since his <UNK> dad said that was the only way he'd come back for him br br the spirit shines through in two ways a funny cast with danny glover and a young joseph gordon <UNK> and the heavenly <UNK> al taking the dynamic form of christopher lloyd its an energetic movie it gets you smiling and really involves you in the sport br br <UNK> lies my <UNK> the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an <UNK> fan for the team there's absolutely nothing wrong with that i just find it odd that i should come away from the movie thinking the angels are a strong cool team when really my base loyalty such as it is lies with the toronto blue <UNK> it's interesting really if it's just a movie about an underdog kids team then its okay
<START> i am fully aware there is no <UNK> data that readily supports the <UNK> between video games and real life violence the movie is false and phony because it is in complete <UNK> of itself which is what i tried to emphasize in my original review the movie fails not necessarily because i really do think these kids were influenced by video games but because the movie sets it up as random and doesn't follow through let me <UNK> in <UNK> life and death of a serial killer you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous yet she is so troubled she really believes them to be true the viewer can make the distinction however in zero day the 2 kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything <UNK> which is obviously false since everything they do <UNK> this neo <UNK> talking about going on <UNK> with wolf <UNK> which is laughable not only because they know his name but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of his bad movie etc this movie doesn't depict <UNK> it shows nothing but <UNK> to prove a point unfortunately you fell for the bait and didn't see this and you didn't pick up on it from my review either the entire movie is just taking michael moore's <UNK> and <UNK> it to something real life in hopes of <UNK> and it fails not necessarily because the <UNK> is wrong but because the movie is wrong and doesn't support it of course i don't think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people but if i'm not mistaken didn't video tape exist of the <UNK> kids or some teen killers shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked or acted like the <UNK> in doom <UNK> the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media influenced but obviously balanced or intelligent enough that its not even an issue zero day is a bad movie not because i really believe a <UNK> exists but because the film maker doesn't know what hes trying to say and the movie does more to <UNK> his point then support it it's almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> if you want to see the <UNK> teen killer theory pulled off right go watch bully
<START> when this was released i thought this was one of the most <UNK> films ever made however thanks to martin <UNK> and a few other filmmakers like him there have been <UNK> films worse language wise than this but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's ears hey i can take a lot of it but this got ridiculous in the first six minutes alone i heard a half dozen <UNK> of the <UNK> name in vain plus an <UNK> number of f words i wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990 i couldn't have been the only one br br not surprisingly some of the feature actors included jennifer jason leigh burt young jerry <UNK> and <UNK> lake since this film stephen lang seems to have improved his image at least playing the <UNK> <UNK> jackson in gods and <UNK> <UNK> role here is just the opposite perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a <UNK> by the end of the film br br depressing gloomy semi pornographic repulsive these are just a few of the <UNK> people used even some liberal critics in describing this story which is painted even worse in the novel of course some of the better known critics all extreme <UNK> praised the movie however they were the only ones most critics were disgusted as well almost all of the paying public it's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this br br trust me on this there are no good likable characters in this entire movie this is a mean sick film one of the worst of the modern era that is unless you enjoy seeing child abuse drug abuse teen prostitutes on and on two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people no thanks
<START> the above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my <UNK> <UNK> decided to watch this masterpiece of modern <UNK> br br erotic scary suspenseful well thought out these are all the things this film fails to be br br it is however incredibly funny the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies i have seen in recent years and yet this film doesn't even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements it becomes a comedy without even attempting to <UNK> br br throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like santa claus goes around <UNK> over zombies and <UNK> vampires into the ground this made me fail to believe the films title if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting oh well whatever besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title such as this one there has been a virus sweeping through america creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist and yet there's only four zombies in the entire film another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted surely you'd see zombies <UNK> about in the woods or in the background a bit in fact i believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didn't have a high enough budget to film in a wider location that or the director didn't want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer <UNK> off to be bothered with such trivial matters br br in fact the director had so much fun doing this that he didn't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor and so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act <UNK> whilst i assume he changed his name and began randomly <UNK> at the film <UNK> editing isn't a hard job anyway right the only reason this movie found it's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with freddy vs jason strange how these things happen isn't it and the only way we made it though the night was by <UNK> gas masks on and <UNK> them to our <UNK> to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess br br oh yes we did laugh at the end but i'm sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity
<START> another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batman dead end that just helps <UNK> our taste <UNK> and leave us wanting more this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like even tough this is a <UNK> of sorts the attention to detail character and action is undeniably real although this is a limited resources production it puts to shame big budgeted star casted hyped productions other superhero related movies here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people finally a superman that actually looks super and looks like the real thing batman the way it should be without the flashy rubber casted ripped body armor to hide <UNK> <UNK> for over paid actors that don't deliver i just wish that some sensible warner bros <UNK> gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel i don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd i would never get tired of watching it just the plot itself is worth my hard earned <UNK> for this hope the <UNK> at marvel <UNK> productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look no more batman robin fiasco or hulk <UNK> etc learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to <UNK> the hero for the movie just to have it bomb in theaters mr <UNK> we need more directors like you
<START> this was a watchable movie but plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of <UNK> earlier movies with that said it was worth the time to watch i gave this a 5 out of 10 so basically its one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see but if you find it on the tube take a chance
<START> this game is amazing really you should get it if you don't have it although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out i believe that this game will always be a classic it's just as good a super mario world or so when i was young my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did it's not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential it's fun entertaining and challenging everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics well it did come out in 1996 rock on <UNK> mario <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is the best
<START> ok i first saw this movie like at 9 00 on <UNK> a few weeks ago and thought it would be award winning boy was i <UNK> on that this movie bit the big one i mean the mother of the monsters shows her true form only at the end of the movie i'm going that's it why doesn't she show it briefly a little bit more earlier in the movie the plot being the mother and son feast on the blood of young women wouldn't it be better if they just went on you know a killing spree killing like a couple of young women each then having the sheriff or a cop find out about and get into the old find a way to kill the monsters save the young woman women and have 1 or 2 more people killed in the process i think it would be a hell of a lot better that way it also sucks because the son is the main character and he gets killed first why not get rid of the mother first plus how does she have that strength at the end of the movie when she starts killing people she said it herself she was too weak what the heck was wrong with stephen this time i can never ever <UNK> the acting on any movie by any actor after all they try their best if it weren't for good acting i'd have given this movie a 1 10 3 10
<START> this movie had the potential to be really good considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci fi <UNK> the hidden and dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles but someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one br br dolph plays a butt kicking monk who travels to new york to retrieve a key that <UNK> a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the <UNK> for 2000 years he must battle the <UNK> who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like the hidden and jason goes to hell the <UNK> naturally wants the key so it can let the <UNK> out along for the ride is an annoying female <UNK> and together she and dolph are chased by the <UNK> possessed bodies br br if i'm making this sound entertaining forget it the pacing is very awkward and <UNK> the acting <UNK> at best and the fight scenes staged poorly dolph <UNK> through his role and <UNK> some of the worst dialogue of his career br br the cheese factor really picks up at the end when the <UNK> battles an army of machine gun wielding monks at the monastery but the rest of this flick is a <UNK> br br too bad i really wanted to like this
<START> a woman left alone after the death of her husband finds herself attracted to her son's friend and handy man in a slightly twisted story the woman begins sleeping with the handy man in an effort to revive herself the twisted part the handy man is also her daughter's on and off love interest br br as if this wasn't strange enough the mother manages to fall for this man and when her daughter finds out she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her messed up life on her poor mother br br though you may think badly of this woman the truth is movie manages to portray her in a positive light beautifully played by anne reid this character has dimension and portrays great emotion br br a truly brilliant performance and an enjoyable film br br 8 10
<START> even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6 br br as a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans it felt this was a combination of pc mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about talk to those who have lived on horse back most treat their animals like family members regardless of background regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad <UNK> of wild horses i had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how pc showed a world different than what they knew in reality br br this <UNK> break from the normal disney or <UNK> fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view but if you live in an area similar to what is shown you may end up answering questions
<START> about 4 years ago i liked this movie i would watch it over and over and over but now i don't actually i think this movie would have been great for mystery science theater 3000 it has a bunch of comment heavy actors <UNK> culkin christopher lloyd patrick stewart whoopi goldberg and a pretty cheesy plot my favorite part is when culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says hey tyler where ya <UNK> the moon also look out for the classic line do you have feeling in your <UNK> br br on the other hand it's better than the good son
<START> i have no idea how to describe this movie and also would love to provide others the same opportunity i had seeing it with no prior knowledge of what to expect i enjoyed it immensely but can also say i barely understood what was going on if in fact there was anything to understand in the first place fans of david lynch <UNK> or especially guy <UNK> films should particularly enjoy this and any fans of the comic book <UNK> will probably be beside themselves with joy and wonder it came as close as any film i've seen to the tone and mood dan <UNK> creates so effectively br br one slight note just to warn anyone easily offended this movie if rated would be <UNK> 17 for sure fans of male full frontal nudity however hmm well yes this is weird wild stuff
<START> loretta <UNK> cher is a woman in her late thirties a widow who lives with her parents in a <UNK> apartment in brooklyn she is engaged to marry johnny <UNK> danny aiello a bland man more out of a <UNK> duty than actual love before their wedding johnny takes a trip out to visit his mother who is sick and leaves loretta the function of playing the <UNK> <UNK> with his brother <UNK> by <UNK> him of their impending wedding <UNK> nicholas cage hasn't forgiven johnny for being the cause of his accident which caused him the loss of his hand and subsequently his then bride to be but he does fall for loretta and hard after a <UNK> affair loretta out of respect for johnny tries to avoid <UNK> but his dark looks and <UNK> <UNK> win her over meanwhile <UNK> mother rose <UNK> olympia dukakis is not only <UNK> her husband <UNK> vincent <UNK> is seeing another woman but is also herself the subject of admiration from a college professor and wonders why do men chase women things get complicated when johnny returns from <UNK> to tell loretta they can't be married br br the setup is pure sitcom but the story written by john patrick <UNK> with a deep understanding for italian americans living in new york is genuine he gets the <UNK> of these people and their day to day <UNK> and quirks and all of the characters have a deep <UNK> that comes through in key moments throughout the story loretta a character hardened by the loss of her husband and knowing her chances of happiness are slim slowly emerges as a woman who is so swept by the sudden recognition of love she becomes the heroine of la <UNK> the one who <UNK> the love of the man with the wooden hand in a clever gender <UNK> and cher <UNK> the role and makes it hers and in her own style subtly <UNK> her <UNK> to a deep dark beauty <UNK> is pure fire and nicholas cage exudes <UNK> power as if he were <UNK> marlon brando the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> the central couple both express their love for each other in two very crucial moments the latter couple on the night of the full moon when loretta and <UNK> <UNK> their affair a rare scene depicting love and <UNK> among the elderly and the former at a tense moment over breakfast when rose <UNK> reveals in touching words that she wants <UNK> to stop seeing his mistress <UNK> anita <UNK> br br moonstruck is not only the romantic comedy and date movie of choice but also a beautiful examination of love and passion among regular people the ending is a tour de force of emotional impact the family situation going beyond the <UNK> complications to <UNK> it in tradition going back to the days of immigrants and is one that <UNK> this movie from being just another feel good movie to a classic moonstruck deservedly got its oscars for best writing actress and supporting actress and has proved to grow beyond its time
<START> the image of movie studios being <UNK> driven instead of <UNK> is not without truth in fact it's more true than false this begs the question why castle rock entertainment allowed kenneth branagh to create a full length uncut version of hamlet with his complete creative control among other things of course branagh had to agree to some <UNK> a star <UNK> cast and a 2 5 hour version for wider release but why would the film studio allow branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see could they have at least in this case had enough respect for the material and branagh's vision to create something for only a few people that is not a question that i can answer whatever the reason this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching hamlet everyone knows the story so i will not spend much time on that however unlike other productions of the play stage included this is a completely uncut production which has never been done before according to some shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut leaving the decision of what to include to the director's <UNK> that being said i have no doubt that had he been able to see it the <UNK> would have been <UNK> with branagh's production br br the film is top heavy with film stars although most have mere bit parts all play their parts equally well i would have thought branagh too old to play the part of hamlet and while he still may be his performance more than makes up for it hamlet is a complex part displaying every emotion from grief to anger happiness to madness and everything in between branagh nailed it derek <UNK> is terrific as the <UNK> <UNK> whose deception and <UNK> sets all these things in motion his unique voice is perfect for the role julie christie is also very good as <UNK> <UNK> caring mother who doesn't realize what is going on until late in the game br br the classical actors are cast in bit parts <UNK> <UNK> is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines but at least they're in it surprisingly no one takes this to heart everyone gives it their all and it shows special mention has to go to jack lemmon and billy crystal who are excellent robin williams is a little too silly but he's not bad his part is pretty small anyway br br yet this is undeniably branagh's show he adapted one of the most famous plays in history and in so doing he took on a whale of a project it's impressive that he got it done but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement what i really liked about this film is that you don't have to be a shakespeare <UNK> to enjoy it as most people know shakespeare is difficult to <UNK> but branagh and his cast understand this hamlet is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting br br this is a must see for anyone and everyone it may be four hours long but it's definitely worth it
<START> one missed call another asian horror based on the cell phone i recently rented a korean horror film based on a cell phone called <UNK> one missed call was just as boring as that one maybe phones just aren't scary or something but this move was dull and drab no tension or thrills for me and the final monster was <UNK> cheesy and <UNK> the movie dragged quite a bit in different parts and felt too long didn't keep my attention it seems phones are hard to make frightening it's kind of like trying to make a pop <UNK> machine eerie and it is ridiculous to compare this with the ring it seems every asian horror movie is compared to it and so far i haven't seen any that measure up in the least to horror directors take the phone off the hook as a horror device
<START> major league back to the <UNK> 1998 <UNK> br br starring scott <UNK> eric <UNK> corbin bernsen dennis <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> written and directed by john warren 100 minutes rated pg 13 for language and some violence br br by blake french br br believe it or not in the new john warren comedy major league back to the <UNK> there is one funny scene it consists of a sequence where an <UNK> coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the <UNK> and <UNK> back and smash him in the face it's not much but with the exception of a few one liners it's all this film has to offer enough said br br this movie is not only <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> undeveloped predictable and badly written but also just plain bad even non critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got it is so familiar it just isn't funny br br how many times does the same movie about sports have to be made last years we saw this same material in air bud golden <UNK> and as bad as that film was this is even worse at least air bud was family oriented major league back to the <UNK> is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a sunday afternoon it is too childish for adults so who is this film for teenagers elderly people who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this br br the film like many others like this has one basic point it tries to make <UNK> <UNK> all yes it does and what a great moral to try to prove too bad we have already seen and <UNK> it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their <UNK> are men in a <UNK> costumes where the silly <UNK> form their own buddy comedy routine <UNK> one liners to themselves like they suck this kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass this guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost maybe it was his mind somebody needs a <UNK> and ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name and where the only heartfelt lecture scene about <UNK> is so <UNK> that it is almost funny br br major league back to the <UNK> is so bad it <UNK> its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence the good baseball team is on a comeback they are about to win and the power goes out i was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion but in reality its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time the movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many <UNK> jokes it is are not funny there is another kind of funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time <UNK> is not wanted in that position any longer the <UNK> answer you're too old too slow and too fat the <UNK> reaction is to die for but that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time and certainly is not worth a <UNK> of your money br br so here is another dreadful <UNK> into this genre of film another that is doomed with its own script which is failed before seen and another which is so familiar it seems like <UNK> <UNK> all over again br br
<START> this is like <UNK> tiger hidden dragon in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame the plot may be hard to follow but that is the nature of <UNK> chinese <UNK> to the screen certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience however an intelligent person should be able to keep up moreover the martial arts scenes <UNK> are <UNK> by eye popping cgi
<START> the first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is <UNK> that you're on it in the first place then it becomes a matter of being <UNK> and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with which is exactly what a young latino girl does in <UNK> ' written and directed by <UNK> <UNK> diana michelle rodriguez is an <UNK> year old high school senior from the projects in brooklyn facing <UNK> after her fourth fight in the <UNK> since the beginning of the <UNK> she affects a <UNK> attitude which masks a deep <UNK> anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go she lives with her father <UNK> paul <UNK> with whom she has a very <UNK> relationship and her younger brother tiny ray <UNK> with her life <UNK> on the brink of <UNK> she desperately needs an <UNK> through which to channel the demons that plague her and one day she finds it without even looking for it when she stops by the gym where tiny trains ironically tiny wants nothing to do with boxing he wants to go to art school but <UNK> is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons when diana convinces <UNK> <UNK> hector <UNK> <UNK> to take her on and approaches her father for the money under the <UNK> of calling it a weekly <UNK> she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for <UNK> turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money ultimately with <UNK> help she finds a way and the ring soon becomes her second home it's an environment to which she readily <UNK> and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better and the fact that she will have to fight men not women in gender <UNK> <UNK> does not <UNK> her in the least diana has found her element br br first time writer director <UNK> <UNK> has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere and there's no candy <UNK> on it either as hector tells diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is i was a fighter once i lost ' then looking around the busy gym like most of these guys they're going to lose too but it's all they know ' and it's that honesty of attitude as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed that makes this movie as good as it is it's a bleak world <UNK> by the <UNK> lit run down gym you can fairly smell the sweat of the <UNK> and that sense of <UNK> that hangs over it all like a <UNK> <UNK> these people who are <UNK> and hanging on to the one and only thing they have all that they know br br making her screen debut michelle rodriguez is perfectly cast as diana <UNK> her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly <UNK> off of her in waves she is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really rodriguez exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin whatever it is it works it's a powerful memorable performance by an actor from whom we will <UNK> another <UNK> with great anticipation she certainly makes diana a positive role model one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life at least to those who would seek them out br br as positive as this film is however it ends on something of an ambiguous note though diana obviously has her feet on the ground there's no indication of where she's headed is this a short term fix for her or is she destined to become the female counterpart of hector after all realistically and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to nor opens it's arms to women and in keeping with the subject matter of the film and the approach of the filmmaker an <UNK> of the results of <UNK> <UNK> would have been appropriate br br the supporting cast includes <UNK> douglas adrian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> alicia ashley <UNK> and thomas <UNK> ira though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify there are certain aspects of <UNK> ' that stretch credibility a bit regarding some of what happens in the ring that aside it's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience i rate this one 7 10 br br br br
<START> full house is one of the worst tv series ever why because all the characters are so irritating that it's impossible to bear the best character is joey an even he is pretty irritating occasionally an that girl dj who wrote her character i want to kill my self every time she speaks not to mention when danny <UNK> with his philosophy br br example dj won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino however she's not <UNK> so she shouldn't <UNK> according to law however the casino was ready to pay her the money but then danny her father <UNK> her and don't let's her raise that money because she is not <UNK> oh come on give me a break will ya since i've seen that stupid and childish scene i instantly turned off the television some of the <UNK> they say in this series not even a child would bought who in the world could think that full house is entertaining and funny every single word they say in this series <UNK> like shakespeare wrote it except that <UNK> knew how to write and except that he wouldn't be that childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the full house br br for everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world i deeply recommend <UNK> not watch the full <UNK> not even one episode as a try out avoid this series save your self from stupidity and nonsense this is the worst television show ever i'd rather watch <UNK> then this <UNK> not watch <UNK>
<START> updated from a previous comment the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late <UNK> silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines davies plays a <UNK> from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines a bit player in crude comedies they appear together in cheap comedies until marion is discovered and becomes a big dramatic star br br a great lampoon on hollywood and its <UNK> davies haines are a wonderful team and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart john gilbert <UNK> <UNK> norma <UNK> mae murray rod <UNK> <UNK> joy dorothy sebastian <UNK> taylor <UNK> parsons <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and marion davies you have to see it are a hoot a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still <UNK> marion davies <UNK> henderson plays the father polly <UNK> is a maid paul <UNK> is the slimy leading man br br show people was said to have used the career of gloria <UNK> as its model i think mae murray is closer davies and <UNK> were friends but this film's story does parallel the rise of <UNK> from one reel mack <UNK> comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b demille films of the late teens and early <UNK> br br davies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends odd that mgm never teamed them up in a <UNK> they're great together a sweet romance and delightful spoof of early hollywood greta garbo and <UNK> daniels are mentioned but do not appear
<START> as a young black <UNK> woman i am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me of course when i saw this movie at the video store i thought i would enjoy it unfortunately i didn't although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant the story was simply not properly developed the movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film had the director done a better job <UNK> the scenes perhaps i would have enjoyed it a bit more honestly i would recommend a film like raising victor over this one any day i just was not too impressed
<START> this is quite literally the worst movie i have ever watched in my life it may be the worst movie possible some movies are so bad that they're good this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes <UNK> awful it is the anti <UNK> we bought it with the intent to <UNK> and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks instead we sat in stunned silence <UNK> poor peter sellers br br this is worse than the animated lord of the rings it is worse than the matrix sequels it is worse than <UNK> it is worse than any batman movie br br do not under any circumstances let this movie approach within ten feet of your television
<START> i happened upon this flick on a rainy sunday <UNK> to tune in to something else out of curiosity i <UNK> the comments here and found myself watching it to the end i really didn't do so with intent this was one of those movies where you're fascinated and watch it for another couple of minutes until you finally just watch to the end and the <UNK> of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view the one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking <UNK> and <UNK> and their earlier roles but great isn't anywhere to be found anywhere here story performances and particularly the absurd courtroom hi <UNK> we all know that perry mason before raymond <UNK> passed the 300 <UNK> mark and ben <UNK> are granted some <UNK> in <UNK> around the courtroom instead of being <UNK> confined to a <UNK> and <UNK> is especially granted the <UNK> of entering <UNK> often by simply going to the jury and showing them before the judge and <UNK> have even been informed of or shown them no real life judge or <UNK> would stand for this br br both perry and ben almost always ended the proceedings by <UNK> a confession of the real killer actually perry nearly always did this but often <UNK> would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true <UNK> <UNK> it reasonable doubt and then leave it to the cops and <UNK> to proceed against the guilty party sometimes on camera sometimes presumed at the end of the show br br but that said holland <UNK> <UNK> and the amount of <UNK> <UNK> her in the courtroom portion of this story made the actions of <UNK> mason more closely resemble the slow often boring detail such as seen on court tv and in real life <UNK> br br every character in this presentation was either insipid unsympathetic obnoxious boring improbable or some combination of two or more of these br br the ending was the most banal absurd even silly conclusion possible but again fascinating because of this <UNK> and <UNK> are attractive individuals and t v movies would appear their best <UNK> probably best in 2nd lead probably better if 3rd roles even in this <UNK> taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them give this one 1 star for the story performances and 3 additional for the fascination factor
<START> only the <UNK> could have been behind such a disaster one only hopes that this irony was the <UNK> force behind the film this movie was so bad it forced me to register with imdb finally just so i could trash it what makes this movie all the more tragic is that it had such great source material i have never seen a movie where all the elements were so <UNK> mediocre as to render the result less than the sum of its parts br br it may seem insignificant but i'd like to start with the score as the proud owner of a music degree i must register my <UNK> i was torn between laughter and dry <UNK> as i listened to what john <UNK> did to <UNK> brilliant score it was far more gruesome than any of the <UNK> death scenes and almost as inadvertently comedic it was by far the most inappropriate score i've heard since well i really can't think of a worse one maybe jaws 4 br br as for the plot i'm sorry new age <UNK> what ever happened to the gritty realism of the original trilogy in those films more so in the first two than the third but still the supernatural was for the most part implied and it was this subtlety that made the movies so <UNK> believable here we have <UNK> going black calling all <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even though in certain scenes the <UNK> would be perfectly normal but for the camera angle gone is the <UNK> <UNK> manipulation <UNK> the <UNK> inherent in our collective psyche in its place a <UNK> slap in the face of recycled cliché and transparent incompetence add to that a lead actress so unbelievably annoying that you <UNK> thank the director for those scenes from which she is absent never have i seen a little girl so <UNK> irritating since little stephanie ruined all in the family br br other than that i have no strong feelings on the subject luckily the first three films are <UNK> <UNK> as to render this train wreck of wasted celluloid <UNK> or at the very most a study in how not to make a film viewer beware may <UNK> <UNK> if you're lucky
<START> i'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti christian pseudo documentary got now i respect the guy's opinion and faith i myself am not at this state believer of the taught christian <UNK> however anti christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue br br this film has valid points but they are very few and represented in a very biased context i'm not <UNK> against seeing it in fact i think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not and this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to christian <UNK> rather than an <UNK> approach on the subject it looks like a personal <UNK> on the christian school that affected his childhood it also <UNK> the christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or <UNK> no <UNK> in between br br the director uses movie scenes from passion of christ without <UNK> sets up an interview with the <UNK> of his former school and presents almost solely anti christian historians and writers i actually found the <UNK> to be the most down to earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified i also strongly doubt that any of the christian <UNK> who were interviewed were <UNK> <UNK> or even told before the interview the purpose of the <UNK> br br with this being said there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of christianity but the way in which this whole think is produced is often offensive highly <UNK> and dreadfully biased
<START> for my <UNK> quarter project for school i chose to do human <UNK> after some research on the internet i found this dvd and ordered it i just finished watching it and i am still thinking about it all i can say is wow it is such a compelling story of a 12 year old <UNK> girl named holly and an american man named <UNK> who tries to save her the ending leaves you breathless and although it's not a happily ever after ending it is very realistic it is amazing and i recommend it to anyone you really connect with holly and <UNK> and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her i loved it so much and now i want to know what happens next
<START> for me the only reason for having a look at this remake was to see how bad and funny it could be there was no doubt about it being funny and bad because i had seen <UNK> i <UNK> 1968 shall we begin here we go br br robert <UNK> brendan <UNK> pierre <UNK> a lean fellow that lacks the depth of the original robert <UNK> brendan <UNK> natasha <UNK> a scarecrow her image can cause insomnia robert <UNK> brendan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an ok incarnation which like the lean fellow <UNK> above lacks depth of a russian soul and struggle within robert <UNK> brendan <UNK> <UNK> a rather unimpressive leader robert <UNK> brendan <UNK> prince <UNK> a turd with an english face robert <UNK> brendan <UNK> count <UNK> a <UNK> freak show br br the rest of the characters are not much better br br the movements of the actors and the way they look and speak are often atrocious they behave like modern <UNK> citizens dressed up for a one day <UNK> it all looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our russian men and women of the early 19th century br br a good piece of entertainment to <UNK> and make fun of we had quite a few <UNK> in our office when remembering this modern product which had been shown the previous evening on our tv br br user rating 8 0 10 <UNK> votes i guess many young people have never watched our film <UNK> i <UNK> 1968 or have weird sense of tarantino spielberg quality remember the scene when our <UNK> is saving his friend turns around shoots and the bridge goes boom looks like a cgi explosion br br there is neither sense nor craft to make a better version of the novel which was screened properly in our country once but i would be happy to watch a russian remake of gone with the wind hey directors wake up and get busy with that instead of spoiling our classics br br now back to common sense jokes aside what i mentioned above is nothing new though deadly exaggerated br br to make foreign actors trying to pass for russians while <UNK> in very serious epics and dramas is a rude mistake and the filmmakers are making this mistake again and again of course it results in numerous laughs especially <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> ridiculous and her dancing and singing makes a russian viewer think this sucks so much that it's funny br br in order to say something new i'd like to mention the pace of the movie to my mind this new version is very <UNK> the narration and the scenes are not naturally flowing they <UNK> and pop up like in a modern video again i have to remember our <UNK> i <UNK> where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit back and enjoy going with the flow br br i thought that maybe the <UNK> battle would be great to somehow <UNK> numerous <UNK> but it has turned out to be no match for the war scenes filmed in 1968 br br there should be something good in this movie after all and there is the actors seem to be trying hard to make it all work they did not have a chance from the start but they still joined the <UNK> team plus 1 point for that <UNK> it makes a russian viewer uncomfortable some scenes are ironically ridiculous though they are intended to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing their best it all evokes pity and sometimes fits of laughter br br what i still like about this serial is the last part of it it shows very vividly how everybody gets his or her <UNK> and <UNK> besides judging by the movie trailers i thought that the film would have an adult sex scene which would definitely kill the whole project but fortunately it does not have such rubbish and that's a big plus br br <UNK> i <UNK> is no harry potter and nowadays even we here in present day russia do not have enough craft to film it properly do i have to say that the moral quality of our life has <UNK> immensely fortunately a proper film was screened during our soviet times the american version of the 1950s was justified to some extent <UNK> did not even exist yet there were <UNK> circumstances then br br 4 out of 10 1 point is given from the start 1 point goes for the <UNK> and 2 points for the last part of the serial thanks for attention
<START> my favorite quote from crow was when the car was going off the cliff the movie is so bad even the car wants to get out of it br br this had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen it was seriously out there to scare you which makes it even funnier if it weren't for mystery science theater i wouldn't be here today p
<START> in spite of the great future design touches the clever <UNK> premise and will smith's <UNK> cool performance this movie doesn't live up to expectations the clichés come thick and fast waking from a recurring nightmare maverick cop has his <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> lieutenant to list more would be spoiling it you can see the end a mile off this movie is also <UNK> you never feel that you have <UNK> anywhere what's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago the robots themselves are good in <UNK> but the <UNK> scenes look more like bad disney the cgi is overdone again and again and if you can destroy the robots by <UNK> them why do they need to <UNK> <UNK> you know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax it could have been great but it's less than the sum of its parts mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years

<START> i was a kid crazy about michael jackson his music his dancing he was and is the greatest of all times few days ago a friend gave me a present <UNK> dvd i just couldn't believe it so i took my time and saw the movie again after a lot of years and it kicked me back in time i almost cried not because of michael jackson but of the good old times i remembered back than when i went to his <UNK> enjoying music and dancing the movie gave me some other perspective than back then when i was a kid you can truly see the parody that michael went through his life thank you michael jackson to bring me back to those great times to your great music and dancing it's a shame that people has forgotten you i didn't because you gave me great moments with your music all the best to you where ever you are out there
<START> this movie really woke me up like it wakes up the main male character of this <UNK> different movie from his life <UNK> br br this guy john ben chaplin leads his mediocre safe life of a bank <UNK> in a small <UNK> english town until the stunningly gorgeous wild girl to die for <UNK> nicole kidman ordered by email from russia enters his life to become his beloved wife by <UNK> plan however a <UNK> turns up <UNK> does not speak a word of <UNK> language although calm and <UNK> on the outside john becomes so interested in beautiful <UNK> that instead of using the full <UNK> policy of the matching service he buys her a <UNK> to start the communication process br br what happens <UNK> in the plot really shakes poor john from his <UNK> of a <UNK> paid safe feeling clerk into a decision making <UNK> thinking action figure giving the viewer a <UNK> message you would have probably acted likewise br br kidman <UNK> <UNK> make a great team acting russians and they are almost <UNK> from the real thing almost only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues however slight enough to <UNK> a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles at least from the cultural background br br the pace of the film is fast and captivating and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out br br my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy to sum it up it has an unusual plot great acting and ideas below the surface like the idea of the rude awakening from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a <UNK> machine the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink <UNK> sings welcome to the machine i bet that in the end john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all br br thank you writers for the great story and everyone else for this great movie please make a sequel and you can stage it <UNK> and name the location whatever because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99 <UNK> percent of the potential viewers i am sure of it
<START> this is a good movie something fun about watching money be blown at a super rate especially from a kid's point of view take it for what it is a fun little movie about a kid's dream coming true and what a kid might do with 1 million dollars don't like it don't watch it they make movies for the <UNK> not the people that have nothing better to do then complain in their lives
<START> to be honest i watched this movie only because of my <UNK> needs i mean i couldn't get women at my age i was 9 or 10 so i thought watching <UNK> <UNK> was the closet thing to sex br br i ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy halloween parties sassy humor and some sexy evil displayed by elvira br br they just don't make movies like this anymore it had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style br br the truth is that it generated plenty of fans because of it's humor and the ability to perform by <UNK> br br this is classic that reminds me of the good days of usa up all night
<START> this movie got extremely silly when things started to happen i couldn't care less about any of the characters susan <UNK> was so annoying and the leading actor forget his name also got on my nerves can't quite remember how it ended and so forth but the whole idea of aliens <UNK> human bodies and all just seemed stupid in this film things didn't quite carry off my dad told me it's s stupid movie i should've listened to him
<START> when the film began i was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera in fact the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie even direct to dvd films should have production values better than this heck a large <UNK> of the home videos <UNK> to youtube have better production values all too often the film seriously appears to be made by sticking the camera on a <UNK> and turning it on with no camera person closeups and anything resembling camera work are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups <UNK> br br the film is about two gay men who want to become married as if was made almost a decade ago their only option was marrying in <UNK> times have definitely changed however the recent acceptance of gay marriage cannot in any way be attributed to this film if anything it set the gay marriage supporters back instead of helping as the movie stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue according to the film religious people are one dimensional idiots who carry <UNK> everywhere and shoot people as well as wives who have gay husbands are narrow minded when they learn their <UNK> have been living a lie go figure i'm sure glad it gives an honest chance to both sides on the issue br br the bottom line nothing about the film shows any <UNK> at all and i even hesitate to call this a film it's more like a home movie and doesn't even merit a listing on imdb or even inclusion on <UNK> bottom 100 list of the worst rated films of all time the acting is horrible the writing is horrible the direction if there even is any is horrible the camera work is horrible and the plot is horrible it's a home movie there is nothing positive i can say about this in any way except that it makes the films of ed wood seem like oscar <UNK> in comparison and i am sure the ghost of mr wood is smiling every time someone watches this mess br br i don't care if you are gay or straight this film is not worth your time and i don't know how they managed to create dvds of it i assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time seriously this gives new meaning to the word <UNK> br br by the way if the one lady in the film was a real lawyer wouldn't the ability to read be an important <UNK> i'm just <UNK> br br finally with gay marriage being such a serious and important topic can't we have a film that's better than this that <UNK> the issue this one sadly only invites laughter
<START> it's been close to ten years since i've seen either of the last two sequels to phantasm surely due to my still vivid <UNK> of them not being very good that being acknowledged to this day i'm still a huge fan of the first two <UNK> so i thought i'd go back and re experience the <UNK> <UNK> part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that doesn't make much sense again kicking off right where the previous movie left us <UNK> saves mike from the tall man who <UNK> to come back for him later but things aren't safe for long when they come across <UNK> who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a <UNK> apparently his soul is held prisoner by the tall man so mike is then dragged into the sinister double <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> has to find him along the way he meets up with a ten year old kid and a nun chuck wielding black chick named rocky who assist him throughout his journey br br there's really nothing memorable about phantasm iii other than how stupid and <UNK> humorous it tries to be only one positive aspect that didn't even help the movie and that was the return of a michael baldwin and bill <UNK> who <UNK> their roles for the first time since the original 1978 classic the problem is they pretty much make cameo appearances <UNK> <UNK> is of course back in his starring role but his bumbling love sick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like <UNK> <UNK> also just didn't seem entirely into his role he talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the <UNK> that the movie seemed to <UNK> resort to most people's opinion on this flick seem pretty <UNK> and tend to think it's still entertaining maybe i'm just too much of a <UNK> <UNK> but i just couldn't get into this one i remember <UNK> it when i was a kid and after re watching it i can safely say nothing has changed don <UNK> <UNK> the scene with his original low budget nightmarish legendary film phantasm which i still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and gory but lord of the dead stupid title just looked too rushed and slapped together to me the inclusion of the two new characters tim and rocky the only thing missing was <UNK> doo was a strong indication of <UNK> running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchise br br so it's a phantasm movie with very little gore nudity and <UNK> barrel shot guns need i say more
<START> i just finished watching this movie and i found it was basically just not funny at all br br i'm an <UNK> <UNK> computer type none of the <UNK> <UNK> stuff but i found none of the jokes in this funny at all br br some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot <UNK> and zoom could've been cut down to <UNK> rather than over a minute and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in time br br i think i laughed a total of 2 3 times in the entire movie br br the acting itself wasn't all that bad around the standard that a b grade movie should have br br i'd suggest not bothering with this movie unless you're a huge <UNK> fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it
<START> it's wonderful to see that <UNK> meadows is already <UNK> international influence les <UNK> attendant shares many themes with a room for romeo <UNK> the vague class identity above working but well below middle the unhinged father the abandoned urban <UNK> the sense of adult failure the barely <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> modern urban life br br but if meadows is an expert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in images and his <UNK> composed <UNK> surreal <UNK> frames serve to distance the <UNK> and rather bleak subject matter which meadows like <UNK> from high farce to tragedy within seconds br br there are <UNK> and cliches but <UNK> is <UNK> mad an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions whose attempts to realise them are <UNK> dangerous while individual set pieces the popcorn <UNK> explosions the best marriage sequence since the dead and the deadly manage to snatch <UNK> from despair
<START> live a little love a little is one of <UNK> <UNK> movies part slapstick part fluff part surreal and part strange elvis meets up with a very off beat girl with an annoying voice she looks like jennifer aniston story doesn't make much sense as is the case with most elvis <UNK> movies and there a bunch of odd characters <UNK> not much music in this one but what there is i liked although none are memorable strange continuity elvis and michelle carey go into her beach house at night but a few minutes later a delivery boy comes in and it's stark daylight what that's about the essence of the movie what oh two good things about the movie a elvis looks great and b the dog steals the show
<START> kirsten dunst is terribly overrated as an actress you can tell always she's just acting i like izzard though plot is awfully boring the viewer has no real connections to the characters never knowing who to really sympathize with or even care about slow dull movie with some laughs but few and not very funny anyway plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least you can see each plot turn coming a mile away what is this movie supposed to be comedy drama who cares you won't by the end of this film
<START> this film attempts to follow the genre of low budget hand held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful br br this one fails and how br br it's amazing how many so called awards this piece of garbage has got <UNK> on the cover it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually <UNK> this br br words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is seriously it's that bad br br i watched it in 20 minutes flat on almost <UNK> fast forward br br from rubbish lighting to dreadful directing grainy visuals to <UNK> sound and of course not forgetting the abysmal acting this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so called film making br br it seriously has no redeeming qualities whatsoever save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick there are plenty out there dead end the blair witch <UNK> to name but a few br br avoid this rubbish at all costs do not waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film br br take <UNK> of all the other comments you've been warned
<START> i took part in a little mini production of this when i was a bout 8 at school and my mum bought the video for me i've loved it ever since when i was younger it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that i enjoyed but since i've watched it when i got older i appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal oliver reed and ron moody were brilliant i can't imagine anyone else playing bill sykes or fagin <UNK> <UNK> nancy if the best character for me she put up with so much for those boys i think she's such a strong character and her final scene when well you know always makes me cry best musical in my opinion of all time it's lasted all this time it will live on for many more years to come 11 10
<START> this movie maybe really bad but it is alot of fun the bad acting and poor direction enhance the film's <UNK> the twins are very funny in their <UNK> roles if you go into this film expecting the first conan or <UNK> than you will hate it if you watch it while in a good mood and accept it as good dumb fun you will have a good time watch for the scene where they try to hang the brothers its funniest scene in the film i wish mystery science theatre 3000 would have done this
<START> i have bought the dvd of this version to compare against the current bbc 2005 version which is brilliant the 1985 was adapted by arthur <UNK> who adapted <UNK> <UNK> soldier spy for tv and who died this year 2005 i remember great acting especially from <UNK> and elliott and moving music music in the 2005 version is far more understated but very telling just to pick up other <UNK> on a couple of points richard <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> boyfriend not <UNK> esther had no uncle charlie drake never played <UNK> in either version nor did he play toby <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> is played by comedian johnny vegas in the 2005 version toby was played by bernard <UNK> br br both versions are <UNK> and admirable adaptations of <UNK> great novel now read the book it's not perfect and the sentimentality may make you <UNK> at times but i defy you not to cry and laugh
<START> adam jones has a brilliant sense of humor there is nothing i didn't like about this film cross eyed was beautifully shot adam does a great job of not only developing the main characters but also the minor characters br br cross eyed gives hope to every low budget film out there that you don't have to spend a lot to create something worth watching there is something to like for everyone if you've had a terrible roommate if you've ever picked on a <UNK> in high school if you've ever <UNK> anywhere in the city if you have any type of sense of humor at all you will love this film this is the type of film that will be around for a long time and ends up <UNK> again once adam makes a bigger name for himself i look forward to <UNK> future projects
<START> the story of the film was as simple minded as its morality go find a girl marry her live with her happily ever after though the film had some fine moments and turns most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline br br the <UNK> mormon struggle was only touched <UNK> and was <UNK> about probably intentionally a more interesting story would have been a mixed couple br br if you wanna see a film which doesn't need too much concentration which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values besides the modern tolerance stuff you will be fine with this film might be shown at a family home evening
<START> my cable tv has what's called the arts channel which is a catch as catch can situation sometimes sometimes films sometimes short clips of films or <UNK> and i came into this just as the bar scene came on where they tear up their <UNK> excellent exquisite ealing wins again my wartime <UNK> raised mother would love this should i ever find a copy of it some of <UNK> best artists from mr <UNK> to wayne and <UNK> and the delicious miss <UNK> having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the home office loved the last scene where as soon as they are back in england the <UNK> <UNK> and it <UNK>
<START> this is one of the most daring and important of the so called pre code films made in hollywood during the 1930s unlike some pre code films that occasionally <UNK> in subjects that would have never been allowed after 1934 5 this film fully immersed itself in a very <UNK> yet entertaining plot from start to finish the conventional morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely not evident in this film as the film is essentially about a conniving woman who sleeps her way to the top and with no apologies along the way this broad both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich something you just never would have seen in films made just two or three years later br br the film begins with barbara stanwyck working in her father's <UNK> in addition to being her boss he is also her <UNK> and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he'll allow the illegal bar to operate with <UNK> while not especially clear here it appears as if daddy has been renting his daughter's body out for a long time br br however after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull barbara has had enough and heads to the big city it doesn't hurt that the still blew up and killed her father but her feeling that she was <UNK> herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the <UNK> to move br br despite the depression barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega bank she starts out at a pretty <UNK> job as a file clerk but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son in law this all ends in tragedy but <UNK> doesn't seem too <UNK> up over the deaths of these two men in fact some time later she is able to <UNK> herself into the life of the new <UNK> and once again she's on top perhaps in more way than one br br now so far this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and <UNK> barbara played a 100 <UNK> a woman with no morality and no conscience just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process however the brave writers and producer <UNK> out and thought it important to <UNK> on a <UNK> ending considering that this woman was so evil and conniving her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly <UNK> from the film in many ways this reminded me of the ending of <UNK> as once again a wicked person somehow sees the light and changes at the not too convincing conclusion br br my advice is to try watching red headed woman and <UNK> red headed woman is much like baby face but features no magical transformation at the end the leading lady really is a <UNK> down deep in <UNK> a film very much like red headed woman the roles are <UNK> and a man john gilbert plays a similar conniving character both are classics and a bit better than this film br br this film is an amazing <UNK> of a brief period of often ultra sleazy hollywood films and in this light it's well worth seeing for <UNK> also fans of the duke take note john wayne plays a very small part in the film and it's very unusual to see a very young wayne playing such a conventional role
<START> i realize it's not supposed to be bsg and i can handle slow paced shows if they're interesting but i find myself completely <UNK> and bored with this series br br the formula for bsg seemed to be action adventure scifi suspense mystery drama br br the formula for caprica seems to be bland drama <UNK> scifi br br maybe it will get more interesting but as of episode 3 i can barely watch it in fact it's at the bottom of my to watch list for the week this is a sad state of affairs the <UNK> channel really destroyed their friday night <UNK> whatever happened to the glory days of <UNK> stargate atlantis and bsg on friday nights they had a good thing there
<START> i can't understand why many imdb users don't like this movie why they think it's <UNK> bad etc it's not worse than anything else out there personally i think soldier is a great movie far better than most other films in the same genre br br reasons why i liked soldier kurt <UNK> connie <UNK> jason scott lee the script david <UNK> peoples great visual effects and the directing paul anderson br br i even think that this is the best work i've seen from director paul anderson who has previously directed the entertaining mortal <UNK> and the not so entertaining event horizon
<START> the angry red planet <UNK> review br br like the man from planet x this is a bizarre science fiction tale <UNK> from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing meaning we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo science <UNK> as science fiction and yes it's another classic released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound by <UNK> movies br br so the main reason to watch this film oh it's definitely the whole time our space crew is on mars what you thought angry red planet referred to <UNK> prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew <UNK> a space ship inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist <UNK> banter aimed at the <UNK> female member of the crew it'd be somewhat offensive by today's standards if it weren't so damn funny but mars is the real reason we're watching this thing the film is generally black and white but mars well mars is screaming bloody red it's filmed in this bizarre red <UNK> sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of <UNK> <UNK> it's really quite a <UNK> are the ha ha aliens viewers are to witness the best being the <UNK> you think that's a joke that's what they call it in the movie it's a gigantic <UNK> small puppet of a thing combining traits of rats bats <UNK> and <UNK> it <UNK> along all <UNK> and scares the sh t out of our heroic crew there are other weird and poorly imagined aliens to be seen but that one takes the cake eventually after their harrowing experience on mars the sexist crew boards their ship and returns to whatever planet it was they came from br br this ain't for everyone science fiction film buffs curiosity <UNK> and some general film buffs fans of mystery science theater 3000 will have a field day with this one if they never got to it on the show br br 2 10 modern score 6 10 nostalgia score 4 10 overall br br www <UNK> com
<START> this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption i loved the transformation of the brother and the <UNK> of the horrible disease on the family well acted and well directed if there were any flaws i'd have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again what about all people of all cultural backgrounds i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life nevertheless the film <UNK> in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes
<START> star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between <UNK> behind the <UNK> br br some <UNK> gone missing and some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of <UNK> destruction so josh <UNK> chuck norris and his cocky young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mills a different actor from the previous film with the assistance of <UNK> adopted daughter <UNK> jennifer <UNK> set out to stop them br br this was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of 9 11 filmed in 2001 norris himself even commented afterwards how <UNK> the plot line to the film <UNK> what happened in downtown new york that day so <UNK> have been those that would have been in the mood for a film where norris and his side kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else other than that it's as <UNK> as anything norris has ever been in it makes you wonder what the original did to warrant a sequel in the first place and whether if this one could get made a <UNK> man 3 might come out sometime soon br br if you've seen one norris film you've really seen them all and there's really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one but at least you know what you're getting and like i said it might have been just what some needed to let off some steam
<START> this film the <UNK> thirteen days to glory is utter rubbish the acting is awful it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best historians would have a field day it does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long rating out of
<START> i saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of fast forward film festivals where we would set out to rent a bunch of b movies and vote for who picked the worst br br the night we watched this it was voted the best due to semblance of plot and fun <UNK> br br this is certainly a silly <UNK> movie to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching low budget fluff personally however i wouldn't recommend additional <UNK> this movie will leave it's own mark on you br br it made enough of an impression on me that i've actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few years br br a good choice if you are setting out to watch bad movies this one is fun and i remember <UNK> music
<START> as jack <UNK> directorial debut drive he said displays at the least that he is a gifted director of actors even when the story might seem to lose its way to the audience and to a modern audience if they can find it which pops up now and again on ebay it might seem more free formed than they think the film contains vivid interesting characterizations the film tells of two college kids the protagonist is hector william <UNK> in what borders on a break out performance a star of the <UNK> the college basketball team he plays on while he has to deal with a coach bruce dern who puts on the pressure to stay focused and a on and off girlfriend karen black with her own emotional problems there's gabriel michael <UNK> the other kid gabriel it seems is just a little more than freaked out by the possibility to be <UNK> and so in his own radical mind state he does what he can to keep out but as hector tries to find the balance between his <UNK> fame and those he loves gabriel is going over the <UNK> of sanity br br nicholson on the technical side of things displays a fascinating editing style that keeps things on edge during the basketball scenes and <UNK> darkness in many other scenes with a documentary feel throughout and from <UNK> black and even robert <UNK> writer of <UNK> last detail and mission impossible among others who rarely acts he <UNK> some credible acting work though in <UNK> there is a tendency to <UNK> his emotions in some scenes for example when he could act brilliantly sarcastic he doesn't play it for what it's worth from <UNK> on the other hand there is a vibrant twisted force in his performance and as he <UNK> it's frightening but perhaps understandable from the times and what a climax dern steals most of his scenes by the way in a performance that should have garnered him an oscar nomination every line of his dialog is appropriate true and it's never <UNK> up like in recent coach movie performances br br but what drags down the film is that elements involving the characters aren't explained to the degree one might wish more the film was based on a novel by jeremy <UNK> who co wrote the script with nicholson and i was expecting that the film to be longer than it was it's a slim volume with a lot of information about the times about the sport about the underlying feelings that were with those of the younger generation nicholson presents us with these characters and situations and rarely are they shown to what's <UNK> them the anti war <UNK> not included their <UNK> understandable enough gabriel is <UNK> by what's going on in vietnam but what else is there hector too is a guy who has <UNK> about being <UNK> for the <UNK> and he still loves to play but what's holding him back this whole atmosphere is intriguing how the late 60's college basketball experience was but that intriguing quality which does lead to some <UNK> is kept at a point where it can't go too further overall the effect of the film as a whole is bittersweet and somewhat memorable for its good points and not for it's low ones and for sure you can tell who's behind the lens every step of the way b
<START> bill and ted's bogus journey is the sequel to bill and ted's excellent adventure their bogus journey <UNK> almost directly after the first movie and does just as good of a job if not better to entertain the viewer br br the plot is an evil person from the future is trying to kill bill and ted using evil robots that look exactly like bill and ted once the robots kill bill and ted they must compete with the grim <UNK> death and return their lives to normal br br the acting in the movie is top notch and even thought it is a little weird at times especially bill and ted's conversations it is a great movie the wannabe <UNK> sure have made another great movie pick this up the next time your at blockbuster
<START> this film is fantastic finally well written characters you can love for all their good and bad pierce brosnan is flat out hysterical in this self <UNK> role i think its the best thing he's ever done he's done other roles that <UNK> shades of being capable of this kind of fully <UNK> work but this role finally gave him the room to run with it i almost died when he walked across the hotel <UNK> in his underwear and boots and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to <UNK> too as well as actors to <UNK> too kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly <UNK> you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back
<START> this is a bad movie in the traditional sense but taken for what it is meant to be it is quite good very funny and well made although there are a few death scenes that are in bad taste what with <UNK> breasts as a girl <UNK> and so on
<START> like one of the previous <UNK> said this had the <UNK> of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery such a waste because <UNK> performance was eerie and williams was believable i just kept waiting for it to get better i don't think it was bad editing or needed another director it could have just been the film it came across as a canadian movie something like the first few seasons of x files not cheap just hokey also it needed a little more suspense something that makes you jump off your seat the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy this movie needs to have a director's cut that tries to fix these problems
<START> my comment is limited generally to the first season 1959 60 br br this superb series was one of the first to be <UNK> in color and it was highly influential in <UNK> americans that they had to buy a color television set which was about <UNK> in 1959 the equivalent of more than 3 000 today how many of us would pay that much for the <UNK> of watching a show <UNK> by a <UNK> ray picture tube on a 17 inch screen i was eleven when the series began and i watched it from the beginning br br watching it now 50 years later several things come to mind first many of the story lines involve the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> of silver mining which dates to <UNK> for <UNK> the weapons and clothes are for the most part not authentic the <UNK> are left out of the discussion that's basically a <UNK> br br and it would have been impossible for ben to have arrived in the lake <UNK> area in <UNK> and to have <UNK> a 100 square mile ranch in the next twenty years <UNK> were still trying to solve the <UNK> <UNK> problem as late as <UNK> and the gold rush did not even begin until two years later br br indians are not played by native american actors john ford was using native american actors in the 1920s the bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later that is a major <UNK> for me br br there are other time line problems in season 1 mark <UNK> appears and he is depicted as a middle aged man mark <UNK> was 24 years old in <UNK> the stories also <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> pre civil war and what was more suitable for an <UNK> time frame there are continuity problems over and over br br it is somewhat off putting too that there is so much killing in the first season in time the killing was reduced br br many of the episodes take a socially liberal <UNK> which would be hard to believe given the time line but give the writers credit for <UNK> the <UNK> shifts in the <UNK> attitudes beginning in the 1960s br br having said all that the acting is good and i have come to conclude in my latter years that <UNK> character was drawn better than any other's i don't think <UNK> roberts ever got the credit he deserved also season 1 <UNK> the fact that dan <UNK> <UNK> was a good actor br br many of the stories trace real historical events the guest stars were interesting br br this was great family entertainment and the series stands up very well by any measure
<START> in short br br spike lee clearly has a lot on his mind he's thinking about racism color <UNK> media and <UNK> <UNK> and capitalism religion <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> politics of the drug war etc etc br br that level of consciousness on is own is great i think it is a <UNK> that more and more people are choosing to <UNK> examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives the silent and invisible forces that <UNK> our societies however just because lee is making <UNK> films does not make him a good film maker br br what comes across in jungle fever is a superficial understanding of these <UNK> political forces this is largely the result of two main failures br br firstly lee is simply trying too hard he seems to be desperately trying to <UNK> every political social statement he can think of into the <UNK> and as such the end result seems confused and <UNK> as he allows himself no time to develop characters that can fully <UNK> the ideas he hopes to present and so he <UNK> stereotypes and we are left with rushed <UNK> and very loaded dialogs the end result is very staged and unrealistic br br secondly by attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of societal functions he appears to have no <UNK> or original interpretation of the social political issues presented what comes across is a <UNK> of <UNK> non sense you feel that he bought an <UNK> level <UNK> text book and <UNK> out all 500 pages br br these are highly <UNK> features because the artistry of film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a <UNK> for the voice of the voice of the filmmaker he is unable to distance himself from the work and allow it to speak for itself br br it functions neither as a piece of art nor a sound political argument br br although i still do appreciate lee bringing up these important issues i must say br br two thumbs down
<START> this was my favourite film as a child and i have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite <UNK> and i doubt anybody could ever re make the story of oliver twist on screen any better than this one did br br my all time favourite <UNK> <UNK> has to be oliver reed as bill <UNK> not only did he scare the life out of my when i watched it as a 6 year old but now as a woman i can empathize more with <UNK> character the bar maid prostitute who helps oliver get the life he deserves br br jack <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> was fantastic and i don't think anybody could ever out do him as the street pocket <UNK> and best friend of fagin the music is fantastic especially <UNK> numbers i'm also quite thankful they didn't give bill <UNK> a musical number it wouldn't of worked with him being such a sinister character br br i think carol reed did an excellent job of <UNK> <UNK> ending keeping it a g rated movie by <UNK> her beating but giving enough away to show the violence of bill towards her br br this movie is both charming and charismatic as a musical sing along as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life
<START> feast of all saints where when br br was the feast of all saints storyline and theme edited out br br what a waste of a wonderful title there is never anything in the story that has the <UNK> connection to the feast of all saints nor is there anything in the story about all souls day which the term is <UNK> why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about all souls day or the feast of all saints br br <UNK> bad script amateur writing br br how did they attract such great talent to this <UNK> the writing is so amateur characters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience not at all the way people talk to each other br br what was the director thinking br br the directing is equally bad the forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish in one scene a character is yelling take your hands off of me and no one is touching him the most badly directed scene however is the incredibly over the top battle scene at the beginning of the film br br excessive gore in a very fake silly battle scene br br there are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene it looks like a saturday night live skit you can see extras waiting for their <UNK> to walk across camera everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys <UNK> every little gasp and <UNK> the blood on battle victims is so excessive and <UNK> applied it looks like someone used a <UNK> <UNK> and just <UNK> straight lines of red on the costumes br br this whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie you almost expect someone like will ferrell and mike myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline br br who in real life would ever behave this way br br the most ridiculous bit of writing directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene br br a little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father who is terribly <UNK> and literally dripping blood form his <UNK> wounds even a totally idiot would know he is dead yet she is very <UNK> repeating over and over daddy daddy while looking at someone off screen she delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day br br even if the poor kid had any acting skills the scene is completely unbelievable the little girl wouldn't even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies while she <UNK> stands there natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified running away from the bloody carnage br br are we suppose to be horrified or laugh br br one particularly goofy detail that gives the scene an snl satire tone is the father hanging with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek he looks like a fish on a hook the unintentionally funny details make the whole scene come across as fake and silly br br in fantasy la la land mothers and daughters are the same age br br another funny detail is that you see a central character the little girl's mother at the end of the scene and in the next scene that occurs 20 years later she looks exactly the same she is still young and beautiful and now the same age as her daughter br br i almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful but i tried to stick it out because i wanted to see the <UNK> settings and i like all the actors i don't know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles br br who was the targeted audience br br the excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are <UNK> out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows it is also a strange way to start a movie that for the rest of the time seems targeted to romance novel reading females weird <UNK> in tone
<START> i'm a bit conflicted over this the show is on one hand awful the acting is terrible even when we get actual name actors like brad pitt and bill <UNK> in one episode the dialogue is moronic and the premise moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short there's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes and robert <UNK> cameos are short pointless and corny in a sort of a bob <UNK> on america's funniest home videos kind of way br br on the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television the 80s fashions the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of the view at all times the premises lend the material more to self parody than scares so we're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his <UNK> his girlfriend will dump him and his parents <UNK> him another is afraid she'll be locked up in prison because she's a <UNK> mom her husband is played by brad pit another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home another is afraid she'll be confused with her socially retarded twin another is afraid if he doesn't break up his mom and step dad he'll get killed for having a party at his house the list goes on and on br br being that these are dreams i suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices but they're so out of left field that there's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience you have characters dressed like something out of a 80s themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point typically watching as a <UNK> character does something <UNK> of a sane person while our main character stares <UNK> and too shocked to do anything about it br br if you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away if you're looking on the other hand for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever watch it br br its been showing on <UNK> tv lately pretty much every day and i've been watching earlier out of morbid curiosity and now just so i can get a good laugh in each day with arrested development and extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now
<START> what a great movie this is so reminiscent of the wonderful disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's i was so pleasantly surprised after the past 20 years of absolute <UNK> disney's live productions <UNK> have <UNK> out br br this movie is an absolute joy the child stars were just that professional quality actors i am most impressed with the quality of this movie br br <UNK> weaver was a total <UNK> insert <UNK> here running a prison camp for <UNK> boys <UNK> fallon was wonderful as the <UNK> mother br br i won't <UNK> the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again but the story is wonderful the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb this work reminds you what it's like to be a child without going all <UNK> or being too grim the deleted scenes featured on the dvd version were truly best left deleted they were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it while the abuse was hinted in the finished product it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent it was best that way br br this was an absolutely delightful movie to watch br br it gets a 9 10 from br br the fiend
<START> enchanting romantic innovative and funny the vision of this extraordinary film is almost <UNK> <UNK> better known death romances such as ghost while we know <UNK> that peter and june will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long long <UNK> the joy is in the journey the moral of the tale of course is timeless love <UNK> all but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a <UNK> <UNK> of sweeping vision and gripping <UNK> with more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures the <UNK> vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later far into the cgi era br br yet for all the <UNK> scale powell and <UNK> knew an essential truth the best story is told at the smallest level the wonderfully <UNK> romantic aspect of <UNK> is captured with ultimate simplicity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on a rose <UNK> br br this film like the story and the set itself is one for the ages
<START> masters of horror the <UNK> solution starts as america is being infected by an <UNK> virus that affects the male population when <UNK> men <UNK> kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of god scientist alan <UNK> <UNK> is brought in by the government knows more than most senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife anne <UNK> norton to take their teenage daughter amy <UNK> o'brien try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on them br br this canadian american co production was episode 7 from season 2 of the masters of <UNK> tv series directed by joe <UNK> i thought the <UNK> solution was pretty bad i personally think the script by sam <UNK> sucks it takes itself far too seriously i don't really understand why it's part of the masters of horror series the horror that the filmmakers are going for in the <UNK> solution is in the actual story itself themes ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the <UNK> <UNK> message it sees intent on <UNK> down our throats whenever it's gets the chance during it's short 60 odd minute running time which i felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up i wasn't happy with the inconsistencies with the story either if men only kill when sexually <UNK> why does the flight attendant casually break that woman's neck on the plane was he sexually <UNK> i think not why does every bloke then think he's killing in the name of god i just can't see every single bloke on earth suddenly knowing the bible starting to believe in god i just found the notion ridiculous the show also states clearly that there's nothing religious about what's going on so what's the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see then there's the fact people get turned on by different things what about gays for instance will they kill guys instead of women i know there's a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it's conveniently <UNK> to one side then there's the thing which annoyed me the most the fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened it just felt so stupid the plotting is rubbish to round things off there's a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of the x files 1993 2002 with a bright <UNK> alien br br director <UNK> on this showing definitely doesn't qualify as a master of horror as far a i'm concerned the story is badly paced it's just so stupid considering it's played deadly straight instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it's deadly virus on the loose situation the subsequent mother daughter on the run because of it there's very little here in the way of what i would call effective horror even less gore there's a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own <UNK> with said bottle another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about br br technically like the other episodes it's really good it doesn't have the look of a cheap tv series the special effects are great as usual it's well made the acting is alright but no one really stood out br br the <UNK> solution is easily the worst masters of horror episode i've seen but bear in mind i haven't seen all of them yet as a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me as a show made by a so called master of horror it disappoints me even more
<START> i joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a film i wasn't drawn in for even a second the characters were all one dimensional they threw every topic they could think of hoping something would stick i would bet and hope that everyone involved in teachers looks back with embarrassment there are some great actors here but you would never know it thank god it didn't destroy morgan <UNK> or judd <UNK> or nick <UNK> or laura <UNK> careers there was no vision no labor of love here only a horrible effort gone wrong btw i don't think the writer ever set foot in a real school
<START> at a <UNK> discussion that i attended after viewing this film the filmmakers stated that one should look at this not as a movie but a <UNK> of thought well the only thoughts that were <UNK> from me were of the time wasted watching the movie the gimmicks of the film documentary style futuristic setting served as <UNK> of what was supposed to be a thoughtful examination of the abortion debate this film illustrates the problem when people try to use film as a platform for their political views usually a very boring movie that <UNK> to the choir
<START> george p <UNK> rambo first blood part ii is pure wish <UNK> the united states clearly didn't win the war in vietnam they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh so innocent soldiers the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen the character of rambo is perfect to notice this he is extremely patriotic <UNK> that us americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but <UNK> for leading officers and politicians like every film that <UNK> the war e g we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a <UNK> reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single us american soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than <UNK> them do we get to win this time yes you do
<START> i must admit when i read the description of the genre on netflix as steamy romance i was a little bit skeptical steamy in a movie from 1968 i was prepared for disappointment and when i realized it was shot entirely in black white i knew my erotic hopes were <UNK> br br boy was i wrong not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance the discovery of first love fear of the secret being found out a sudden unexpected end but at times this movie was downright erotic you will soon forget that it is shot in black white the cinematography deserves every <UNK> it has received over the years and the performances from the two stars <UNK> <UNK> and anna <UNK> are intense and memorable ok so they're both in their mid <UNK> trying to play school girls it's 1968 do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much br br i think this movie was way ahead of its time the level of <UNK> was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination <UNK> instead to give us poetic <UNK> to add to what we were shown br br i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it won't be all you expect i don't think you'll be too too disappointed
<START> <UNK> melodrama taken from a william gibson story produced by john <UNK> and directed by <UNK> minnelli richard widmark heads up posh <UNK> rural nervous asylum where his loose wife battles with self <UNK> queen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and widmark himself gets the <UNK> eye for staff newcomer lauren bacall who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child <UNK> and muddled set in an <UNK> time and place and with a david and lisa love story hidden in the <UNK> <UNK> widmark and bacall do have some good chemistry together but this script gives them nothing to build on for precisely an hour most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the <UNK> hanging in the library this thread isn't used as symbolism rather it's a red <UNK> in a non mystery the picture hopes to show the <UNK> that <UNK> people come to when they're working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right but unfortunately the <UNK> way minnelli <UNK> this <UNK> is neither informative <UNK> nor entertaining from
<START> when will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world if you realise this then expect to have <UNK> of fun while watching bill and ted's bogus journey this is a movie that is <UNK> of fun to watch keanu and alex make a great on screen team <UNK> their characters from bill and ted's excellent adventure with even more <UNK> then they had in 1st movie it's not rocket science but it's great for a laugh the characters being extremely like able and the story line being so radical you have to laugh don't expect <UNK> and <UNK> just expect pure fun
<START> in <UNK> <UNK> the upper middle class teenagers <UNK> <UNK> and gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class they go to a party with drugs and booze on the next day after their classes the date of <UNK> in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl the girl dies they panic and decide to get rid off the body but <UNK> mother arrives <UNK> with gabriel and rolls the <UNK> breaking her neck the trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage <UNK> but along the night other <UNK> happen br br the <UNK> and shameful <UNK> de <UNK> is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth and is certainly the worst brazilian movie that i have seen along many years the shallow tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste the screenplay is not funny with stupid lines and dialogs and boring manipulative and silly <UNK> with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end the acting is terrible apparently with many <UNK> but no talent and i was disappointed with presence of the promising <UNK> <UNK> in this trash the camera framing cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality the sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking probably it is a plus since this flick sucks the gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex exploitation my vote is one awful br br title brazil <UNK> de <UNK> bed of the cat
<START> this show is so full of action and everything needed to make an <UNK> show but best of all it actually has a plot unlike some of those new reality shows it is about a <UNK> girl who escapes from her military holding base i totally suggest <UNK> the dvds i've already <UNK> them i suggest you do to
<START> i can't believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10 i could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that i was a huge fan the 1st season i was hooked all the mystery suspense unexplained events you never knew what was going to happen next by season 2 i was still watching <UNK> but was getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained and instead of giving you more answers it just seemed like more questions i love suspense but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching br br now i can't even remember what finally turned me off but somewhere in season 2 i had enough i'm not a big fan of <UNK> viewing and you clearly can't miss an episode to stay up on what's happening so it was no longer worth the effort to me br br it's a shame that they couldn't have been a little smarter and more <UNK> of the loyal fans i agree with some of the posters that it appears abc just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out don't they realize that in the end they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain
<START> a fabulous film with everything you could want in a film huge battle scenes and lots of other action suspense and a romantic love story br br kind of like an old <UNK> film totally entertaining from start to finish br br the editing was fast and you are never bored for a second the story is like a classic story of trouble in the royal household the actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent the costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative the special effects are amazing too br br gary stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at he looks like a sure bet for super stardom br br john rhys davies is wonderful as he usually is he is one of the great actors of our time br br and cindy <UNK> ex miss thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady even doing an english accent with remarkable success br br i found out that the film has won numerous awards and i can see why br br all in all this is an amazing independent film see it for sure br br i highly recommend it and give it a ten
<START> it is not often i watch a film that is as dreadful as this one i continued to watch every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously well as seriously as this genre <UNK> br br the acting was <UNK> and the situations horribly contrived and clichéd if a film was made in <UNK> for example and had the quality of hide seek <UNK> in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive as it happens this film was made in 2000 and i have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this one br br definitely not for the serious movie goer br br not worth a rating
<START> opening scene <UNK> why hurt is later <UNK> to the <UNK> man' too bad it doesn't explain anything else how did he get whatever he <UNK> what was it why does it work so fast then we go to present day <UNK> ok was the opener in the past or the future it turns out to be the past of course but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the <UNK> of the movie moved to the beginning sorry i should have paid closer attention huh or maybe it's just badly done then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he's had in related fields and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him <UNK> so the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects he must have been one of the top guys he's friends with the c e o of the chemical company for god <UNK> then there's the substance itself technically a poison but it <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> so we can have whatever we want a poison a disease an <UNK> reaction all very different things in real life magically it's not <UNK> from one dying victim to another only from the <UNK> how convenient then there's the h a z m a t <UNK> they jump into a situation without having any idea what's in store or how prepare for it did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance i kept thinking hurt was going to die from bad <UNK> technique and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all
<START> <UNK> funny that sums this movie up in one word what the crap was this thing since it might kill me to use the word movie i hope the director writer and producer didn't mean for this to turn out good because it sure didn't a scientist turning his son into a hammerhead shark and the shark killing a bunch of people the scientist invited to the island oh my <UNK> i hate this film so much that when i was watching it i laughed at all the serious parts because they were so corny and <UNK> and they couldn't have made the shark look more unrealistic even though this thing had a bit larger budget than most low budget movies all i have to say is watch this movie expecting to laugh at all the bad acting and stupid corny dialogue because if you are expecting a good movie you'll be highly disappointed
<START> it was and a simpler time the seventies a simpler place san francisco where a man could make a simple movie about a drug crazed psychotic re <UNK> of christ as a woman on acid with never ending dream sequences and inter cut flashbacks while having a multi racial inter gender <UNK> regardless of financial <UNK> or moral <UNK> br br this movie tedious slow boring is the worst example of the kind of pretentious heavy handed art school dreck that passed as art in the midst of the 70's and i love it once this train wreck of endless slow motion zoom ins and heavy <UNK> echo chamber acid guitar <UNK> starts you can't take your eyes off of it until the ridiculous and absurd end its kind of a cross between jesus christ superstar beyond the valley of the dolls and a really crappy acid trip with your parents on a water bed its simultaneously a train wreck completely fascinating and also a great <UNK> of the worst or best elements of b grade seventies <UNK> film genre br br the plot br br i'll just tell you the plot because you will hardly be able to tell whats happening due to the constant cross edited flashbacks to events that may or may not have happened to characters that may or may not be themselves and the face painted <UNK> freak <UNK> endlessly <UNK> about in banal sequences of performance art level <UNK> like street theater br br logan is a really annoying <UNK> film maker who yells at people <UNK> and is surrounded by a mostly silent film crew who are always dropping acid and having what seem like really bad <UNK> richard <UNK> has an <UNK> role as what seems like the <UNK> the film crew seems to hate him for some reason and break out into <UNK> laughter perhaps to torment him suzanne the titular character is a <UNK> blond who stairs <UNK> into space and <UNK> the totally insane artist character the artist is going completely mad by the way either from his <UNK> overacting or the incredible awfulness of his paintings all of course terrible <UNK> of <UNK> there are some other characters that randomly show up a <UNK> <UNK> the man character who also is all hot for suzanne i guess he has a monologue i couldn't really ever figure out what he had to do with the story except everyone had to hate the man back then and you couldn't make a movie without one there is also a mute girl the mute girl pays off in the end trust me its incredibly stupid
<START> i will probably always go to see a woody <UNK> movie as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile sadly however this film just <UNK> make it on any score saying <UNK> actually makes me sad and even a little guilty i'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of woody but what can one say it's probably time for him to concentrate on his <UNK> which in my opinion he is rather quite good saying all of this i'll still probably go to any new film woody may come out with in the future there's always hope and i'll continue to love and respect the woody
<START> as far as heist movies go this one is pretty weak continuity is pretty lousy there isn't enough character continuity to really feel like you understand any of the characters peter falk is great and he is one of the reasons its worth watching falk has some great lines like he'll be right back he <UNK> buy to some <UNK> or something like that there are a few nice scenes although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors direction script and editing is pretty lousy
<START> as far as cinematography goes this film was pretty good for the mid 50's there were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus the acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were non existent the attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick <UNK> and strings i also couldn't help but think the budget didn't allow them to <UNK> the house so they kept making references to the <UNK> and that all the things in <UNK> should be coming soon honestly it would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie it wasn't bad enough to be a good bad movie but wasn't good enough to be good either get the mst3k version it's more fun
<START> this is the most disturbing film i have ever seen it makes <UNK> for a dream look like a disney film although technically it is reasonably well made acting cinematography music directing etc are good however the <UNK> gang rape scene is the most appalling and violent thing i have ever seen and i really wish i had not seen it i am afraid that it will haunt me for the rest of my life although i think anyone would find the film extremely disturbing my wife and some of her friends were <UNK> in a very similar manner and i really didn't need an explicit reminder of the horror that they experienced i saw the film at the <UNK> film festival in austin <UNK> and none of the cast or crew were in <UNK> i would have liked for them to have had the opportunity to defend the violence in their film which i felt was excessive gratuitous and unnecessary an earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood they were apparently <UNK> for but without <UNK> your face in the extreme and explicit sexual violence this film should have a big warning label on it for these reasons i would not recommend anyone seeing it you've been warned
<START> no one goes to a movie like the hills have eyes 2 and expects the second coming of citizen kane the same is true for the majority of low rent horror flicks especially those roger ebert has dubbed dead teenager movies the hills have eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a dead teenager movie only here the teenagers have been given the superficial appearance of military <UNK> br br some will argue the line it's only a movie when questionable facts are raised in a movie review but i've always been a firm believer that all good fantasy must be <UNK> in reality in order to be effective in the hills have eyes 2 we're to believe the main characters are military people on a training exercise but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert the dialog is awful and frequently vulgar to excess though the films aren't nearly comparable i kept imagining these soldiers being in platoon and <UNK> with dread br br very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than <UNK> and <UNK> radio <UNK> are carried out like teenage phone conversations a colonel is <UNK> as hey <UNK> by a private and nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do or any sense of command structure when things begin to go wrong i think of the soldiers in james <UNK> aliens a film of pure fantasy and how even those futuristic marines <UNK> like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations fantasy <UNK> in reality br br i try to begin watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10 and judge it's strengths and weaknesses from there you have to allow <UNK> for the material there's no way star wars is as good of a movie as the godfather on equal terms but both are excellent examples of their type br br in that respect while the hills have eyes 2 is a pretty dreadful exercise in amateur and immature writing it's only <UNK> worse in that regard than the typical dead teenager movie on a technical side the movie appears to have decent production values and is pretty well made from that perspective scenes that are intended to shock or which are intended to evoke urgency or suspense generally work so while watching the hills have eyes 2 may indeed be a fate worse than death there are certainly far worse horror flicks in <UNK> br br it's worth a watch for those who enjoy this type of stuff without the usual <UNK> <UNK> or those who don't tend towards thinking every movie they see is either the best ever or the worst ever of all time if you don't get horror especially the dead teenager variety you're not likely to have a good time with this one br br 4 10
<START> how to lose friends alienate people is in all honesty one of the best comedies i've seen this year along with <UNK> express and step brothers its not one of those gross out comedies that heavily relies on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at an <UNK> pace and you will be easily attached to the unfolding narrative simon pegg nails it in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fish out of water character and is quickly <UNK> himself from the <UNK> he once <UNK> to back in england the other two would be nick frost and edgar wright getting yourself in the top of the hollywood food chain is a hard thing to do as we can clearly see with pegg his first <UNK> at the lead role was david <UNK> comedy run <UNK> run but it received <UNK> reviews from critics and audiences alike his second try is this movie got fairly positive reviews from the majority but was a flop in the box office i for one still haven't lost faith in him and i'll still be there whenever he wants to take that third shot for glory br br other characters were well cast from jeff bridges to danny huston and gillian anderson surprisingly kirsten dunst in my opinion <UNK> well in this movie as the love angle to <UNK> character however the spark that i saw in interview with the vampire is still lost she needs to find it fast or she might suffer the consequences of being lost in the land of <UNK> <UNK> forever
<START> i am as many are a fan of tony scott films when this movie came out i had high hopes that it would be like <UNK> on <UNK> to find out that the movie it's the <UNK> thing from it the story was <UNK> water from the get go and the choice of mickey rourke was not such such a good idea and the whole <UNK> was too gratuitous br br the movie is centered around <UNK> <UNK> and this movie reveals that she'll never become a movie star the movie brought some of the worst acting ever br br i like tony scott's direction <UNK> all but this takes the whole <UNK> cake sorry ton 1 out of 10
<START> i have anticipated the various sci fi and thriller type movies this summer but was so disappointed about this particular film while some people walked out of the film i decided to stay only to laugh along with the other <UNK> at the acting lack of suspense ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line i found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film the only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack this is one of those budding star films which they later regret doing in retrospect i wouldn't even rent this one let alone pay more than 5 to see
<START> i admire <UNK> on the <UNK> for its <UNK>  <UNK> hair cutting and masturbation especially from the lead director joe <UNK> they weren't afraid to show <UNK> to everyday private <UNK> unfortunately the film falls under the 'the brown <UNK> realm though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy yes it mirrors <UNK> with a whole lot of nothing going on or too many cinematography shots focused or sincerely <UNK> on absolutely nothing  feet hands or <UNK> again unfortunately i can see why this film was released and why people are renting true life sex scenes and full frontal equally both male and female nudity other than that it was a complete waste of time we quickly learn of a post college male female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex boyfriend other than that we are subjected to the every day events of their boring lives she works for her parents he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer for this all to work the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real neither work and it's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour i e 'the brown bunny ' the only actor that stands out is kate <UNK> and even she does some questionable acting the dvd extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching listening to again i admire the filmmakers especially <UNK> for <UNK> it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower <UNK> but overall the film falls flat it has <UNK> that doesn't fit the scenes too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder other than the soft porn factor why you rented this
<START> mean spirited and down right <UNK> adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its <UNK> but lacks any talent what so ever mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor i have seen a lot of bad film this year but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made
<START> i recently watched belle <UNK> thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an oscar for best foreign language film i was a bit <UNK> by the predictability and simplicity of the film maybe the conflict i had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times aside from predictability of the plot some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline ex a certain event at the wedding at times the film was a bit preachy in it's ideas and in relation to the franco era the film was set in and the church the only thing the film had going for it was the <UNK> moments the scenery and the character of <UNK> being a strong independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics
<START> <UNK> whose previous films such as the circle and <UNK> gold have seemed to range from <UNK> to grim has produced in his new <UNK> a funny <UNK> <UNK> chaotic ensemble piece that ends on a note of <UNK> and heartfelt fun  yet the movie deals with material quite as challenging and relevant as anything else he's done by focusing on a group of <UNK> girl soccer fans caught <UNK> into the pre world cup <UNK> iran match in <UNK> stadium <UNK> brings up issues of national spirit and independent <UNK> and the <UNK>  and sheer absurdity  of the <UNK> religious gender apartheid in a world of modern competition with a majority youth population and urban girls who increasingly think for themselves br br as the film opens we <UNK> join one of the girls in a bus with a father <UNK> a lost daughter this one has a disguise and has national colors as <UNK> but we cringe with her in the knowledge of what's going to happen she's still easily spotted the thing is most of the men around don't really care still rules are rules and once they try to make it through the various <UNK> on the way into the big stadium the would be soccer girls or some of them anyway get rounded up and held in a little compound upstairs in the stadium by some mostly young green and <UNK> soldier cops who have no idea how to deal with these big city girls' independent ideas and would rather be watching the game  whose <UNK> we constantly hear in the background  themselves each girl is different  represents a different set of reasons for wanting to break the rules and different ways of doing it one wore a <UNK> uniform and got into the <UNK> section one is tough and <UNK> and mocking and provocative she could pass for a pretty boy and <UNK> hints at that are you a girl or a boy which would you like me to be one doesn't care very much about soccer but went to honor a dead <UNK> one <UNK> <UNK> is an <UNK> soccer player herself  and so on these <UNK> girls are stubborn and smart and they walk all over the uptight rural lieutenant in charge of them <UNK> <UNK> one of the rural cops <UNK> <UNK> takes the girl soccer player to the men's <UNK> of course there's no <UNK> forcing her to wear a poster of an italian football star as a mask a comedy of errors and chaos follows in which the girl escapes br br later a <UNK> looking van comes with an officer who directs the cops to take the girls to the vice department  <UNK> sexual <UNK> rules qualifies as vice a male gets mixed in with them  a kid who's <UNK> guilty of <UNK> fireworks into the games the van turns out not to be so <UNK> the radio <UNK> is broken but one cop holds it in place so they can listen to the increasingly heart stopping <UNK> cops and prisoners are all joined in a common excitement now there's no score the game goes to penalty kicks and the winner will go to germany br br in the background through all this is a real game a real stadium and real masses of young men crazy about the outcome of this event the excitement is tremendous and the streets are <UNK> with cars and <UNK> and a <UNK> mob of supporters praying for an iranian win and united in their excitement br br what makes this film so good as may be clear by now is that it's shot during the evening of an actual game with a real finale that turns everything around this in contrast to <UNK> previous highly <UNK> narrative <UNK> is spontaneous <UNK> film making that <UNK> in rhythm with a captured background of actual events and <UNK> you into its excitement in ways that are quite thrilling br br the essence of <UNK> is the <UNK> between modern world soccer madness and retro <UNK> social <UNK> <UNK> women  the latter existing at a time when young iranian women are becoming part of a global world in which females participate in sport and share in the <UNK> of national team spirit how exactly do you <UNK> the country's ambition to become a modern global power with social attitudes that are medieval a lot of <UNK> is astonishingly real including the way everybody tries to talk their way out of everything the director's decision to <UNK> young actors into an actual sports mega event leads to a stunningly effective blend of documentary <UNK> and fiction that is too energetic to seem to have a bone to pick and that ends in a way that's brilliant and moving br br i've had <UNK> about <UNK> films before but this one kicks ass <UNK> does something remarkable here he <UNK> his society presents an unusual drama and touches our hearts with a sense of a <UNK> aspirations
<START> most of the bad reviews on this website blame hood of the living dead for one or more of the following reasons 1 it is a low budget movie with virtually no acting 2 it was so bad it made me laugh 3 it is something i could do myself i won't even discuss the first point because it is a very <UNK> matter whether you like low budget and independent stuff or not i must say however that i still fail to understand people renting such a movie as hood of the living dead and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as a romantic comedy with lindsay <UNK> or matthew <UNK> <UNK> as for the second point i really don't see what's so wrong with laughing i personally like to laugh and love movies that make me to be they comedies or horror flicks when in hammerhead i saw this girl stepping into a <UNK> and the shark man came out of it to eat her i just <UNK> up and i was grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun honestly laughing just makes me feel good while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as a bad bad thing if you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie hood of the living dead and low budget flicks are definitely not for you but please don't come and tell us that you find them laughable we already know it this is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place however it is the third point that leaves totally <UNK> just several years ago people were <UNK> up out of theaters to see blair witch project which is a way more <UNK> boring plot less and bad acted movie than hood of the living dead and takes itself way too seriously too moreover half a million people go on youtube every day to see the short films of <UNK> which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend a room and a <UNK> could do not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there why don't people blame those clips for bad acting and non existing plot i think it is one of the best things of our times that everyone with <UNK> technology and a bunch of friends can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests and i feel a certain admiration for people who spend their <UNK> with their friends making a honestly bad yet refreshing piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the mall or playing video games alone leave aside your <UNK> and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking b movies and you'll see that hood of the living dead can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers if you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home made horror movies i recommend <UNK> the ghosts of <UNK> the killer eye monster man don't look in the basement the worst horror movie ever made redneck zombies jesus christ <UNK> <UNK> and habit
<START> the ramones whom i consider the <UNK> of modern punk rock lend their then unique sounds to a <UNK> twisted movie about a <UNK> rock fan p j soles who faces off against a <UNK> <UNK> principal mary <UNK> for the right to rock br br featuring a soundtrack <UNK> with incredible music <UNK> is fascinating in concept and execution it's chock full of <UNK> sight gags like the mouse experiment teenage spirit probably my all time favorite film opening and bizarre off the wall moments the <UNK> scenes if you're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a <UNK> level look no further but if you're looking for a nice <UNK> dramatic epic maybe you should look a wee bit further br br hi everybody i'm riff <UNK> and this is rock roll high school
<START> well i can once and for all put an end to the question <UNK> is the worst movie ever made ever ' it is flight of fury starring and co written by steven seagal sure there are lots of <UNK> bad movies but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously br br it is a romanian made film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become this movie is so bad that you literally feel <UNK> after watching it and need to <UNK> in the corner of the shower and cry knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again br br it was released only on video i can't imagine why and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvd's had to wear protective gear and receive regular <UNK>
<START> the combination of the superb black and white photography and the <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> plot made this a real knock out for me the atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots <UNK> with occasional very bright <UNK> white was gripping there was a superb moment where where <UNK> apparently conventional holiday <UNK> but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly were shown accompanied by <UNK> heart wrenching <UNK> from the <UNK> opera eugene <UNK> br br for me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere last year in <UNK> is a good example of such a film <UNK> is in the same <UNK>
<START> a fun concept but poorly executed except for the fairly good makeup effects there's really not much to it there are obvious problems for example after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size the main character seems to go from normal size to <UNK> thin in days and once he's <UNK> thin he stays pretty much equally <UNK> thin for what seems to be a long time br br in any case the movie has far worse problems than that the cinematography is decidedly low budget tv show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around robert john burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird <UNK> charlton heston <UNK> and is literally painful to watch the only scary thing is that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are both even worse br br the only reason why i'm giving this movie as high as i am is that once the movie enters its last 1 3 or so and joe <UNK> character takes over the movie develops a fun campy <UNK> <UNK> feel and the <UNK> crazy schemes for <UNK> the totally obnoxious <UNK> are somewhat fun to watch the ending if predictable is also nicely mean avoid unless you're a king o <UNK> or are really <UNK> up at the idea of the voice of fat tony from the simpsons <UNK> a gypsy camp
<START> holes originally a novel by louis <UNK> was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well made film starring <UNK> weaver as the warden <UNK> <UNK> as stanley and <UNK> thomas as zero the roles were very well casted and the actors portrayed their roles well br br the film had inter <UNK> <UNK> that all led up to the end the main storyline is about stanley <UNK> and his punishment of spending a year and a half at camp <UNK> the second storyline is about sam and kate <UNK> this plot deals with racism and it is the more deep storyline to the movie the third is about <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which explains the 100 year curse on the <UNK> family in my opinion these <UNK> were <UNK> together very well br br contrary to many people's beliefs i think that you do not have to have read the book to understand the movie the film is reasonably easy to understand br br the acting in the film was well done especially <UNK> <UNK> stanley <UNK> thomas zero <UNK> weaver the warden and jon voight mr sir the other members of d <UNK> jake smith <UNK> max <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> castro <UNK> byron <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> x ray enhanced the comic relief of the movie however the best parts were with zero and stanley who made a great team together br br although holes is a disney movie it deals with some serious issues such as racism shootings and violence the film's <UNK> at some points is very well done br br i would suggest this movie to people of all ages whether they have read the book or not you shouldn't miss it
<START> back in the 70's when i had first seen this i was in high school it was cool then now as an adult i look back at it and i say to myself yeah right what was so funny it has it's moments but they are few and far between it is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up show this to a younger crowd and they will be totally lost if you like this type of humor you may want to stick with kentucky fried movie or amazon women from the moon tunnel vision as well as groove tube are too dated for today's viewing
<START> it was a painful experience the whole story is actually there so i won't go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work i thought working with <UNK> material meant that you should wear <UNK> clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this <UNK> on top a file <UNK> that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a <UNK> labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesn't even tell him anything about it not to mentioned bad acting very bad can't get any worst than that my advice don't watch and i thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently <UNK> <UNK> movies look like classical shakespeare compared to this
<START> this movie is good for tv i like it because i'm a huge fan of disaster films even though this is a family film accuracy on the film from the book is half and half they got the characters names right but in the book there was no storm <UNK> the the car scene involving the <UNK> family running away from the <UNK> wasn't in the book instead it involved dan <UNK> and his friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety and in the book dan and his friend are both 12 years old thats all i can think of overall this was a good movie even though it could of have been a little more accurate to the book did you know the book was based on a true story of a series of <UNK> devastating a small <UNK> town in 1980
<START> yes i know <UNK> had just been invented for the cinema 2 years earlier when this was produced in <UNK> but this film showed that much had to <UNK> about the art of producing films it comes over as a filmed hammy stage play with the actors <UNK> <UNK> their lines rolling their eyes using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema which i suppose was normal during the process of <UNK> them to appear more <UNK> on screen the gaps between lines spoken should have been <UNK> up during editing as it considerably slows the film it is now only of interest for titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film in next <UNK> order they could see titanic 1953 a night to remember 1958 titanic 1997 to see how the <UNK> depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years there have been many documentaries and tv films made including the atrocious <UNK> titanic 1979 on my version which is a dvd david <UNK> gives the introduction it was he who played harold bride <UNK> junior <UNK> <UNK> in a night to remember still the best feature film please read my tribute to walter comments on imdb under howard <UNK> demon co uk and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos entitled end of a dream so he was well <UNK> to give the narration of more interest i found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the <UNK> us <UNK> hearing which is also on the dvd actors speak the actual words spoken by <UNK> 2nd officer j bruce <UNK> managing director of white star harold bride and others including gloria stewart the old rose in titanic 1997 whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors
<START> a film like amazing grace and chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just doesn't get it they never did and <UNK> continues to slip further and further into political oblivion br br this film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons the boy is understandably <UNK> until a <UNK> of professional <UNK> led by former <UNK> star alex english join his cause not just a few of them join the cause by the time his movement reaches its <UNK> entire <UNK> of professional and college sports have to <UNK> their seasons since nobody will play any more just to move this review along i'm prepared to grant them this premise even though it would never happen in a million years i'll just imagine it could then go from there br br i don't quite remember how but some type of <UNK> is reached and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene br br before <UNK> the message of this film let me just say that this film is poorly written acted and directed even if one does agree with the boy's stance it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed and that's a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste peck curtis <UNK> alex english does as well as he could have with his character however and i wish he would try to act in more films alas it's likely much easier to find work in the <UNK> world of the <UNK> one wishes mr english would teach more of these <UNK> <UNK> types of today how to shoot the rock a little better alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the <UNK> br br as far as the film's message in concerned it's just wrong headed plain and simple all of those nuclear <UNK> <UNK> away in those missile <UNK> out west prevented war it would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the use of nuclear weapons these weapons were in fact never used and that was the genius behind their existence neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile without these weapons who knows what might have happened between the usa and <UNK> br br the makers of this film obviously intended for kids in america to take up their cause and follow in <UNK> footsteps kids in america however are more intelligent than the left wing <UNK> who created this dreck br br the film is worth only 2 of 10 stars br br if you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war stick with dr <UNK> instead br br mr <UNK> you are no frank <UNK>
<START> forget that this is a b movie forget that it is in many ways outdated instead give writer director <UNK> <UNK> much deserved credit for addressing a subject which at the time 1950 was taboo in hollywood to my knowledge this was the first film to address the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that that crime has upon its victims br br although much of the <UNK> acting is pedestrian at best <UNK> powers who at the time was <UNK> or <UNK> gives an excellent performance throughout as the traumatized young woman ann who tries to run away from her shame based on her work in this film i'm surprised that she did not have a more successful acting career <UNK> andrews too has some fine moments as the minister who reaches out to help her br br ms <UNK> obviously working on a limited budget was still able to create some memorable scenes such as the pursuit through the streets and <UNK> leading to the rape and the police <UNK> following it and she created a bittersweet ending which left me wondering if ann really could ever have a normal life again
<START> michelle rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the <UNK> force for other actresses to look out for she has the <UNK> to place herself in a rarely seen tough girl role very early in her career and pull it off which is a feat that should be recognized although her later films <UNK> her to that same role this film was made for her <UNK> br br her character is a <UNK> student fighter lover struggling to overcome her <UNK> existence in the projects which is a little overdone in film but not by a girl that aspect of this film isn't very original but the story goes in depth when the <UNK> relationships that this girl has to deal with come to a <UNK> and her primal rage takes over br br i haven't seen an actress take such an aggressive stance in movie making yet and i'm glad that she's getting that original twist out there in hollywood this film got a 7 from me because of the average story of ghetto youth but it has such a great actress portraying a rarely seen role in a minimal budget movie great work
<START> this is the kind of movie that my enemies content i watch all the time but it's not bloody true i only watch it once in a while to make sure that it's as bad as i first thought it was br br some kind of <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> that at least is an improvement over having <UNK> <UNK> a good part of the <UNK> the airplane goes down in the <UNK> triangle and sinks <UNK> to the <UNK> a kind of post <UNK> submarine br br it has one of those all star casts the stars either falling or barely above the horizon br br we're on our own says pilot jack <UNK> he is so right except for george kennedy he's in all these disaster movies br br watch another movie instead oh not airport the original that's no good either instead watch a decent flick about stuck <UNK> like flight of the phoenix
<START> this movie wasn't just bad it was terrible after i watched it i actually felt the need to take a shower to get the filth off of me there is running <UNK> with an elderly couple making out it is not funny but it is disgusting the monster make up was cool but that is all the continuity errors alone will have you angry at least i was the editing is really poor br br almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie even if your group of friends are into <UNK> <UNK> this one is exceptional in its <UNK> i couldn't even bring myself to laugh at it you have been warned
<START> the wit and pace and three show stopping busby <UNK> numbers put this ahead of the over rated <UNK> street this is the definitive 30's musical with a <UNK> frenetic performance from jimmy cagney one of the last releases before the motion picture production code was strictly <UNK> a must see
<START> imagine turning the american national <UNK> into a cartoon throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible <UNK> and a pair of roller <UNK> and you'd find yourself with almost an exact <UNK> of this film br br i remember seeing this when i was younger i made my mother rent it from the video shop about 5 times the story itself isn't too bad it's just that any <UNK> watching would certainly have something to complain about br br if you don't like america you won't like this film
<START> more like psychological analysis of movies but psycho does sound better as a <UNK> the man in charge of the movie the narrator if you will does depict movies here in his own way most of them are classics but all of them are listed here at imdb and i'd strongly advise you to see them especially the hitchcock movies <UNK> conversation and the lynch movies because <UNK> zizek will reference them br br or in other words he might spoil them for you i don't remember if he spoiled more than those i've listed i think the chaplin movies too but as i wrote it'd be best if you watch them all beforehand in the imdb listing there is a movie missing that i did report to them so it might get up there pretty soon it's a meg ryan movie but it's a only a brief <UNK> not big of a deal anyways br br zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to if you're open minded to see things through another perspective even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you it doesn't mean it will do that but it could
<START> of all the movies i have seen and that's most of them this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the u s naval <UNK> <UNK> during the <UNK> ii era yes there are other good <UNK> related movies but most use special effects more than any real time shots this man's navy has considerably more real time footage of <UNK> etc true lots of corny dialog but that's what makes more interesting hollywood movies even today p s i spent 10 years out of 20 and have over 5 000 hours in navy <UNK> of all types from 1949 through 1959 proud member of the naval <UNK> association etc <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> retired
<START> michael bennett and nicholas <UNK> broadway show ran for years but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation which most likely <UNK> from the choice of director richard attenborough as far from b way as you could get and lead actor michael douglas who plays a director choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer the slim story about a <UNK> audition for a broadway show which turns into a therapy session for the actor dancer singers is pushed right up on us with loud <UNK> talents playing to the <UNK> nothing is <UNK> or subtle particularly a laughable subplot about a ex dancer returning to the theater and <UNK> heads with old flame douglas the over eager <UNK> are filled with promise and <UNK> but their personal stories of angst are a little embarrassing this matched with <UNK> <UNK> pacing spells disaster and even the now famous songs fail to break through the artificial <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> if you're as huge of a fan of an author as i am of jim thompson it can be pretty dodgy when their works are converted to film this is not the case with scott <UNK> rendition of after dark my sweet a suspenseful sexually charged noir classic that closely follows and does great justice to the original text jason patrick and rachel ward give possibly the best performances of their careers and the always phenomenal bruce dern might have even <UNK> him self with this one like <UNK> book this movie creates a dark and surreal world where passion <UNK> logic and the double cross is never far at hand a must see for all fans of great noir film
<START> not only did they get the characters all wrong not only do the voices suck not only do the writers seriously need to get girlfriends not only are the drawings really crude but it seems like it was mainly created for ages 1 6 the only episode i've ever seen of this show that kept me watching was a <UNK> of family because i liked the robin character and sometimes i think it's just a general copy of batman the animated series example in <UNK> bruce is friends with harvey <UNK> yeah over a two episode story he transforms into the unlikely villain <UNK> in the show bruce is friends with that ethan guy and over a two episode story he transforms into the unlikely villain <UNK> that was just a small example that may not even be true but in short this is the worst attempt on a batman series and that's saying something
<START> this is one of the most hilariously bad movies i have ever had the <UNK> to see br br i watched this on dvd with a bunch of friends one friday night and we just couldn't stop laughing from start to finish br br the story is simple enough terrorists <UNK> a <UNK> they think is carrying weapons grade <UNK> but it's actually carrying a bunch of man eating dinosaurs easy mistake to make cue a <UNK> incompetent team of army special forces to tackle the <UNK> <UNK> they are led by colonel <UNK> played by scott valentine a man who seems to have <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> acting as <UNK> by joey in friends br br there's plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting but unfortunately <UNK> team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a <UNK> of giant <UNK> monsters also the lights always seem to <UNK> and go out whenever a <UNK> attacks <UNK> so we can't see how bad the creature effects are br br having said all that we all had a great deal of fun <UNK> on who was going to get their head bitten off next br br as a <UNK> park aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a <UNK> <UNK> but as ludicrous tongue in cheek entertainment it's a roaring success
<START> orson welles manages to knock me on my ass with every picture of his i see lady of shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces the magnificent <UNK> touch of evil the trial and <UNK> at midnight the plot can tend to be confusing sometimes and sometimes it seems to be moving maybe a tiny bit too fast about an hour of it was edited out when test <UNK> went poorly it doesn't matter however you can't watch welles' films and manage to concentrate too much on the plot his direction <UNK> what great direction is almost any scene from this film can hold up with any other scene he directed check out the courtroom scene usually they are such stock scenes that i can't stand them case in point try to sit through welles' own speech near the end of <UNK> in lady from shanghai just pay attention to the level of detail in that courtroom scene watch that <UNK> who is always <UNK> and <UNK> the proceedings or just take a look at the lighting in that scene i know it is just a simple <UNK> blind and that it was used constantly in film <UNK> and crime films of the era but welles gives it a beauty all its own the dialogue is also remarkable welles had the skill a skill that no one else seemed to have to make a crime film containing examples of the <UNK> poetry whether he was speaking shakespeare or spitting out hard boiled lines it had the power to stir the soul 10 10
<START> city hall is a somewhat mixed bag part vignettes of nyc political life and part <UNK> tale al pacino a dukakis <UNK> boss with presidential dreams gives an <UNK> times <UNK> or subdued performance there's a couple times when he <UNK> the scenery and in the case of city hall this is where he shines john cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance without going into caricature of a new orleans <UNK> or <UNK> into melodrama during the films climax danny aiello as a <UNK> political chief is also very good i love <UNK> too br br the major problem with city hall and it is a good movie in many ways is the general feeling of a lack of momentum it comes off more like a documentary than a motion picture we see the action or follow the story from a detached perspective and naturally the viewer doesn't become involved when the viewer doesn't get involved to a certain degree they become <UNK> towards the characters and eventually the plot br br this tends to alienate and what should have been a riveting detail <UNK> finale came off as a hmmm uh okay they say you can't fight city hall as the <UNK> worn cliche goes yet it still can't stop you from thinking what might have been if they had just <UNK> up the screenplay and pacing of this movie
<START> after reading the other tepid reviews and comments i felt i had to come to bat for this movie br br <UNK> films tend to have little to do with one another and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark br br what this film is is a thoughtful and <UNK> look at religious faith the only other film like it in terms of its religious message would have to be <UNK> the rapture ' br br i am <UNK> that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural it is a simple movie about catholic faith <UNK> and redemption though you would never guess it till the end it is also the only movie i can think of whose resolution turns literally on a pun br br as a happily fallen catholic myself i know what the movie is about and i find a sort of <UNK> in its ultimate innocence about the relation between god and man but if you are not familiar with the kind of <UNK> on which the film is based then it will go right over you head br br as a film as opposed to a story cold <UNK> it is not ground breaking while the <UNK> is heavy with <UNK> significance and cinematic imagery cold <UNK> <UNK> its own cinematic qualities there are no striking shots no edgy effects no attempts to fit the content to the form it is <UNK> shooting but subdued nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama it is a simple story that unfolds simply it may seem odd but at the end the mystery is revealed it looks ambiguous but with a single line the ambiguity <UNK> in a <UNK> of catholic dogma br br in this regard cold <UNK> has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like the <UNK> ' or the sixth sense ' or final descent ' or <UNK> a pure <UNK> ' all of these are films with a trick up their <UNK> they may <UNK> you along the way but they have a point an obvious one indeed but the fun is at least in part in having been taken in br br still even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line it is worth watching for way it directs and <UNK> you try it especially if you are or have ever been a catholic
<START> i was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary on what it was like to be puerto <UNK> when i heard it was <UNK> <UNK> i wondered could she possibly know what it is really like to be puerto <UNK> as far as i knew she was a <UNK> well anyway i <UNK> sat with my popcorn to watch i realized 10 min into it that my initial <UNK> was right <UNK> <UNK> has little knowledge about what it is like to be puerto <UNK> this documentary is more a 1st hand very very personal account on what it is like to be a <UNK> and all of what that <UNK> she like most of the <UNK> i know have a watered down partial and sometimes twisted sense of history how could they not they live here yes all of them are proud as they should be but a lot don't know the ins and outs of the real culture history and political background or language for the most part it all became very very apparent with her participation in the <UNK> issue regardless of my personal take is on this issue at least i know what the hell the fight is for there is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about and only <UNK> in because it was a puerto <UNK> cause i really don't understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it for those of you that are not puerto <UNK> please view this as a partial account of a woman's journey of self discovery and acceptance do not take this as <UNK> a lot of it isn't even true please consider the source <UNK> is an actress not a <UNK> this movie is not and should never be for other <UNK> the base for their information instead just a step towards finding more info learning and <UNK> what the reality is not just the one coming from this woman's eyes
<START> gorgeous <UNK> production telling the unusual tale of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a <UNK> monk who has left his monastery breaking his <UNK> the film opens at a convent in europe where a former student <UNK> a lonely beauty in black named <UNK> marlene <UNK> she is advised by the mother superior to go to the desert and find herself and lose her grief over her father who has recently died in the train car on the way into the <UNK> she sits opposite a very very troubled man charles boyer our former monk she's soon at a hotel near a palm <UNK> <UNK> where she again sees our mysterious troubled man as he is <UNK> over what to do when confronted by a very seductive dancing girl <UNK> becomes friends with him though knows nothing of his past romance soon to follow br br this film is sentimental melodramatic and different in a way almost surreal and even a bit campy i found it to be quite fun and entertaining the photography in this is really interesting it is full of extreme facial close ups and beautiful color shots of <UNK> of horses crossing the desert <UNK> figures against a sunset sky marlene <UNK> gives a nicely done though restrained performance here and looks gorgeous charles boyer not usually one of my favorites is actually pretty good in this i think the part sort of suits him and he looks quite young and handsome too basil <UNK> is fine here except given very little to do another great <UNK> score by max <UNK> helps keep the drama rolling all in all a very enjoyable film
<START> well this might be one of the funniest movies of all time and sandy gives a tour de force performance alas her career never quite took off but at last she will always be remembered for her three first rate pictures the king of comedy dallas doll and without you i'm nothing she <UNK> into different <UNK> from new york <UNK> to diana ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in america sexy and fierce tender and sensual philosophical and <UNK> she convinces the audience in every scene and she actually is really pretty watch this one if you're not from <UNK> you'll certainly enjoy it
<START> by god it's been a long time since i saw this probably about 18 years ago br br the movie tells us kids all about human blood and the <UNK> system very <UNK> put together disney style animation plus human actors it was directed by frank <UNK> for <UNK> sake br br kind of an <UNK> i wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film <UNK> worth of information on the human body but boy will those kids watching it learn even now i can clearly remember dr <UNK> being challenged by <UNK> himself to name what common material most resembles human blood to which the doctor immediately answers sea water
<START> this highly underrated film is to me what good writing in a movie should be all about <UNK> takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at the movie is about the <UNK> people create to <UNK> themselves from the violence and hatred and <UNK> of everyday life br br along the way we are asked question after question about life davis steve martin with a great beard asks himself <UNK> my making a violent movie and by <UNK> our enjoyment of it causing the violence in society ' claire asks what kind of world throws away something as precious as a human life ' mack is not <UNK> as he asks <UNK> it possible to pass beyond the <UNK> of race and an even harder step <UNK> these are of course not <UNK> from the film but <UNK> others ask their questions too and to be honest it raises more than it answers br br but that is the nature of life we <UNK> all our lives to find answers to questions we will never totally answer and in certain cases have to make answers fit to our own needs and desires as humans we <UNK> on questions we cannot answer some answers are real claire and mack come to realize that even though they could take the easy road and let the state take the baby their finding it placed the responsibility for her life in their hands some answers are not davis sees the <UNK> and decides not to make violent films but the next day turns around and <UNK> his <UNK> as <UNK> to his art br br we all seek answers this movie does not answer them for it simply reminds you to keep looking for the answers br br
<START> for fans of troma or the <UNK> genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you there is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film also the effects can be <UNK> and awesome the plot is ridiculous and refreshing not being <UNK> down to what we as audiences are <UNK> of from films these days br br also notable are the little aliens who i found cute all in all it's a good film for fans of the genre also recommended are films such as <UNK> the iron man and versus for that weird japanese film approach filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed of course seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two
<START> whatever his name is the writer and director should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again this one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time sometimes movies are bad in a way that they're actually sort of good not this one this was so bad i got angry seriously a drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script what a waste all the actors were completely uninspired to work at all the cgi was barely acceptable the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was it's like he just decided i want this to happen and this to happen but i don't care how we got there just shoot it and put it in whatever i'm going back to my trailer to pick my nose if anyone calls for me i'm not here shame on you whatever your name is shame on you
<START> war is hell but this documentary of wwii is heaven br br not only is this series a breath taking almost <UNK> look at the second world war it's a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence olivier br br this documentary series <UNK> the genre it's <UNK> long no doubt but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more i have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a year br br truly this is an impeccable bit of film making other than olivier the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a <UNK> to butcher so they could have something delicious for <UNK> br br i'm going to go watch it right now again my <UNK> time
<START> jon voight is brilliant in midnight cowboy but <UNK> performance though reminiscent of his later turn in <UNK> is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies as a portrayal of a new york character only daniel day <UNK> portrayal of bill butcher in gangs of new york comes to mind as comparable and day doesn't give his character the emotional depth that hoffman gives ratso br br it's typical of <UNK> way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with midnight cowboy is voight i think hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels br br <UNK> buck is so naive that he would <UNK> out of the film altogether except that ratso pulls him down pulls him down but also teaches him a lot about how to survive and more importantly how to live br br midnight cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself i think that as gritty a movie as it is it has a very beautiful message that no matter how much a loser you might be ratso clearly <UNK> loser if you can find a way to be true to yourself you are in possession of the secret of life and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else br br i can't help but compare midnight cowboy to <UNK> from a few years later which i think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape
<START> he's <UNK> <UNK> slightly cross eyed and restless he stands in front of us and calls himself a <UNK> he claims that we  the film viewers  perceive the screen as a toilet bowl and are all secretly wishing for all the s t to explode from the inside he's unpredictable and scary <UNK> come on you could have guessed by now he's one of the leading <UNK> of our age br br <UNK> <UNK> is both a narrator and a subject of sophie <UNK> extraordinary new film a <UNK> guide to the cinema <UNK> illustrates a feature long lecture by <UNK> and does so in two ways by providing <UNK> film clips and putting <UNK> on real or <UNK> locations from the movies he speaks about it's always nice to watch neatly <UNK> scenes from great movies although revenge of the <UNK> got here as well but the main attraction of a <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> himself what makes the movie such fun to watch is the <UNK> question one cannot help but ask over and over again what is more outrageous <UNK> views or <UNK> screen presence in a documentary by <UNK> taylor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at one point <UNK> his fear of being silent because he claimed he feels like he doesn't exist in the first place the only way to make all other people believe he does is to talk constantly and <UNK> and talk he did and how also a <UNK> <UNK> is dominated by his voice  delivering perfect english in most crazy way and making some astonishing points about the cinema br br what are those well for example he sees <UNK> <UNK> towards talking picture as a sign of an universal fear of voice itself kind of alien force taking over the human being  think the <UNK> segment of dead of night 45 he says that the perverse nature of cinema is to teach us to desire certain objects not to provide us with them he <UNK> <UNK> marx as super ego <UNK> as ego and <UNK> as id he says a million other interesting things and all the time we cannot take our eyes off him so <UNK> and captivating are his looks at some point i couldn't help but stare at his thick <UNK> hair and wonder what kind of a brain lays <UNK> underneath <UNK> of course for more insights br br most notable are <UNK> <UNK> of lynch and hitchcock which comes as no surprise since he has written about both of them the <UNK> effect of many brilliantly edited clips from their respective work made those parts of <UNK> lecture memorable and  unlike others  difficult to argue with since he seems to really have gotten things right on these two directors this doesn't go for his reading of <UNK> for example upon whom he relentlessly <UNK> his own utterly <UNK> view of reality <UNK> precisely what's so remarkable in all <UNK> namely strong religious <UNK> and images br br the question isn't whether <UNK> is inspiring and brilliant because he is or whether <UNK> film is worth watching because it is likewise the real question is rather are <UNK> views coherent one smart observation after another make for an overwhelming intellectual ride but after the whole thing is over some doubts remain for example while considering vertigo <UNK> <UNK> states that what's hidden behind human face is a perfect void which makes face itself only a <UNK> something of a deception in its own means however when in the final sequence we hear about the ever shattering finale of city lights <UNK> as being a portrait of one human being fully exposed to another it's hard not to ask what happened to the whole <UNK> <UNK> why should we grant <UNK> face <UNK> value of the real thing and <UNK> kim <UNK> of this same <UNK> in two bold <UNK> or maybe that <UNK> might also be read in <UNK> terms the name of the <UNK> <UNK> french <UNK> is fundamental to <UNK> thought the film has all the virtues of a splendid two and a half hours lecture lots of ground are covered many perspectives employed even some first rate <UNK> made when <UNK> travels on a <UNK> <UNK> boat from the birds <UNK> and tries to think as she did he comes up with i want to f k mitch but it has also one <UNK> that isn't inherent to two and a half hours lecture as such it's almost <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> yarn about how far are we from the real is as good as any other <UNK> yarn but after some 80 minutes it becomes quite clear that one of <UNK> perverse pleasures is to <UNK> on and on changing subjects constantly overall effect is this of being swept away by a giant cool <UNK> wave you're simultaneously taken by surprise <UNK> in mortal danger and confused no end as you finish watching your head is <UNK> with ideas not of your own and you're already planning on re watching some films  but you also share a sense of having survived a <UNK> br br the ultimate question is did <UNK> lost it or haven't we even came close to the real thing once <UNK> becomes <UNK> by <UNK> we shall all meet in a one big cell and finally talk to each other not having any movies around to turn our faces to i dare you all who will have enough guts to approach <UNK> and defy him my guess is that once you look into those eyes in real life you become a believer
<START> the scarecrow was on of the funniest killers i have ever seen in the act plus he's really <UNK> most of the time he jumped around which was awesome also he had an excellent voice i mean it was just perfect for him the story lines was excellent too i like how the kids soul was transferred into scarecrow that was cool plus he did have a reason for all that killing i mean after what those people did to him i would be angry too scarecrows look was really good his look gives that person an <UNK> reaction when they see him which was great the stares he got were funny those people were stupid who would stare for that long they should of <UNK> and ran for their lives even though that wouldn't of made a difference
<START> the third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear it is a political film more than a plain entertainment jason bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the <UNK> he was <UNK> to in order to kill his old identity he really killed some one who became his corpse but the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the cia within a <UNK> program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at <UNK> all american citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people who was one essential officer of the cia up to 1980 when he became vice president that goes along with what is being said on the internet then the truth will come thanks to jason bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the cia is a woman and that woman gets the <UNK> involved in a general investigation a woman and the <UNK> read my lips in the usa politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign it is music and the cinema right now hollywood and beyond the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are using the cinema in general and this film in particular to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the <UNK> so go and watch the film it is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet <UNK> of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for but no one is able to pretend it won't come the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK> university <UNK> saint quentin en <UNK>
<START> dolph lundgren stars as a former cop boxer who <UNK> <UNK> kinky scene to find out who killed his brother who was well thought of in the community however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame dolph lundgren is very good in this movie in fact on the basis of his performance here one would forget <UNK> rise to fame involved action roles that said the material gives lundgren nothing to work with in fact lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible co star <UNK> brett is also good in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of lundgren and brett indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would've been fairly decent however the movie is lackluster the action is non existent the plot not given enough exploration too much boring b s around <UNK> investigation of his brother's <UNK> and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous once again lundgren is actually really good as is newcomer <UNK> brett but the film just <UNK> from one sequence to the next which makes this movie particularly disappointing if anything else though it shows how underrated lundgren is as an actor br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
<START> the day time ended is an incredible picture in some ways it's better than close encounters of the third kind i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget <UNK> the special effects are cheesy but that's a big part of the fun jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film it's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature the musical score is very good the story doesn't make sense but that only makes it all the more intriguing like many of the best works of art the day time ended isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the day time ended may be a low budget indie film but it isn't too much of a stretch to compare it with the existential european films of the fifties and sixties many of which were low budget independent productions themselves
<START> having just welcomed home my 23 <UNK> old daughter from a year in iraq camp <UNK> medical support unit i felt compelled to get this dvd i wanted to hear other returning vets feelings in order to attempt to better understand her mentality on arrival and not waiting until after something bad happened regardless on your take on the war and peace this movie serves as a great start for all americans to begin the healing of our returning vets emotional void the paramount statement of the entire movie is take action on the problem incredibly emotional movie i would highly recommend this movie to the vet the vets entire mature family and ask that they follow through with a plan to listen comfort help the returning <UNK> war enduring freedom vets br br fast forward nearly one year later my daughter has seen this dvd took account of her emotions and actually has made a commitment to re up for another 6 years her take on her time spent in the sand is that she did some good local <UNK> children got first rate medical treatment for various common <UNK> not <UNK> able to afford free with an <UNK> and <UNK> her look over her shoulder at her iraq tour was we changed some hearts and minds back there great dvd you have to keep an open mind and see all sides
<START> i have not seen each and every one of <UNK> movies but this is for sure the best one i have seen so far br br the story in it self is nothing special really so i <UNK> go deeper into that what makes it special is the stunts the fighting the good acting the warm sense of humor the movie has a raging <UNK> all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it all the cool stunts of course made by jackie himself makes you want jump around in the couch and scream it´s just awesome even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it br br i know this police story can be a bit hard to get a hold of at least it is here in sweden but i can assure you it´s worth a try
<START> a never ending frenzy of clever visual <UNK> does not necessarily create an engaging film the blonde wig half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self <UNK> by its makers br br the wong faye half featuring a very playful if karen carpenter looking faye wong holds much more appeal all the ingredients are there however the girl meets boy story element takes a back seat to artsy <UNK> character development is uneven emotion is missing br br for music lovers wong <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> version of the <UNK> smash hit dreams is used effectively in <UNK> express faye wong also recorded a <UNK> language version called <UNK> <UNK> both are on cd although only <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is found on the official movie soundtrack cd
<START> this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen horrible acting not funny at all and well just boring br br i can only assume all these 10 out of 10 <UNK> all time movie comments are actually the actors themselves in disguise br br <UNK> what the runtime on this movie is i'm sure its listed on this page it certainly felt like an eternity br br if your looking for a tough challenge attempt to sit through this awful movie br br otherwise br br don't waste your time as i did on this one
<START> even though ian <UNK> <UNK> himself from this project due to inaccuracies in regards to hitler's life and yes this is <UNK> but essential robert <UNK> plays hitler during his later years during this documentary that only deals with hitler from <UNK> until he became <UNK> of germany including the night of the long knives this tv film also a two part mini series shows how a series of factors allowed hitler to come to power e g the financial disaster of 1930 br br the series follows hitler and little else apart from the lives of fritz <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all in all valuable and filled with interesting actors yet i feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography most actors are portrayed in half body shots which for me makes for a theatrical stance not cinematic the <UNK> is at times <UNK> and the film does suffer from it being approximately 2 5 hours long
<START> just saw this movie today at the seattle international film festival and enjoyed it thoroughly br br great writing and direction excellent and believable interaction among the cast and great comic timing as well br br this movie touches on themes that are universal family and <UNK> as a result i can see european asian and american audiences all finding points of similarity between this film and their own lives br br if all that wasn't enough this has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the year somebody <UNK> this in the usa please br br finally thank you maria <UNK> it really is a great film
<START> i have been a fan of without a trace from the <UNK> episode i really cannot express my disappointment in the episode last week this is a real problem that far too many <UNK> american families have dealt with and continue to deal with the lack of media coverage crucial in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study law <UNK> including local state and federal are also <UNK> what was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then <UNK> out on the ending seemingly television can deal with almost any subject matter except race this is shameful get it together or don't explore it next time
<START> i just saw the movie on tv i really enjoyed it i like a good mystery and this one had me guessing up to the end sean connery did a good job i would <UNK> it to a friend
<START> i don't know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but i enjoyed this one as i'm a fan of urban horror there's not too many urban horror movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf just the title alone <UNK> my curiosity so i decided to check it out and i was surprised it's not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story is it low budget yes can you tell that it's low budget yes but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn't matter i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice i don't know what's up with all these bad reviews for this film all i hear is worst movie ever have these idiots seen every movie out there there's thousands of movies out there how can you <UNK> one as the worst ever a video not movie like <UNK> may be the worst film i ever seen but i can't say that it's the worst movie ever since i haven't seen every movie out there bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the <UNK> listen if you don't like minority based urban films the ghetto films hip hop etc then why watch these types of movies knowing that you don't like this type of stuff sure this is a horror film but it's not just a horror film but it's an urban horror film with a multi cultural based cast i don't like tv shows like <UNK> creek or the o c they suck to me films like garden state wedding <UNK> and i heart <UNK> suck to me i'm a guy from new jersey and these shows and movies suck to me why because i can't relate to them they don't peak my interest just common sense believe me i will never watch garden state 2 garden <UNK> wedding <UNK> 2 here's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart <UNK> now back to this movie in regards to <UNK> comment above i don't know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked stupid by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me everyone did a great job the actor who played ricky i forgot his name did a very good job i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off <UNK> i liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet i'll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this bring on the sequel i'm out <UNK> <UNK>
<START> hello i am paul <UNK> a k a panic attack of <UNK> channel <UNK> in philadelphia let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on adam <UNK> film career but was <UNK> after a short time br br going overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails or so i thought sandler encounters babes that like history of the world part 1 and <UNK> the babes were supposed to be engaged but actually they get executed by <UNK> the <UNK> cannibal the world has ever known adam sandler <UNK> bad in going overboard but <UNK> better in big daddy billy madison and <UNK> <UNK> favorite 50 first dates man drew barrymore was one hot chick <UNK> is red hot going overboard ain't <UNK> <UNK> end of file
<START> this is the best movie i've ever seen br br maybe it's because i live just a few miles from the village were the story take place and i know how things work out in this area in sweden the movie tells the truth believe me it both <UNK> and <UNK> the lifestyle of <UNK> and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more opened minded and care more for your closest friends and relatives br br but if you live in another small village anywhere in sweden or another country you will probably also recognize much from this movie br br thank you maria <UNK>
<START> this movie is such cheesy goodness br br a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school they start getting killed off they know they are being stalked so what do they do one girl decides to take a bath another decides to cheat on her husband who is also there with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed in an old abandoned school and go at it br br and it comes through with the gore and the t a br br and it's also interesting from a historical <UNK> point of view where the usual 80's slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves or how adults view young people or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective this is a brit film made to be an american slasher it's hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak american unintentionally slip back in to their uk accents br br if you like cheesy 80's slashers like pieces then you will like this one
<START> this is the worst film i have ever seen i was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough the plot was bad and there wasn't a single likeable character i could get more entertainment watching static i gave this movie a 1 only because the scale didn't go into negative numbers avoid this movie at all costs
<START> intelligent <UNK> and thrilling the invisible man stood out in 2000 among sci <UNK> usual <UNK> <UNK> out <UNK> 's <UNK> art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty cynical plots and modern noir dialogue the show sat between law and order and doctor who on the believability <UNK> but there was no denying the fact that i man 's characters went beyond caricature even characters that <UNK> on predictability like the keeper the official and <UNK> were given <UNK> from the formulaic paul ben victor and vincent <UNK> had a chemistry that evolved and <UNK> <UNK> made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors the effects are never allowed to <UNK> the plot and the science only sometimes <UNK> on the totally unbelievable the show's low points are still entertaining and i've never seen such taut pilot episodes matt <UNK> and sci fi should be <UNK> and fans have the right to demand a <UNK> dvd edition of the show every time i come across a marathon of <UNK> the legendary <UNK> on sci fi i roll my eyes and sigh mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that invisible man and its <UNK> represented
<START> josh <UNK> dead eyes the thick writing of it and harrison ford being in a buddy cop comedy here's 3 reasons to hate it avoid it and to <UNK> <UNK> minutes of your life better br br the buddy cop movies are fun however their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the <UNK> but a reason to ask god to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than hollywood homicide br br what really did happen to this entertaining formula since a whole decade the things hadn't been the same you'd have a buddy action stubborn flop after another i'll delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well i spy 2002 national security 2003 taxi 2004 <UNK> <UNK> 2004 and the worst of them all yet miami vice 2006 br br i believe one of the reasons is the natural case of <UNK> after many similar cinematic flicks and tv shows during 2 decades already add to that particularly here the <UNK> dealing and the dull humor actually the matter this time is totally unbearable yes we've got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs and the background of <UNK> city but what else was new it's not about cliché it's about few <UNK> mixed with clichés where both have been badly made br br the acting especially from <UNK> 's side is terrible this guy is anything but a comedian or actor so his character was wanting to revenge for his father's death revenge on yourself man he probably died out of watching your acting even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy or that's what they seemed here anyhow br br the directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh some parts managed to be highly dull <UNK> the black guy through the lack it's a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action comedy they didn't <UNK> hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm or even as a place <UNK> full of shining or fallen stars cameos that could've given it few interesting moments br br it's a very easy movie that <UNK> on being watchable by only its <UNK> <UNK> and as being a buddy cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non chemistry on the screen one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself guess who and a buddy cop <UNK> more than movie god don't make me or my children live enough to witness hollywood homicide  part 2 at last look at harrison ford's performance he wanted to have a good time but at least we didn't
<START> <UNK> is a literature teacher that arrives to a <UNK> town there he will fell in love to <UNK> the most beautiful girl in town they will start a <UNK> romance which will end in the tragic death of <UNK> at the sea some years later <UNK> has married to <UNK> the <UNK> man in town and lives a quiet happy live surrounded by money one day the <UNK> of <UNK> will make her passion to rise up and act without thinking the consequences the plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent part in addition three quarters of the film are sexual acts which still being well filmed are quite <UNK> as we want to see more development of the story it is just a bad <UNK> <UNK> film with lots of sex no argument and stupid characters everywhere
<START> i used to watch this show when i was a little girl although i don't remember much about it i must say that it was a pretty good show also i don't think i've seen every episode however if you ask me it was still a good show i vaguely remember the theme song everyone was <UNK> cast the costume design was great the performances were top grade too i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don't think i've seen every episode now in conclusion when and if this show is ever brought back on the air i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
<START> i simply love this movie it is a perfect example of the well rounded surprising stories that come out of asian cinema there was a recent hollywood remake of this movie with richard gere and the simply awful jennifer lopez please do not confuse the two movies the original japanese film is touching subtle and wonderfully acted the hollywood version is the exact opposite i was <UNK> when i first saw the trailer for the remade us version and who was starring in it it's typical hollywood unoriginal crass <UNK> at it's worst the remake <UNK> the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon the only reason the original film did not become more widely viewed is the us audience's <UNK> to subtitles br br one of the main reasons this movie would never work in an american telling is that the reserved ultra socially conservative character of the public japanese persona is at issue in this movie certainly the main character <UNK> to a more full understanding of living a <UNK> life through dance but half of the movie's tension comes from the stereotypes and <UNK> ballroom dancers face in japan br br please try to see this movie in it's original form not the terrible full screen and please do skip the us remake it's a shallow travesty in comparison to the original japanese movie br br yes i know the original movie is much older and this is simply a japanese take on the story but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new us remake br br speaking of foreign films i'll make a few quick <UNK> 1 <UNK> wedding i list this first for a reason outstanding film 2 johnny <UNK> very funny italian mistaken identity <UNK> 3 <UNK> a korean action <UNK> that mixes both asian <UNK> us style plot 4 run lola run a german film that <UNK> it's <UNK> score <UNK> br br well just a quick list anyway
<START> i would like to comment the series as a great effort the story line although <UNK> a few <UNK> was pretty well especially in season 1 season 2 however became more of a freak show and lost <UNK> original charm season one story line was more interesting a light side to the life at jam <UNK> while a focused serious plot with <UNK> chasing down the x series i was looking forward to new seasons in fact i still am i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of <UNK> still wait for da to make a comeback even after 2 <UNK> of it being cancelled da can make it big if worked on properly and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge
<START> believe it or not this movie is worse than number three it's slower the acting is worse and the story is very weak there isn't a lot of good to say about this movie even the fight scenes are more dull than number three and i would have thought that impossible this is a very slow 90 minutes painful in fact i stuck it through hoping it would get better if you really want to see this movie you should try to find a cheap rental of it it is hard to find for purchase that is and probably for good reason like number three this movie has nothing to do with the first two it is the same in name only anyway the most i can give best of the best without warning is 2 10
<START> i don't like grade <UNK> but i just had to give this a 10 i can't think of anything i didn't like about it i saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it i'm sure that the hollywood remake that someone told me about with j lo and richard gear will be excellent but this original japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought provoking for me that i am hard pressed to think of any way that it could be improved or its setting changed to a different culture br br a story i found worth watching and with o fist fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort imagine that br br all the characters seemed well developed even non primary characters had good character development and enjoyable acting and the casting seemed very appropriate br br it's always hard to find a good movie musical in our day and age and perhaps this doesn't quite qualify there is plenty of learning how to dance but no singing but i really think that gene kelly and others who <UNK> a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man successful with a family in japan looking for something he knows not precisely what br br to the team of people in japan who contributed to this film thank you for creating and doing it
<START> the <UNK> of <UNK> is a meandering mess of a movie this spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other and much better films supposedly tied together by <UNK> telling how he brought in different <UNK> hunt powers john cameron brings nothing to the role of <UNK> skip this one unless you just have to have every <UNK> movie made and even that may not be a good enough excuse to see this one
<START> i have three comments to make about this film which i discovered hanging out <UNK> in a lower shelf at blockbuster first off it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially <UNK> works some have as kubrick did with <UNK> gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work of course that can't happen here <UNK> <UNK> is long dead some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new unrelated direction the recent adaptation of <UNK> <UNK> comes to mind here you can dumb it down the film of <UNK> five is to my mind an example of that or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes that would be the approach of woody allen's everything you wanted to know about sex and arguably this film upon consideration it is probably the only thing one can do with a <UNK> work like <UNK> <UNK> the potential loss is that whatever <UNK> point the original work had is <UNK> or destroyed and so it is here br br point two is the cinematic style some would call it an homage to <UNK> <UNK> carl <UNK> etc but i think it more crude than that its far too heavy handed and self conscious to be effective for long it is eventually just annoying br br point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation how did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual <UNK> and <UNK> that is so incredibly boring i found the film impossible to pay attention to and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual <UNK> will find it so as well i don't want to be completely <UNK> and say the film is pointless but i have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather <UNK> by the nature of the source material the overt <UNK> of <UNK> styles and the stubborn <UNK> to engage the audience on an emotional level possibly for fear of being accused of <UNK> br br the film is a dubious exercise from the start and doesn't really work for me i'm sorry to say
<START> spinal tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal you saw in jokes all over the place if you know anything about porn this mock documentary will leave you cold everything in it rings false br br spinal tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top this film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real world br br the acting here is uniformly awful but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good but it's not
<START> very good point there only an elite few the upper classes would both have access to the internet and be able to communicate on an exclusively english speaking site such as the imdb some might think internet is not reality but this point of view really put media society and democracy at stake you are probably right even if there is internet <UNK> in <UNK> most chavez supporters will not afford to even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on imdb br br screw you <UNK> upper class rich right wing <UNK> liberal intellectual <UNK> probably this is your first time using internet
<START> this is a top <UNK> film this year although tango <UNK> comes close the director <UNK> made couple of years back another nice little film called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i was in love with a desperate woman <UNK> is truly true to life beautiful film of one saturday afternoon in a little village town the actors are maybe not so handsome or beautiful but they do act beautifully i certainly do hope that many of them get <UNK> statue <UNK> oscar next spring i think this film could make it abroad as well
<START> i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child <UNK> the heart of his her reluctant guardian i've seen enough of them  baby boom <UNK> about a boy mostly martha and to some extent whale rider  to expect to be bored by the formula what held my attention in the king of masks was the <UNK> of the setting small town china in the 1930's extreme poverty was the norm and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to <UNK> would take them on the black market when wang discovers his purchased <UNK> whom he's <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> he initially casts her out even though she's showed great promise as street performing heir even after he reluctantly takes her back he's not too upset when she's kidnapped the film is gritty then showing the <UNK> to which a young street smart girl had to go to survive in that society br br the two lead performances are believable and <UNK> in their societal context in a western society one would expect at least a hint of <UNK> from wang at not having achieved more material success wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status though that i did too while <UNK> <UNK> a level of <UNK> and cunning that would be suspect in a modern suburban child it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her her fierce <UNK> to wang makes perfect sense br br the <UNK> at small town life in a foreign country the <UNK> of the two lead actors the surprising plot twists and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film
<START> a missed train a wrong phone number an extra cup of coffee what happens to those around you when you make a seemingly <UNK> decision most people don't give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions br br <UNK> tells the story of the <UNK> and cause and effect of the mundane as it <UNK> to a group of normal <UNK> folk it has all the <UNK> of what passes for contemporary theater with the full cast of the dysfunctional and <UNK> br br there's a cheating husband an illegal immigrant a classic <UNK> a <UNK> a crazy grandmother an annoying girlfriend a selfish roommate and a homeless man audrey <UNK> serves as the <UNK> protagonist in the sense that she's on camera as much as anyone else and opens and <UNK> the film and normal girl who just can't seem to find the right rhythm in her life br br she learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her <UNK> holds for her what happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters does the <UNK> come true the concept is good but the storytelling is flimsy the connections from one event to the next are weak there's better storytelling in 15 seconds of the liberty mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of <UNK> br br if you enjoy audrey <UNK> then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film but you'll finish it <UNK> and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and director
<START> unfortunately for myself i stumbled onto this show late in it's lifetime i only caught a few episodes about three before it was cancelled by abc i loved the characters and storyline but most of all the great actors i was a fan of sex and the city so i saw two characters i recognized bridget <UNK> was the character todd was smith jared as well as jay <UNK> from carlito's way rise to power and erika christensen <UNK> i enjoy watching young actors get their due and felt like this show would <UNK> their career further along i hope this at least gets put back out on dvd and maybe wb will pick it up for a second season sometime in the meantime i'm viewing it on <UNK> website from the beginning
<START> after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review this is my first ever so bare with me br br first of all i would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me i would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as i wasn't particularly thrilled either the film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who <UNK> a few times during these times she visits a house which she has been drawing after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality as she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in until she adds her constantly away father to the house due to a <UNK> her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his <UNK> br br think its an attempt to be a slightly more <UNK> version of a nightmare on elm street but is more like a trip to the beach br br in conclusion my generous 3 10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab
<START> this movie was good for it's time if you like eddie <UNK> this is a must have to add to your collection eddie was young and funny with his 80's <UNK> charlotte lewis <UNK> <UNK> is hot this was one of her first movies and she was not bad the graphics were good for the 80's a lot of the actors went on to do other good movies you should check them out through imdb other must have from eddie is coming to america and 48 hours another actor victor wong has a small part in this movie check out some of his older movies like big trouble in little china if you liked the action movies from the 80's this is your movie
<START> anton <UNK> and <UNK> taylor are friends they both are the leads in their own respective bands anton with the brian <UNK> massacre and <UNK> with the dandy warhols what's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals its a love hate relationship at times you both hear them <UNK> one another but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are while the dandy warhols went on the reach commercial success <UNK> still was stuck in the underground scene and for good reason why br br the focus of dig is more towards anton and the <UNK> as they have a lot more substance they are the most dysfunctional band during <UNK> they will fight and bash each other anton will hit other members if he feels they aren't performing correctly with the amount of drugs an alcohol they <UNK> fight was always waiting to happen you know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens that's why people would go to their <UNK> for the fights br br anton is very unstable always thinking himself as a music <UNK> he wants to change music and create a revolution but he could never get out of the underground he is a very talented musician its amazing how many <UNK> he can play and with such skill but his draw back is he cant escape the world he created a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs alcohol and depression on the other side the dandy warhols were having their own troubles they didn't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label but they found huge success in europe but <UNK> keeps being sucked back into the world of anton its interesting that both anton and <UNK> both had what the other needed <UNK> always wanted to be <UNK> talented as anton though anton wouldn't say it he needed the commercial success that the <UNK> had to make his revolution br br over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands there is a lot of footage there is never a dull moment in dig it is constantly moving along as it doesn't have time to slow down as it has to much to say seven years of story telling in the <UNK> <UNK> is a hard job <UNK> <UNK> has done a great job of <UNK> together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more even if you don't like the bands it still deserves viewing it <UNK> the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure br br you wont be disappointed
<START> this movie makes a statement about joseph smith what he stood for and what the lds church believes with all the current media coverage of a certain fugitive people have confused the lds church with the <UNK> church and criminal fugitive warren <UNK> <UNK> is not associated with the lds church yet media groups <UNK> have asked for comments about <UNK> from the lds church <UNK> is not mentioned in the movie at all but i think that it is ironic that this movie with all it's points about joseph also point away from the <UNK> of the <UNK> church and their leader at this time in the media world this is a movie about joseph smith and a great one at that some of the most obvious differences between <UNK> and joseph is portrayed in <UNK> humanity acceptance and love <UNK> views and opinions <UNK> greatly from joseph smith and the lds church and it is seen in this movie <UNK> thinks of the <UNK> as <UNK> joseph smith knew they were children of god and gave up his wife's favorite horse to a african american former slave to buy his son's freedom joseph is shown doing <UNK> for his wife emma and is criticized by a member until joseph tells him that a man may lose his wife in the next life if she chooses not to stay with her husband and that doing <UNK> is a way to help and <UNK> your wife <UNK> brought one of his <UNK> wives to her knees in front of a class full of students by grabbing her <UNK> and <UNK> it painfully till she came to her knees lastly joseph <UNK> with law <UNK> and sought aid from the government at all times <UNK> thumbs his nose at government and <UNK> at all times br br i loved this movie and if you don't know much about joseph smith and what the lds church believes then this is the movie to see and if you had confused the lds church with the <UNK> church then you really need to get your act together we are not much different from anyone who believes in jesus christ the <UNK> of marriage and the family as well a patriotic to our <UNK> and country we are all different as well just like you can find different <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> what's important is our message and what we stand for this movie <UNK> to portray that but there is so much of <UNK> life that can't be covered in a mere 2 hour movie this was a really great show
<START> jason bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands trying to make sense of what he's just done meanwhile a cia chief in nyc <UNK> the <UNK> response to what's just happened on screen an american flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the <UNK> of the shot but as he speaks it slips out of focus as his plan <UNK> into morally dubious territory as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security br br this shot effectively captures the mood of the film as well as portraying <UNK> quest to find out how he became jason bourne ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the <UNK> taken to protect us in the interests of <UNK> and security br br it is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year br br it's just so intense bourne says to simon ross <UNK> this isn't some newspaper story this is real and in the audience you almost believe him the camera shakes but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with bourne as he tries to <UNK> his <UNK> and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying instead of just being actors performing well written roles the action scenes are so brutally fast paced and well choreographed that they seem <UNK> instead of planned to the <UNK> movement the stunt work is nothing short of amazing br br the pacing is just incredible it keeps driving forward towards its conclusion but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set piece while they're often simple the <UNK> sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them the film is just so focused on <UNK> <UNK> that you can't help being swept along by it br br with its intense action set pieces brilliantly paced storyline and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security the bourne series is one that accurately captures the <UNK> of our age ultimatum is its peak
<START> this is an excellent documentary packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story the <UNK> cameras give you a very wide perspective as a dvd movie it is perfect your hear every <UNK> working almost all the time the film is not <UNK> up and just gives you the natural feel of <UNK> of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are good they give a depth to the driving scenes
<START> on this 4th of july weekend it's <UNK> to see the spirit of the <UNK> of independence alive and well in the film war inc just as our <UNK> fathers gave the back of their collective hand to king george iii this film exposes in hilarious fashion the craven war <UNK> by the current crop of <UNK> creeps who are intent on <UNK> <UNK> the government to include <UNK> war itself br br the cast in this satire absolutely shines john cusack is wonderful as a <UNK> conflicted corporate assassin and the beautiful marisa tomei is superb as his love interest my gosh george <UNK> was right marisa tomei is so attractive but it is john's sister joan cusack who really steals the film her portrayal of a <UNK> yet simultaneously <UNK> personal assistant is priceless and more than once i just couldn't stop laughing at the brilliance of her performance she not only possesses fantastic comic timing her face is as <UNK> as one could ever wish for in an actor dan <UNK> too has a short but very effective cameo in the film as the head of the company which is running the war the <UNK> corporation sitting on a throne with his pants down around his <UNK> <UNK> even looks like the <UNK> clown who currently <UNK> one of our real <UNK> of power you won't have to think too hard to recognize that person much of this movie was filmed in <UNK> which is why we are able to see so much real military equipment you just know that the us military would never have <UNK> in making this <UNK> expose of war <UNK> i especially enjoyed the character of omar <UNK> as played by the <UNK> actor <UNK> <UNK> in one scene in which he is on the dance floor with marisa tomei he has a couple of lines that could <UNK> our entire foreign policy attitude toward the foreign leaders we <UNK> and <UNK> in power br br naturally this film won't appeal to everyone if you believe that the on going <UNK> of our foreign policy the military intelligence collection and analysis <UNK> and the <UNK> system public health and a <UNK> of other government services is a good thing you may not find much to like in this film if you believe however that destroying people and countries in order to add to some <UNK> bottom line is an abomination i think you'll find much to appreciate in this film nothing could be more in keeping with the spirit of independence that <UNK> well deserved <UNK> on corrupt powers that be
<START> in 1983 director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster and that he did with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast the result was scarface ' starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles the story begins in may of 1980 when castro opened the harbor at <UNK> cuba to allow cuban <UNK> to join their families in the united states <UNK> 000 left cuba at that time for the <UNK> <UNK> of freedom in america and most were honest hard working people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted but not all among the <UNK> who <UNK> into florida approximately 25 000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> criminals considered beyond redemption who castro had merely wanted to be rid of and they too saw america as a land of opportunity even as al <UNK> had considered chicago some fifty years earlier and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana pacino known to his associates as <UNK> ' scarface br br now that he was free of the <UNK> of communism under which he had grown up montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida he was determined to have it all wealth and power that was <UNK> dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez robert <UNK> lopez it seems had a brother in cuba who had met an <UNK> end at the hands of one of <UNK> <UNK> a man who having <UNK> his <UNK> to castro had been <UNK> <UNK> and was currently being held in little <UNK> ' along with montana and all of the <UNK> just off the <UNK> where they <UNK> their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives and in short order montana sees to it that <UNK> brother has been <UNK> and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of america br br lopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets montana and his friend <UNK> steven bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work in his day <UNK> may have had <UNK> as a means through which to line his <UNK> with <UNK> gain but lopez has the modern day equivalent and it's even more <UNK> cocaine lopez takes montana under his wing and <UNK> him into the life but once he has a taste of it montana isn't satisfied with whatever <UNK> lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be at the top ' with a cold blooded iron will montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost but before it's over he will realize the price for his dream and he'll pay it but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what it's like to be the man and he will also know whether or not it was worth it br br in step with de palma's vision pacino plays montana larger than life and he does it beautifully from the accent he affects which he <UNK> thoroughly to make sure he got it right and he did to the body language and the attitude he's got it all and it makes montana convincing and very real what he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors de niro would be one can this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but <UNK> screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him it's quite simply a dynamic memorable performance br br michelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom as elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of <UNK> dream pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior <UNK> she like pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly <UNK> across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and <UNK> demeanor br br the supporting cast includes mary elizabeth <UNK> gina <UNK> <UNK> mama montana f murray abraham omar paul <UNK> <UNK> and harris <UNK> <UNK> an excellent <UNK> to the more recent and highly acclaimed traffic ' and blow ' and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of <UNK> the wild bunch ' de palma's scarface ' originally <UNK> by critics has since been <UNK> by many as being the definitive american gangster saga much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing but if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end and like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time but the reward is always worth it and that's the way it is with this film i rate this one 8 10 br br br br br br
<START> this movie is a masterpiece a story of a young woman during the war and it really happen not exactly as the movie but it is a great story i was impress by this film the acting and the story where great i like this film because it is a true story it's <UNK> me a feeling that i was there and i feel sorry for the <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> is playing because who wants to end here life that way i recommend that everybody have to see this film special the young ones and ma by the learn something from this film this film you can compare <UNK> the movie soldier from orange or any real story that happened in the ww2
<START> being a film studies graduate i would like to think that i have seen a diverse range of films some good and some bad but i would have to say that <UNK> <UNK> is by far the worse film i have ever seen i chose the film in the hope that it was going to be a great british classic such as <UNK> and <UNK> or <UNK> but oh no this was so bad that my flat mates and i ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script reminded me of a bad <UNK> in <UNK> school production the main characters michelle and gary began to annoy us from the start <UNK> the main character who lives with her two friends has the type of face that you would never get tired of <UNK> and gary was so wet he kept breaking down in tears every 5 minutes that by the end of the film i really didn't give a damn about either of them all i could think was ' i paid <UNK> for this <UNK> i have never written a review before but after watching this film it has <UNK> me on to warn people of this disastrous production so please avoid at all costs thanks for reading
<START> i saw this when on the wonderful world of disney as a kid so i didn't recall much of it as i watched it recently i sat there thinking this is the <UNK> thing i've seen br br the <UNK> scenes look like something caused by an <UNK> <UNK> the animated characters are mostly oddly colored voiced versions of jungle book and robin hood characters some not so disney things i noticed kids being threatened at knife point and prostitutes during the <UNK> road song br br it was very entertaining though the musical numbers were long and i can see little kids getting bored with them also the subject manner was a bit dark seeing as it was set during ww2
<START> naturally i didn't watch <UNK> <UNK> out of choice i was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex girlfriends house br br <UNK> jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario which of course it isn't the result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints <UNK> the amount of humour of which there is none or entertaining action scenes and soon becomes too serious the film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable br br <UNK> <UNK> fails where other action films succeed mainly because films such as james bond dirty harry and various others are larger than life yet never <UNK> to be otherwise they are <UNK> and therefore entertaining <UNK> <UNK> tries to be real and fails br br this is a very disappointing film from <UNK> scott with a very non credible storyline <UNK> acting and the only reason i give it 2 10 instead of 1 10 is for some of the technical work
<START> if you like film don't miss this one if you prefer action or horror or romance then you'll wonder what's happening everyone here is stuck in a gangster film and what happens is <UNK> murder br br there are few similar films no doubt it will see limited release and be hard to find but the search will be worth it if you want to study a <UNK> as a potential symbol then this is indeed a film to study br br you can't watch it once if you do you'll never see what's happening dark city is better joe <UNK> the <UNK> is more fun but mad dog time could <UNK> the <UNK> crowd to symbolism or at least to think twice before shooting again
<START> 'the <UNK> was a wonderful movie about the second chances life holds for us and also puts an emotional thought over the audience making them realize that your dreams can come true if you loved <UNK> the <UNK> 'the <UNK> is the movie for you it's the feel good movie of the year and it is the perfect movie for all ages 'the <UNK> hits a major home run
<START> this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on tv i my eyes are glued to it the acting and plot are amazing it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama
<START> when many people say it's the worst movie i've ever seen they tend to say that about virtually any movie they didn't like however of the nearly 700 movies i can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that i walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry this is my first movie review by the way and i <UNK> with imdb just to rave at this movie's badness i went to see it when it was in the theaters myself and my two buddies were 3 of 5 people there and after 15 years i can't remember very many <UNK> but my attitude upon leaving the theater is still crystal clear br br spoiler alert br br oh my where to begin fat loser left at <UNK> goes on <UNK> weekend meets blonde <UNK> who takes an interest in him takes him home to meet the family they're all cannibals and he's the main course pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape kicks all their <UNK> and runs off with the brother's girlfriend they live happily ever after <UNK> firstly the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be funny and that this was a comedy the special effects what few there are look like they were done 15 years earlier the big dramatic ending was so hokey and poorly acted that it was nearly unbearable to watch he knocks out the entire cannibal family with <UNK> laying in the lawn that stand up tom and jerry style when they step on them i'm sure that there's much much more but i have no intention on seeing it again for a <UNK>
<START> good times working with the <UNK> brothers and the entire cast on this project as the guy on the <UNK> i was amazed how well they accomplished capturing all the <UNK> traits of a true b horror film hopefully i will have the opportunity to work with <UNK> <UNK> pictures team again in the future i moved to detroit shortly after <UNK> and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release one time was actually in the video store and the girl damn near lost her mind it was pretty funny and that was my 1st real <UNK> moment as i signed her <UNK> one day i asked the girl at blockbuster if the movie is rented often and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer at the time it was renting more than <UNK> which was also a new release at the time the title really captures immediate interest in the more urban <UNK> she also noticed on many occasions the movie had not been returned by the <UNK> leading me to believe the movie is just so good people don't want to give it back watch out for zombies when in the hood cause they will get ya <UNK> <UNK> guy on the <UNK> 2005
<START> there's plenty to appreciate here spectacular locations and flying sequences period costumes props and sets and competent writing and acting however to enjoy a drama we need at least one principal who <UNK> some qualities that we can like or admire in this bunch of <UNK> <UNK> we found only one character who is at all likable  a hapless <UNK> man in a fleeting <UNK> role as their helpless victim from the reviews here it is clear that we are completely out of step but we did not find their <UNK> <UNK> behavior amusing or entertaining even the dog is <UNK> we threw in the <UNK> after two of the six episodes so you should <UNK> these observations <UNK> but what i could find written about this mini series gave us no cause to expect character transformation or redemption
<START> definitely not worth the rental but if you catch it on cable you'll be pleasantly surprised by the cameos <UNK> appearance is especially self <UNK> it's also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from the sopranos <UNK> themselves
<START> when his in laws are <UNK> murdered by a gang of thugs a young deputy is ordered to <UNK> his mute friend forced to take the rap by the gang to <UNK> for trial and ending up having to face the real killers along the way br br the <UNK> is a real life <UNK> sent to video stores to lure you away from better films it's talky illogical slow and ultimately very boring br br there's some good costumes sets and photography but nothing else is good about this vanity project from writer director producer star justin <UNK> who apparently had too much money on his hands br br they used to make westerns like this that were under an hour long <UNK> this of about half it's length and you might have something watchable
<START> you may want to know up front that i am not a mormon unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film i mention this so you'll understand that the way i look at the film may <UNK> greatly from those in the faith for some being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faith and that is not my intention so my review is that of an <UNK> trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were well after seeing the film i doubt if i have learned much at all since i have been a history teacher i have a good basic understanding about young as well as joseph smith as well as the <UNK> of the church but anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so gosh darn nice too nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal plus you learn practically nothing about the <UNK> beliefs other than they are nice people work hard and some have many wives and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film instead the people are almost cartoon like in their simplistic portrayals joseph smith and <UNK> young and their followers are <UNK> the non <UNK> were all <UNK> and brian <UNK> playing exactly the same sort of role edward g robinson later played in the ten <UNK> is the trouble maker who claims to be a mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy it's all so very simple too simple almost like an <UNK> film or <UNK> br br <UNK> young especially was a very complex man with many good points an excellent <UNK> and <UNK> as well as bad don't even get me started on his views about blacks within the church or <UNK> to portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly it's also a lot like how gandhi was portrayed in the film with ben kingsley only the facts that led to his being almost super human were <UNK> heck now that i think about that this is the trouble with most religious films they often come off as one dimensional trite and bland let's have a full and more complete film of these men one that will stick to facts and not emotional appeals br br now if you can ignore the fact that you won't learn very much about the faith or its second leader the film is enjoyable enough it's obvious someone at 20th century fox really cared about the film as they had a wonderful cast of both <UNK> actors <UNK> power up and coming actors linda <UNK> jane <UNK> and vincent price and wonderful character actors dean jagger john carradine and brian <UNK> the film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of <UNK> it just didn't have a lot to tell us other than they were all <UNK> plus there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes a few of the mistakes include young taking over the <UNK> immediately after the death of joseph smith it was three years later no mention of the various mormon <UNK> and <UNK> groups talk of gold in california even though it was <UNK> and gold wouldn't be discovered until 1948 as well as no specific mention of <UNK> or smith's many wives just plain dumb scenes include carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom scene and no one seemed to care even though it was a very hostile audience don't you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with it br br one final comment do not i repeat do not watch this film when it's shown on american movie classics a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years while i am critical of the film because of its simplistic message i was horrified with the complete <UNK> the station had for the church and its traditions what i mean is this the film was <UNK> with ads for penis <UNK> <UNK> as well as tons of pop ups some advertising a show that features the <UNK> cast talk about <UNK> and gross and i would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film by doing this they not only insult the faith but <UNK> their market after all who is into hearing about these things and the life of <UNK> young is this a movie in this form that you can show to your kids or recommend to others
<START> i watched this movie on the grounds that <UNK> benson rocks and nick <UNK> is generally pretty cool i figured that any film featuring two actors i like and respect couldn't be all bad and in that sense i was right considering the cringe making dialogue they were given both of them perform reasonably well not well enough to stop the movie from sucking you understand but well enough that i was able to make it through the 75 odd minutes of movie and that's the main sign of an awful film when at 40 minutes through you're already praying for it to be over br br it's hard to know where to start with the problems in taboo the dialogue as mentioned is appalling wooden and completely unnatural january jones' acting is unbelievably bad and since she's the character we spend most of our time following around the house this is an unforgivable flaw the plot manages to be so convoluted that it makes no sense while simultaneously being so clichéd as to be completely predictable literally not one of the major <UNK> in this film would surprise anyone but a <UNK> a few interesting shots aside the director tries far too hard with far too little success awkward tracking shots and <UNK> camera work distracting from what little element of story there is br br three of this movie's stars are awarded for the fact that it contains <UNK> benson and the last is tossed in on the grounds that one of the jokes made me <UNK> a little bit i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone ever under any circumstances avoid at all costs
<START> i have to admit that i'm a great fan of this show so you must know how disappointed i got when i watched this movie first of all the plot was awful i thought it was going to be something more interesting like to see what happened to arnold fathers or something more interesting but <UNK> a maniac wants to destroy <UNK> house between many other places so many people tries to stop this br br i must admit that the plot wasn't so bad after all but what really sucked were the steps that arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac they become friends of a spy they drive a bus based on a video game for god sake and to worse everything they make super moves on the bus things that many persons had already tried and died but not arnold <UNK> and <UNK> 'cause they are experts on a video game br br honestly my mom my sister even me got really disappointed after watching this movie 'cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon i must admit that i used to enjoy hey arnold it was one of my favorite cartoons on <UNK> but after this crap of movie i'm not quite sure if i'm going to watch hey arnold as i used to watch it on the past br br other thing <UNK> with that enormous number of dynamite i can assure you that not a simple street would explode i think that the whole city could explode with that oh and please if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that don't do more movies you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good br br honestly i think this was the worst way to end this show a good show transformed into this crap of movie
<START> in this movie the old amitabh bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman again he meets her in his restaurant the younger woman <UNK> <UNK> with him he does not know what to do and asks her out her reaction on his <UNK> is rather weird is was supposed to be funny br br and that <UNK> me about this whole movie it wasn't that funny the jokes and script was terrible the only jokes i liked was about the teeth of a <UNK> but after a several times even that began to bore br br amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy this was a weird relationship a little girl with the mind of an old woman it was frightening i know someone can be attached to a kid but this man has adult conversations with this child it did not make any sense br br <UNK> father is <UNK> <UNK> he has to give amitabh a hard time but we all know <UNK> he can't do that so even the conversation at the end when they sit all around the table even that was supposed to be funny br br i only like movies who really are funny i suppose i will never watch this movie again
<START> i think dark angel is great first season was excellent and had a good plot with max jessica alba as an escaped x 5 <UNK> creation trying to adapt to a normal life but still saving the world and being hunted by <UNK> throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice br br the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first the plot kinda disappeared and the series lost a little of it's charm mostly because of all the weird creatures appearing don't get me wrong the second season is good but with a little bit to much of the <UNK> however they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2 in which i had a lot of hopes to see more of br br so i really wish they could start making new episodes and with james cameron behind this it can't go wrong so as a conclusion i would say it's a great series however i'm still hoping for a third season
<START> enjoyed the movie and efficient <UNK> crime drama the old order survives the threat <UNK> by a <UNK> young greedy man no doubt representing modern society i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being <UNK> for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest on thing that always <UNK> me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone they are still there
<START> john <UNK> was absolutely horrendous in this movie i felt like i was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film anna <UNK> was par for the course not good but not horrible plus she's cute <UNK> keaton should have known better jeff daniels was the only saving grace in this movie even though it was poor judgement on his part as well br br all in all i would avoid this at all costs i'm just glad i didn't pay to see it br br john <UNK> will forever be stuck in the <UNK> role <UNK> the <UNK> kid ' unless he does some serious work on his acting chops
<START> from the start of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to servants running round in the worst clothing i've ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film made a bit of sense with pierre and is father but as the film gets to its really silly ending you have got to think why end a film this way and <UNK> they had a better ending if only in there heads this is not a film to watch basically
<START> ok so there's nudity but hey there's free porn on the internet for <UNK> likes it and its just silly how they forced tits into every frame i mean i was embarrassed not from the nudity but from the far <UNK> of the producers writers of this piece of crap br br the movie is not funny at all its just extremely predictable all the time there is no plot no dramatic content at all this is way <UNK> worse then the other pie films and they <UNK> that great either if you're really drunk or maybe a 13 year old buy who are really obsessed with tits this might be acceptable otherwise not br br may it forever roth <UNK> with crap of the same <UNK> with regards <UNK> the <UNK> flash <UNK>
<START> good times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear black family living in the chicago projects whether or not you live in the inner cities <UNK> <UNK> or rural countryside this show is still a treasure to watch and observe a family being just a family rather than a show about a poor black family but they don't <UNK> on it they find humor and have strong family values and morals despite the story behind the scenes this show was worth keeping on the air except i didn't like them killing off the father which i agreed with esther <UNK> who fought hard to keep the family together but despite all the fights behind the scenes good times was a show about a family we all loved <UNK> dynamite and his antics we watched janet jackson's penny grow up a little this show was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs gangs and alcoholism without being to preachy the evans always tried to do the right thing rather than do something wrong to get out of the ghetto
<START> a half hearted attempt to bring elvis <UNK> into the modern day but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo playboy magazine subplot <UNK> is surrounded by the same old <UNK> <UNK> clichés a woman picks e p up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life and he doesn't seem to care dick <UNK> is <UNK> in another <UNK> but don porter and <UNK> <UNK> try hard as <UNK> two bosses he's <UNK> you see some of the songs are quite good especially almost in love but if you want to see a <UNK> <UNK> updated elvis sex comedy look elsewhere when elvis and his fatal attraction get into bed together there's actually a wooden board in between them get real from
<START> this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen i'm not <UNK> i told the guy at blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves the only thing interesting about this movie is the box on the box it says from the director of the boogeyman so i figured eh whatever if this was made recently i'm sure the directing at least won't be too bad but after i saw the movie and looked at what boogeyman they were talking about it's some nonsense from the early 1980's that he made great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers br br anyway i think that they just liked the name zodiac killer and didn't bother to research any of the actual <UNK> crimes or his mo or even the years that he was active all of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the zodiac and the stories about the original zodiac take place several years after the actual <UNK> crimes did they also compare the zodiac to vampire of <UNK> fritz <UNK> throughout the movie and talk to <UNK> son quite often the zodiac and <UNK> were nothing alike and it makes more sense to compare him to btk who also shot people not a man who killed people by chewing through their <UNK> none of the <UNK> facts are correct either just a bunch of <UNK> nonsense his son even says don't forget his name was fritz <UNK> with 2 <UNK> his actual name just has one i think that the writer director simply <UNK> in a <UNK> search for serial killers and the <UNK> ones that came up were the zodiac killer and fritz <UNK> <UNK> those sound like cool names let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research great idea br br perhaps my favorite <UNK> in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from <UNK> iv and getting <UNK> of it i was also <UNK> with <UNK> iv and have since <UNK> etc for those of you who don't know <UNK> iv is the psychological <UNK> for mental <UNK> if anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some serious problems haha br br anyway my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list and it's rare that a movie ever reaches that point but if you are interested in watching a totally non fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring full of inexperienced actors and not completely rational i'd say check out this movie br br oh and i liked how the killer tear <UNK> a few of his victims with dry ice nice touch
<START> before seeing this movie please check out reviews available on the internet regarding the movie's <UNK> of events particularly its <UNK> regarding the widely accepted fact that 7 8 000 muslim men were <UNK> out of <UNK> and shot by serbian <UNK> the <UNK> also belongs to various pro serbian american <UNK> please watch this movie <UNK> and read reviews beforehand most reviews argue that the <UNK> takes his arguments too far even if he raises questions that target the conventional wisdom regarding the war a review in the <UNK> by stephen <UNK> states that it would be inaccurate to label this documentary pro serbian but one should question both the presentation of facts many of which are taken from reliable sources and the <UNK> of those facts that <UNK> serbian forces i do not advise against seeing this documentary but i do caution you to examine it with an especially critical eye as one should do at all times anyway
<START> the simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film and also relates to the dogma films br br did you ever get bored of those hollywood style cop flicks with <UNK> guys who get <UNK> james bond would be <UNK> of fed up with the married living single cop the divorced but family man the <UNK> <UNK> and the tough hunter ever wondered how the real police work is like br br well for germany this film shows you set in the north between west germany and east germany former <UNK> an laid off post office clerk starts her job fresh from <UNK> she quickly finds her way around the usual customers and becomes <UNK> to life as a <UNK> but this is not much fun br br other german crime films like <UNK> der <UNK> et <UNK> have <UNK> officers talking <UNK> with suspects these cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view even more if you know that part of germany a bit
<START> in general i like dinosaur movies but this one is pure crap no script no dialogues no acting and the brave colonel <UNK> trying to show he is tough and so <UNK> his mouth resembles as a twin brother the stupid <UNK> from the police academy so this was a complete waste of time fortunately not waste of money as i saw the film on tv and i really cannot understand 7 people who <UNK> this sh t 10 they must've <UNK> my advice if you see this title run from it
<START> as far as the movie goes it's an ok science fiction movie it has a lot of cool stuff in it and some quality scenes that said it's not that good and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched br br as for calling this another cube movie is utter and complete <UNK> t this is the very definition of <UNK> a great and inventive original movie the whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first but the introduction of people <UNK> as part of the team behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch br br i gave this a 3 because of the <UNK> of the original this one should have been kept <UNK> in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all br br watchable for those who have not seen cube <UNK> but not <UNK> for fans of the series
<START> while returning from a christmas eve shopping trip an abused suburban housewife basinger finds herself in a fight for survival after a <UNK> with a group of <UNK> <UNK> takes a violent turn br br suffering the <UNK> of a straight to dvd release here in the u k susan <UNK> directorial debut will perhaps not be given the recognition it deserves this is a shame as the standard of the writing directing and acting is very good indeed and certainly surpasses the quality of your average straight to dvd flick br br kim basinger gives her best performance in some time as the <UNK> wife of an abusive husband craig <UNK> while <UNK> is not really given anything more to do than be a threatening presence it is in their brief scenes together that basinger <UNK> showing painful vulnerability yet <UNK> at the rage that will eventually <UNK> over in her <UNK> with the <UNK> it's a truly great understated performance her transformation from victim to <UNK> is <UNK> played br br lukas <UNK> i initially thought was miscast as he along with the other three <UNK> just did not seem much of a threat however had all four <UNK> been more physically <UNK> the later scenes in which basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all the fact that these are four average men albeit slightly unhinged is the key to why the film works as well as it does br br apart from a few pacing issues during the latter half of the movie and a couple of cheesy lines here and there what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the film is over some may be put off by the slow burn nature of the opening scenes or the abrupt ending others by the at times brutal violence i say give it a chance it's certainly more deserving of your time than saw v
<START> i just saw this film in santa barbara my friend knew someone who worked on it so i thought i'd check it out i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again the actors were really good and i loved all the music there was not a lot of talking in the film which at first felt a little strange but once i got into it i thought that the story and the acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought that it left a lot to the imagination i want to see the movie again because there was so much going on in it that i forgot a lot of small things but know that i left the theater thinking about the film it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique
<START> the famous international conductor daniel <UNK> michael <UNK> has a heart attack with his <UNK> busy professional life and <UNK> his successful career with an early retirement he decides to return to his hometown in the north of sweden from where his mother left when he was a seven year old sensitive boy <UNK> by <UNK> and other school mates to live a low paced life he buys an old school and is invited to participate in the church choir by the local shepherd <UNK> <UNK> falk but the reluctant and shy daniel refuses in the principle however he gets involved with the community and feels attracted by lena <UNK> <UNK> a local woman with a past with the local doctor his music opens the hearts of the members of the choir affecting their daily life the slow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has the chance to participate in the choir <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the wife of <UNK> releases her repressed sexuality <UNK> helen <UNK> takes an attitude against her abusive and violent husband the <UNK> and frustrated <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> opens her heart against lena the fat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cries enough against the jokes of the businessman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even daniel starts loving people and lena as the love of his life when they are invited to participate in an important contest in vienna daniel finds his music opening the heart of people making his dream come true br br <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> is a touching and sensitive movie with a very beautiful story it is impressive how director kay <UNK> and the screenplay writers have been able to develop a great number of characters in <UNK> minutes running time the performances are top notch supported by magnificent music score and at least two awesome moments when <UNK> sings her song in the concert and certainly the last concert in vienna with the audience jury and everybody <UNK> in the melody and daniel making his dream come true like in <UNK> the stranger changes the lives not of only a family but of a conservative community further like many european movies the open conclusion <UNK> that daniel actually died at least in my interpretation reaching peace with the success of his music my eyes became wet in these two scenes my vote is nine br br title brazil a <UNK> no <UNK> the life in the paradise
<START> maiden voyage is just that i'd like to say straight away that i watched <UNK> of this before i just couldn't stand it anymore as already stated in another comment this film doesn't fall into the whole so bad it's good thing it's just bad the acting is awful the <UNK> are poor and the story is bland and stupid even the extras suck the bag guy guards and such appear to hold their weapons like water <UNK> br br don't even bother watching this film the only thing special about it is that no matter how low your expectations are you will still be disappointed
<START> in hazzard county georgia cousins bo and luke duke scott <UNK> and their cousin daisy duke jessica simpson run <UNK> made by their uncle jesse willie nelson while avoiding the local authority boss <UNK> burt reynolds their problems with the boss are only beginning as they learn he's been plotting to strip mine the town for valuable <UNK> found below it br br i have never seen the tv show and after watching the movie i'm not going to start any time soon i like stupid comedies but this one didn't offer many laughs it was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through the second part was a little better but this film was still a missed opportunity the film focused on bo and luke way too much the characters in general weren't very interesting and the actors portraying them didn't do a very good job br br the acting wasn't very good i wasn't expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny <UNK> william scott and johnny <UNK> both give below average performances the latter was pretty good as <UNK> but he tries way too hard here the latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else jessica simpson isn't known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing she's famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things she is pretty but she's a weak actor it doesn't matter though because she doesn't really appear in the movie and the character she plays isn't complex or anything willie nelson also has a minor role and he doesn't do anything special br br the screenplay was written by john o'brien and he made two films prior to the dukes of hazzard the first one was cradle to the grave which was okay the second one was <UNK> and <UNK> which was pretty funny he doesn't do a good job here though as the story is a mess he also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better the movie is also pretty long for a comedy okay <UNK> minutes isn't exactly long but it feels so much longer because there's very little humor in the first hour i think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time the dukes of hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone <UNK> minutes the car sequences were average and they don't save an already troubled film in the end dukes of hazzard may appeal to a few people but most people will probably find it dull and it's better if you just skip it rating 4 10
<START> the first was good and original i was a not bad horror comedy movie so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch it br br what really makes this movie work is judd <UNK> character and the sometimes clever script a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay sometimes there's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy look br br great made for tv movie it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd <UNK> stanley doing what he does best br br i suggest <UNK> to watch the first one before watching the sequel just so you'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background
<START> someone mentioned editing this is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess for starters let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments why are these people the best choices for the type of <UNK> they are involved in and what exactly are they testing apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit the acting is pretty bad everyone is <UNK> everyone is keeping secrets they frequently mention that if it weren't for the money they'd hang it up there's a deranged minister who <UNK> <UNK> on and on but again the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors there are some really cheesy elements those little rooms and those <UNK> <UNK> the awful <UNK> was it <UNK> it was interesting but didn't seem to go anywhere
<START> my <UNK> love of italian actress <UNK> <UNK> who helped jump start my <UNK> with her performance in <UNK> <UNK> has led me to some fairly unusual places case in point this british curiosity from 1959 <UNK> <UNK> of the f o which features <UNK> in one of her earlier roles she plays a princess in this one although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of terry thomas and peter sellers both of whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point in this cute often very funny film we learn of the <UNK> like island nation of <UNK> which had been a british colony until <UNK> and then universally forgotten forty three years later however it becomes the center of worldwide attention and international espionage when valuable <UNK> <UNK> are discovered there and her <UNK> sends the bumbling <UNK> <UNK> of the foreign office to take charge terry thomas <UNK> this part nicely as does sellers in his role as prime minister <UNK> of the tiny country this was <UNK> second film of 1959 concerning a tiny country matching wits with the world the other being the mouse that <UNK> of course ian <UNK> almost steals the show here as <UNK> suave king and my girl <UNK> is as appealing as can be in her minor role the film <UNK> much in the way of very dry humor although there are some belly laughs to be had the reception at the <UNK> airport for example and especially that may day style parade of <UNK> strength and <UNK> seedy prime minister with his <UNK> english and seemingly <UNK> sweat <UNK> is yet another memorable character in this great actor's <UNK> despite the occasional instance or two of <UNK> stiff upper lip british <UNK> i found this picture to be a <UNK> modest entertainment and well presented on this crisp looking anchor bay dvd
<START> i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes i still am <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> of the animation and the slow yet thoughtful actions of the story telling i am still a fan with some minor pains br br though this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had a stylish <UNK> way of telling about the <UNK> of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything sound familiar i have to say that this one gets a bit too <UNK> dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their <UNK> need to belly <UNK> about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from <UNK> in their plans especially the character called <UNK> i mean he <UNK> more than an american character on a soap opera get a <UNK> will ya br br besides for the over exaggerated drama i think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors this series is still very exciting and will still <UNK> me once again i mean it can always be worse it could be like the recent installment seed <UNK> talk about <UNK> dramatic i'll chat about that one later
<START> of course the plot script and especially casting are strong in the film so many fine things to see one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonist <UNK> <UNK> ex mentor working his evil on the <UNK> his chess <UNK> an italian dandy in three piece and <UNK> turns out to be a real <UNK> and a truly fine chess player to his credit the <UNK> <UNK> goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship <UNK> luzhin has taken a <UNK> out a window sad but so releasing to him by way of the unstable <UNK> widow emily watson in death then because of the <UNK> of an honorable chess master <UNK> <UNK> which he worked out in a late moment of <UNK> is allowed to be played the italian <UNK> <UNK> the play and calls it brilliant talk about a dramatic end game
<START> i honestly have to say that i could not stop watching this movie from the second that it started simply for how bad it was it's kinda like watching paint dry only a lot more confusing i mean you sit there and just wait for something to happen anything in fact preferably something that makes the whole film make sense at the end of the film i actually sat there wondering if there was any chance at all that i may have missed the first hour that explained everything or whether i may have inadvertently passed out during the film and missed the parts that glued the plot if there was in fact one together the main thing that really confused me about this movie is nearly at the end the main girl if there was indeed a main girl was in some sort of alternate reality i mean what the hell was going on at this point all of a sudden she <UNK> and was in a mental <UNK> <UNK> to a bed being drugged by doctors or something then <UNK> than it would have taken me to <UNK> my <UNK> it <UNK> back and she was getting eaten out by some random vampire it made no <UNK> sense i'm tempted to email the makers and demand my time back i mean i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this rubbish i am kinda interested to know if the filmmakers themselves actually knew what it was all about just seemed someone had edited out all the bits that could have made it make sense though i think the film would have had to have been <UNK> long to make that happen i side completely with the other person who wrote the other review i was <UNK> <UNK> with this film by its title and that alone i'm just so <UNK> grateful i didn't actually buy the film no matter how many times iv seen it in the local pound shop you would have thought that would have given me a clue that the film was a complete pile of steaming movie rubbish but to be honest i think <UNK> was way too much money to spend on this film what a <UNK> huge waste of time and a good razor blade i mean i wish i <UNK> its less painful than watching this film
<START> a simple movie in the beginning a simple movie in the end it does have that un ending and pretending cliche but most tv movies have that any ways br br christopher reeve does a good job as being an ex con drifter the marriage between her and the woman he works for i feel is a bit <UNK> but i believe for the time period it is set in that it is believable none the less br br now i saw the edited <UNK> version even tho the movie was made and showed on <UNK> i find that a bit <UNK> as well but i feel if i saw the entirety of the piece i would give it more in likely the same rating br br j t walsh does a nice job not his best role but still a nice job br br 7 10
<START> i grew up in southern west virginia i'm about the same age as or maybe a year older than homer <UNK> author of the rocket boys the book <UNK> the true story basis of this heart warming film br br and so i relate closely to the west virginia coal mining theme and to the stunning effect <UNK> had at that time october 4 1957 on all of us the rocket boys went on to make great lives for themselves i went on to get my degrees in physics and computer <UNK> all because <UNK> woke up a lot of young people to the science gap the u s s r had on the u s in those cold war days br br this is a wonderful film for everyone of all ages but if you grew up in west virginia in the late 1950's it'll touch the core of your being br br everyone get it watch it recommend it to your friends <UNK> thank you many times
<START> i think this film has been somewhat overrated here there are some things to admire in it for one thing it deserves credit for being a science fiction ish film which relies on its story instead of special effects and action sequences to carry the day the supporting cast is good the set design and cinematography are good and the ideas are interesting enough though they are beginning to seem a little tired after the many mediocre dark city <UNK> fight club <UNK> of recent years but the film is <UNK> by poor characterization wooden performances from the lead actors and a laughably bad ending br br the main problem i had was that the protagonist was neither likable nor unlikable i realize that part of the story <UNK> that he should be a bit of a wait for it <UNK> but i was utterly unable to work up any empathy for a character that just seemed like a boring anonymous <UNK> of a man what character transformation there is for this sad sack is <UNK> forced on him by the plot lead actor jeremy northam succeeds in conveying that the protagonist is confused and hapless but fails at inspiring any sympathy for him opposite him lucy liu does what she can with a character who has no real personality of her own unless being the <UNK> of a spy movie cliché counts as personality br br one of the biggest <UNK> of this movie is the ending i won't give any spoilers here but i will say that a surprise twist at the end was <UNK> pretty clearly at least 45 minutes before it occurred further after being content to be a quirky idea oriented movie for the first hour or so the last few scenes suddenly and terribly <UNK> into the worst kind of hollywood <UNK> complete with big explosions and special effects the revealing of the film's <UNK> at the end is poorly done and at the end the characters seem even less likable than they did before some of the film's main plot threads were resolved br br the movie's not all bad though it does manage to maintain a certain low level of tension throughout most of it despite the slow pacing although i think i have a higher than average tolerance for slow paced movies and there are some moments when the <UNK> <UNK> feeling that director vincenzo natali was clearly trying to evoke rises to the surface but in the end these elements aren't enough to overcome the flaws in the film's acting and script there is probably a good movie that covers these same themes and ideas but this isn't it
<START> what is most disturbing about this film is not that school killing <UNK> like the one depicted actually happen but that the truth is they are carried out by teenagers like cal and andre normal kids with normal families by using a hand held camera technique a la blair witch ben <UNK> succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some issues with high school although we aren't ever told exactly what is behind those issues they seem to be typical a lot of people hate high school so what a part of you just doesn't believe they will ever carry out the very well thought out massacre on zero day the <UNK> camera scenes in the school during the shooting are made all the more powerful for that reason you can't believe it's really happening and that it's really happened the hand held camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie a brilliant idea given the subject matter
<START> sometimes i just want to laugh don't you no <UNK> no <UNK> and no looking for deeper meaning rent this movie watch it all and laugh your ass off don't want to admit you liked it fine but don't trash it here when you and i both know you liked it it's damn funny
<START> karen goes into a japanese house as a substitute nurse to emma a strange woman who sleeps at day and wakes at night karen goes upstairs after hearing noises when she encounters a frightening ghost she will learn the <UNK> secrets br br it is very scary the scenes are shocking and frightening the characters are good the settings are creepy i love the whole plot the ending was shocking i <UNK> at a scene where the little boy <UNK> so <UNK> to the man finding his sister upstairs and i was shocked this is the scariest movie i have watched i did not see the japanese version i recommend this to horror fans 10 10 and 5 stars
<START> well what can i say other than these people are super in every way i quite like sharon <UNK> i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the <UNK> set of 9 <UNK> 30 episodes i did not realise that they had made so many i also think that it is a great shame that they have not made any more i wish that i got given these powers imagine me being knocked off my cycle somewhere and being knocked out cold then waking up in a special hospital later on i discover that my body has been enhanced just like richard <UNK> these stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way you cannot fight these 3 people as they would defeat you in all forms of <UNK> the music is well written and to me puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind the sort of powers that the <UNK> have are the same as our domestic dog or cats improved sight improved hearing and touch and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of 3 women for sharon who i thought was beautiful and intelligent when i was a boy i had a huge crush on her now i can see why on my dvd set the box is very nice and it comes with a free <UNK> all about the series i also thought that <UNK> was a good boss firm but he got things done
<START> because of all the negative reviews of this film i almost didn't watch it however i was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie the acting wasn't great apart from the wonderful alice <UNK> but some of the dialogue just consider yourself lunch was quite amusing br br on the whole an above average stephen king effort 7 10
<START> this is by far the worst horror thriller i've seen in my <UNK> years if someone offers this to you for free tell them no this movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it the plot isn't even the worst part of this movie its the acting camera work lighting and sound there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie whoever paid to have this film made is broke now i hope the director never gets the <UNK> for another movie in its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual btk killer's capture but i've seen movie of the weeks that looked like oscar winners compared to this
<START> well well well as good as john carpenter's season 1 outing in masters of horror was this is the complete opposite he certainly proved he was still a master of horror with cigarette burns but pro life is perhaps the worst i have seen from him br br it's stupid totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it <UNK> it's welcome despite the less than an hour running time the script is nonsense the characters are <UNK> and un appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd br br and for those <UNK> who actually bought the dvd one of them being me did you see how carpenter describes the film he's actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time and he <UNK> the script and in the commentary track where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut he just says he didn't feel it essential to <UNK> the mistake and he just let it be there i fear the old master has completely lost his touch i sincerely hope i'm proved wrong br br i want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome though technically speaking this film is top notch with effective lighting schemes and make up effects
<START> someday somebody is going to write an <UNK> comparing paul <UNK> fury of the <UNK> to the great spanish <UNK> films <UNK> <UNK> and un <UNK> <UNK> the naschy film is a masterpiece of <UNK> from beginning to end <UNK> and <UNK> probably loved it and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off br br the film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from a to b to c some <UNK> about a professor <UNK> his first name mind you who was bitten by a yeti monster during an expedition to <UNK> and hasn't been the same since which is understandable one of his jealous colleagues the insane daughter of the noted doctor <UNK> knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him but its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to <UNK> his inner beast br br <UNK> <UNK> out turns into a werewolf kills a few people is <UNK> dies is buried <UNK> taken to a castle filled with circus freaks <UNK> to various machines <UNK> with <UNK> electronic effects <UNK> with potent <UNK> is <UNK> up turns into a werewolf a woman in an evening <UNK> with <UNK> high nazi fetish boots

against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife the lady with the nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her <UNK> pistol they die together and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the <UNK> reporter who did nothing look what a beautiful day it is br br la <UNK> del <UNK> <UNK> was written by paul naschy in a hurry original director <UNK> <UNK> was fired and replaced by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a drunk who was <UNK> <UNK> throughout the production he was often unable to work though he did find time to <UNK> his 14 year old nephew to make some <UNK> to the script and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited <UNK> did <UNK> enough to clip some action scenes from one of <UNK> previous movies mark of the <UNK> the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different and helped pad out the runtime after <UNK> refused to get out of bed to finish the movie post production was a nightmare nobody knew who was doing the editing the money ran out the master print disappeared for a while and then at a pre release screening for a film <UNK> the executive arrived to find <UNK> <UNK> into the <UNK> in front of the theater he was too drunk to find the <UNK> but at least he made it to the <UNK> br br yet somehow the film works if you let it it keys into those <UNK> memories we have about murky <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> chains <UNK> gloomy <UNK> fans of those sort of things will find it <UNK> watchable even if the story as a whole doesn't make much sense due to the <UNK> <UNK> of the execution in one scene its <UNK> rain and the <UNK> <UNK> at the lightning in the next shot its bone dry and he's howling at the full moon then its <UNK> again and yet you don't look at it as a <UNK> its like an unfolding dream where <UNK> are possible <UNK> are the same and effects proceed causes first the <UNK> picks up the power cable and screams and then the cable starts <UNK> with electricity people say its low budget hurts the overall <UNK> i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend it is a marvel of making something out of nothing and succeeds not because of what it could of had but because of what it does it's easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it the trick is being able to see through the mayhem or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect br br paul naschy died last week at the age of 75 he had been ill with <UNK> cancer for a year or more was working on film projects right up until his last days but passed away in <UNK> spain with his family while receiving <UNK> treatment his rich varied and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man <UNK> pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream <UNK> and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like fury of the <UNK> in <UNK> awe even people who don't like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at if only for just a minute in a couple spots you can find it for free at archive <UNK> or even buy it on a dvd for a <UNK> it's worth far far more br br <UNK> naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted sick demented little movie as a classic if not an outright masterpiece of cinema <UNK> the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him but i will say this i'd rather watch fury of the <UNK> in its <UNK> most cut and <UNK> <UNK> public <UNK> print than ever sit though the overbearing obnoxious crap <UNK> out up at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this or any other weekend br br the world lost a great artist this month watch his films and remember br br 9 10
<START> i'm a big fan of camp but when every plot <UNK> is predictable and bad while obviously not trying to be even i lose interest i was going to rate this a 3 but the ending dropped it a point easily its only saving grace is that i hated other movies more not enough beer in the world for this one
<START> this was the first of <UNK> films that i have seen i saw it at melbourne film festival i was totally absorbed by the different characters that he creates and how differently they react and behave compared to aussie kids and yet on other levels how similarly i think perhaps if more people could see movies like this they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be <UNK> by the fear of the unknown there are the obvious large political differences between oz culture and iranian culture but i found the more subtle differences between the characters that this film <UNK> out so successfully on screen extremely fascinating there are <UNK> in the characters that seem to me so unique i found it made the characters compelling viewing
<START> did <UNK> really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that <UNK> <UNK> could play the lead in this movie the woman has no <UNK> personality and gives a completely lackluster performance <UNK> was great as usual and provided the only <UNK> of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green <UNK> to begin with maybe i'm expecting too much for a lifetime movie played 15 days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a <UNK> <UNK> with an actress that at least could <UNK> sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie
<START> joseph l <UNK> sleuth didn't need a remake it's a thoroughly well made film that stands up well to this day however given that the modern day remake machine is currently in full swing i really can't say i'm surprised to see the film updated for modern audience the plot remains identical to the original film and at its core we have the story of a young man milo <UNK> who goes off to see an older man andrew <UNK> to discuss a divorce as the younger man is having an affair with the older man's wife from there a game of cat and mouse ensues its clear right from the outset that director kenneth branagh wanted to add a different touch to this film and he does so by way of the central location which has been changed from the charming games ridden country house of the original to a technical marvel <UNK> out with layers of security equipment i'm glad that the director chose to make this change as nobody wants to see a remake that directly copies of the original plus there's the fact that the location is well used and always nice to look at unfortunately however the positive elements of sleuth 2007 end there br br the original film was over two hours long while this remake is only just a <UNK> over <UNK> minutes naturally therefore that means that this version has less about it and unfortunately it's the characters that suffer the plot is also rushed and we get into the first twist in the tale far too quickly and before we are given any chance to actually understand why and how these events can be taking place the film does not build the characters or the <UNK> between them enough to make sure that their relationship makes sense one major thing that has been changed about the older character is his obsession in the original he was obsessed with games which turned out to be very important once the twists come into play here he has some kind of security fetish that doesn't really mean anything by the end kenneth branagh's handling of the film allows for a classy score but the class ends there the original <UNK> on it but this film is happy merely to <UNK> itself with <UNK> on numerous and mostly <UNK> occasions which <UNK> the whole thing the final twist in the tale is completely different to how it was in the original and <UNK> that the film <UNK> down to a really hideous conclusion after spending two hours with the original i understood respected and liked both characters presented in the film after <UNK> minutes of this i hated them both i do have some respect for branagh for not merely rolling out a <UNK> copy of the original film but this is not a good adaptation of the great anthony <UNK> play
<START> they're showing this on some off network it's well crap while it is not as bad as the b movies they show on the sci fi network on <UNK> but still a fairly large pile of crap the acting is passable the plot and writing are fairly sub standard and the pacing is entirely too slow every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they're <UNK> things up before the credits not the peak of the movie the denouement also large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range they're playing the whole thing is predictable boring and not worthy of being watched save your time it's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free
<START> oh my god the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old the plot the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace br br i am not usually this critical about any movie cause every person has his her style but this movie however was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008 i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown and i think it should stay like this for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke br br i advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies or even simply movies to stay far away from this one
<START> the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from <UNK> till about 4 in the morning but their <UNK> factor is very limited if one exists at all in fact i am sure i will find a multi million pound <UNK> win more scary than anything this channel has to offer br br the <UNK> leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel the <UNK> low of a channel full of <UNK> i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is but for the purpose of <UNK> the minimum 10 lines <UNK> by this site i will at least give it a go br br firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen in fact the film might as well have been called <UNK> or <UNK> for all it has to do with the plot at least they used <UNK> at least they had <UNK> br br there are no <UNK> for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances not one i'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here br br a more suitable title would have been <UNK> italian count leads five people to a scary castle and <UNK> us silly for ninety minutes ' yes that fits better br br the acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character abysmal br br the only saving <UNK> of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene two small and very interesting <UNK> sex scenes and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her <UNK> off bonus br br otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one no vampires no dancing no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever ever ever watch this one again br br no word of a lie this film could put you off motion pictures for life
<START> it utterly <UNK> me why godard is taken so seriously and one plus one is a great example of his <UNK> as both a filmmaker and an <UNK> <UNK> it's hard to credit that godard actually believed all that <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> anyone with half a brain could work out the <UNK> of those <UNK> and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as godard was making his films supporting them as a filmmaker ask yourself would you have boring voice overs reading tedious political <UNK> at your audience and then when you couldn't think of anything else to do <UNK> another voice over to the first voice over which had lost its <UNK> after the first 100 words in any case brilliant jean luc as for godard <UNK> on making a film with the rolling stones of course he did wouldn't you it was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place the genius of the stones <UNK> a talentless and <UNK> political idiot set loose with a camera the <UNK> scene wasn't worthy of even the worst <UNK> theatre and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it as could be readily seen <UNK> out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this <UNK> crap was a satire on mainstream film making is no more than a safe get out to offer those who clearly see <UNK> poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience ironic that <UNK> one time great friend <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> made the best film about film making ever and godard made the worst with le <UNK> incidentally godard didn't choose the <UNK> track of sympathy with the devil it just happened to be the track they were working on when the <UNK> started shooting at barnes olympic studios
<START> i suppose if you like pure action you'll find it here i suppose if you find a gorgeous blonde designed to be screwed find it here i suppose if you want to find a couple of extra baddies headed by 1 2 extra extra <UNK> bosses who meat a nasty end you'll find it here br br overall routine stuff and the good guys come out on top big time under extra ordinary circumstances br br what i marvel most at how the good guys armed only with <UNK> can kill dozens of bad guys with machine guns who are shooting at them at point blank range and missing the <UNK> even get time to <UNK> their <UNK> amid the <UNK> of machine guns bullets br br ho hum
<START> i've seen tons of science fiction from the 70s some <UNK> bad and others thought provoking and truly frightening soylent green fits into the latter category yes at times it's a little campy and yes the furniture is good for a giggle or two but some of the film seems awfully <UNK> here we have a film 9 years before blade runner that <UNK> to imagine the future as <UNK> dark scary and <UNK> both charlton heston and edward g robinson fare far better in this than the ten <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> suicide scene is <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and his <UNK> some of the attitudes are dated can you imagine a filmmaker getting away with the women as furniture concept in our oh so politically correct 90s but it's rare to find a film from the me decade that actually can make you think this is one i'd love to see on the big screen because even in a widescreen presentation i don't think the overall scope of this film would receive its due check it out
<START> i saw this in the theater during it's initial release and it was disturbing then as i'm sure it would still be it was the first part of <UNK> and this was still making the rounds in towns across america and there had recently been a mass murder in my hometown where i saw this where a man went on a shooting rampage the <UNK> of that close to home event combined with this <UNK> true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience it really brought to life the excellent acting of robert blake and scott wilson i was familiar with the novel based on the true event by truman capote and the screenplay and direction by richard brooks <UNK> the event and <UNK> interpretation into compelling gritty cinematic adaptation music from <UNK> jones effectively scores it's story i've only seen this a couple times since it was too real almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers i would give this a 9 0 of a possible 10 society is so <UNK> to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be viewed with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a hallmark into the examination of the criminal psyche
<START> this is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a ny production of <UNK> although it has a lot to say about power jealousy and ambition the themes of <UNK> in our modern world the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously recognizable actors such as john glover gloria <UNK> and david lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the murder of <UNK> john <UNK> is <UNK> probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre but anyone who enjoys shakespeare should enjoy this film
<START> this is a typical late universal horror flick its technically <UNK> if by the numbers with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting the most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of <UNK> <UNK> a man with a bone disease as the film's monster its sad to see this man exploited but he probably made good use of the money they paid him <UNK> is less horrifying than the studio hoped as i more often felt pity over fear or even loathing martin <UNK> is on board as the film's mad artist and he is very amusing in this part i for one enjoy seeing <UNK> in just about anything for some reason the man <UNK> me the only other part of the film that entertained me is the film's absurd take on the art world here we are shown evil art critics who <UNK> in their ability to break artists this is side by side with the film's male hero who is an artist who paints get this pin up girls somehow our hero's work is reviewed side by side with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also amusing is the film's chief nasty critic who at one point claims that he <UNK> the hero's pin up art because women like that don't exist to which our heroine replies with an <UNK> that the critic just doesn't get out enough finally there's a bit of a subplot about the <UNK> who is an art critic herself <UNK> by the leading man completely anti feminist and ridiculous to witness overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements
<START> barbara stanwyck gives this early douglas sirk directed universal produced soap just the kick that it needs not nearly as memorable as <UNK> later <UNK> it's easy to see by watching all i desire where sirk would be heading artistically in the next few years stanwyck is a <UNK> who returns to her family in <UNK> u s a after <UNK> them a decade earlier her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return some of the cinematography is amazing and stanwyck is tough as nails and really gives this film a shot of energy overall a fairly good show
<START> zu the warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic you never would have guessed it was made in 1983 tsui <UNK> use of special effects was very creative and inventive he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre legend of zu is connected to zu warriors from magic mountain it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one the plot is a bit hard to follow but to be honest it doesn't matter it is all about the action and adventure i always was wondering what tsui <UNK> would do if he got his hands on cgi now we know he made this movie maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that there is so much happening on the screen you simply won't believe i think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in holland because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like superman returns or <UNK> 3 the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor in most of tsui <UNK> movies he combines drama fantasy martial arts and humor somehow it is missing in this movie again i am not going to be <UNK> about these small matters legend of zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see a true classic
<START> oh just what i needed another movie about 19th century england which is pretty much like regular england only <UNK> <UNK> football <UNK> in this <UNK> setting of <UNK> <UNK> and other randomly chosen titles charlotte <UNK> walks around <UNK> as jane eyre from that novel nobody has ever read willingly jane usually hangs out in mr <UNK> <UNK> where she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty <UNK> all the time one day mr rochester william hurt on auto pilot comes back to fall in love with jane and all that but there's still the matter of his <UNK> wife that is locked in the attic <UNK> that wasn't in the <UNK> after some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire they probably rented the set the movie finally comes to an end everything looked really authentic that's something i guess but then again <UNK>
<START> the japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies they have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere the problem is they have never had the money to succeed in making convincing special effects this film released in france under the title les <UNK> de <UNK> is no exception its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant <UNK> to the giant <UNK> trying to have the upper hand on the humans it's extremely awkward and laughable but well quite enjoyable too after all we do like these creatures and these films after all don't we
<START> i got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with <UNK> <UNK> as one of it's alternative titles <UNK> this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title which may mean that the other one is really bad this film is pretty bad too obviously you cant go into a film that calls itself <UNK> <UNK> and expect to see a masterpiece and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on display but it all feels very old and tired which isn't helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line it's just your average nuclear <UNK> causing people to turn into zombies etc etc the film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what you're in for low quality zombie garbage there's plenty of gore in the film and it's a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring zombie bloodbath looks really cheap too and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers the main influence seemed to be romero's superior day of the dead although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore it all <UNK> down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall i can't say i was impressed with it
<START> gods i haven't watched a movie this awful in a long while maybe not since 'the new <UNK> or various <UNK> <UNK> jr movies yes it is that <UNK> awful mira <UNK> blank and wooden acting surely must've been inspired by <UNK> the movie staging was awkward like a play rather and that feeling of <UNK> does not work well on film the actors had no idea what they were doing especially sorvino her accent was awful and her sex appeal non existent here so it was painful to see her <UNK> other characters and they <UNK> for it and what was with the <UNK> shots of a live audience in lawn <UNK> nonsensical i had to turn the dvd player off it would have been self inflicted pain to finish this film
<START> a woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town and hears two <UNK> stories from the local weirdo both zombie related but perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too br br the zombie chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films i have ever seen in fact i must confess so bad was it i fast <UNK> through most of the garbage and there was a lot of that believe me it runs for just <UNK> minutes and there is still tons of filler you get some <UNK> doing a lot of push ups plenty of dull <UNK> <UNK> scenes between goofy teens that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors br br as for the title characters they barely even have a <UNK> in the film why you get more undead action in the intro than you do the <UNK> feature though considering how pathetic the eyes <UNK> out of <UNK> and the eating of brains sequences are amongst other <UNK> maybe that's a <UNK> in disguise br br and to top it all off it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on youtube jerky camera work <UNK> on the print <UNK> lights i had to rub my eyes when i realised it was made in 2001 and not 1971 even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date br br if you think i'm not <UNK> to do a review of chronicles having not seen the whole film then go ahead you try sitting through it i <UNK> you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue <UNK> <UNK> freaks before making your excuses and leaving it is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it and honestly you'll get far more fun <UNK> your drink on the disc than actually torturing your dvd player with this <UNK> excuse for horror in fact don't for surprised if it packs it's <UNK> and leaves in the morning leaving you doomed to watch vhs tapes for the rest of your life you have been warned 0 10 br br p s what kind of 18 rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports <UNK> on during the obligatory sex scene see the movie can't even get that part right
<START> i buy or at least watch every <UNK> movie he came out with a handful of good movies then <UNK> into poor stories bad camera work and a walk thru persona he nearly lost me a few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie now he's forgotten again this film is seriously dark on any level you care to name there is a lot of slash <UNK> going on here with no discernible purpose unless it's meant as a warning against the military br br <UNK> may have had a stand in for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone else's voice was used most of the time sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody then <UNK> to raise havoc all over the place okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner anyway this bad guy was at least colorful and very focused there's lots of gore if you like that king of thing it looked to me like the bad guys <UNK> the same <UNK> every time i'm just glad they didn't suck the blood from their hapless victims i <UNK> you back to my summary basically it is a horror movie disguised as an action film <UNK> 6 2006
<START> i had heard this film was a study of a landscape <UNK> art by presenting the beauty in man's <UNK> the natural landscape it certainly showed the <UNK> activities to find locations setup shots and capture stark images whose final <UNK> were art studios worldwide put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show br br this film <UNK> by you <UNK> the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that <UNK> you like on slow moving river each sequence stands on its own but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming <UNK> there are few words this allowing the <UNK> in what is shown to <UNK> in its own way an awful massive factory filled with human <UNK> who live in hopelessly lifeless <UNK> individuals dying early while <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> in mountains of our e waste the <UNK> of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant <UNK> the construction of the three <UNK> <UNK> the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time the time <UNK> as a city dies and is simultaneously <UNK> into a <UNK> of <UNK> that <UNK> destroys all <UNK> of the culture that was br br the most terrifying image for me was a <UNK> engineer explaining that the most important function of the <UNK> was <UNK> control the shot shifts to the <UNK> behind the <UNK> where you witness the level of the last <UNK> by the toxic water having eaten the <UNK> from the trees <UNK> that nothing but the most hideous <UNK> could be living in the waters br br the obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy save the earth documentaries the artist edward <UNK> explains the method wonderfully <UNK> not saying what you should see  many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you don't necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we're doing is creating problems that run deep it is not a simple right or wrong it needs a whole new way of <UNK> the subtlety of this <UNK> into an either or <UNK> but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side br br though never stated directly in any way as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate there is only one conclusion possible  we are doomed the progress of mankind that is <UNK> from our <UNK> leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in what he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> toward our own demise unlike most films with <UNK> themes this one ends with no call to arms it <UNK> basically what's the point but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally
<START> this film has a weak plot weak characterization and really weak special effects that i question why i lost valuable life by watching it it has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film the robots are sad and the main hero <UNK> is turned on by a huge knife switch if this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable but there's nothing funny about it the main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters and he is killed it's sad when you root for the bad guy because he's the best one to cheer for when all is said and done this movie was better left on the cutting room floor or never <UNK> at all
<START> the secret is this movie blows sorry but it just did br br spoiler br br in this bad riff on i know what you did last summer and scream beth played admirably by <UNK> barton joins several friends on a spring break trip the group <UNK> a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation then the deaths begin first one then another then another of the friends is murdered leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results br br one note <UNK> barton is the poor man's reese <UNK> looks like reese acts like reese and could pass for reese in a police <UNK> maybe that's how they cast her <UNK> decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing
<START> oh my god this is without a doubt the absolute <UNK> movie i have ever seen the acting is bad the story is weak the characters are weaker and the whole film just doesn't make sense couple this with mediocre directing really strange scenes such as the one where the kid reaches over the <UNK> and mysteriously falls in and thoroughly abysmal dialog look <UNK> <UNK> his pants and you get one complete failure not to mention the fact that the only thing mr <UNK> looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars but this is part of the movie's charm sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh br br i love this movie because it's just so bad
<START> yeah stupidity i just finish watching and i still have bad taste in my mouth too much colors too much unnecessary <UNK> to a story too much stupid characters i presume they wanted to achieve comic relief but i only wanted to cry too much of everything shame to spoil one of divine stories from <UNK> nights like this childish naive both on a bad way and with lot of magic breaking mistakes i don't think this could keep a child of five for more then ten minutes princess is lovely but should be <UNK> cause actress don't know how to carry a role rest of the cast is even worse our bad guy is really bad shame that the good guy is not better only light in this dark is of course david carradine who goes unfortunately deeply down under his level with this but at least keep his actor fighter skills at top i'm still sorry to see him in a thing like this but glad that i had something to watch in whole <UNK> so thank you david only only for him i give this 2 stars to this fiasco i would give more for him but that would rise final score to entire movie the rest is so bad that i would maybe like to grade it but there is no grade lover then 1 here and i think that would be too much
<START> i can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this film's link with the eighties but i really wouldn't say it's an accurate depiction of most <UNK> lives in that era even on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it is however typical of the blunt <UNK> rubbish the dear old royal court theatre was <UNK> out at that time plenty of <UNK> <UNK> artistry for small small audiences but enough well connected <UNK> to ensure future <UNK> for turgid <UNK> <UNK> simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon <UNK> common experience you'll find millions more <UNK> in knowing <UNK> to love and live as depicted in <UNK> <UNK> br br i would be tempted to call this a <UNK> <UNK> drama but that would be doing a great <UNK> to the <UNK> industry however as far as having a decent script is concerned this film is indeed all washed up for some reason it has <UNK> an odd following amongst guardian reading film goers i can only assume they get a visual <UNK> out of pretending to <UNK> it steer clear my friends it is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim life on the <UNK> it isn't but it is grim do the <UNK> up instead
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen while featuring good actors the movie doesn't live up to the expectations the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music which pretty much sums up the movie <UNK> for a bad and confusing storyline by having known good actors loud and dramatic music it doesn't change the fact that this is a very boring movie to watch earned itself a score of 1
<START> some people think that the second series was where scooby was ruined i disagree totally the shows quality did not go up or down and <UNK> win my opinion as a very good <UNK> i looked at a <UNK> on <UNK> com and <UNK> of people said <UNK> second series was <UNK> downfall ok so loads said yes but 28 still cant be wrong i do like the way most of the episodes focused on comedy i believe the show would have gone rubbish if it was the same 5 people dog solving mystery in same formula <UNK> was a breath of fresh air to the show sure some people tuned out but when <UNK> was introduced viewing figures <UNK> back to the show all the episodes and segments were very funny i was <UNK> by the <UNK> shorts and but at the end of the day its a matter of opinion if you like <UNK> or not is a matter of opinion there is certainly no fact involved but in my opinion this was a superb series that gave a beginning to tire show a new formula and <UNK> of life <UNK> said
<START> <UNK> is a story of fifties london a world of budding rock stars violence and forced homosexuality <UNK> uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that <UNK> the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion <UNK> much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such <UNK> language it's as if the stilted <UNK> of 1950s screenwriters serves a common <UNK> for a past that seems in consequence a very distant country indeed and therefore <UNK> the particular rather than the universal in the story <UNK> features a strong performance from ian hart and annoying ones from <UNK> <UNK> and ewan <UNK> the latter still struggling to build a post <UNK> career but feels like a period piece a modern film <UNK> structured in an outdated <UNK> rather dull actually
<START> good grief i can't even begin to describe how poor this film is don't get me wrong i wasn't expecting much to begin with let's face it a pg 13 slasher flick is pre destined to be missing the <UNK> <UNK> so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore but it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away br br we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy and here's a <UNK> for the books she never changes hence breaking the <UNK> rule of basic screen writing character development if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some <UNK> then think again br br on top of this we're handed possibly the least intriguing and definitely the least scary killer ever to grace the genre i'm not joking when i say that <UNK> the <UNK> has scarier villains than this movie br br finally because all the potential for tension or <UNK> is removed by the inept and apparently thirteen year old director what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time br br <UNK> that's what br br lots and lots of <UNK> big <UNK> small <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> so many damned <UNK> you'll not want to dress yourself for another year in fact this movie should have just been called closet and had a picture of a big scary <UNK> on the dvd case on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert something to the extent of what the f did we just waste our time watching
<START> this movie stars jay leno as a detroit cop tony <UNK> and pat <UNK> as a tokyo cop sent to detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car <UNK> a japanese man traveled to detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to <UNK> the deal killed him and took the prototype an angry derek <UNK> tries to distance himself from phillip <UNK> who led the men but <UNK> played by chris sarandon has none of it and threatens <UNK> forcing him to continue their <UNK> meanwhile in the same junk yard where the japanese man had been killed a friend of tony <UNK> was also killed by the same men tony's friend had been watching the junk yard br br tony sets out to find the killer against his <UNK> order tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case while tony is investigating the crime he runs into the japanese cop and <UNK> he <UNK> him eventually they end up working together on the case they make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as pat <UNK> jumping and kicking right through a the <UNK> of a moving car and kicking <UNK> in the head but it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie at least in my opinion jay leno is no actor but he is likable in the role and pat <UNK> is good as well still they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop <UNK> in an action film if you liked buddy cop films cheesy 80's movies or you want to see jay leno as an actor then i recommend this movie
<START> well i'd heard from somewhere that ossessione is a <UNK> to the italian film genre and particular favourite of mine the <UNK> but actually aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in italy the two have pretty much no relation in the sixties and seventies italian film makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful american film released they've not done that here but ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later american film 'the <UNK> always rings <UNK> without giving the <UNK> author james m cain so much as a credit anyway the plot focuses on gino <UNK> a handsome drifter who by chance stumbles upon a <UNK> where a woman named giovanna <UNK> works he soon learns that she's married to <UNK> a big fat annoying man whom giovanna can't stand to have even touching her he wants the pair of them to run away together but she's not so keen on the idea however fate ends up <UNK> and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful br br despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not <UNK> the author whose story it's based on it has to be said that director <UNK> visconti <UNK> the film noir style well and in a way i even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger american noir classics the story is as you would expect extremely strong and the visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast visconti drags the film out a little bit too much however and with a running time of almost <UNK> minutes i felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length i almost feel guilty for <UNK> all this criticism at ossessione as it is a good film but it's not a <UNK> film the relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly and it seems like the film is <UNK> to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters' heads there's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on and by not always focusing on the characters themselves the film is not as interesting as it could have been still it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason although it's not as good as the 1946 version of the same james m cain classic
<START> because it is that's why this is the same jealous daughter kills people flick we've seen a billion times <UNK> arquette makes anything worth watching and mandy <UNK> brief nude scene after <UNK> via scantily clad <UNK> throughout the film at the end almost make this trite <UNK> worthwhile but not quite br br out of
<START> pre adolescent humor is present in large <UNK> the acting and story are wonderful if you can stomach the concept those with weak <UNK> will have some difficulty since the worms are realistic enough to cause <UNK> of more than a few in the audience br br tom <UNK> and <UNK> kate <UNK> stole the spotlight but the young <UNK> <UNK> could get some serious time on screen over the next few years br br miss <UNK> has developed from a cute face into a strong young actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery br br the story does a spectacular job in dealing with bullying friendship and fairness it creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open and frank manner while <UNK> some gross scene from the film
<START> don't really know where to start with one of the worst films i have had the <UNK> to watch in a very long time from the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited london for even 1 day will agree was not london to the much unexplained way how <UNK> character managed to escape the country back to the us without a single problem then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in america how on earth did grandma agree to that he's an assassin well that's the ending how about during the film well unfortunately that didn't fare much better we have british cops driving an amazing range of cars i'm sure it was an eighties <UNK> <UNK> which chased the taxi after the <UNK> but a modern <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the prison van in a few scenes prior <UNK> or whoever the gun <UNK> arm of the met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after <UNK> along with the cia there were children walking around but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him does this happen in london no it doesn't i live there we also have the very implausible travel from central london to the airport let's say <UNK> for arguments sake within 5 minutes of receiving a call we also have terrible american accents a young girl who's <UNK> than the queen but lives in elephant castle what does it say for british police when <UNK> and a number of officers at <UNK> location can't find <UNK> and he manages to <UNK> capture by hiding behind some stairs the train station was obviously not even on uk <UNK> and the fight scene sound effects were terrible the plot was also extremely poor boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before but there were a few notable actors cast in this film what were they thinking and please don't let that <UNK> you to watch this film this film didn't seem to know what it wanted to be if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an <UNK> then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it if you want an all out action film which this is not then continuity and scenery can be put to the side
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> remake of an old celebrated english film although it may be overly <UNK> as a total disaster which it is not it never builds any tension and betrays its tv origins richard burton <UNK> through his role and sophia <UNK> closed in this movie face doesn't display much passion either
<START> just kidding about the weight loss thing well you might lose weight you never know anyway what can i say i love this film it has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like stand by me and the <UNK> <UNK> closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we overlook them the film reminds us what it's like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic mystery and horror they perceive <UNK> closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who's had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with watch it with friends watch it with loved ones build a <UNK> wine <UNK>
<START> this film was made in <UNK> and <UNK> parks and returned the world eye again to what little of the wild western canada is left when <UNK> began to write his stories for the papers the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and <UNK> <UNK> the first nation peoples br br the film puts forward and asks the question why would a well educated obviously talented <UNK> become an indian br br <UNK> as an english boy dreams about becoming something but <UNK> the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless no <UNK> what it is sounds like a famous puppet story doesn't it br br in my opinion i saw <UNK> become my living image of the <UNK> store indian a very wooden character and not real at all very well done acting on the part of mr brosnan he also portrayed the wild indian in the dance scene for the tourist the <UNK> and or reality of it weren't realized till he met and married his wife annie br br annie pushed <UNK> in a direction that would bring him to the <UNK> of the <UNK> world stage not as himself but grey owl an canadian native of the wilderness frontier br br this is the closest <UNK> get to becoming the noble savage prototype br br mr <UNK> interpretation as well as the directors is both well done i have watched documentaries on grey owl and i think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection br br spoiler i thought the final scenes with <UNK> going to meet the grand <UNK> of <UNK> was a great a great moment in the film br br very beautiful canadian lake scenery and real grey owl locations br br
<START> where to start this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen the editing is the worst ever the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects with muddled talking in the background i had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on and what was i supposed to hear exactly probably one of the worst scripts ever made i can't believe people actually put up some green for this film it makes me think i could take a crap in a box send it to producers and then have them <UNK> a movie for me br br dolph was a usual dolph nothing else needs to be said the villains were bad the protagonists were bad and the movie was a stinker if you really want to know what not to do when either writing directing or editing a movie watch this
<START> even if one didn't realize that sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the film's release the <UNK> plot of dr fu <UNK> would be painful viewing it is supposedly a lampoon of <UNK> <UNK> famous oriental villain but it lacks any focus the potential for satirical commentary on the anti oriental overtones of <UNK> concept are ignored indeed the movie employs racist insults there are hardly any actual jokes or gags just mostly actors behaving <UNK> and <UNK> dreary lines it is especially <UNK> to see sid <UNK> forced to <UNK> <UNK> and racial <UNK> for attempted laughs most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well br br and then there's peter sellers he plays the <UNK> roles of the sinister fu <UNK> who is trying to <UNK> a formula to regain his youth and his <UNK> british <UNK> <UNK> smith sellers isn't one hundred per <UNK> bad he conveys a quirky warmth as smith when he <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> to his lawn <UNK> and he's oddly moving as <UNK> when he expresses his love for english music hall entertainment but most of the time he plays both roles with a weary <UNK> thus further <UNK> any comical possibilities <UNK> routines where he <UNK> his <UNK> strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating he seems too convincingly <UNK> to be funny br br a few genuinely witty lines an apt slapstick bit by burt <UNK> <UNK> in the pink <UNK> films as one of <UNK> <UNK> and helen <UNK> amusing musical numbers cannot salvage this mess if anyone wants to understand why peter sellers is considered a comedic genius they won't learn anything from the <UNK> plot of dr fu <UNK>
<START> i've seen the original non dubbed german version and i was surprised how bad this movie actually is thinking i had seen my share of bad movies like <UNK> 2 <UNK> <UNK> zombie lake and such nothing could've prepared me for this it really was a pain to sit through this flick as there's no plot no good acting and even the special effects aren't convincing especially the so called zombies wearing nothing more than white make up and their old clothes so their good set wouldn't be ruined by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br if you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life then watch it for all the others don't do it because you will regret it
<START> <UNK> an authentic tough guy but this movie misfire from normally competent rko <UNK> his impact at every turn the script is about as plausible as <UNK> simpson at a ten <UNK> dinner just count the times <UNK> incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his <UNK> and violent acts the old cliché about it only happening in the movies applies here in <UNK> then there's the guy playing the <UNK> who appears to have <UNK> in from a <UNK> <UNK> fields comedy ruining the menacing mood in the process the static one room sets don't help either and neither does director <UNK> obvious lack of feel for the material then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay off and the results are pretty flat in fact the movie only picks up in the station house scenes where hard bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent looking gas station <UNK> too bad that <UNK> career never really <UNK> i gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off screen as on and getting in one sleazy <UNK> after another his ice cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of lee marvin at his tough guy best anyway this project might have worked as a radio play but as a movie with a promising noir title it's a disappointment
<START> this is about the worst movie i have ever seen this movie does match the quality of such movies as they cabin fever but even those had name actors where this one fell short the eye candy of this movie looked to be a 50 woman with a bad face lift just an example of the quality i would have rated this movie in the negative if possible ladies i have to tell you that the men were not bad to look at but not much either if you were planning on going to see this movie i would strongly recommend saving your money
<START> fragile <UNK> just before his great period although it is sometimes <UNK> directed and marred by <UNK> hotel du <UNK> is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of french films of the late 1930s as well as a relative <UNK> of touch unusual with this director all of his great virtues are here the <UNK> interiors broken up by <UNK> complex delicious camera movements a melancholy <UNK> of light and <UNK> remarkable <UNK> sets by alexander <UNK> which are so <UNK> that they as the title suggests take on a <UNK> personality of their own the quietly <UNK> music of maurice <UNK> a seemingly casual plot about romance tragedy and <UNK> that casts a <UNK> over its characters extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time in this case louis <UNK> and <UNK> br br in fact the film's biggest failing and i find myself <UNK> as someone who usually <UNK> <UNK> its importance to admit it is its script it has plenty of wit and <UNK> but without the poetry and irony regular <UNK> <UNK> jacques <UNK> brought to their best films it cannot avoid <UNK> into cliche even if it is only cliche in <UNK> br br ostensibly set in the <UNK> house the film sets up its opening idea of community with two <UNK> tales of doomed love and emotional <UNK> and actual isolation the doomed love scenario is the one that works least well <UNK> is very beautiful but not very good at doing tragic while <UNK> <UNK> brilliantly appropriate though it may be by its nature <UNK> any real felt romance maybe it's just me but i find it hard to <UNK> with a couple so young so attractive who after only a few months are so <UNK> with despair that they have to shoot each other their high <UNK> lines are rather embarrassing too of course this affair is not meant to be plausible they are symbolic of youth hope and possibility being crushed in france or maybe france itself <UNK> <UNK> waiting for death for symbols to be truly powerful they must convince on a narrative level which i feel they don't quite here br br what saves this plot is its connection with the story of m <UNK> a character linked to the great tradition of french gangsters although we only learn it gradually he is a killer in hiding living off the prostitute played by <UNK> having <UNK> in his <UNK> in his previous <UNK> and the <UNK> of his position is crucial he had one set of traits in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite living a rather <UNK> life he is profoundly <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> and becomes <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of trying to cheat death br br in this way the admission that one is less a person than a collection of signs and that death is an <UNK> reality the most powerful <UNK> must <UNK> to <UNK> is like a romantic prototype of <UNK> <UNK> killers with one exception he gives briefly into hope a <UNK> which only <UNK> if that's not too much of an unbearable irony his fatal resolve br br all this could have been trite if it wasn't for the truly amazing performance of louis <UNK> i had studied his theatrical work at college but this was my first taste of his screen talents and he reveals himself to be worthy of the <UNK> grant mastroianni <UNK> mason mitchum <UNK> giving a quiet <UNK> to a role which is more of a conception he needless to say is <UNK> too than an actual person <UNK> begins the film a minor supporting character but emerges as a tragic hero of some force like all those major actors <UNK> brilliance lies in what he <UNK> br br on a <UNK> level what <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> ten years before its <UNK> of the techniques of the great hollywood <UNK> of sirk <UNK> ray and minnelli although his <UNK> lacks the <UNK> and clear eyed beauty of <UNK> contemporary german <UNK> check out the masterpieces zu <UNK> <UNK> and la <UNK> <UNK> style truly fits his theme that of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the film's principle <UNK> is that of water the credits <UNK> and <UNK> the hotel stands by a <UNK> but instead of <UNK> open river of possibility we have a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> going nowhere the film begins as it ends and the setting never changes except for one brief <UNK> from which both <UNK> are doomed to return characters can only escape through death their <UNK> is <UNK> by the narrow rooms they <UNK> the walls and frames that hold them captive the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve any hope at the end therefore is profoundly if <UNK> <UNK>
<START> is <UNK> activity with little or <UNK> results on the surface so in that respect <UNK> average voting score is spot on br br a spanish film made in the usa with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of <UNK> <UNK> dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time as well as wasting the money of those who backed the project <UNK> br br the slugs involved are originals from <UNK> northern spain but as they were not allowed into the united states plastic ones had to be made however <UNK> them up in the <UNK> being used for making the evening dinner time <UNK> <UNK> rather <UNK> with <UNK> music as well as a rather <UNK> array of other us forgotten hits or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for <UNK> it the actors involved were also a rather <UNK> array just suitable for a low budget film which might be <UNK> as horrific horrifying horrible or just simple awful br br as a result the outcome is <UNK> on the surface <UNK> underground and about as attractive as chapter 17 000 of <UNK> street or the latest news from <UNK>
<START> my brother brought this movie home from the rental store and i remember expecting it to be such a bore i think the title especially put me off i can't ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over i watched the movie twice before i let my brother take it back to the store it is very <UNK> that a movie speaks to me the way this one did i was completely caught up in <UNK> situation as she tries to make her way through her life the bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly i could have kept watching for hours another downside is that i have been <UNK> with everything ashley judd has done since she is so perfect in this movie this film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time
<START> though not seen in too many films prior you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since br br not one of <UNK> nor <UNK> best films they make an outstanding effort together after all with that much talent and very good supporting cast you know the laughs will be there br br the film is light has some dramatic <UNK> but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through br br a great example of classic american film fare that has stood the test of time br br definite saturday afternoon fare heavy on the popcorn
<START> the invisible man is a fantastic movie from 1933 a cutting edge film for it's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible go ahead take a look at the film you will be shocked that it was made in 1933 it was the first true special effects movie come 2000 computer aided special effects seem like child's play audiences are not blown away by special effects instead they are disappointed if they are not done right the special effects in hollow man the update of the <UNK> wells story are ok but not the biggest problem with this film directed by paul verhoeven who you might remember from <UNK> and total recall kevin bacon plays sebastian caine a scientist <UNK> in the world of bio <UNK> yeah i know that's not a word but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the <UNK> funding so as movie characters who are about to have their funding <UNK> are prone to do he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the <UNK> yeah i know i used that non word again process the process has dire consequences no caine does not die but instead becomes a horny violent creature aka a guy now that he's invisible caine stalks a sexy neighbor a co worker former girlfriend linda <UNK> <UNK> and the man who took away his funding then a funny thing happens caine becomes a new supernatural being the thing that won't die laughing in the face of all things natural caine faces down death and <UNK> in it's face as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die dragging the ending of the movie out the movie is silly stupid and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used sometimes not there are neat possibilities in hollow man but of course not one of them is explored for a more interesting look at an invisible being get ready for some good old fashioned black and white cinema and check out the 1933 invisible man kevin bacon will still be invisible when you come back probably still alive at the bottom of a <UNK>
<START> the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission he plays a kind of james <UNK> psycho twin brother separated at birth no doubt as an intense hit man his character is very sexual but even better very funny add the kind hearted uber likable american guy next <UNK> greg kinnear to set up contrast the <UNK> locations vivid colors and quick witted humor provide great entertainment hope davis is well cast as the gem of a wife but the focus of the film is on the two <UNK> a new odd couple and that's the part that works very well have a great probably r rated laugh and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper
<START> last week i took a look at the weekly <UNK> ratings and there was <UNK> mars supposedly the best show you're not watching br br well they're right that you're not watching it it aired twice and was <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> out of <UNK> br br translation this is the lowest rated show on any <UNK> broadcast network and deservedly so i tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage <UNK> it as a great show a realistic look at life and all such nonsense the reality was otherwise <UNK> mars is a bore it's as unrealistic as it gets and it richly deserves to be canceled br br the only mystery is why <UNK> felt compelled to put on its <UNK> schedule the lowest rated show in memory after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure
<START> in christian <UNK> movie hitler the rise of evil hitler's early years in life and politics is shown in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration it is quite natural for a hollywood movie to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the <UNK> that they will get from the movie even though such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done by the book i believe that most of them fits well with the rest of the movie making it more interesting we should not forget that this movie is not a documentary who cares how did his dog died anyway br br throughout the movie hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals but he was not portrayed as a super villain but more like an ambitious politician i believe that this is a nice perspective as the movie is not <UNK> by tons of negative emotions and this made the movie somewhat objective yes he was a little mad and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in <UNK> <UNK> i believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts br br the flow of history is nicely reflected to <UNK> even though the movie's focus was around hitler we also had chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions via <UNK> discussions of people and the songs in a jewish <UNK> also <UNK> reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited struggles of journalist fritz <UNK> and ironic plays that are played in the <UNK> was amusing and interesting but that was all mostly we only saw his followers <UNK> the streets and cheering him br br another thing that was missing in the movie is information about the origins of his hatred for jews in the beginning of the movie some ideas about this is given but they were quite superficial all of a sudden he was a politician who is giving speeches about necessity of <UNK> of jews br br in conclusion hitler the rise of evil cannot be considered as an excellent movie that everyone will like but it is not <UNK> at all if you can stand directors that change history for cash it is an interesting movie <UNK> hitler's personality in a successful way
<START> <UNK> the movie a variation on the original 2 part pilot yet the movie although shorter does contain extra footage unseen in the 2 hour pilot the pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie where as a pilot movie is normally the same 2 <UNK> combined but the movie is actually a different edit with extras here and cuts there br br worth a look even if you have the season 1 dvd set i'd still pick up a copy of the movie it's still in some <UNK> like virgin <UNK> and the likes of mixed media stores although it generally needs <UNK> but it saves needing to buy online as many of us still don't do or trust online shopping but if you look around <UNK> in stores br br <UNK> was truly 1 of the 80's most under rated shows br br a full size <UNK> is currently being re built for a helicopter museum info and work in progress pictures are over at http <UNK> <UNK> also with <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> and flight <UNK> games it <UNK> she's finally here to stay
<START> this film is basically two hours of <UNK> character drinking himself nearly literally to death the only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised it was just a grim sad waste of time br br willem dafoe is excellent actor peter <UNK> is an excellent actor but this film just sucked slow doesn't make the movie bad it was just bad the <UNK> plot mixed with artistic <UNK> of <UNK> detail aren't <UNK> drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives finally at the end i really appreciate the artistic vision but as entertainment it put me to sleep seriously i fell asleep and had to re watch the film which was even more disappointing br br i generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others even when they suck but this film <UNK> one it's just too bad that these great actors were <UNK> with this end result
<START> <UNK> from family ties plays eddie a <UNK> <UNK> nerd who gets picked on when his favorite <UNK> <UNK> singer sammi <UNK> dies he throws a <UNK> fit <UNK> down all the posters on his bedroom wall but when he later gets an <UNK> record that holds the spirit of his dead <UNK> idol he first gets sucked into ideas of revenge but then he doesn't want to take it as far as sammi does which isn't really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital this movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say rock star ok maybe a tad more than that piece of junk but you get my point and how anyone can root for a guy played by <UNK> from family ties i haven't a clue the cameo by gene simmons is ok and <UNK> <UNK> reaches <UNK> i applaud him for that but otherwise skip this one br br my grade d br br eye candy <UNK> richards gets topless an a topless extra at a pool party
<START> <UNK> tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy <UNK> water on himself and rolling on the floor to much calm down get yourself together and make us laugh i didn't quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars just because there both up on stage or something he said that every comedian wants to be a rock star i'm sure rodney <UNK> was really into that when he was alive he had a few good jokes like the <UNK> king joke where people yell at the drive thru i also liked the <UNK> pieces joke if <UNK> just didn't act so mental he might be funnier and i might have given this a higher rating as high as maybe an eight
<START> on the surface written on the wind is a lurid glossy soap opera about the sexual <UNK> of a texas oil family but underneath it all is a deep social commentary on 1950's life director douglas sirk scores again with another <UNK> <UNK> robert stack falls in love with lauren bacall the problem is that <UNK> best pal rock hudson loves her too when stack finds out he's <UNK> and bacall ends up pregnant the fireworks fly and the all too good dorothy malone won an oscar for her <UNK> of <UNK> biggest <UNK> who is <UNK> by hudson good epic soap opera
<START> this movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else i've ever seen really if you are a <UNK> fan rent it just to laugh at it with your friends i won't be the <UNK> person to rip apart its flaws all i will say is that the movie for me anyway lost major points for turning my favorite character sam into a bumbling idiot shame shame 3 10
<START> adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they're two different <UNK> do you think it's a great idea to make <UNK> into a stage play imagine it where two <UNK> <UNK> sit in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there's thousands of them out there great movie and a bad stage play br br in order for a stage play to make great cinema there's two <UNK> needed br br 1 a fine cast that creates on screen chemistry br br 2 great dialogue br br on paper cher and <UNK> <UNK> would be a good casting choice but not in these roles the story revolves around a hit man played by <UNK> breaking into a house to kill a wife played by cher with most of the action taking place inside the house i was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which can't decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny since the story is very static it's of the <UNK> importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it <UNK> more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give faithful a miss and watch 12 angry men instead
<START> swedish action movies have over the past few years evolved into something that imitate american hardened action movies like heat but with a low budget this movie follows the same <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> however it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough movie br br the story has been seen before the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor especially from the main actress the movie tries to paint a picture of hard boiled military like robbers with no <UNK> at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational it does not succeed very well br br the <UNK> cast photo style does not seem fresh anymore and it is not even done well in this picture only a very few scenes actually look good also the sound is quite weird and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue is recorded afterward br br the main quality of this movie is <UNK> <UNK> though not making a convincing portrait of a <UNK> team leader has some really funny lines also the music is quite well
<START> it is very hard to rate this film as entertainment value for 21st century viewers it fails miserably however for the student of early sound films and history it is a jewel show of shows was a <UNK> filmed to compete with <UNK> successful hollywood <UNK> of <UNK> which still survives intact complete with its technicolor scenes br br the purpose of the all star <UNK> was to showcase a particular <UNK> silent stars in speaking roles and show that they could make the transition however warner bros seems to have forgotten this and employs many acts and stars that they didn't even have under long term contract such as ben <UNK> lloyd hamilton <UNK> <UNK> and even a <UNK> band meanwhile their biggest talent al <UNK> is <UNK> absent even at a high <UNK> he could not be compelled to join in almost every act is overly long and the film plays like a dozen or so <UNK> shorts strung together with no continuity the finale is also overly long but it is really enjoyable with all of its dance numbers br br the highlights of the film are two numbers from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in the <UNK> a couple of numbers with nick lucas john barrymore performing shakespeare and the chinese fantasy li <UNK> li with nick lucas and myrna loy this last number is the only part of the film that survives in technicolor and it really is quite attractive reasonably enough the players in these good acts were long term warner bros stars so perhaps the director knew how to play to their strengths since he was familiar with them br br this film acts as a <UNK> at an odd point in film history the year <UNK> which was the bridge year between two <UNK> the silent and sound <UNK> and the roaring <UNK> and the great depression just two years later this same film would have had an entirely different cast as warner bros would abandon its silent era stars and the stars they hired just to produce the early musicals in favor of those stars that gave warner bros its distinctive urban look and feel james cagney joan blondell edward g robinson and others
<START> a clever script from the late sebastian <UNK> and smart performances from the two male leads <UNK> <UNK> and charles bronson or should it be the other way around result in an engaging and entertaining thriller br br add to the above the competent direction from veteran jean herman and a sparse but effective score by <UNK> de <UNK> it becomes easy why this film has an odd timeless quality br br this is a buddy buddy or bonding story with two <UNK> both <UNK> and world weary returning presumably from <UNK> like the other colonial powers of this time post <UNK> ii leading into the 60s france had <UNK> to keep up appearances overseas losing <UNK> was a bitter blow br br <UNK> <UNK> the original title chronicles the actions of our two anti heroes as they struggle to make a go of it after their <UNK> br br one thing happens after another and the viewer really has to pay attention because <UNK> is lean and <UNK> with his script if it is there then there must be a reason br br suffice to say these two men battle it out physically and psychologically one long weekend their motivation is quite different their goals are different their survival depends entirely on each other that <UNK> <UNK> and charles bronson are <UNK> so different the former arguably a pretty boy and the latter an ugly thug adds to the chemistry br br that quest makes for a great story which in turn makes for a great film br br <UNK> i forget there are women in this film and true to the <UNK> method they too are memorable though not nearly as fleshed out to say much more would be to spoil one's delight in discovering their true nature br br farewell friend has been released in the uk an <UNK> image 16 9 enhanced in english only not even subtitles for the hard of hearing a running time of <UNK> minutes <UNK> soundtrack but the de <UNK> music has lots of punch br br highly recommended
<START> in this satire of the <UNK> and <UNK> of war john cusack plays brand <UNK> an assassin sent to to <UNK> to take out omar <UNK> who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former vice president of the <UNK> own company in addition to this <UNK> must <UNK> his fake position as a trade show producer a wedding for pop princess <UNK> <UNK> duff and a <UNK> liberal journalist natalie marisa tomei br br <UNK> the technical aspects br br the acting by the main characters at least was good as was to be expected some of john <UNK> dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it maybe unrealistic is more accurate joan put forth a great and often hilarious performance marisa tomei while i've never been a big fan of hers was more than suitable for the role and worked well <UNK> duff however was pretty terrible they needed an attractive middle eastern or russian or whatever that accent was supposed to be pop star unfortunately they went 0 for 3 with her br br like i said above the writing seemed a little stiff and <UNK> at points especially john <UNK> dialogue not much of it mind but some the story also got a bit ludicrous at points which is fine for a satire to a point but it took it to a whole new level here luckily the <UNK> and tomei keep a relatively cool calm demeanor throughout and that makes a nice even mix of the <UNK> of the film and the <UNK> of the actors br br joshua <UNK> who previously had a <UNK> of real credits to his name did a fine job with a rather wide spectrum film he handled the small 10 million budget very well <UNK> it to make it appear to be much more <UNK> also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story with the painful and hard to watch parts of the real war including slaughter of civilians etc br br as far as the general satire goes its exaggerated look on the <UNK> of war is very well done especially the <UNK> palace <UNK> ads on the u s tanks at points it becomes a little too much but in the end it still accurate portrays what it's going for an a young <UNK> <UNK> type of style br br overall the film is very well made for the <UNK> budget and it's definitely worthy of a look it won't go down as one of the great <UNK> of cinema but it's certainly not the worst br br 7 10
<START> this is not a very good telling of the tarzan epic there was only one reason for this movie john derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the buff bo derek in <UNK> was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex this movie is nothing more than soft porn if you're into that well then fast forward to it and skip the rest this movie like <UNK> was again a vehicle for bo derek to show off her terrible acting she is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie richard harris was a better actor than this this was one of his few mistakes don't waste your time on this movie go buy the book instead
<START> a river runs through it is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the <UNK> of its cinematography can be truly appreciated the acting is wonderful and understated with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning brad pitt gives a <UNK> performance and tom <UNK> is powerful as the preacher father the movie moves like a river you have to be willing to follow it through <UNK> and flows but it is well worth it in the end
<START> the life and time of little richard as told by little richard as produced and directed by little richard was about as one sided as one of his songs this is not a biography or even a <UNK> but does have good writing great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing richard all the music is by little richard so it rocks a tight <UNK> on every song br br the movie covers his early childhood <UNK> thru the <UNK> years in music the wild success and <UNK> throwing it all away to praise the lord its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in <UNK> manages to stay away from the idea that little richard discovered the beatles whom opened for him br br my main <UNK> is that his outrageous counter cultural behavior is <UNK> and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time some of his energy which he still has does not come across full force he seemed tame compared to what i remember of him at the time br br the best scenes are richard getting <UNK> by lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing to make the point about not having a decent place to change br br if they had gotten into the <UNK> <UNK> as richard use to refer to himself in interviews then there's a story trust me i just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still <UNK> with the pretty white boys giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience his <UNK> nearly <UNK> and still going strong i recommend this movie and any concert or t v appearance you can find little richard is always on
<START> as i said the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if melissa gilbert hadn't been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll what kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway it sounded the same as her horrible russian accent in another movie that i have seen her in every time she opened her mouth i <UNK> it took 3 tries before i was able to watch the entire movie brad johnson was good as the other lead br br i really liked the beach location scenes they added some much needed <UNK> to take your mind off of melissa <UNK> depressing portrayal i think they could have used san francisco views more to their advantage though it looked like the night scenes were actually sf but i could be wrong i don't recall the character in the book being this depressing br br please keep melissa gilbert out of any future movies that require an accent
<START> a most <UNK> masterpiece not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the <UNK> brilliant and ingenious picture work of <UNK> not to mention the acting of giants mastroianni and <UNK> and the remarkable character play by <UNK> <UNK> gregory <UNK> performance may seem overshadowed by his tough <UNK> at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl <UNK> and the man mastroianni albeit hinted beforehand hence the spoiler br br get your expectations straight it's an art movie in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention not for spending free time but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert due to the overall <UNK> style large screen viewing is recommended br br dialogues are used <UNK> but the film includes in addition to the standard greek and english speaking <UNK> spoken in <UNK> <UNK> and turkish which will be attractive for those who are <UNK> by the beauty in hearing various languages
<START> first of all the actor they have to play jesus has blue eyes half the actors they have playing jews have blue eyes aren't there enough brown eyed actors out there jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet <UNK> he was a full blooded jew second of all what is it with old english language movies that are supposed to take place in non english speaking countries and everybody has english accents another example is david <UNK> dr <UNK> aren't there enough either jewish actors or actors who can do a israeli accent the movie often is not true to the <UNK> and so seems to doubt the <UNK> of <UNK> claim to be the <UNK> in the bible when jesus is <UNK> by john a voice comes from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased matthew 3 17 mark 1 11 luke 3 22 in the movie john the <UNK> says this the screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the <UNK> as crazy as well for example in the bible the angel gabriel tells mary she will become pregnant with the son of god luke 1 26 <UNK> but in the movie we do not see or hear any angel mary appears to be talking to a <UNK> and when <UNK> mother hears her talking to someone and <UNK> in on her she doesn't hear or see anyone either also in the movie when jesus is speaking to the <UNK> in the temple in <UNK> he says you shall not see me here again not until you learn to cry <UNK> is he who comes in the name of the <UNK> for i and my father are one and the same the correct line matthew 23 <UNK> and luke 13 35 is you will not see me again until you say <UNK> is he who comes in the name of the lord ' period jesus never claimed to be god the movie cuts out a lot of important parts the <UNK> on the <UNK> is very <UNK> but then spends a lot of time on stuff that isn't even in the bible a whole scene with mary <UNK> talking with a john it seems like the screenwriter instead of wanting to do a movie version of the <UNK> wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind and between the scenes the movie has one gem though during the scene where jesus tells the <UNK> of the <UNK> son at matthew the tax <UNK> house i had tears <UNK> down my face it is the best movie i've seen about <UNK> <UNK> but that isn't saying much because the others are just terrible jesus christ superstar is my favourite movie about <UNK> last days the passion of the christ is way too graphic though i like how jesus of <UNK> instead of just ending with <UNK> death continues on and shows his <UNK>
<START> i've seen the movie only recently although it appeared in 2001 i hoped to see an entertaining movie but let me tell you princess blade is nothing compared to azumi the princess is not very <UNK> as you may have noticed she reminded me of jean claude van damme who only <UNK> to make his point then beat the crap out of the opponents during the entire movie i waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked why was she fighting who did she love and trust i waited in vain crappy movie crappy dialog don't watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds it's so bad that in the end i was wondering how i managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour approximately i give a 4 10
<START> another made for tv piece of junk this is an insult of a war movie i use the word movie in it's <UNK> possible form i thought telly <UNK> career had hit rock bottom when he did the voice over on that visit <UNK> video that's shown on <UNK> on tv on a semi regular basis but then i'd forgot he was involved in this i'd tried to push it into my <UNK> memory but cable tv brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me br br i like the bit laughs <UNK> in the film which claims to be a scene from <UNK> in the forties but it's blatantly a shot of <UNK> <UNK> in the late eighties also the steam train the <UNK> are training on shows the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> state <UNK> <UNK> on the side of the <UNK> quite clearly even though the makers have tried to black them out why not just film in the uk if that's where most of the film is set br br cheap rubbish and a waste of celluloid
<START> this movie was like a bad indie with a list talent the plot was silly all the way to the end it reminded me very much of something <UNK> out for the home video market in the 1980's i would have given it a one but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really <UNK> to make this worthwhile i think the worst thing was the underwater <UNK> held off of the <UNK> the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air this air tank would kind of appear i would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf good day
<START> well i am going to go against the grain on this film so it seems being a self <UNK> horror fan i sat down to this not quite knowing what to expect after 2 or 3 mins i actually found myself scared quite rare the film obviously has a small budget and is set around <UNK> cross station but the films lack of money does not distract from the story yes the story is a bit far fetched and doesn't explain itself very well but the creep is a class act and proceeds to slash and <UNK> anything that comes its way message for ladies there are certain parts of the film you should close your eyes at or at least cross your legs you will understand when you see it br br all in all a good film and it makes a change to see a good slasher movie that actually scares
<START> the basic premise of miami <UNK> most definitely deserves a spot in the top say fifty of most demented cinematic plots ever scripted down i know top 50 doesn't sound too impressive but i've seen a lot of really weird films with lunatic plots i was prepared from something convoluted because the film was directed and co written by <UNK> de martino who was one of <UNK> most ambitious and creative but sadly underrated film makers de martino steals multiple ideas from successful blockbusters like most italian directors did around that time but he always adds a lot of stuff to make it even more complex confusing and overwhelming not all of de <UNK> films are worthwhile but some of them are extremely underrated like a special <UNK> for tony <UNK> holocaust 2000 and formula for a murder the concept of miami <UNK> contains elements from numerous great sci fi and adventure flicks like alien <UNK> close encounters of the third kind et  but i wouldn't exactly call it a rip off the only thing that is really shamelessly stolen from another film is the opening <UNK> theme song that sounds almost identical to harold <UNK> <UNK> f from beverly hills cop the rest of the film is an amusing <UNK> of fantasy sci fi action horror and superhero movie gimmicks it certainly doesn't always make sense most of the time it doesn't actually but miami <UNK> is undeniably an imaginative and <UNK> film that kept my mate and i fascinated from start to finish br br the plot is extremely difficult to briefly <UNK> but i'll try anyway <UNK> journalist craig <UNK> is <UNK> the story of a german scientist who allegedly discovered <UNK> <UNK> inside a crashed <UNK> and managed to clone it the <UNK> cell belongs to an evil alien force that already <UNK> another <UNK> race in the past and it will <UNK> destroy the whole of mankind as soon as it grows large enough in size if this isn't <UNK> enough already the rich mr anderson ordered to steal the slowly growing evil <UNK> because he thinks that he can manipulate it and use it to obtain world <UNK> with the help of some good aliens in an <UNK> disguise craig <UNK> has the difficult task of <UNK> the planet from the evil <UNK> okay i know all this sounds grotesque and silly but i assure that miami <UNK> is in fact a light headed and easy <UNK> flick the first half of the film may come across as overly <UNK> and confusing because <UNK> de martino attempts to keep the plot secret through the use of preposterous red herrings there are <UNK> ghostly appearances supportive characters behaving <UNK> mysterious for no real reason and at a certain point there are even <UNK> about the lost continent of atlantis this is all misleading padding material however and as soon as the set up is more or less clear miami <UNK> turns into an ordinary early 80's popcorn action movie with bloody <UNK> flamboyant chase sequences in the florida <UNK> explosions gratuitous sleaze and nasty little <UNK> monsters in <UNK> br br now i really don't want to raise the impression that miami <UNK> is a lost and <UNK> obscure gem of italian exploitation cinema make no mistake this is a pretty bad movie the events only become <UNK> if you accept the stupidity and <UNK> of the plot and if you don't succeed in that well than this is just a non stop <UNK> of negative aspects the acting performances are painfully awful particularly b movie veteran john ireland as the <UNK> james bond villainous character doesn't seem the least interested in the script you can tell from his <UNK> and by the way he delivers his lines that he also thinks the whole production is retarded and simply signed up for the paycheck laura <UNK> is probably the least sexy female lust object ever and the person who drew the <UNK> chaotic vhs cover must have felt exactly the same way because the ravishing girl on the cover does not appear anywhere in the movie what an embarrassment this must be for mrs <UNK> still her completely gratuitous nudity sequences compensate for this as she's quite hot from the neck down and finally there's the unforgettable scene where david <UNK> takes down a helicopter from a moving school bus with a regular pistol i don't think even john rambo can do this while he's a <UNK> vietnam veteran and <UNK> character is a simple tv reporter
<START> this show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship as a man married for 26 years i empathize with patrick <UNK> character he loves his wife but he assumes she knows that i also enjoy his <UNK> delivery never gets too excited or too low a nice ensemble of characters this will be a nice addition to the monday night line up br br i don't know how david spade will be in his role he is best enjoyed in small doses he also seems a little old to still be <UNK> for women br br i enjoyed the pilot and i look forward to seeing how the series develops
<START> i don't know why but when i am asked about bad movies i have seen i often think of the air up there i know that technically lots of movies are horrible compared to it and i have seen worse acting it's just that it's so bland so predictable in a word mediocre
<START> generally i don't like films directed by sydney <UNK> the firm being somewhat of an exception and i've never been a robert redford fan either still i thought three days of the <UNK> must be good because of the number of <UNK> comments it has received br br although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and max von <UNK> does a nice job as the sinister professional killer i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing the film undeniably <UNK> paranoid atmosphere but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn't seem to make any sense br br the film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings i have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and <UNK> i'd much rather watch any of hitchcock's films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more
<START> this has an interesting albeit somewhat <UNK> sci fi plot but it's wasted with poor direction and <UNK> special effects <UNK> dawn chong is appealing despite the lack of a believable story and direction consistent with her talent
<START> as it was already put the best version ever of <UNK> epic entirely shot in natural locations in the <UNK> the sea and the sky are strikingly blue the islands green and <UNK> the clothing is <UNK> <UNK> and fur the settings <UNK> and bare everything is somewhat rugged and primitive a bit what you would find in <UNK> or <UNK> movies and it makes it all the more authentic although the story is based on <UNK> and widely goes into supernatural it gives us a good idea of what life in the <UNK> century <UNK> might have been like br br the rhythm is somewhat slow and <UNK> but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it actually it is amazingly close to the original plot by homer if not to the text itself <UNK> doesn't appear until the first hour the start being centered on his son looking after him then he suddenly appears lost in a storm lands on the island of the <UNK> where the royal family takes good care of him his adventures are told in flashback as a narration to his <UNK> the terrifying <UNK> the magic world of <UNK> the underworld the <UNK> etc he finally comes back to his <UNK> <UNK> after 20 years and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the <UNK> of his faithful <UNK> penelope br br as a story the odyssey is an <UNK> metaphor of the struggles of a man's life the cast is brilliant and international here irene <UNK> gives us a typical greek tragedy style performance as penelope but most amazing is the <UNK> actor <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> really good looking and totally convincing it seems the role was really made for him strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards also playing <UNK> is barbara bach as barbara <UNK> later famous as the james bond girl in the spy who loved me and playing <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> who was otherwise noted in the strange movie called performance with mick jagger br br as it was done 35 years ago the series was actually quite an <UNK> for its time as the first big european co production for tv italy france germany and <UNK> i have seen this mini series in 8 parts on french television as far back as 1974 i was a kid back then and although it was all in black and white it left a very vivid impression all my life long i wondered if i would ever get a chance to see it again as it was never shown on french tv later on br br i recently found a copy on dvd all in wonderful color through internet it is unfortunately only in italian with no subtitles although french and german versions existed back then i never heard there was any english version of this film as it is widely unknown in the <UNK> <UNK> world and it's quite a shame if you ever get a chance to watch this you are not going to forget it ever br br there were not many versions of the odyssey before or after that the one by <UNK> in 1955 starring kirk douglas is a classic sword and <UNK> like the 10 <UNK> but not as impressive and very short for such a complex story the one in 1997 by <UNK> is a <UNK> hollywood movie based on special effects sometimes quite gory very poorly acted and grossly <UNK> from <UNK> story and atmosphere
<START> i work as a hotel <UNK> in washington <UNK> and take my word there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j fox 1 we simply do not walk around with our <UNK> <UNK> with theater tickets and 100 bills 2 if i ever let anybody use a room for some <UNK> <UNK> time i'd be fired on the spot the organization to which i belong les <UNK> <UNK> has very definite standards of <UNK> and conduct that we take seriously 3 similarly untrue was the concept at the end of the movie of doug simply <UNK> his gold key <UNK> and passing it on to some other employee we earn those keys and it is a <UNK> of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them there is a whole <UNK> and <UNK> process to joining our organization br br this film does nothing to <UNK> the unfortunate perception of a <UNK> as nothing but a money <UNK> <UNK> in short it does a <UNK> to our organization i welcome any comments
<START> i saw the film tonight at a free preview screening and despite the fact that i didn't pay a dime to see this film i still felt ripped off ladies and gentlemen time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a benjamin on your seat the acting is <UNK> at best <UNK> sutherland phones in his worst <UNK> of jack bauer and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zeta jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey eva longoria is a non <UNK> she looks like she's reading her lines off a <UNK> and if you can't spot the mole within the first 20 minutes then you just landed on this planet from a world without tv and recycled story lines if you truly want to see a good secret service thriller rent in the line of fire if you see and buy into this one you'll start to fear for the <UNK> safety because the secret service looks and acts like the grown up versions of the kinds from <UNK> no matter what your feelings about w let's hope this art does not imitate life
<START> i saw the film for the first time at bbc on july the 27 of 2005 for me it was a good interpretation of the person conan doyle and i truly wonder what the sherlock fans think about it i also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentioned you may ask yourself was a c doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question however he was the creator of the famous holmes but how much of it was a sort of semi biography not the less i strongly put this adaption forward it is a movie you have to see even if you aren't interested in the sherlock holmes movies or books look a it enjoy yourself and have your own opinion of it
<START> ever wanted to know just how much hollywood could get away with before the hayes code was officially put into effect well unfortunately convention city is lost so well just have to watch tarzan and his mate to find out for 1934 there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh just look at jane's nude swim while tarzan is often thought of as b adventure films made for young boys and no one else this picture proves that the series was originally very adult over <UNK> years later it is still as sexy as it was when it came out br br in addition to the <UNK> pushing taboo nature it is a superb and exciting adventure story i've always enjoyed the jungle films that hollywood <UNK> out in the 30s and the 40s but there are few from the genre i'd call great films tarzan and his mate is by far the best film from this long gone <UNK> the sequences of the attacks on the <UNK> by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today also the animals are all too cool <UNK> the apes throwing <UNK> the acting won't win any major awards soon but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture the film is once again stolen by <UNK> the <UNK> monkey in the jungle one of the most entertaining examples of pre code hollywood out there
<START> this is the best movie i <UNK> ever seen thomas <UNK> richard miller two <UNK> who want to survive in the jungle of violence and <UNK> one shot one killed you must kill if you getting doubt about something you must survive br br p p i <UNK> of my bad worst english
<START> wow praise imdb and <UNK> for i have been trying to remember the name of this <UNK> awesome movie for over 15 years now slaughter high man <UNK> yeah br br i'm not going to bore you with a plot summary and actors and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 'cause you all know what's up that's why you're here anyway what i will do however is explain the fond memory i have of this quintessential 80's d movie slasher joint br br in 1987 when i was around the age of 7 my father used to rent all these horror movies would he care that his kids were watching them with him no so at that young age i saw slaughter high what i saw in that movie stuck with me big time i haven't seen it since but i remember to this day most of the ridiculous kills in the movie for example the post sex scene why is there a metal bed in a school gets <UNK> or the guy being drowned in a <UNK> pool come on my personal favorite though the exploding stomach from the <UNK> beer amazing how can you honestly hate on a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school like 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it then his stomach explodes what and that great line let's take my car it always starts classic crap all the way br br i mean i look back now almost 20 years later and laugh at it but when i was 7 i was scared sh <UNK> that <UNK> hat or was it a mask that the killer rocks throughout freaked me the f <UNK> out br br all in all yes a crappy movie but for nostalgia purposes and for humor factor this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me either stay up every night real late and hope to catch this on same late late late movie show or hunt down a vhs copy and dust off your vcr
<START> russell <UNK> acted in many films until his death in 1945 he only directed 2 and black gold was one the other was also from 1936 frankie <UNK> had a sometimes <UNK> screen presence but in this he was playing a good kid he was obviously quite popular on the <UNK> circuit he made so many films in this one he plays the son of an old oil <UNK> who is convinced that he will strike oil very soon br br j c anderson <UNK> <UNK> is trying to convince the old man to sell up as he knows there is going to be oil struck at any moment a <UNK> henry comes on the scene and helps <UNK> dad he also convinces <UNK> to go to school regularly henry has his eye on <UNK> the pretty teacher this was gloria <UNK> last film she had begun her career as <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> the american girl <UNK> <UNK> dad is killed when the <UNK> is <UNK> and henry is determined to bring anderson and his <UNK> to justice when henry is kidnapped anderson tries to <UNK> <UNK> to sell his oil <UNK> it all ends well with oil being struck and <UNK> going to military school br br it is okay for a rainy day
<START> warning this review contains minor spoilers br br well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas i'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare tremors 4 the legends begins however is a very dull movie where the heck are the <UNK> br br due to the relative lack of <UNK> through the first 90 minutes i'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a character study unfortunately there isn't one interesting character in the movie except for billy <UNK> character who is given too few lines too little to do and in the end too little screen time what saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt <UNK> whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt <UNK> was going to be interesting to listen too and or watch however in this movie gross plays <UNK> <UNK> a very poor and boring substitute br br on the plus side when the <UNK> dirt dragons in this movie are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets br br i was impressed when i saw that tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long pretty good for straight to video but after watching it i'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn't further the plot any was there a rush to get this movie made i think not more time could have and should have been spent on the script br br i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors 4 <UNK> for sale with tremors what luck i thought pay for 4 get 1 for free well after watching tremors 4 i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free i can't imagine paying a single dime for tremors 4 for fans of the series it's best to forget that tremors 4 the legend begins even exists br br tremors 4 the legend begins rates a 3 out of 10
<START> but thomas ian griffith just doesn't have the polish that a big bucks actor has granted this was made 5 years ago some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action but comedy and how do you get <UNK> out of <UNK> <UNK> anyhow <UNK> character was so corny he would have fit better in a <UNK> <UNK> personally if action flicks are going to show skin i'd have liked to have seen equal time between female male otherwise don't show any
<START> this has to be one of the top overrated anime shows ever made and yes i was even shown the end of <UNK> and that still made me hate it even more not to mention the countless rip offs of this show br br i don't mind psychological and philosophy <UNK> but <UNK> drags it out into the mud like nothing else not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting the only ones that seemed to be interesting were <UNK> <UNK> and pen pen other than that mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny <UNK> losers they need to go to a <UNK> center not <UNK> giant robots against aliens called angels br br even the <UNK> and alien fights did not help at all goes something like this br br well there are these robots and they are really cool because they bleed when they get hurt but they are not really <UNK> but captured angels so sometimes they go insane and don't do what the <UNK> pilots want and they have to be controlled better blah blah blah br br i am so sorry but i just cannot recommend <UNK> to anyone anime <UNK> or not to those who love this series greatly fine you're entitled to that opinion i respect you but to <UNK> that have a out of your mind obsession to think that every one will like this series you are more of an <UNK> br br i prefer <UNK> <UNK> run dim and robot <UNK> v myself
<START> i recently watched spirit and enjoyed it very much i've seen it about 4 times now on hbo and will buy the dvd those who gave negative reviews would probably think that <UNK> <UNK> was just another car chase movie and thelma <UNK> was just another chick flick although the conclusions of those films are darker i feel the themes are somewhat related that freedom and <UNK> are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you the other common <UNK> of these movies is the caring thoughtful guardian <UNK> types who help the main characters to overcome <UNK> br br another review here mentions how this film relates to the theme of civilization <UNK> someone else's home all one has to do is look around at the <UNK> open areas around us to see that br br i thought the animation and the story were amazing the animators really got the horses to look act and move naturally <UNK> emotions were very clear as the story progressed yes i'm aware they do <UNK> the horses a bit but this is fiction in a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the <UNK> and the heat from a forest fire in other more quiet scenes which are most of the time you're allowed to <UNK> the backgrounds one of the big things that make the story really work is by not going the talking singing animals route doing so would take away from the story's power instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack another plus is that they weren't afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side which really made this film watchable to me this isn't prevalent through the entire movie though and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappy br br those who appreciate horses will really like this movie but i think it's a bit more than a horse movie i don't feel this would be a good movie to take children to if they're brought up on the inane fare that's offered up today but if they're the thoughtful sort that can handle compelling stories like the lord of the rings and black beauty they'll likely love this movie hell i'm 35 years old and still love that stuff
<START> this show is just annoying i feel sorry for the actors for having to attempt to be funny especially bob <UNK> the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes and the <UNK> track comes up at the most unnecessary times the over dramatic kids are no exception especially the olsen twins also this show is cliché city if you were to look up the word cliché it would read full house every story line has a life lesson to be learned at the end a sappy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most <UNK> child have a sudden realization of goodness gasp too bad this couldn't be possible in real life i don't know how someone could watch this show without bad <UNK> the behavior of the characters or the laugh track i find myself yelling at the tv saying that isn't funny sad cute if life were really like this the world would fall apart
<START> absolutely trash i liked halloween and from then on <UNK> been in a <UNK> spiral this is about the <UNK> we get it john pro <UNK> are scary you don't have to make a <UNK> film that <UNK> the hell out of me to <UNK> me br br the pacing is way off here it feels like john didn't have much to work with here to his credit it looks like he did not write this junk there are countless times where the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look dumb or say something dumb i love the long cut too bad carpenter doesn't know how to employ it he needs to <UNK> up with <UNK> and fassbinder 30 years ago please john stop making a fool of yourself and boring me to death
<START> i saw this film and heard the writer director juan gerard speak at the santa barbara <UNK> film festival br br all i knew about it was that it was the story of an 8 year old boy at the time of the cuban revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family br br its opening scene will bring to mind cinema <UNK> in fact the film is filled with references to classic films the <UNK> wheel casablanca chicken <UNK> rebel without a cause references to <UNK> touch of evil you'll find more the homeless man <UNK> <UNK> brown is a reference to cuban <UNK> which often uses a black man as a type of greek chorus br br what this film really is is the <UNK> of a dream <UNK> wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life br br this is the true story of juan gerard and all the people in it are real as are the events depicted gerard is actually an architect and engineer and passionate film lover but his dream was to make this movie he and his wife decided to live that dream and harvey keitel became an angel who believed in gerard and agreed to produce and star in it keitel holds the screen <UNK> as the mysterious and <UNK> grandfather che brown and keitel are the only americans in the cast <UNK> <UNK> high <UNK> and <UNK> garcia <UNK> y <UNK> mama <UNK> offer strong support in key roles br br <UNK> the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines and some <UNK> but stay with it the last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet and honest climax it is the first effort of juan gerard but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come through in this sincere first effort i would definitely see it again and hope that he continues his film career br br
<START> this is the best sci fi that i have seen in my <UNK> years of watching sci fi i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today
<START> an interesting idea four african american women crushed under <UNK> boot <UNK> take their revenge by robbing banks is ruined by f gary <UNK> horribly slow direction and an excruciating script by takashi <UNK> and kate <UNK> full of unintentionally funny moments instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay <UNK> in a world where men <UNK> abuse and <UNK> them gray <UNK> and <UNK> prefers to <UNK> their unsuspecting audience with <UNK> notions of operatic tragedy it's melodrama at its worst gray has his actors <UNK> over every tired line and john <UNK> lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the <UNK> <UNK> faces and <UNK> they are although actors such as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a fox have some raw talent queen <UNK> is the fourth and as an actress she's an excellent <UNK> they need a <UNK> hand than <UNK> to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera steer clear
<START> <UNK> paris is an <UNK> drawing with people and vehicles <UNK> along at multiple levels in an obvious homage to fritz <UNK> metropolis paris is both <UNK> and <UNK> into <UNK> and in the blink between <UNK> <UNK> a pretty young medical <UNK> is kidnapped just after leaving her sister in a seedy nightclub a tough police captain <UNK> shown in stark black and white with the gloomy corridors shadowy <UNK> and single source lighting characteristic of the most hard boiled of film noir comparisons to sin city are inevitable but the story owes more to <UNK> <UNK> and william gibson than to frank miller as high tech <UNK> near invisible stealth suits and ruthless super <UNK> are as much a part of the landscape as guns and cars the film never quite <UNK> the doom laden atmosphere of <UNK> <UNK> vision with its tech heavy <UNK> characters <UNK> with industrial types from <UNK> that all seem to have their own <UNK> of fear but the viewer definitely gets the sense that future paris is no <UNK> and future science is less than <UNK> and as the police <UNK> plot line unfolds we are taken into the darker <UNK> of individual ambition beneath the shiny <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> image the motion capture process used here produces a look somewhere between b w comic books and next generation <UNK> and is either captivating or <UNK> depending on your tastes nevertheless a great visual sense is on display here and future paris is filled in down to the tiny details giving the picture a unique look which is in turns both <UNK> and <UNK> worth a look
<START> the final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films it goes further to play the anti bond theme bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his <UNK> past everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography stunt work to the script to acting br br the film starts out in a <UNK> as bourne is running from the <UNK> police the story seems to pick up right where the first film left off or does it the time is a little muddled here but we get the fact that bourne is remembering things a sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone they aren't his target from there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player <UNK> <UNK> who seems to know everything about bourne and will protect it at all costs pamela <UNK> is back as well as <UNK> parsons who seems to have a past with bourne as well br br the cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything the car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two and the veteran cast chasing bourne is superb with a nice part by albert finney it also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government <UNK> but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot all in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year if not the best action trilogy ever
<START> i must give how she move a near perfect rating because the content is truly great as a previous reviewer commented i have no idea how this film has found itself in <UNK> bottom 100 list that's absolutely ridiculous other films particular those that share the dance theme can't hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of top notch believable acting and amazing dance routines br br from start to finish the underlying story this is not just about winning a competition is very easy to delve into and surprisingly realistic none of the main characters in this are 2 dimensional by any means and by the end of the film it's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them and even if you're not the crying type you might get a little <UNK> eyed before the credits roll br br i definitely recommend this film to dance lovers and even more so to those who can appreciate a poignant and well acted storyline how she move isn't perfect of course what film is but it's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half baked plot and or characters who lack substance the actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers
<START> <UNK> this was the most painful experience of my life watching this i could even finish it what is happening to nick their best thing on teen nick is drake and josh and thats about to go off air the kids songs are kinda of annoying and the so are the kids my little sister wanted to watch the show because she likes anything that comes on disney or nick usually but after finish watching this show she said one of the worst shows that i have ever saw so boring my little brother actually fell asleep i envy him in short if your <UNK> old with no brain activity you'll enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now
<START> many <UNK> ago when i was seven years old i can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie it <UNK> to my naive sense of curiosity and i decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie being the wise adults that they are they told me absolutely not it's a bunch of trash of course i was very disappointed that i would not be the first kid on my block to see the incredible melting man br br little time passed maybe a couple of days i forgot about the incredible melting man and my disappointment faded twenty five years passed until it re entered the <UNK> of my thoughts while surfing through channels on digital cable i found this long lost <UNK> of a movie my curiosity was <UNK> and i decided to finally <UNK> in this fruit forbidden by my parents i should have listened to them the incredible melting man is perhaps the worst movie known to man it makes movies such as <UNK> con 4 <UNK> and <UNK> got <UNK> look like oscar <UNK> i feel <UNK> for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth the story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for 1977 how anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond me br br don't make the same mistake that i did listen to your parents if they <UNK> you to watch this movie they were right
<START> the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician however mid way through the very successful show the police come and shut him down it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had created even those he made on his own time at home as a result price <UNK> kills the evil man the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing because price was a bit mad he just couldn't stop at one sort of like eating <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks including a huge <UNK> saw and a <UNK> for the shows great plot twists as well as exciting action one thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull while it's also far from subtle it is fun throughout though and well worth a look br br had i never seen vincent <UNK> version of house of wax i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 that's because while the mad magician is a wonderful film it's highly reminiscent of the film that <UNK> it house of wax the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful the formula was re <UNK> in the follow up film both were made in 3 d both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he can't stop once he's committed the first and both are great fun to watch the biggest differences and there are few are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mystery br br my advice is to see this film and house of wax the price version only they are both terrific 1950s horror films
<START> usually i love lesbian movies even when they are not very good i'm biased i guess br br but this one is just the <UNK> yes the scenery and the buildings are beautiful and there is a brief but beautiful erotic <UNK> but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time <UNK> <UNK> between <UNK> and getting high stoned passing out on whatever drug or booze is handy and ella inexplicably puts up with this <UNK> behavior through the entire movie at no time are we given any insight into why this is so or even why <UNK> is so depressed and <UNK> br br if there had at least been some kind of closure in the potentially romantic we don't even know relationship between the two there might have been some kind of satisfaction but although <UNK> at one point asks ella why do you love me ella doesn't even acknowledge this it's never really clear whether this is anything more than an ill <UNK> lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight woman br br even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey which could have been lively and informative are instead flat tedious and mostly incomprehensible br br there is one good joke in the movie although i'm sure it was unintentional the women travel in a two seat ford <UNK> with a <UNK> sized <UNK> yet when they set up camp they have an enormous <UNK> <UNK> sleeping gear and even a table chair and <UNK> on top of that when they board a ferry we see <UNK> of <UNK> presumably theirs presumably also carried in the little ford's <UNK> br br and through the entire film we never see one gas station or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy <UNK> mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert so where did they get fuel br br there may not be too many lesbian films out there good or bad but there are plenty that are better than this and very few that are worse leave this one in the rack
<START> i saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as i thought sandra was quite funny from what i remembered the only facial movement i had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie i just suffered through br br the person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line just one scene that is even worth a chuckle br br she is a much better singer than i remember her to be but i didn't want to watch a <UNK> act br br i think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don't view it <UNK>
<START> what a good movie at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock <UNK> of fame well known <UNK> are getting old and forgotten not the music and with a good sense of humour have you ever <UNK> on bill <UNK> rock around the clock br br anyway still crazy is probably the best movie about rock <UNK> i have ever seen far much better than spinal tap for instance why because in still crazy people are mature they have a different point of view about rock about love and about life they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much beyond the story itself we see characters with their own personality weaknesses and dreams like anyone of us br br spend a good time watching this listen to the awesome soundtrack and finally thinking of your own future br br bye
<START> after watching a dozen episodes i decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is <UNK> <UNK> in the episodes that charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using <UNK> models i thought that my profession was being <UNK> about i am not a <UNK> instead a chemical engineer but i do work a lot with <UNK> models so i will try to explain to the <UNK> why what is shown is close to make believe of fairy tales br br first choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task charlie <UNK> is shown as a genius but even him would have to spend considerable time <UNK> for a suitable model specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future individuals are <UNK> and <UNK> there is no <UNK> for them <UNK> <UNK> even wrote about that in the 1950's even if there were a model for specific kind of individual it would be a <UNK> <UNK> one meaning it has good chance of making a wrong <UNK> br br second <UNK> the right model for someone or a situation is found the model <UNK> have to be known these <UNK> are the <UNK> of the <UNK> such as the gravity <UNK> 9 8 m <UNK> and often are not easy to determine again charlie <UNK> would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right <UNK> for the model he chooses and after the model and the <UNK> are chosen they would have to be tested oddly they are not and by miracle they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted br br third a very important aspect of <UNK> is almost always neglected not only by numbers but also by sci fi movies the <UNK> effort required for solving these models try to make <UNK> solve a complex model with many <UNK> and <UNK> and one will find doing a <UNK> job even if charlie <UNK> has the right <UNK> to solve his models he might be stuck with <UNK> that will be dreadfully slow and even with the right <UNK> <UNK> combination the model solution might well take days to be reached he <UNK> them immediately i could use his computer in my research work i would be very glad br br as a drama it is far from being the best show the characters are somewhat stereotyped but not even remotely funny as those in big bang theory are the crimes are dull and the way charlie <UNK> <UNK> them sometimes make the fbi look pretty incompetent br br for some <UNK> the show might work for others the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow
<START> while visiting romania with his cia dad tony adam arkin quite a talented high school <UNK> seen as the <UNK> to lead his team finally to a victory over rival simpson is told by a would be palm reader in romania the people are not allowed many books so she took up palm reading that he would be bitten by a werewolf when the moon is full don't make any <UNK> you will be busy well who would have <UNK> it tony is in fact bitten and his life would be forever changed after his father unfortunately dies in a <UNK> within his bomb shelter under odd circumstances firing at his werewolf son inside a <UNK> bomb shelter isn't a very good idea especially if the bullet doesn't leave the room and <UNK> around like a <UNK> gone <UNK> tony travels the land through endless years until he's tired of <UNK> and returns decades and many us <UNK> later to hopefully lead his football team to a win over simpson a task he abandoned long ago what was once a very white clean cut high school has indeed changed into a ghetto of drug use violence and <UNK> to get an idea of what the early 80's full moon high <UNK> prom party resembles think studio <UNK> with teenagers br br larry <UNK> parody of werewolf flicks among others things is <UNK> full of gags <UNK> and in jokes my favorite sequences contain one in the sex ed <UNK> where tony reveals to the 80's class his werewolf transformation and the <UNK> scene to dr brand alan arkin who steals the film when kenneth mars isn't on screen quite possibly the worst psychiatrist on earth his task to talk down a <UNK> leads to two men falling off a balcony the <UNK> and a <UNK> trying at first to talk him out of it both <UNK> mad at brand brand even tries to get tony to sign a <UNK> for his <UNK> being <UNK> to science so he can get his wife a fur coat kenneth mars had me rolling in the floor as a homosexual football coach and later in the 80's as the principal who likes to pat his players on the behind his scene where tony's <UNK> the truth to the sex ed class is classic the film is loaded with inspired casting choices just <UNK> with funny characters and the cast interpretations such as ed <UNK> as a very conservative military <UNK> who actually looks identical to joseph <UNK> standing next to his photo in the bomb shelter always talking about <UNK> <UNK> nail as <UNK> eyed ricky in present day who falls for the werewolf elizabeth <UNK> a <UNK> of blue as a <UNK> nerdy sexually <UNK> and <UNK> teacher who finds an attraction towards tony james dixon as a deputy his great scene has him stealing a line from his police chief <UNK> it to dr brand who begins <UNK> the words to himself for <UNK> <UNK> kelly as jane an <UNK> devoted female <UNK> tony for only herself constantly demanding he <UNK> her and bill <UNK> as flynn tony's long time pal and now the police chief who only got jane after his friend left town can not forget <UNK> j <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> gay son trying to fit in at the school hoping to find a dame with hilarious results br br i like how the film pays homage to the werewolf genre such as when he's on the <UNK> he's often referred to in the papers as jack the <UNK> because he likes to bite his victims on the cheek and i'm not talking face he's seen more as an annoyance than danger the <UNK> to carrie and psycho are nice and the <UNK> <UNK> is also amusing cohen <UNK> so many <UNK> at the viewer eventually one has to stick obviously in a comedy such as this not every joke hits it's mark but many do the cast makes this worthwhile the film looks cheap on the typical larry cohen budget notice the 50's scenes where the obvious old cast members that would show up down the road wear glaring <UNK> loved adam in the lead he is the perfect foil for the gags that follow him and the <UNK> he lets fly from <UNK> script the film moves quickly rarely catching a breath i liked this horror comedy more than most it seems
<START> the <UNK> murder case starts off at a run and doesn't stop until the very end everybody had reason to kill the victim and several people tried william powell is terrific as philo vance gentleman detective mary <UNK> is refreshing as the put upon niece who only wants to marry her scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance this movie comes paired with nancy drew reporter on dvd which is also fun if you have to rent the disc or check it out from your local library do it it's pure entertainment
<START> al pacino kim basinger tea <UNK> ryan <UNK> richard <UNK> my mouth was <UNK> i dropped everything to watch this movie on cable 30 minutes in i was having trouble staying awake 60 minutes in and i hit the record button and fell asleep finished watching it the next morning shouldn't have bothered what a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a day in the life cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie i guarantee you at least an hour and a half of <UNK> sleep dialogue horrible continuity non existent camera work could have been done with a hand held super 8 and looked better br br this movie was a total disaster
<START> of course there's spoilers i'm sure this project started off as a screen writing <UNK> on avoiding clichés in horror movies female protagonist check bad things happen to drug <UNK> check <UNK> knocks out villain check heroine doesn't notice villain recovering <UNK> check frame the sequence so we see <UNK> villain creep up behind heroine check unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here in fact there's so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he's been killing people on the underground i'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to <UNK> the oscars that year and there's always a market for horror movies likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that it's slightly better than <UNK> death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground it's just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head
<START> it was everything this isn't it had pace pop and actors who weren't afraid to chew the scenery it also had a decent script this one had me scratching my head if farrah isn't really serious about a career why does she have a manager and why is he wasting his time if kate and barney are artists why do they sign up for the mother of all <UNK> shows like the brady bunch movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare only to find himself on <UNK> they weren't industry names but they weren't exactly starving either and while they got the history right the poster was released before farrah got the show silverman <UNK> <UNK> for funniest home videos and american idol and spelling promising his baby girl <UNK> someday he'll create a show for her obviously did not happen br br what bothered me was how <UNK> role is distorted he's shown as the show runner and creator when he was neither and how he comes up with the idea for <UNK> was is laughable br br how were spelling and goldberg allowed to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> contract when the others were signed and why didn't farrah or <UNK> tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner <UNK> but because <UNK> wanted her to this is why when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the bad girl like suzanne <UNK> it fails because the <UNK> was never laid that was where the <UNK> company <UNK> delivered
<START> it's like what other dracula movies always do the <UNK> of dracula always on <UNK> side which is what disappointed me at the ending regardless the person wants to stay a vampire or not i would like to see something like in the first movie that the <UNK> fights against her master it is much interesting since you can almost predict how the story goes than just either the priest or d win the game we need some surprising plots
<START> it sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings by using the <UNK> <UNK> i do not intend to imply that i am surprised about the things told about in this film or that i was <UNK> unaware of them it is just that i am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and <UNK> horrific it is to kill each other off either with or without a <UNK> br br the first part of the film focuses on <UNK> successful participation in the hungarian resistance <UNK> <UNK> would never have won an oscar for this performance due to inconsistent directing but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma she is cast very well as <UNK> and immediately has our sympathy her very beautiful looks help of course but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress playing a good part br br certain inconsistencies keep occurring in <UNK> war i sometimes get the idea director <UNK> <UNK> often <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> murder was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene on the other hand i am very thankful he made this impressive and thought provoking film and as i am very positive about it i think he did a good job br br the second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one it focuses on <UNK> suffering beware of donald <UNK> scary portrayal of the cruel and <UNK> captain <UNK> and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war i receive <UNK> war especially the second half as a strong anti war film and for that alone <UNK> deserves credit it is also this second half in which <UNK> <UNK> talent comes out creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking strong and tragic ever portrayed it is also great to see ellen <UNK> whose appearance and acting style always remind me of <UNK> schneider who had she been alive and cast would have made a similar effective contribution to <UNK> war br br the tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful <UNK> and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears and when i realized once more it wasn't even fiction it all actually happened i found myself in even more tears the image of <UNK> portrayed by <UNK> <UNK> will be in my mind forever
<START> i bought this dvd set sight unseen and wish i hadn't the script needed some serious <UNK> as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and <UNK> in comparison to the book the lighting is horrid very <UNK> but if it was just that i could overlook it the script doesn't focus enough on the characters there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to <UNK> who is who especially in the planes no idea who dies when br br i have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters if you don't have that you don't have anything there was no focus on the characters at all you never got to know them who they were what they liked what made them do the things that they do the series is 5 hours long and split up into 6 parts i bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they didn't detail the characters they put a lot of filler in it i will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes lol i mean do we really need to see that over and over again i would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters
<START> i chose dead creatures because i thought it was a zombies movie just like 28 days or so but not at all it isn't even a horror movie nothing happens except for a group of women that seem to have been infected by a strange virus that make her to eat human flesh in order to survive br br that plot gives rise to a series of disgusting scenes of <UNK> br br very very bad movie br br my rate 2 10 br br br br
<START> this is the best series of its type i've seen all year i can't help thinking it's just my luck a series i love gets 6 episodes and more next year and the constant stream of cookie cutter cop shows get never ending episodes br br i think the reasons new tricks succeeds are many the scripts are good and the mix of characters superb the acting is top flight and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat the stories aren't all that memorable but that's not the reason i watch shows like this one br br the theme song is a favourite and we were disappointed to find it isn't available in any published edition great stuff bbc a triumph of sense over sex appeal aside from the young <UNK> <UNK> there as eye <UNK> and even if he is he can still act
<START> there is no greater <UNK> to do to history than to <UNK> it this takes the <UNK> and most shallow route simply portraying him as a monster only showing his negative sides and <UNK> them those who are ignorant of the past doom us to repeat it he was a human being that may prove tough to some people to accept but an important part of life is facing that which we don't want to rather than <UNK> the man we ought to try to understand him otherwise we stand little chance of <UNK> anyone similar in the future or possibly even the present from <UNK> at anything of remotely comparable scope as far as damage and misery goes hate him and what he did don't make him into something mythical intentionally or otherwise frankly far too much of this mini series could play dumb dumb <UNK> after or during scenes the whole thing <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> at the audience with a clear message of was this guy evil or what <UNK> every single bad <UNK> as well as making up several that go directly against who and what he was letting them appear more or less out of nowhere and having them be constant throughout his life not something he came to believe or claimed to this should never be used to <UNK> use der <UNK> downfall in english and maybe point out the few inaccuracies of that instead this this is <UNK> to the actual events that took place and to any and all survivors not to mention those who died the cinematic quality top notch it's well done through and through excellent production values a solid arc to the well told plot what characterization does occur is strong and credible dialog and script are great all acting performances are masterful <UNK> looks and behaves the role as it was written perfectly the music is well composed cinematography and editing are flawless and creative and this is definitely dramatic entertaining and riveting they get dates and many <UNK> and do them justice if i had been offered to work on this and did not feel i could be objective enough to have hitler appear as a fully fleshed out person i would have <UNK> <UNK> that as the reason i don't blame anyone for loathing him how can you forgive what he did and are we sure that we should that is not what i am suggesting finally let me point out that as i write this we are in a world wide economic crisis that has lasted for about two years and that is not terribly <UNK> to the stock market crash of <UNK> the two reasons it hasn't led to a depression of the new millennium are as follows <UNK> are giving money to the banks to keep the market going and the majority of the countries is now friendly towards one another apart from that the lesson hadn't been learned hopefully it has now back to this my suggestion read a book non fiction dealing with the subject there are plenty of informative smart ones the dvd holds a trailer i recommend this only to those who know better and <UNK> urge anyone who has watched it to seek out the truth 8 10
<START> this movie is lame and not funny at all the plot doesn't even make sense some scientist who works on the <UNK> of science opens a <UNK> to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the <UNK> guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie i'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is a go camping to make out then fight a monster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book <UNK> than make it confusing i didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid i can't think of any part of the movie that was good
<START> tv version of <UNK> springs a few <UNK> but manages to remain watchable my sister bought this at a wal mart a few years back when it was released i saw it back then and thought it was okay later <UNK> with bill <UNK> and helen hunt comes out or was it before i think it was <UNK> and did a better job overall but <UNK> was more silly fun this is realistic with a message it all depends on what you want from a movie with <UNK> <UNK> or a low budget character study br br john schneider and <UNK> <UNK> he's the reason my sister bought it star and <UNK> <UNK> who went on to wild america final destination and <UNK> got his big break here so in a way i was one of the first people to see him really take off i don't know if it's an honor or a shame i haven't seen how he acts in recent films br br night of the <UNK> all depends on personal taste like i said it all depends on what you want from a movie with <UNK> <UNK> or a low budget character study night of the <UNK> has the latter so you decide br br i give it a 2 5 5 br br john <UNK>
<START> i only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie no it was a hundred times worse ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that's not true the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever br br the american cop has a german accent the police station was a desk in a warehouse with a sign police station hanging on the wall there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet br br this cop pulls women over <UNK> them and leads them to a warehouse he tells his cop partner to wait in the car then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a <UNK> bag the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women but he isn't sure if that is what's happening because he's a moron the dialog is totally stupid the acting is awful and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen it is totally obvious to the <UNK> partner that he is <UNK> <UNK> these women and he is <UNK> them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a <UNK> bag with a body in it and yet the partner who is there all along doesn't know what is happening br br the director of this film is a total hack i stopped the movie at 30 minutes because i couldn't take it anymore it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won't waste anymore time on it writing this review br br absolutely worthless
<START> this tale set in <UNK> new zealand <UNK> <UNK> home of the renowned <UNK> college is <UNK> first feature br br with a contemporary new zealand <UNK> via satellite <UNK> with absolutely hilarious situations which develop in the adult family context at the same time it manages to <UNK> intense emotions of sadness and despair br br one of the most moving and <UNK> movies of the year not to be missed
<START> had placed this on my <UNK> for a rainy day due to the cast some really hard working people in the industry and when i finally watched i was not disappointed br br this movie has some altman like flavor he's mentioned in the end credits as a thanks person <UNK> seemingly independent unrelated plot lines that <UNK> as the film draws to its climax macy is pure clean and honest as a man who can't seem to escape his destiny sutherland plays and portrays as few can <UNK> adds <UNK> to a deliberately toned down environment add tracy <UNK> barbara <UNK> remember mission impossible on tv not to mention the steady john ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good film the script is <UNK> the dialog is free from cliché and thoughtful especially between macy and david <UNK> suspend belief and enjoy this is truly time well spent
<START> this is the kind of movie that wants to be good but sucks first thing what the hell are those punk trying to do with the school i think the kids doesn't seem to realize the gravity of the situation <UNK> guy say to the girl that they under his responsibility when she ask why he wants to go back for them but right after this he gives a gun to the wheel chair dude and wants him to go alone <UNK> the phone line where is the responsibility there i understand poor actors must pay their food but why not just give them the money that takes to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity oh <UNK> and none of them knows how to aim the stupid punk guy shoots in the <UNK> nowhere like a crazy they all want to look professional but they all suck one more thing i don't believe that there's no <UNK> exit in the school the kids are trying several doors but they all locked what happens if there's a fire and the <UNK> security guard is dead it is illegal to not have an <UNK> exit in school anyway there's a lot more to say but it would be too long i spent some time of my life to watch a crap
<START> i liked it the plot was weird drew barrymore and <UNK> making out was awkward for both of them <UNK> acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time dennis christopher as the shrink was pretty cool and as always he does his best i'm a major dennis fan anyway that's why i bought the dvd br br i didn't get the ending that weird <UNK> red <UNK> thing looked just like it was out of <UNK> which is ok i guess but it could have been more br br and the whole thing with the knife if it was that uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid of it br br it was very confusing as to when it was the <UNK> weird thing or when it was <UNK> or was it dennis all the time because the <UNK> made out with dennis and patrick in the scenes with patrick if it was dennis as the <UNK> then i think patrick would notice br br the music was ok but <UNK> in places the whole <UNK> score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone br br a big mix of lots of blood and <UNK> shots of drew nude br br all in all a bit of a <UNK> guilty pleasure movie don't read too much into it don't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it there are some diamond moments and goofs <UNK> watch it and just have a bit of fun with it
<START> the <UNK> is so <UNK> scripted that you have think to yourself why on earth did an up and coming actor like david arquette agree to be in it it has to be one of the weakest plots i have ever seen and without any humour at all it borders on the brink of tedious it <UNK> along to a dreadful conclusion which appears to only happen because the director got bored and just wanted to wrap up quickly in order to get home for his dinner stay away
<START> i am normally skeptical about watching films or mini series based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel fortunately i was wrong the screenplay was very close to the novel i guess it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer huh br br the cast is outstanding i can't describe how much i enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actors from <UNK> davis and ruby dee to robert <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br the location setting i was expecting to see the homes and <UNK> i imagined in my mind what i saw on screen was slightly different however it wasn't enough to make me dislike the mini series br br i recommend this for anyone who has read the novel you will not be disappointed if you have 8 out of 10 stars br br
<START> <UNK> comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments often with <UNK> to describe things that he is more <UNK> about than most is quite refreshing there is one other character in the film that constantly tries to <UNK> complicated issues using more language than necessary this guy should never have been given a <UNK> cut to <UNK> and you know you're in for a treat br br the way the <UNK> of big wave surfing are portrayed is very <UNK> of a lost era <UNK> the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living much less took care of issues like medical care the use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done
<START> well what's to say the golden child falls in the category so bad it's good eddie murphy is having some funny and sometimes quite annoying lines but you are still entertained <UNK> dance has never been worse than his role as the villain <UNK> <UNK> what a f ed up name is this br br who should watch the golden child <UNK> difficult to say but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog br br 4 out of 10
<START> i kind of feel like a genius i feel like i'm the only one who saw through this fake film i watched it three times once with commentary and i found myself getting annoyed at all the close ups all the times the screen just blacks out and worst of all i feel the film never really <UNK> anything yes the priest dies but he didn't really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much grief or with himself that and he was an idiot if it weren't for the commentary by peter <UNK> which explained not only the movie but the book it came from i wouldn't have been able to stomach it at all i enjoy french movies but this is one that was completely absurd br br diary of a country priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but that alone cannot save this deadly dull tripe scene after scene of extreme close ups where characters don't say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do not make an interesting or relevant story how this film ever became a classic is mind <UNK> it reminds me more of the <UNK> new clothes br br yes claude <UNK> performance is heartfelt and thought provoking if you are a <UNK> but this film left me feeling empty because overall it is a weak impression of the catholic <UNK> which is an <UNK> and <UNK> institution of corruption the young <UNK> triumph over the <UNK> pride is a weak scene but 90 of the film will drag you down with its dreary <UNK> and window into the young <UNK> melancholy thoughts this priest doesn't come across so much as being humble as he does just plain pitiful br br being that i don't speak or understand french i was looking forward to doing the english <UNK> thing to help understand the film well the english <UNK> is at times impossible to view read and the text rolls by so quickly that there was much i could not read and i am not a particularly slow reader i just finished <UNK> in 3 days br br i really wanted to like this film i try out everything chosen by the <UNK> collection and yet can not see why in many ways this one merits some sort of critical nod however i sat through this entire two hour film yearning to feel some sort of empathy for the main character and it never <UNK> he just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter and for that i say it <UNK>
<START> i've just returned from a showing of my left foot at our public library what an emotional experience i feel <UNK> and <UNK> br br it's the story of christy brown irish writer and painter and based on the author's <UNK> my left foot christy was born with a form of cerebral <UNK> such that the only <UNK> he had good control of was his left foot doctors advised his parents he was hopelessly mentally retarded but his mother didn't give up on him and somewhat as annie sullivan had done with helen <UNK> helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the <UNK> and then to read write and paint br br this film won academy awards for daniel day lewis best actor as well as best supporting actress for the actress playing his mother it also received oscar nominations for best picture best director and best adapted screenplay br br as a retired <UNK> psychologist and family <UNK> while many films may entertain me many also often leave me having to overlook gross <UNK> or <UNK> in realistic psychological reactions br br not this film it was absolutely spot on in portraying typical irish <UNK> roles <UNK> see e g see typical irish families in <UNK> <UNK> family therapy as well christy <UNK> uneven emotional <UNK> some immature personality reactions that were even further <UNK> by his picking up traits of his father br br the film presents the greater truth while changing certain sequences in his development painting writing and <UNK> several important people into one person for the sake of telling a coherent believable story not <UNK> by small distracting less important <UNK> see christy brown in <UNK> for more accuracy the dvd version we were shown had some english subtitles that were a great help in understanding <UNK> speech some of the irish speech the initial release of the film may have lacked this if you see this on dvd <UNK> that option br br the performance by daniel day lewis is one of the greatest believable acting jobs i've ever seen truly magnificent outstanding <UNK> br br my left foot bears more than some similarity to a more recent film the diving bell the <UNK> in that each portrays the life of a real person successfully <UNK> the <UNK> and isolation of an extremely severe physical <UNK> br br and in doing so it <UNK> with william ernest <UNK> <UNK> which begins out of the night that covers me black as the pit from pole to pole i thank whatever gods may be for my <UNK> soul
<START> i recently may 2008 discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a dvd although i've seen a great deal of high quality movies since then late 70's i was 10 in 1978 this three episode low budget thing still stands strong br br what's fun is that i now watched it with my 10 year old daughter and she experiences just the same as i remember from back then the creepy music she had to hold my hand even though she's been raised with watching lotr and resident evil the ever changing theories of who the <UNK> actually is and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before <UNK> discovered the difference between stage acting and movie acting br br this is the one and only good science fiction movie or series ever made in <UNK> and it's still worth watching
<START> i agree totally with another of the reviewers here who was pleased for the birds won the oscar in 2002 for best animated short not this sick material which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone of course who has no belief in heaven or hell br br the animation was good but so are a lot of animated shorts and by the way i love dark humor but this just was unappealing from the start br br as for the story here a guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but grey symbolism here is told by a tv set which appears every few hundred <UNK> away that he is in either heaven hell or <UNK> each time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself after hearing the news i guess that would be funny in two of the three instances
<START> the <UNK> episode of star <UNK> third season is excellent and a highlight of the much <UNK> final season essentially spock mccoy and kirk <UNK> down to <UNK> to find the <UNK> population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and mr <UNK> the <UNK> all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of <UNK> past spock gives a convincing performance as an ice age <UNK> who falls in love for <UNK> while kirk <UNK> his unhappy experience with time travel see the <UNK> on the edge of <UNK> when he is accused of witchcraft and <UNK> before escaping and finding the <UNK> back in time to <UNK> present in the end all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the <UNK> <UNK> star around <UNK> goes <UNK> the enterprise <UNK> away just as the star explodes br br ironically as william shatner notes in his book star trek memories this show was the source of some <UNK> since leonard <UNK> noticed that no reason was given in <UNK> script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> here directly to the show's executive producer fred <UNK> that <UNK> weren't supposed to fall in love p <UNK> however <UNK> <UNK> the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was a time when <UNK> still had not evolved into their completely logical present state this was a great example of <UNK> on <UNK> part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to <UNK> like a <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> play music with hippies in the way to <UNK> or sometimes display emotion the script here was more believable <UNK> acting here was excellent as <UNK> <UNK> admitted to shatner p <UNK> the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy <UNK> thousands of years back in time mccoy too should have <UNK> to a more primitive human state not just spock but this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows the brilliant spock mccoy performance and the originality of this script who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of <UNK> would escape their doomed <UNK> fate by travelling into their past this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of <UNK> <UNK> a genuinely inspired story br br shatner in <UNK> named some of his best unusual and high quality shows of season 3 as the enterprise incident day of the <UNK> is there in truth no beauty the <UNK> web and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome p <UNK> while my personal opinion is that <UNK> the children shall <UNK> is a very poor episode while <UNK> there in truth no <UNK> is <UNK> all our <UNK> certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek <UNK> films i give a 9 out of 10 for <UNK> our <UNK> '
<START> my name is domino <UNK> edit <UNK> chop my my my name is domino harvey cut chop my name is domino harvey edit cut <UNK> br br never have i seen a director take so much <UNK> for his style before by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scott's choppy flashy <UNK> editing technique if i have to choose between loving it and hating it i'd say i love it it was borderline distracting at times but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality even if it borrows heavily from mtv videos br br this <UNK> edge <UNK> itself as <UNK> knightley plays the role of cocky <UNK> bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her no matter how much she suffered we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke <UNK> <UNK> and edgar <UNK> the crew become <UNK> up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher <UNK> tv production company what is christopher walken doing in every film by the way i guess that is a clever film technique because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtv reality show editing footage as he likes it becomes a <UNK> of mtv culture at this point br br it <UNK> then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid fire pace with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence there are some funny jokes it's all very modern and surreal at the same time it's a mess but it's a rather enjoyable mess it is ultimately flawed in so many ways the actors try too hard to make their characters cool for one but it works i give it a weak 7 10 which may seem generous when compared to the general <UNK> of movie goers who <UNK> this film  but i feel it had some good ideas and executed them well br br 7 out of 10
<START> that is no criticism of the film but rather a comment on how blind we are to our own past br br i recently watched winter soldier and the ground truth was like watching a remake or sequel except it was about iraq rather than vietnam similar to winter soldier because of it's one sided message both films illustrate how <UNK> we rush to engage in conflicts based on false <UNK> and allow our young and brave and often naive to bear the <UNK> of this greedy war <UNK> both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines but the training falls woefully short of teaching the <UNK> and <UNK> skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they're supposedly fighting for this is ultimately what lost the war in vietnam and will likely lose the war in iraq as well br br my only negative comment is that the film is so one sided it could be easily passed off as left wing propaganda not by me mind you but by those aiming to <UNK> the film and message a more balanced point of view would speak to a larger audience
<START> a wonderful film filled with great understated performance and sharp intelligent dialogue what really <UNK> the film however is that <UNK> of sadness throughout the story is <UNK> by affairs loneliness suicide disappointment the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed having been ripped apart by the beginning of world war ii in fact the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the <UNK> of serious scenes to the comic scenes yet funny it is listen to margaret <UNK> harsh <UNK> of jimmy stewart and watch his <UNK> expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend of poetry and <UNK> it's funny pointed and sad all at once a remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made
<START> i rented this film because of my interest in american history and especially the somewhat weird story of the <UNK> this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his vision into a major world religion it first focuses on the troubles the <UNK> had in their <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> it portrays the trial of joseph smith within the course of that trial <UNK> young stands up to tell of his <UNK> to <UNK> and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith then smith is <UNK> and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the <UNK> to a new land despite his grave doubts he <UNK> and finally has a vision that <UNK> is the place for his colony that gives him confidence in the <UNK> of his <UNK> later as <UNK> are destroyed by <UNK> he again doubts that he has truly been chosen however a miracle occurs which <UNK> his place in history br br i found the performances to be moving and the story to be convincing and interesting i would love to know whether <UNK> believe that this is an accurate portrayal <UNK> is a part of the story but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised the issue is not <UNK> br br i'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject matter but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout
<START> jeremy <UNK> characterization of the <UNK> mild mannered <UNK> morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single <UNK> <UNK> and under the spell of lucy <UNK> presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face neck and lips no matter the <UNK> love has a way of <UNK> love also cannot be <UNK> in with either of his two fake wives in <UNK> stages he begins to <UNK> with his glasses to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses the music is fantastic hypnotic sexy and appropriately driving at times the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi film noir in the tradition of many classic thrillers i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy <UNK> portrayal whenever she sees him in his various <UNK> states the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part she is just no match for <UNK> talents but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author
<START> at first i didn't like the movie cause of it being a nazi <UNK> drama but after buying it and seeing it it wasn't that bad i heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and <UNK> <UNK> not singing now i understand the radio show was a super propaganda radio program <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> plus <UNK> <UNK> and band like kurt <UNK> and his orchestra and <UNK> <UNK> ex <UNK> never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories the club foot had that <UNK> that for <UNK> occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave <UNK> for the soldiers also night <UNK> and <UNK> in berlin and <UNK> and record sales only this is why <UNK> wasn't allowed to sing in this picture this would be made up by medium budget musical were making music 1942 in which she would demonstrate her <UNK> but this is an excellent example propaganda <UNK> and her aunt <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> goes to the 1936 <UNK> the aunt forgets her tickets so <UNK> has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets she meets <UNK> <UNK> who plays herbert who has an extra ticket she goes with him and it's love at first sight they plan to marry but the spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side carl <UNK> as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain when he did <UNK> and they put a mustache on him plus his own <UNK> that made him plain looking you see the nazi soldiers acting normal like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in france and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs this reflect <UNK> animal rights <UNK> the character was a butcher now soldier this was a subtle put down against meat eating late on in world war 11 herbert is flying in a german airplane we shoot one of the pilots so herbert takes over we shoot his plane they crash unfortunately for us they survive another seen the nazis soldiers go in a bomb catholic church now it's putting the <UNK> down and <UNK> best friend helmet played by <UNK> <UNK> starts to play the <UNK> <UNK> more bombs come in from us the church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the <UNK> he's being told to leave we end up <UNK> him propaganda message the catholic church <UNK> cause him to become addicted to it it injured him see by this time <UNK> is with her either mother or grandma played <UNK> <UNK> the same german <UNK> actress who played maria <UNK> aunt in <UNK> <UNK> well later it comes to the short view of the radio show this was not intended to be a musical <UNK> such as <UNK> terry released that same year were as well as <UNK> in <UNK> the music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop it was mainly a war romantic movie it's easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the nazi cause cause of the job and the <UNK> pay that they would receive after the war many of them who survive would regret it this is a good <UNK> classic the only problem is that today you have neo nazi and nazi skin heads who watched the same movies to reflect their hitler worship and their they have disturbing <UNK> who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity be careful most of the time it's the direct hate only classics if their scenario looks like they are <UNK> it then its a nazi website skip it go to <UNK> or german wartime films <UNK> com amazon <UNK> dee or german video <UNK> net they are legitimate <UNK> 23 10 <UNK> a mistake it wasn't <UNK> friend that got killed at the church it was <UNK> <UNK> character's friend <UNK>
<START> the trivia page on imdb claims the filmmakers <UNK> because this film was re cut by the studio to <UNK> the plot if so that effort was a total failure as this is one of the most incoherent <UNK> i've ever seen in a film i'd hate to have seen it before the plot was <UNK> br br it's sad to see warren with so little character to go on that even he can't do anything with the inept material it's interesting to see caron in '70s mode instead of her hollywood era <UNK> <UNK> and persona but it's sad to see her <UNK> wander through this doing a favor to her producer husband dreck she would actually later hook up with and marry the director instead who you'll note never directed anything again but did strictly 1st or 2nd a d work in tv from here on out that <UNK> tell you enough right there br br i call this interesting because i have an automatic <UNK> for american films of this period and this role does add perspective to <UNK> otherwise fantastic 1971 <UNK> two lane <UNK> the hired hand but the 1940s detective as fish out of water in 1970s l a theme which is the only thing the movie really has to say is sold in way too heavy handed a manner a similar theme would be far more effectively handled two years later in altman's the long goodbye and as far as <UNK> playing a hard bitten guy on a doomed <UNK> three years on he would give his definitive performance in bring me the head of <UNK> garcia if you haven't seen those don't waste your time with this
<START> yes i have a copy of it on vhs uncut in great condition that i <UNK> to dvd and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a christmas classic please <UNK> me at <UNK> <UNK> net i searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a <UNK> mountain holiday im not to sure but its close
<START> <UNK> edgar allen poe a <UNK> and a <UNK> pan if you don't mind the psycho thriller or horror film genre and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted this is the movie for you an amazingly well developed first film hatred of a minute has all the draw of mainstream hits like silence of the <UNK> and of cult classics like army of darkness the editing and effects are well done better than many films in the genre <UNK> weaves an intricate tale of torment drawing on both the bible and <UNK> <UNK> at a time when big budget big name films lack much in the way of substance the independent film has <UNK> this dying <UNK> if you love <UNK> a good story or a decent thriller go check out hatred of a minute
<START> br br i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program and i thought it was awful as i said in my <UNK> it was pretentious trite petty and <UNK> self important br br i consider myself a fan of film and all the things that film has to offer if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival i will watch a e and they would probably be alot more objective about it br br i dont recommend it period br br
<START> bell book and candle was released in december 1958 and features james stewart kim novak jack lemmon and ernie <UNK> this film had james stewart and kim novak in their second on screen pairing after the alfred hitchcock classic vertigo released earlier the same year this was stewart's last film as a romantic lead as he was deemed too old at age 50 to play that sort of part anymore the movie is about a witch played by kim novak who is attracted to a mortal played by james stewart she puts a spell on him and he falls head over heels in love with her i enjoyed the movie and its cast this movie at the time was a <UNK> success which was nominated for a golden globe for best movie comedy <UNK>
<START> no one would argue that this 1945 war film was a masterpiece how could any 1945 war film be a masterpiece and yet this is an extremely effective telling of a true story that of al <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> as played by john garfield who spent days wearing a <UNK> to capture the nuances of a blind person's actions robert <UNK> in helmet for my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> popularity in favor of his <UNK> mate who was killed writing that the country must have needed live heroes br br well i suppose the country did and they had one here there is a single combat scene in the movie bound to the studio lot lasting only ten minutes or so and occurring less than halfway through the film instead of being saved for the climax but it is the scariest and most realistic depiction of men under fire that i can remember having seen on screen including those in saving private ryan men yell with fear scream at each other and at the enemy and bleed and die without the aid of color <UNK> sound <UNK> or gore br br simply from a technological point of view the film is outstanding it isn't just that we learn how complicated a <UNK> a 30 caliber water <UNK> <UNK> machine gun is or that it must be fired in bursts of only a few rounds or that it isn't <UNK> around like a fire <UNK> as in so many other war movies the technical <UNK> adds to the <UNK> riveting quality the need to stick to short bursts is horrifying when dozens of <UNK> enemies are <UNK> across a creek fifty feet away with the sole aim of <UNK> you and your two isolated <UNK> confined to a small gun <UNK> br br the performances are solid if not <UNK> including those of the <UNK> 1940s support john <UNK> and a <UNK> youthful <UNK> parker the framing love story is spare but it works and ultimately is quite moving a striking dream sequence is included it's not <UNK> but for a routine 1945 film it stands out as original and effective br br albert <UNK> may have <UNK> the script or it may have been altered by someone else it could have used the kind of <UNK> that might have introduced some much needed ambiguity still there are odd verbal <UNK> that have a surprising impact on the viewer why don't god strike me dead and in the eyes lee get 'em in the eyes depths of anguish in a few corny words and a surprising amount of <UNK> expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 war film br br notes that might seem false to a contemporary viewer but perhaps shouldn't the dated <UNK> which it's difficult to believe many of today's kids could think was actually ever spoken private <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gee you dumb <UNK> dame a <UNK> guy and feeling sorry for yourself let us consider the historical context and be kind in our <UNK> at the time some of this goofy <UNK> was at the cutting edge br br real weak points the wounded veterans get together and argue with each other about how much of a collective future they have and the argument is <UNK> resolved with a conclusion along the lines of just because you have a silver plate in your head doesn't mean people will think you're a bad person there are sometimes voice overs and silent <UNK> that are both unnecessary and downright unimaginative please god let him return to me and that sort of thing br br well the film makers were operating within the constraints of their times maybe that's why the final fade is on a shot of independence hall and the inspiring <UNK> of america the beautiful <UNK> in the back br br none of this can <UNK> the film's virtues which are considerable particularly the impact of that horrifying combat scene it's not on television that often if you have a chance by all means catch it
<START> the film is side <UNK> from the outset eddie just seems to bring that <UNK> to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together the film is very rare in this country but unsure of <UNK> in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck <UNK> companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it so hints are very welcome if any one likes eddie murphy as a comedian and <UNK> the video get it it is worth the money and can't go far wrong
<START> this documentary is at its best when it is simply showing the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and treatment <UNK> there is no denying the <UNK> poverty in india and desperation of even their <UNK> <UNK> however as an argument for <UNK> medicine in general this film fails miserably although indian <UNK> mention having seen <UNK> doctors those doctors are not interviewed and we have to take the vague statements of their patients at face value the doctor said there was no cure the doctor said it was cancer etc well no cure doesn't mean no treatment and what type of cancer exactly does the patient have the film is at its most feeble when showing <UNK> practice in america there it is reduced apparently to the stunning suggestion that having a high powered wall street job can make your stomach hurt
<START> this charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low key performance marlon brando stands out there's a subplot with mira sorvino and donald sutherland that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little i'm still trying to figure out why charlie want to change his name every movie with charles has been pretty bad
<START> now i love bela lugosi don't get me wrong he is one of the most interesting people to ever make a movie but he certainly did his share of <UNK> this is just another one of those br br lugosi plays dr <UNK> a doctor who has had his medical license pulled for unexplained reasons he is however doing experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful it's revealed that she is 70 80 years old yet lugosi looks to be in his mid 50's so why he is married to this old woman is never really explained br br anyway these <UNK> or experiments involved giving brides who are at the <UNK> being married some sort of sweet <UNK> substance <UNK> they pass out but are thought to be dead then lugosi and some of his <UNK> steal the body on its way to the <UNK> and take it back to his lab where it's kept in some sort of suspended animation or <UNK> state then the stolen brides have a <UNK> <UNK> somewhere in their bodies maybe the neck and then the <UNK> is <UNK> into the body of <UNK> wife to bring her back to youth and beauty we never really see where lugosi sticks the <UNK> or what it is that he draws out of the brides but it somehow <UNK> his wife apparently old age makes you scream with pain because <UNK> wife does a lot of screaming until she gets back to her younger state helping lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie a weird old <UNK> and her two <UNK> sons one son is a big <UNK> looking slow acting fellow who likes to <UNK> the <UNK> brides and the other son is a mean little dwarf little person to be politically correct in today's world at night these three just sort of pile up and sleep in <UNK> dreary <UNK> lab who these 3 are and how they came to be <UNK> scared <UNK> is like a lot of stuff in this film never explained br br so anyway a female reporter is given the assignment by her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen brides are going to she quickly figures out that the one common thing among all the stolen brides is a rare <UNK> that is found on them so she asks around and is told that there is a world renowned <UNK> expert living nearby who just happens to be the one who developed this particular <UNK> this expert turns out to be creepy dr <UNK> she quickly tracks him down and <UNK> his little house of horrors i'm not sure where the police were during all this but they came in to <UNK> up after the reporter had done all the dirty work br br it seems that <UNK> movies always had some sort of unnecessary silly plot line that just made the whole thing stink to high heavens i mean a world famous <UNK> expert kidnaps brides by sending them a <UNK> up <UNK> he himself is known to have developed <UNK> br br and then later it's revealed that the young ladies don't even have to be brides for the <UNK> to work so why would lugosi keep kidnapping brides from heavily <UNK> <UNK> for his experiments and create all the attention and newspaper <UNK> why not just grab a prostitute off the street like a normal weirdo <UNK> would do this <UNK> reminded me a lot of another lugosi stinker the devil bat same silly plot lines and bad acting and same silly <UNK> gets bad <UNK> deal br br but lugosi is always good he is creepy and sinister enough to keep you interested at least enough to keep watching him the woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actor she had no emotion whatsoever she just delivered her lines like a machine gun <UNK> them out as quickly as she could everyone else pretty much blew too when it came to being good actors br br but this thing is watchable if only for bela lugosi fans lugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a dog he must have known he was doing terrible pictures but maybe he also knew that if he gave it everything he had a little of that intensity might shine through past all the bad plots and bad acting which surrounded him br br and he was right we horror fans will always have a love for bela lugosi he gave it his all every time he was in front of the camera we do give two f <UNK> for you bela
<START> this has to be the worst film i have ever seen i bought the dvd and it didn't work well the dvd worked fine its just the film didn't in fact its so bad that i think non of the actors have worked since or before judging from the acting there is no real plot to speak of and no real horror the production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the <UNK> br br all in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they didn't know any better which have been an improvement there are only two lines in the film that are funny both of which <UNK> around the <UNK> prostitute although they hardly merit watching all <UNK> minutes for br br as for the marketing of the dvd i feel thoroughly cheated i mean reading the back i expected it to be bad br br he chose his weapons he selected his victims he picked his nose he turned into a girl br br but i thought it might be funny also the case claims it is <UNK> re <UNK> i would love to have seen it beforehand the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper the case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie in what way disgusting production acting br br this film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes if you are considering buying this i would say buy bad <UNK> instead it is a much better film and is funny also it has peter jackson the director of the lotr in it br br incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the actors or director patrick j <UNK> and what they have done since please post here as i would love to know purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there or if anyone in this film ever bothered to learn to act
<START> i consider stuart bliss the worst movie i have ever seen br br the acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous i get the fact that the main character's wife leaving him <UNK> a mental breakdown but it got so silly and boring after a while i could have cared less about any of the characters br br the movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot the whole thing with the <UNK> counter got too much after a while after stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter <UNK> something was there br br then there was the repetitive scenes with the <UNK> and the confusing ones where he meets himself br br i should have guessed that this movie was a flop when i didn't recognize any of the actors do yourself a favor when this movie comes up read a book you'll be better off
<START> this show was a landmark in american comedy as it was the first sitcom to star an all <UNK> american cast sadly though it was never broad casted on british tv br br the evans family are a poor <UNK> american family living in a tower block the dad is called james he tries to run the house but his wife florida always gets the better of him the three children are the artistic <UNK> the moody thelma and the young intellectual child michael always coming into the house is <UNK> <UNK> friend <UNK> br br i watched two episodes of this show on youtube black jesus and sex and the evans family the only two on the site you may be thinking why has an english viewer watched a series that has never been shown or hardly heard of in his country the answer is this in 1976 <UNK> first all black sitcom came out called the <UNK> only two series were made and it now seems forgotten but i watched an episode and was really impressed then i <UNK> that the scripts were identical to good times they were exactly the same characters but with different names sam foster was the dad his wife was pearl foster and the three children were sonny a young <UNK> henry shirley and benjamin <UNK> <UNK> friend was <UNK> to read about the <UNK> i have wrote a review about that whilst watching good times only two things annoyed me first off was the opening theme tune awful and secondly was the audience laughter i like audience laughter but in this somebody would say a slightly funny line and the audience would go mad and start <UNK> apart from that it was a very funny show let's hope more episodes turn up on youtube and lets hope that someone will release the <UNK> on dvd in england br br best episode sex and the evans family series 1 episode 6 the <UNK> episode of it was called sex in the black community the other episode i saw black jesus was a title of one episode of the <UNK>
<START> in 1943 a group of <UNK> officers including eric <UNK> decide to escape from a <UNK> camp using a <UNK> <UNK> horse in the <UNK> in 1950 it was decided to film his account and it kick started a peculiar british film genre the military prison camp story that reached its <UNK> in danger within 1959 br br the wooden horse is one of the <UNK> films i have ever watched there are no great dramatic moments but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn't give way for unlikely drama jump cuts or <UNK> up somethings about to happen music it is utterly of its time and works beautifully br br leo glenn anthony steel and david <UNK> lead a curiously low key cast of extras and i suspect non actors without exception all are constantly <UNK> <UNK> and quiet they keep emotion out of their roles as so many were until recently ex service i suspect they <UNK> their war time roles as <UNK> and <UNK> br br this <UNK> approach does not detract from any dramatic tension on the contrary unlike most wartime escape films the story doesn't end at the <UNK> wire and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end
<START> in a performance both <UNK> and <UNK> al pacino re teams with sea of love director harold <UNK> br br as new york mayor john <UNK> in city hall br br a <UNK> thriller thats the first film ever shot inside the lower manhattan structure that's ground zero for the city's government br br that the other nyc locations provide the vivid settings as an idealistic <UNK> <UNK> john cusack follows a trail of <UNK> and cover up that may loop back to the man he serves and <UNK> br br bridget fonda danny aiello martin <UNK> tony <UNK> and david <UNK> add more <UNK> brilliance to this gripping tale of power br br and the power behind power
<START> here i thought <UNK> of the north was the last word in <UNK> semi doc <UNK> movies how wrong as an avid sea <UNK> i stayed up till <UNK> to watch this hoping to get a glimpse of some hand made <UNK> <UNK> the movie did not let me down any student of <UNK> <UNK> construction should have a look see here note to fellow <UNK> they appear to be using norton sound <UNK> with single blade <UNK> br br but the film went way beyond this admittedly narrow interest even though there were as others have noted some little back shot <UNK> bits the movie has so much heart they are just a minor annoyance it was from this very amateur <UNK> viewpoint probably the perfect time to make this movie early thirties the <UNK> are so new that they including <UNK> b <UNK> actually let the <UNK> speak in their own tongue and there is so much that was still despite the <UNK> melodrama authentic they are really <UNK> that polar bear that whale and those <UNK> a fifties version of this film would have been so cheesy with <UNK> technicolor etc to <UNK> it up the seventies version don't even a very good companion piece to this excellent movie is white shadows in the south <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the mirror image to <UNK> it also deals with the relentless and profound <UNK> of western culture technology on an unsuspecting people
<START> spirit <UNK> of the <UNK> is an overall wonderful movie the <UNK> of animation types is unique the storyline is amazing and the music is wonderful br br the drawn animation is a special thing about many animations how they expressed the characters especially the horses through their animation are spectacular especially while the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand many young children and people who haven't studied horses might not understand without words i would imagine it would have to be challenging to express them through the features because of this i understand the <UNK> they added to the horses while real horses don't have those thick lines one of the few things i noticed about horse <UNK> that might have been portrayed strangely is that spirit lead his mother's herd in wild horse <UNK> the lead <UNK> usually chases the young <UNK> out br br also while some people might think portraying the white army officers as the <UNK> <UNK> is stereotyping think of all the movies in which the native americans have been portrayed as that sometimes back then they did treat <UNK> very poorly for example in real history the <UNK> breed was almost wiped out due to the army officers imagine what would have happened to one of the worlds best loved riding <UNK> if the native americans had not saved them br br i think it's amazing how the realism wasn't <UNK> by making the horses talk to each other <UNK> feelings were expressed by a little bit of narration but mostly through the music by bryan adams the songs express the story really well and hans <UNK> and bryan adams did a great job telling the story through <UNK> and lyrics br br the emotion i got when watching the movie whether the first time or the <UNK> yes i've watched it that much you wouldn't believe some of the scenes take your breath away while others seem to force tears into your eyes the opening sequence showing <UNK> <UNK> puts you right into the spectacular action right away br br i don't understand at all why some people are so hateful of this brilliant movie overall i rate it a 10 10 a must watch
<START> clearly an hilarious movie br br it <UNK> me to see the poor ratings given to this piece of comic genius br br please look at this for what it is a funny ridiculous enjoyable film laugh for christ sake br br
<START> i don't remember ever seeing this one before tonight probably the title sounded so ordinary it kept passing me by but it is a well crafted b western with an interestingly brooding storyline <UNK> by acting <UNK> from the good to corny br br robert mitchum <UNK> into wide open town looking for his wife and news of their daughter and stays for a time as town <UNK> as usual the good business folk have mixed emotions they want to get rid of the baddies but like the business they bring it still applies relax drink and gambling laws and encourage the <UNK> but pretend to <UNK> the seedy effects it can have on ordinary people what's fascinating about this film is <UNK> <UNK> intense portrayal in going about cleaning the town of baddies and the <UNK> acceptance that his violent methods were the only ones favourite bit the sudden demise of 2 of the baddies in the red dog saloon the firing of the main saloon <UNK> on nasty but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison br br overall a very good film with its only fault <UNK> to be a little <UNK> not so good for do <UNK> who would probably prefer a lifetime of <UNK> with evil rather than end it
<START> for a no budget movie this thing rocks i don't know if america's gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really non hollywood br br the actors and music <UNK> the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff <UNK> us up <UNK> <UNK> br br i've seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think i've seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it <UNK> luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors
<START> first it was jack the <UNK> now it is alan feinstone the crazy dentist <UNK> people in horrific ways quite realistic at times but some of the acting is abysmal and comical especially from corbin <UNK> in some scenes there is dental torture that will really make you cringe
<START> i had high hopes for this film i thought the premise interesting i stuck through it even though i found the acting save helena bonham carter <UNK> i kept hoping my time spent would pay off but in the end i was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing maybe in george <UNK> version there is a message worth conveying if this film accomplished anything it has inspired me to read <UNK> classic i find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption if the film <UNK> message is the mundane life is worth living well then they've succeeded i would recommend this film to no one 101 minutes of my life wasted
<START> but it was on a <UNK> channel and the reception was very fuzzy i'd really like to own the movie since the reason i watched it in the first place is because i am a bus driver and at the time i saw this movie i was driving that model bus it was only during his murder trial some 15 years later that i remember vaguely that <UNK> was one of the stars in it i only recall that he was the driver and of the <UNK> being shot up and driven wildly i've been looking all over for this movie to no <UNK> since viewing it in the mid 80s i liked the movie i don't usually watch thrillers but after reading the summary in the tv guide and viewing its beginning although fuzzy i stayed for the whole thing
<START> meryl streep is such a genius well at least as an actress i know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents but she nails the accent every time her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring mrs chamberlain as portrayed here was not particularly likable nor all that smart but that just makes <UNK> work all the more remarkable i think she is worth all 10 or so of her oscar nominations about the film well there were a couple of interesting things i don't know much about australia but the theme of religious <UNK> among the general public played a big part in the story i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery inducing pursuit and <UNK> as their american colleagues a pretty good film a bit different grade b
<START> ok this movie could have been <UNK> good all generations have been exposed to thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie the craft themselves and <UNK> island were realistically transferred to the big screen whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with sophia miles was simply fantastic as lady p and bill paxton whilst not exactly who i <UNK> jeff <UNK> being was solid enough but then the adults were taken out of the <UNK> and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 <UNK> machines br br it's not so much the fact that the movie was <UNK> around the children that made me feel like <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film it was the fact that alan <UNK> was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers who were at least 19 20 seriously these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case br br the film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or <UNK> it tried to pay homage whilst <UNK> and it just generally fell flat on its face 3 10 2 for the machines 1 for lady p
<START> have never understood why the macdonald eddy <UNK> song has always been <UNK> so mercilessly not just by their <UNK> but by virtually everyone to me i married an angel is more lively and imaginative than any of the <UNK> more celebrated <UNK> the sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an mgm musical the script is by the reliable anita <UNK> san francisco the women gentlemen prefer <UNK> etc the <UNK> and hart tunes albeit altered a bit by macdonald eddy <UNK> bob wright and <UNK> forrest are given <UNK> treatment by herbert <UNK> oscar winner for <UNK> the wizard of oz and best of all the singing <UNK> look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings try to show rose marie or <UNK> to the <UNK> today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still but this offbeat fast paced fantasy is bound to entertain
<START> i couldn't find anyone to watch dig with me because no one i knew was a fan of either of the bands naturally everyone assumed you can only enjoy this film if you like the music of either the dandy warhols or the brian <UNK> massacre but this is so far from the truth the only <UNK> is that you have an interest in music and or pop culture in general the way in which the careers of the two groups are <UNK> is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take and watching the public eat up and spit out the dandy warhols is fascinating i agree with other reviews that mention it would be nice to get a final word from anton himself since he's clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and the <UNK> to the <UNK> ability to just remain br br most interesting to me is the <UNK> respect for the <UNK> despite their lack or <UNK> and for anton despite his <UNK> behavior the dandy warhols respect the art the group produces even if the group hates everything the dandy warhols now stand for although that's <UNK> the best line is when the drummer for the <UNK> says i won't have them anywhere new me again and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out i'll still buy their records though to me this just shows how powerful good music can be br br definitely see this movie even if you know nothing of either band it's more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting it's rare to follow a group so closely for so long
<START> les <UNK> the first movie about the medieval time <UNK> was actually funny i like jean reno as an actor but there was more there were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain <UNK> that would remind you a little bit of louis de <UNK> br br now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling the plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time <UNK> so they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting <UNK> as you advance in the movie the duke jean reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been <UNK> so there's not a lot he can do to save the film br br now the <UNK> slave <UNK> he has really all the attention the movie is merely about him and his being clumsy annoying stupid or whatever he was supposed to be fact is this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longer br br if you liked les <UNK> do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel if you didn't like les <UNK> you would never consider seeing the sequel if you liked this sequel well i suppose you still need to see a lot of movies
<START> i just saw the drugs years on <UNK> and i love it i think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly it has a strong message to the all generations there is <UNK> there are <UNK> <UNK> and jim <UNK> deaths there are many many examples of drug use and drug abuse it completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in america in both good and bad ways in my opinion this documentary is well done and i would like to <UNK> to its creators because this is exactly what is needed to be playing in the tv in these days i am waiting for the dvd release you should definitely see it this movie is stunning big time
<START> the house of the dead was the worst movie i have ever seen between the pathetic <UNK> <UNK> camera angle <UNK> and the cheesy acting i fell asleep i don't think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was <UNK> or not because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other i would rate this movie a 1 out of 10 10 being the best 1 being the worst also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time i beg anyone who reads this not to see it it's not worth the time
