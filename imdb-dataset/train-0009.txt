<START> i am a lover of b movies give me a <UNK> mutated bat and i am in heaven these movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world even a stupid b movie will usually make me laugh and i will still consider it a good thing then there was hammerhead which was so awful i had to register with imdb so i could warn others first there was the science of creating the shark man which the movie barely touched on in order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes during one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a <UNK> to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead what fabulous special effects back to the science i thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be <UNK> through their breast <UNK> anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and i'm sorry to say pretty bad acting not even william forsythe hunter <UNK> or jeffrey combs could save this stinker
<START> engaging riveting tale of captured us army <UNK> who has to prove his innocence to avoid the <UNK> paul <UNK> <UNK> friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a us spy on a secret mission in korea br br in the vein of classic courtroom dramas sergeant <UNK> is an extremely well crafted mystery <UNK> guided by an outstanding cast director <UNK> constant momentum and effective plot twists and turns br br this film was originally made as a television movie in 1964 and subsequently <UNK> up for this <UNK> with the presence of many name actors and some action sequences <UNK> <UNK> his role is spot on as the <UNK> <UNK> attorney whose <UNK> sometimes stray to the personal plight of <UNK> supportive yet somewhat distant wife played with <UNK> by vera miles <UNK> out the <UNK> is peter graves for the <UNK> and norman fell and murray hamilton in key supporting roles br br <UNK> interpretation of the paul <UNK> character is a balanced depiction of a simple but dedicated man whose normally laid back <UNK> is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he's placed marvin switches perfectly from <UNK> indifference to passionate determination giving a convincing often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small scale drama it's this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it <UNK> a place on the best ever lists of courtroom dramas br br however despite its apparent obscurity sergeant <UNK> still remains a taut and compelling examination like a book that you just can't put down highly recommended
<START> there are many adaptations of charlotte <UNK> classic novel jane eyre and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best the short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to <UNK> the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a 100 min length consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel the tv series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the <UNK> life br br there are three tv mini series released in '73 <UNK> and 2006 the 2006 version is not only the worst of these three but the worst of all jane eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film the <UNK> beautiful lines are <UNK> by insipid and trivial ones and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel what it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the rochester and jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set it is a silly soap opera in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the <UNK> by mistake this jane eyre as it <UNK> to call itself is indeed a slap in the face of charlotte <UNK> br br the 1973 version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between mr rochester and jane are rendered in nearly their full length but what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen at times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen and the constant <UNK> of the dialogues by jane's voice overs add to the impression of <UNK> and <UNK> and despite the <UNK> to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured another problem is the casting of the main characters <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of jane as a bold self confident <UNK> wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model and michael <UNK> although a good actor does simply not possess the commanding physical presence nor the charisma necessary to play rochester although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really <UNK> the audience br br all the faults of the '73 version stand <UNK> in the tv mini series of <UNK> with timothy dalton and zelah clarke although from a <UNK> point of view timothy dalton is too handsome tall and lean to be rochester he possesses the essential qualities for the role he has an <UNK> physical presence great <UNK> and an air of self <UNK> and authority and despite his <UNK> <UNK> he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of <UNK> convincingly but the excellence of his performance lies in the way he <UNK> all the <UNK> of <UNK> character of all the actors who have played rochester he is the only one to capture them all <UNK> <UNK> nearly <UNK> his <UNK> and <UNK> as well as his humorous side his <UNK> his <UNK> and deep frantic love <UNK> handling of charlotte <UNK> language is equally superb even <UNK> most far fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when dalton delivers them he is the definitive rochester <UNK> and <UNK> and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor br br zelah clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of rochester she portrays exactly the jane of the novel an <UNK> shy reserved and <UNK> young woman but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will she catches beautifully the <UNK> in jane's character her modesty and <UNK> on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other her seeming <UNK> and her <UNK> sense of right and wrong she and dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight br br as regards <UNK> to the literary model this version also quotes <UNK> from the novel as does the '73 version but with one important difference the dialogues are <UNK> in this version but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered <UNK> thus the scriptwriter avoided any <UNK> of speech while still fully <UNK> the beauty and originality of charlotte <UNK> language and in contrast to the earlier bbc version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured br br the plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the '73 series it is nearly a scene for scene <UNK> of the novel where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of jane's life it is the only jane eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel and the only one which does full justice to the <UNK> pivotal and most <UNK> scene when jane and rochester meet after the <UNK> wedding timothy dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill he <UNK> with almost painful intensity <UNK> anguish as he realizes jane's resolution to leave him his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him it is a heartbreaking almost devastating scene which will stay with the viewer for a long time br br with even the smaller roles perfectly cast an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true jane eyre
<START> for those of you that don't that reference <UNK> was 4 <UNK> hitting one body br br anyways onto the review br br i miss <UNK> saturday night some of my favorite wrestling moments took place on this stage i remember watching stunning steve austin rick rude brian <UNK> <UNK> jack dustin <UNK> johnny b <UNK> <UNK> in his <UNK> days lord steven regal harlem heat ricky <UNK> <UNK> i'd be here a while listing everyone point is <UNK> had an awesome <UNK> in the pre hogan days and they were producing entertaining television dusty <UNK> on commentary in it's later years gave me a whole new reason to watch when i started smoking pot as a teenager i really wish vince would put him on the <UNK> for a show or two maybe at the next great american bash they <UNK> here comes da <UNK> he was great br br <UNK>
<START> i personally liked the prophecy of 1995 a lot christopher walken was as always great and even though the film wasn't flawless it was a creepy and highly original horror fantasy film that entertained immensely this inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching but mainly due to walken walken is one of the greatest actors around in my opinion and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen <UNK> gabriel whom he plays for the second time here once again the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child namely the child of the angel <UNK> <UNK> wong and the human woman valerie jennifer <UNK> this child could once be the <UNK> factor of the <UNK> war as i said above christopher walken is once again excellent as gabriel besides gabriel however the prophecy ii sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters the character of valerie was annoying enough and <UNK> annoyed me even more the biggest pain in the ass however was the character of <UNK> played by <UNK> murphy a <UNK> girl who wouldn't shut up still <UNK> performance isn't the only redeeming quality of the film the entire film is quite dreary and well shot in dark colors which contributes a lot to the atmosphere <UNK> <UNK> scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive and one of the coolest moments in any of the prophecy films the prophecy ii is nevertheless the weakest of the three prophecy films with walken definitely a christopher walken one man show entertaining but nothing beyond that
<START> the thing that makes this movie so scary is the way that it portrays andre and <UNK> as relatively normal guys these are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera forget scripted lines etc they are only making the video as a diary to show 'the <UNK> how normal their lives were their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video by <UNK> other kids attacks on their schools andre and <UNK> learn what not to do and they inform usually in a silly <UNK> old <UNK> kind of way any potential <UNK> and <UNK> who might be watching this video how to make bombs get weapons and not get caught before zero day the day of the attack
<START> this film along with <UNK> are minor gems amongst the <UNK> homage <UNK> that have passed for horror movies so far at the <UNK> <UNK> and yes that's faint praise indeed 'cause there's not much worse in <UNK> than would be <UNK> who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot br br and that's all you get with the abandoned this is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head sure it would have been nice if he'd <UNK> it to film but this happened instead it's a very pretty film with a few genuine scares but the last reel is strictly for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> crowd
<START> this is a movie of tired yet <UNK> childish clichés there's a nazi witch master performing sf related experiments in the basement oh please br br aiming for a <UNK> sense of horror and fear the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright not having any expectations beforehand i am left with an aged <UNK> from buffy and a heroine with ape like face who doesn't seem to know how to act said <UNK> <UNK> have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable cannibal women in the <UNK> jungle of death br br camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame
<START> imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something 50 times worse br br got that br br ok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever <UNK> is the single worst movie i've ever seen there were a few cheap laughs very few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funny br br the only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's not surprise why
<START> panic in the streets was a decent thriller but i felt a bit disappointed by it the central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating but the film never really explores or develops it its well made and entertaining but its not as interesting as it should have been the screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down none of the central characters are really compelling or believable br br fortunately the film is very well made so it <UNK> for the weak scripting the direction by <UNK> kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace there are some standout sequences particularly the memorable chase climax when his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later the man could mostly do no wrong br br the acting is also very good richard widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an <UNK> character paul douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well the <UNK> in the cast are the two villains zero mostel known primarily for his comic roles is effectively slimy as one of <UNK> ultimate <UNK> characters jack palance is <UNK> a chilling villain panic in the streets is disappointing but still worth watching 7 10
<START> this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad hence can i advice anyone to watch it well i was kinda <UNK> by the fact that in was in the <UNK> competition i still can't believe it won and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q a section but that was also anything but interesting what's it about well the first half the worth watching one presents three characters a hooker a musician and some kind of official the first two lie about their <UNK> but the third is the actual liar the second half do something else don't ruin a good evening includes some old breasts and heavy drinking but maybe you will see it completely different the <UNK> jury did were they drinking <UNK>
<START> as an avid fan of the <UNK> books by george <UNK> <UNK> i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released sadly it was a huge disappointment then so i left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again but it was no better the second time mr <UNK> is a tremendously <UNK> writer but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester the <UNK> for slapstick <UNK> 'the three <UNK> for me and the same applies here to me the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong the <UNK> books are <UNK> funny in parts but they are adventure novels there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that <UNK> has after all he is involved in dangerous situations this is conveyed in the novels but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book when i first read that the book was to be filmed the article said that the film was to star oliver reed i <UNK> as reed to me was the epitome of <UNK> how i would have loved to see him in the role malcolm mcdowell is a good actor but does not fit the visual image of <UNK> created by the books too <UNK> looking <UNK> is supposed to be a big <UNK> fellow <UNK> reed was excellent as <UNK> what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which <UNK> kills de <UNK> tom bell a great shame as the production values costumes sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell possibly the <UNK> of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is as a recent radio adaptation of <UNK> for <UNK> adapted by mr <UNK> worked quite well perhaps one day we may see <UNK> done justice on screen
<START> they bothered making this movie anyone i didn't think so br br if you are looking for a coming of age movie go rent summer of <UNK> this is no summer of <UNK> br br when your big stars are nolte <UNK> <UNK> gets more screen time that is your first warning sign and of course for such an artsy movie there is plenty of <UNK> skin <UNK> around just to make it look artsy br br <UNK> did his usual uninteresting cardboard character <UNK> by moments that were supposed to be intense the intensity is that of someone with <UNK> polar disorder br br miller is most famous for her looks what she had to say about the city of <UNK> after this movie <UNK> should hold a grudge against her she <UNK> an actual <UNK> native br br foster gave <UNK> a run for his money in the cardboard acting style wow was this his first role after high school <UNK> br br so we have this weird triangle foster has a crush on miller but is with his boss girlfriend he can't take miller to bed won't take his boss to bed so he hangs with <UNK> miller watches them get it on br br then after one of <UNK> pseudo intense moments foster miller get it on a scene that we are treated to in every sloppy <UNK> detail finally just to round it all out foster <UNK> get it on with foster in the miller role now i know how 2 guys get it on as if that was ever anything i needed to know br br after all that all that's left is the tragic ending for one character the <UNK> views of the remaining 2 it gets me right in the pit of my stomach oh wait that was the <UNK> pizza i just had br br i'd like back the time this movie took out of my life please
<START> right up until the end the bad guys have the upper hand always which kind of put into question the <UNK> of the good guys a couple of innocent man accused of a crime plots are irritating some unnecessary dialogue in which various dull legal issues get <UNK> this is just a mediocre dumb old western so what's this nonsense about trying to keep things realistic <UNK> <UNK> presence in a western is one of the few if not the only entertaining thing about the movie somewhere around the middle there is a ridiculously timed marriage <UNK> sort of like where is the kid hiding where is he oh and by the way will you marry me
<START> another one for the babes bullets crowd the story is much <UNK> than any other musical i have seen <UNK> hidden up the missing legs of females and places each <UNK> in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the locale more effective than contemporary <UNK> ' it is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants in <UNK> of <UNK> pretty remarkable if you consider the context br br despite the cannon up the leg thing providing 90 of the surprises this film also chronicles how greed <UNK> all other <UNK> in the lives of a group of <UNK> who pursue a woman who keeps up her leg a <UNK> cannon rocket <UNK> hence no group shower scenes or <UNK> the hidden <UNK> <UNK> which is pulled out from the behind the protagonists back seemingly from nowhere in miike's dead or alive 1999 the torch brought forth out of thin air by the heroine towards the end of the original <UNK> 2000 or the harrowing flame <UNK> scene in sunny gets blue 1992 all <UNK> to an almost third world <UNK> esquire influence in the contemporary japanese cinema of which i am at a loss to explain but cannot complain br br you won't see good quality movies of this essence made in hollywood its all but <UNK> and with cheap crap they <UNK> out for a cheap thrill is all but laughable this is a true film and while its great in its entirety the ending is a brilliant if not <UNK> rip off of certain sergio leon pictures involving <UNK> where legs should be and certainly is appropriate
<START> i watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh i've had in a long while the plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way the only plus to be found anywhere in the film are corey <UNK> impressive <UNK> alexandra paul i think that's her name is horrendous as the <UNK> wife who has a history of depression ted <UNK> is gross and his character's a <UNK> on top of it all and as if the fact that you think she's having sex with her son isn't enough they throw in needless <UNK> <UNK> at every opportunity the end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable i mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him
<START> clara bow <UNK> <UNK> is daughter of plantation owner albert <UNK> bill <UNK> who is mainly interested in playing cards and <UNK> with friends she's interested in riding in the countryside until engineer clive <UNK> anthony <UNK> shows up to build a <UNK> one of her father's friends <UNK> <UNK> mrs <UNK> then <UNK> for his <UNK> his wife <UNK> <UNK> margaret <UNK> shows up for the contrived finale br br lots of <UNK> <UNK> elements like nude bathing br br wonderful location shooting in hawaii
<START> <UNK> and the man' is one of <UNK> funniest plays if handled correctly and this production does a good enough job helena bonham carter pre film stardom is <UNK> the daughter of a military family who has a <UNK> of a fiancé patrick <UNK> and who <UNK> a soldier from the enemy <UNK> <UNK> during a raid on the town br br full of colour and energy this production rips along at a good pace and if bonham carter and <UNK> <UNK> as the maid are <UNK> a bit by the rest of the cast they still hold their ground <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the parents are delightful and the whole play is generally a happy one br br highly recommended
<START> mitchell <UNK> fifth feature as director and he shows his <UNK> by directing a musical after his previous movies were heavy dramas he also plays a cameo as the conductor br br you can tell it is a pre code movie and nothing like it was made in the us for quite a while afterwards like 30 years <UNK> shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see no widescreen shots or from above ala busby berkeley what i do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience br br as others have mentioned the leads are fairly <UNK> and jack <UNK> and victor <UNK> play their normal movie <UNK> <UNK> michael however provides a bit of spark br br the musical numbers are interesting and some good the rape of the <UNK> in particular is amusing but the drama unconvincing and <UNK> three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters this is where this movie could have been a lot better
<START> here's the skinny it seems that this is much older then i thought it was but it's still cool the bike <UNK> are cool and the story works for the most part there are some character issues that i hope work themselves out by part 2 and my biggest complaint of all that it seems to be a <UNK> knock off not just the animation style but several character designs for example all the girls in this movie look like <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> look similar to <UNK> as well as the other characters this is really not made for little kids it has graphic violence nudity and graphic sexual content so to make a long story short i give this cool <UNK> knock off 7 stars
<START> this film was terrible ok my favourite film is 'the wicker man' 1973 so i was always bound to be a little biased br br the plot <UNK> along throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term <UNK> highly dubious he's not a virgin but is <UNK> to <UNK> wow so many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained which i'm afraid mr <UNK> does not a horror movie make how are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film cage looks <UNK> and <UNK> throughout and his character is prone to calling out <UNK> at the slightest noise the <UNK> to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage for example certain incidents mirror the original the girl falling out of a <UNK> pretending to be dead when <UNK> cage is searching the island and several lines of dialogue are <UNK> straight from anthony <UNK> original screenplay and <UNK> in br br i'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this i really can't be bothered to write any more about this film it lacks any kind of substance throw it on the <UNK> heap with all the other remakes that have <UNK> the good names of the films they were <UNK> on in this case very loosely
<START> this is a great british film a cleverly observed script with many <UNK> lines which captures perfectly what magic <UNK> can do to a man over a weekend as per usual phil daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of british actors <UNK> bell peter <UNK> with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting <UNK> and gary stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece although it seems to be billed as a biker movie i think it will find an audience outside of this purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t shirt also a great original soundtrack with a <UNK> version of <UNK> this really could be a 21st century heir to the famous ealing comedies like the <UNK> in the <UNK> fields it's a <UNK>
<START> i came to new <UNK> south expecting a surrogate movie about the <UNK> school massacre similar to gus van <UNK> elephant and certainly the synopsis in the tv guide stating that a student <UNK> rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned br br the story is about <UNK> a chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he <UNK> to be an <UNK> regime the major problem is that the character is <UNK> and the actor who plays him blake <UNK> is unable to <UNK> any script <UNK> you have the gut feeling that <UNK> should have the evil charisma of hitler <UNK> or bin laden but he never comes across as anything more than a <UNK> <UNK> teenager and it's impossible to believe he could <UNK> any <UNK> the subtext of you <UNK> one manipulative <UNK> regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means new <UNK> south is an entirely unconvincing drama that's not worth going out of your way to see
<START> i don't think this movie was rated correctly i took my copy and <UNK> out the pg rating and wrote down r i would not recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18 whatever the r limit is br br why it contains a scene in the jungle with several topless indian women i don't know about you but that's not something for little children to be watching true it might be the traditional clothing style of the african indians but i think partial nudity should give a movie an r rating br br i haven't seen the movie recently but i guess otherwise it was alright
<START> much has been made of <UNK> use of digital technology to <UNK> <UNK> the background at times it works well the scene where grace and her maid witness from <UNK> the king's execution is particularly striking at other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look resembling a home video however the major failing is that the sheer <UNK> of the <UNK> en scene creates an <UNK> effect in the viewer we know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters to be frank i did not care at all what happened to the lady or the duke br br the other major failing i regret to say is the performance of lucy russell in the leading role she is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance ok she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion her <UNK> in the scene where she <UNK> to her friend <UNK> de <UNK> an excellent performance by the <UNK> helena <UNK> seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience also watch her hands when she is expressing emotion br br all in all a very disappointing film particularly given the positive reviews on this site
<START> wonderful cast wasted on worthless script ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as <UNK> could this ever happen in a million years it's simply a fantasy and a boring one at that do they become teenagers again do they <UNK> their pranks games good times they may try but ultimately the answer is no is there any intrigue any suspense horror comedy none of the above how anyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me i wanted to like this movie i tried to like this movie but my brain refused
<START> okay i must say that before the revealing of the <UNK> saying that he really didn't fit into that category just some weird thing that had an annoying <UNK> and personally i think a <UNK> could have ran away from that thing but anyway i actually was getting into this film although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didn't come as an appeal but such scenes as when she runs away from the train and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy also where the guard had just been killed and the <UNK> put his hand on the screen br br but then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror with limited thrills or scares slowly i became more bored and wanted to shut the thing off i like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it specially the guy he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there i think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are just boring and well not worth the money br br if you are looking for a cheap scare here and there or a mindless gore fest which is limited hardly any in fact by all means give it a go but for all you serious horror <UNK> look somewhere else much better films out there
<START> <UNK> hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing recent adapted <UNK> like <UNK> have ruined great writing but the mother surpasses all his previous <UNK> <UNK> even my beautiful <UNK> a middle aged woman <UNK> widow hood by having a very <UNK> relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally weak daughter the fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the <UNK> gift of the writing and in daniel craig we have a <UNK> <UNK> gruff anti hero who <UNK> the audience to ever question why a young stud would contemplate <UNK> a <UNK> grandmother beautifully shot the film fails only in the weak depiction of the <UNK> characters but as a study of <UNK> lust it's a winner
<START> this is a low budget film with a cast of <UNK> and a minimum of on location shoots the <UNK> substitute for thailand and nobody actually goes to hong kong the stock shot of a <UNK> pacific <UNK> jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly this film proves that you need neither mega budgets nor a <UNK> star to produce an excellent movie it contains neither the <UNK> nor the <UNK> that young <UNK> often stumble into solid <UNK> from people who know all the aspects of movie making and who understand the <UNK> between art and box office an excellent piece of work
<START> in this send up of horror films 50's cold war paranoia reagan era america and high school films adam arkin plays tony the star <UNK> of full moon high in the 1950's he and his father ed <UNK> travel to communist romania and while he's lost in the streets one night he is bitten by a werewolf when he returns <UNK> he cannot control his <UNK> <UNK> and goes on a killing spree frustrated he <UNK> town decades later the immortal tony returns to town and re <UNK> in <UNK> he still can't control his <UNK> and the <UNK> and his friends realize he's not quite human it all <UNK> during the schools big football game br br i expected this to be one of those <UNK> bad it's <UNK> films from the early 80's but i was surprised that the film was actually <UNK> funny the cast including kenneth mars as a <UNK> coach <UNK> kelly as tony's <UNK> former flame <UNK> wilson as a bus driver and alan arkin as a oddball doctor go all out with hilarious results br br while watching this film i was struck by how similar the writing and humor were to <UNK> guy ' <UNK> moon <UNK> has that same anything goes attitude and never takes itself seriously
<START> silly simplistic and short gun crazy volume 1 a woman from nowhere goes nowhere br br this brief just over sixty minutes tale isn't so much inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a rip off of sam <UNK> the quick the dead his admitted homage to the spaghetti westerns brought into a contemporary setting in quick dead sharon <UNK> character seeks revenge against the <UNK> sheriff played by gene hackman who when she was but an <UNK> placed the fate of her father a brief cameo by gary <UNK> in her hands she accidentally shot him through the head in gun crazy <UNK> played by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seeks revenge against the <UNK> mr <UNK> played with <UNK> appeal by <UNK> <UNK> who when she was but an <UNK> placed the fate of her father in her hands she let her foot slip off the <UNK> and dear <UNK> dad was drawn and <UNK> by a semi truck the only significant difference despite the settings is the fact that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with  well i won't spoil that for you in case you decide to watch it br br in short <UNK>  a pale imitation of the clint eastwood's <UNK> with no <UNK>  rides into the town  basically there's a auto shop and a <UNK> alongside an american military base so i guess that <UNK> for a town  <UNK> by <UNK> the local <UNK> with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored <UNK> her true self as a bounty hunter <UNK> takes on the local <UNK> in <UNK> whose choreography <UNK> more than a passing similarity to the works of johnny to and john woo of course by the end of the film <UNK> has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys but she rises to the occasion  on her knees in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending  and <UNK> all of her enemies with a rocket <UNK> br br don't ask where she gets the rocket <UNK> just watch it for yourself try not to laugh br br the image quality is average for the dvd release there is a grainy quality to several sequences but all in all this isn't a bad transfer the sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times but again it isn't a bad transfer br br rather it's a bad film
<START> yes shakespeare would indeed have been proud laurence fishburne was not at his best but certainly not bad kenneth <UNK> on the other hand was brilliant his scheming was wonderful as was his <UNK> with the audience very nice work br br there were at times too little drama where more would have been expected <UNK> <UNK> for instance was a bit <UNK> by too much happening to far apart causing the <UNK> to twist his head to grasp it all br br did i mention michael <UNK> his madness <UNK> <UNK> was unusual annoying even br br if you haven't seen othello before see this if you haven't read othello see this if you haven't heard othello see this you do on the other hand do yourself a favour by reading it seeing it acted <UNK> and hearing it sung too
<START> please take a minute to read my entire review i am not knocking the film itself only the dvd versions currently available br br br br i really wanted to give this film even two stars i mean how could it possibly rank a mere 1 out of 10 br br here's how an epic film adaptation of <UNK> novel war and peace with historically accurate battle scenes courtesy of the red army and an extremely faithful scene for scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but worth sitting through for seven hours if that's what you were seeing br br the trouble is you can't see that film anywhere as far as i know br br i am attempting to watch the <UNK> dvd version widely considered the best version available since it's letter <UNK> and <UNK> the scenes that were cut from other dvd releases br br but it is one of the worst film <UNK> i've ever seen <UNK> to dvd the picture is <UNK> and inconsistent often <UNK> it's almost tolerable if you <UNK> your <UNK> color and picture levels up to maximum but the problem doesn't end there br br the sound is also way inconsistent <UNK> loud in parts virtually <UNK> in others br br and as for languages it's a huge problem for english <UNK> the dubbed option has some good actors and some really terrible ones whose performance <UNK> and parts of the film just aren't dubbed at all <UNK> back into russian and even french randomly br br the subtitled option isn't much better the subtitles don't appear below the image but right over it <UNK> some of the beauty or what's left of it in the scenery furthermore the subtitles are often a poor translation a shame given that the script took pains to <UNK> so close to <UNK> actual words and the subtitles too seem to just drop out in parts br br so even if you max out the color <UNK> and picture settings and turn the volume way up and choose subtitled and english dubbed you're still going to get a film that's annoying to watch and listen to br br can it's content overcome that it might have been able to but at seven hours who can stand it for that long br br maybe someday someone will come along and <UNK> this and maybe then i will see a masterpiece but for now i just can't give more than one star to something i've only been able to stand watching about the first 12 of
<START> this has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time awful acting awful script and they were the good points one to definitely miss the jokes if you could call them that were so predictable as to be pathetic pamela anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic i sat willing to give it a chance hoping that it was going to improve which alas it didn't if it was a choice between this and a book i suggest you settle down for a good read i like denise richards which is why i gave this movie a go but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me
<START> it should come as no shock to you when i say that alone in the dark is a crappy movie to put it <UNK> it's as if a dung monster <UNK> ate the result and then <UNK> the final product would still <UNK> this movie br br seemingly based on an ancient <UNK> video game the movie has something or other to do with a <UNK> to the <UNK> of the earth the <UNK> of demons and ancient <UNK> something about there being two worlds that of darkness and that of light guess which one's <UNK> oh and 10 000 years ago a really super <UNK> advanced civilization opened the <UNK> demons came over and had a blast then wiped out the civilization which is why we've never heard of them conveniently enough br br christian slater perhaps <UNK> for the days of <UNK> and <UNK> up the volume plays edward <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> to whom something bad happened when he was 10 years old he's hot on the trail of one of the <UNK> of said advanced civilization <UNK> used to be part of a secret institution called <UNK> which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long ago civilization but <UNK> believed he wasn't going to be able to find the answers he sought so he left the group br br but see these <UNK> are out and they get their prey in varying ways such as <UNK> them splitting them down the middle <UNK> <UNK> control devices in them or just turning them into killing zombies yes it's another zombie movie br br that's about as <UNK> i can make the plot it's pretty convoluted and incomprehensible in similar movies one might see the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> figure things out a step at a time and when we the audience are mentally with the <UNK> it's a lot of fun but when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context not so much fun br br the acting is dreadful save for slater who although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie showed he was capable of carrying the acting load he had to get this tara reid is cast as a museum <UNK> honest to goodness i thought i'd seen the casting of a lifetime when denise richards was cast as a nuclear <UNK> in tomorrow never dies but reid here matches richards crappy <UNK> for crappy <UNK> <UNK> include reid <UNK> <UNK> as new <UNK> land reid delivering most of her lines in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kinda like she'd been on an all night <UNK> for the past week before filming reid a museum <UNK> mind you spending a lot of the movie in a <UNK> bearing top and hip <UNK> <UNK> oh yeah she was as believable as jessica simpson giving stock quotes oh why must the pretty ones be so dumb note i don't think tara <UNK> all that good looking she looks like she's in <UNK> need of food almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable except perhaps for steven <UNK> who played burke one of the leaders of <UNK> <UNK> character wasn't terribly well developed but nothing in the movie was from the sets to the characters to tara reid but i <UNK> br br anyway the <UNK> and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a <UNK> pace but director uwe boll <UNK> in a <UNK> mind <UNK> soundtrack it's so loud you can't hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes that can't be right given the acting level however perhaps thanks are in order to mr boll br br oh and a fun note the opening moments of the movie include narration of the words that are <UNK> across the screen at the same time remember the first star wars you heard that now familiar star wars theme while the prologue <UNK> there was surely no need for narration why do i need some <UNK> to read what's on the screen for me were the producers simply looking out for blind people maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud they were also looking out for hard of hearing people also the narrator inexplicably had a <UNK> for the first few lines of the crawl then lost it bizarre br br alone in the dark is a loud dopey <UNK> of dreadful acting an incoherent script and ham handed directing hardly a note rings true there's so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise even in the dark the demonic creatures seem <UNK> and much more developed by comparison br br ironically since there were only three other people in the theater i watched this alone in the dark i wonder if uwe boll planned it that way i can't quite give this the lowest rating because i had low hopes for it to begin with and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it it's atrocious although slater <UNK> himself a tiny bit
<START> why can't this type of <UNK> entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century it keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way the cast is a great ensemble william powell <UNK> true star quality who knows perhaps he was <UNK> for his future as nick charles he is a joy to watch one also can see why eugene <UNK> made more than 200 films he is a great supporting character actor and his excellent chemistry with powell is fun to watch mary <UNK> does above average work in a not very <UNK> role all other hands chip in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes i suspect michael <UNK> had a ball directing his one bravo
<START> if you didn't live in the 90's or didn't listen to <UNK> ever this movie might be ok for you but any for any fan or any single person who ever listened to rap this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where i said thats interesting or i didn't know that another thing that <UNK> me was it made it look like anything in his life he did was very easy there was no struggle he made jail look easy selling drugs and even <UNK> it wasn't realistic i think if the movie where released in about 15 years from now it might have more of an impact maybe good rap movies <UNK> and flow get rich or die trying not notorious
<START> forget the campy <UNK> movies that have <UNK> the television film market this movie has a real feel to it while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws it also has that message of forgiveness and overall good morals however i did not like the lighting in this movie for a movie dealing with such subject matter it was too bright i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie which is almost an unforgivable sin but the recognizable cast and their performances <UNK> this <UNK> br br definitely worth seeing buy the dvd
<START> meaning if this movie got pitched scripted made released promoted as something halfway respectable given the constraints yeah i know springer sex violence where is he br br reminded me of porn movies i saw in college plot and dialogue wise <UNK> just done something for the <UNK> porno market showed <UNK> and be done with it would have made more money the ultimate point of this exercise
<START> i enjoy a good slow moving drama christmas in august <UNK> express virgin stripped bare by her <UNK> the way home <UNK> in a small town <UNK> <UNK> eat drink man woman dolls in the mood for love and spring summer fall winter spring are all enjoyable films  just to name a few br br unfortunately there is a <UNK> of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the <UNK> of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves these are what i call ian films  incomprehensible artistic nonsense <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the king of this <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is his masterpiece in fact this is the <UNK> de la <UNK> of crap <UNK> garbage under the <UNK> of art people walk around in their apartments drink water <UNK> back and forth waiting for pay phones to become <UNK> hang posters <UNK> papers together go to the bathroom eat do <UNK> have sex slap at <UNK> etc i'm not joking when i say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film which is the quintessential <UNK> for pointless art house trash there is no plot no storyline no interesting or noteworthy events no emotion no meaningful dialogue and most importantly  no drama br br the most <UNK> scene has two people <UNK> on a bed with a person <UNK> underneath the <UNK>  ironic that it's also totally tasteless and gratuitous the relationship of the characters on the bed is practically non existent <UNK> apparently didn't feel like <UNK> anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to bang the person under the bed is just as one dimensional and uninteresting he likes to drink water <UNK> with <UNK> and stroke himself this is <UNK> idea of character development a truly misguided entertainer indeed br br <UNK> true contribution in <UNK> <UNK> is perhaps the most atrocious scene in art house film history he first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for <UNK> <UNK> seconds only to then show her cry hysterically  for absolutely no reason whatsoever  for another <UNK> <UNK> seconds the film then abruptly ends no point no entertainment just pure concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer br br in an effort to beat a dead horse the underlying theme of loneliness is <UNK> so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom in fact <UNK> kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film <UNK> and guess what it's actually interesting that film moved as slow as <UNK> in january but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a perfect example of that br br fans of cinema may thank <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for directing this film as he has provided <UNK> evidence that art house cinema can be just as poorly made as b grade made for television horror flicks art house <UNK> have now officially lost their <UNK> of self <UNK> the quality level of your precious genre now <UNK> films like army of darkness and  gasp  <UNK> how do you like them <UNK>
<START> steve biko was a black <UNK> who tried to resist the white minority <UNK> south africa in much the same way as gandhi tried to resist the british <UNK> <UNK> in india richard <UNK> film cry freedom is not about biko or apartheid as much as it is about donald woods the white liberal newspaper editor who <UNK> his life trying to tell <UNK> story the film has a jarring point of view switch after biko dies in prison from <UNK> behavior at the hands of south african police woods played by kevin kline must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to <UNK> books about biko or allow his wife played by penelope <UNK> to pressure him into forgetting about the books in that case biko dies in vain what begins as a life changing friendship between biko and woods <UNK> into a standard by the numbers escape over the border yarn after <UNK> death oscar nominated denzel washington is good in only his fourth film as biko but something is wrong in a film that tries to depict the struggles of apartheid by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half the film attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on <UNK> rise to <UNK> instead of beginning where biko <UNK> woods perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1 2 hour film wasn't exactly <UNK> to big box office but the film was a tremendous box office flop anyway film politics aside the film still entertains and sends a message or two albeit in pg <UNK> fashion of 4 stars
<START> good grief while i still maintain that <UNK> the hands of fate is the worst piece of mental torture available hobgoblins came awfully close this this thing insults the audience at every opportunity br br at least films like space <UNK> and future war can be enjoyed on mst3k this one was a struggle to get through i was literally <UNK> on the couch in anguish this thing managed to embarrass me alone br br even if you are a die hard mst3k fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment think twice about seeing this one br br it's that bad
<START> its time to pay tribute to the great <UNK> heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one his other films of a past generation were ben <UNK> the ten <UNK> <UNK> man and planet of the apes were his better works br br this film made in 1973 attempts to <UNK> a future earth in <UNK> that is so <UNK> that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called soylent green which is <UNK> with human flesh this bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes <UNK> population which would be about 2 billion by that stage would be then meat <UNK> without knowing it br br charlton <UNK> character this <UNK> secret international conspiracy that world powers have <UNK> to meet the <UNK> demands of <UNK> by using <UNK> br br unfortunately for the producers of this film the green message they deliver is not the <UNK> party of today's <UNK> thank god <UNK> was <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> in new zealand <UNK> and <UNK> up until only 40 years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilization br br another silly <UNK> in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical <UNK> which was on the rise in 1972 when this film was made br br the film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very <UNK> last film performance by the late and great edward g robinson but still no a valid reason to <UNK> the film other than for academic reasons br br this is a dud of a film and i wouldn't even recommend it to baby <UNK> or charlton heston fans all the other reviews of this film i have read all sound the same referring to a <UNK> society in the future of which the <UNK> theme only seems to involve the usa in which an <UNK> disaster has occurred br br the only merit in the film is that earth does face <UNK>
<START> i like this film a lot it has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is pretty universal the story of the <UNK> son the aspect i like the best however was the way that the bath house was more than just a background for the story as the father told the son the story of his wife's family in the northern <UNK> of china the element of water and bathing becomes an almost sacred ritual water was so <UNK> that a simple bath had profound depth and meaning br br overall the film was very effective there were moments however when it <UNK> on too sweet <UNK> on <UNK> during the park <UNK> scene but overall i highly recommend this film
<START> sure i've seen bad movies in my life but this one was so bad that i actually became angry in the theater i wanted my money back i wrote to the director asking him to <UNK> my movie ticket of course i didn't receive a <UNK> or even a <UNK> but it's the point that matters on a scale of 1 10 i give this movie a <UNK> why did the <UNK> chevy <UNK> stop running from being hit with a bat why did they hit the <UNK> chevy <UNK> with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the <UNK> skull the plot was thin the movie filled with obvious clichés and certain parts of it just didn't make any sense
<START> i have seen this movie a while back after <UNK> it for my friend who is a big dominic <UNK> fan the movie itself was very interesting though it had its positive points which for me was the <UNK> <UNK> kind of wtf factor after the movie had ended br br of course with positive also come negative points to me the young girl in the film was incredibly good and dominic <UNK> did a good job as well unfortunately i don't have this opinion about daniel burke who played <UNK> this might just be me and i'm not claiming to be a serious critic in the way that i don't find myself skilled enough but he just didn't seem convincing as an actor but perhaps it's even more striking then for although i am not a critic this does get my attention br br to conclude over all i think it's definitely a film worth watching it's interesting confusing and you just should have seen it
<START> simon pegg plays the part of sidney young a young entertainment writer who has begun the <UNK> of a career writing for a <UNK> magazine that <UNK> in <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of the rich and famous he is making a career out of <UNK> celebrities although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself the movie is based on the very bizarre career of toby young who also ran a small magazine in britain called the modern review which offered <UNK> criticism of pretty much everything imaginable until he closed the magazine in a <UNK> of verbal bullets with his co editor and then went on to a spectacularly failed career as a writer for vanity fair which is pretty much the part of his life told in this movie br br he is at first thrilled to go work for a major <UNK> called <UNK> magazine in the movie and despite active nerves he is positively <UNK> on his first day he meets the chief editor <UNK> <UNK> played by jeff bridges who is hard as nails but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be for a goof off like young to keep his job at the magazine he offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of young but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of <UNK> off the wall antics and inappropriate behavior br br much of the comedy in the movie is derived from <UNK> <UNK> of or indifference to the generally accepted code of public behavior and the peculiar <UNK> involved in dealing with the rich and famous but <UNK> reasons for acting in such a weird way and for giving <UNK> offensive interviews is because he believes that he <UNK> the entire celebrity culture and it would seem he believes in that age old saying  <UNK> you can't beat 'em join <UNK> then beat 'em br br <UNK> matters are two very different women there is a charming regular girl at the magazine named alison olsen kirsten dunst who at first is appalled by <UNK> obvious arrogance and <UNK> ways and a stunning model named sophie <UNK> fox who represents the celebrity culture needless to say <UNK> endless attack of <UNK> and stardom is a superficial lust for sophie the one with the look of a star br br sophie is stunningly beautiful it's true but also comes across as having not a single thought <UNK> around in her head alison is a regular girl not very interesting or attractive but <UNK> performance makes her a real person a relationship with her would have all the reality of a britney spears marriage and yet the movie <UNK> some level of believability because despite how obvious this is we also feel <UNK> pain in not pursuing her i felt it anyway br br how to lose friends and alienate people has a pretty interesting premise and is full of honest satisfactory performances and although it turns into a bit of your standard romantic comedy by the third act it has a variety of well developed and interesting characters danny huston for example gives us a great performance as <UNK> other love interest who pays homage to the big <UNK> also starring bridges with his ever present white russian one of my personal favorite drinks buying absolute and <UNK> here in china costs the equivalent of about <UNK> but my kitchen is never without them br br i am looking forward to the day when simon pegg will branch out a little bit because i love his films but i am completely unsure about his range he played a serious character in hot <UNK> but only serious in relation to the <UNK> surrounding him and ultimately went back to being himself again which he has pretty much been in shaun of the dead run fat boy run and now how to lose friends he's a rising star it will be interesting to see what else he can do
<START> jean <UNK> career began with his <UNK> answer to a prize question civilization makes us evil this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films society is real identity is a construction freedom is criminal here the idea is treated literally both main characters find themselves and each other only when breaking rules this discovery may well hold true in france at any rate it's quite romantic
<START> once again like charlie's angels inspector gadget and thunderbirds a tv series is turned into a full length film and gets ruined for all the hundreds of people that watched basically the duke cousins luke johnny <UNK> and bo <UNK> william scott in hazzard county spend a lot of time driving very fast in the general lee but they need to get their act together and stop their family farm being destroyed along with almost the whole town by nasty <UNK> davis <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nominated burt reynolds to make way for a huge coal mine they get help along the way from their sexy cousin daisy <UNK> nominated jessica simpson and uncle jesse willie nelson while being chased by equally mean sheriff <UNK> p <UNK> <UNK> m c <UNK> and the police also starring joe don baker as <UNK> jim <UNK> jack <UNK> as deputy <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> michael <UNK> as deputy <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> carter as pauline i think the only reason i give the film an extra star is because of a couple of impressive car stunts and of course the gorgeous body of simpson i'll admit her legs aren't quite catherine bach but still but besides that it is pretty boring it was nominated the <UNK> for worst picture worst director for jay <UNK> worst remake or sequel worst screen couple for simpson her daisy dukes and worst screenplay pretty poor
<START> simply put this is a simplistic and one dimensional film the title the rise to evil should tell you that this isn't going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with hitler's character rather from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background we are given a view of hitler that presents his as a <UNK> <UNK> seemingly ripped right out of a saturday morning tv show the film really wants to make its case that hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that hitler was evil ultimately making him such a one <UNK> evil character is both boring and confusing one must ask how the inept <UNK> character in the film cold ever <UNK> a nation to follow him or be named <UNK> man of the year this film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century and try to delve into his mind instead it basically just says hey hitler was evil just thought you might like to know over and over again the great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character give me a break
<START> i saw this film it's english title is who's singing over there at the 1980 <UNK> international film festival it won <UNK> then and disappeared a terrible shame it is brilliant sublime ridiculous sad and extremely funny the script is a work of art it's been 19 years and i've seen only a handful of comedies or any other genre for that matter that can match its originality
<START> scarface has a major cult following even now 22 years after its release br br it has also been widely criticized as being very tacky <UNK> over the top and all <UNK> up these are people who compare scarface to the godfather movies it is true that on the technical front cinematography screenplay direction etc scarface is way behind 'the <UNK> br br but it is also true that what scarface has and some other gangster movies lack is the <UNK> the sheer crude approach of the gangsters the latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished italian or irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'the <UNK> or <UNK> this is one of the major winning points of scarface and i strongly believe that this fact has been written off as <UNK> by most critics i have seen the original 1932 scarface and i must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of <UNK> the original over the remake br br al pacino has been criticized to be over the top and loud in this movie but how about considering that that is precisely the way the film makers wanted tony <UNK> character to be he is this angry young man who takes <UNK> decisions and throws fits of <UNK> every other minute he is not the calm michael <UNK> here he is tony montana a very tacky <UNK> individual who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time br br there is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie the soundtrack is all 80s i love some of the songs including <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it to the <UNK> and the title track <UNK> br br there are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences including the famous chainsaw scene the <UNK> hit the first meeting with <UNK> and tony's visit to his mother's br br about the performances al pacino is brilliant as the angry cuban <UNK> he has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing tony montana the most in his entire career and it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes one wonders what scarface would be like without pacino i just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying tony montana and in all <UNK> the film wouldn't be as effective without him br br steven bauer shines as tony's friend <UNK> br br robert <UNK> is wonderful as tony's boss lopez so is f murray abraham as omar in a small role br br then there is some eye candy in the form of elvira played by michelle pfeiffer she looks beautiful and is adequate in her role br br the director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax without revealing anything i would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to <UNK> handling br br scarface is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out enjoy it for what it is a raw portrayal of the drug <UNK> and their <UNK>
<START> i don't think a movie like this would be released today it takes it's time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isn't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat br br but what this film does have an interesting study in how <UNK> deal with grief how when the language for healing and over coming tremendous loss leaves us mute and we rely on raw emotions instead grief without reason and patience is anger even hate and unfortunately the lead character a young boy who <UNK> shoots and kills his brother while hunting in the film is given more than his fair share of it he eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather <UNK> <UNK> who makes it clear to him that it was an accident i got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart but needed to hear those words from his parents and to receive their forgiveness br br what i loved about this film the lack of dialog there was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction facial expressions and the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors something we don't get to do alot of with today's films br br
<START> for the first three seasons sabrina was a gem hidden away on <UNK> and later early school day afternoon reruns each episode had a maniac zany energy and rapid fire pacing that <UNK> the occasional awkward joke melissa joan hart <UNK> a keen talent for physical comedy particularly in her facial expressions her two aunts playing the straight men or as straight as two witches could be had great comic timing and general chemistry with hart <UNK> as a talking cat was free to <UNK> in whatever mad scheme he was interested in and one could laugh and take it all in <UNK> because he was after all a talking cat <UNK> friends rounded out the social experience at school in which also <UNK> the typical evil <UNK> and <UNK> principal perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to <UNK> pop culture e g bands of the era jerry springer <UNK> human condition morality e g the importance of friendship the spirit of christmas and the literal representation of such related <UNK> in the magical realm unfortunately like so many other shows throughout the age of television the show hit its peak during the first three years which <UNK> with sabrina attending high school starting in season four the move to college marked what would become a <UNK> decline in the general quality of the show particularly when the writers chose to introduce josh as <UNK> rival and <UNK> thin excuses for aunts <UNK> and <UNK> to remain on screen as key players the final season where sabrina works at a pop culture magazine was <UNK> disappointing still in the end sabrina particularly the high school years remains a unique entry as a hybrid <UNK> comedy with magical elements that <UNK> it above the tiresome fare that is produced in this genre every year
<START> i will start by saying that this has <UNK> be <UNK> by just about everyone the fact is it wasn't what anyone was expecting especially from guy ritchie what everyone was expecting was cockney <UNK> and good one liners do ya like <UNK> etc but this is far more mature than his previous works i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder this film demands all your attention look past the cool and dazzling look of the film try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more <UNK> understanding of the whole film br br yes this has its influences from modern classics fight club pulp fiction etc but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his <UNK> masterpieces
<START> sentimental and naive but undeniably affecting emotional man helping man <UNK> in this case <UNK> as german and french <UNK> forced to be closed off from each other after the great war thanks to a new border leading to <UNK> on the german side as the french are the bosses but when a fire begins on the french side the common decency of the german men lead to assistance safety and even friendship this was a <UNK> that would fall on deaf ears within the decade as a certain man from <UNK> own side would break that piece and turn the great war into merely a <UNK> but it is obvious to me that <UNK> really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental <UNK> as this film <UNK> with this optimism whereas his more <UNK> cynical adaptation of the <UNK> opera lacked the bite needed to make that work work also <UNK> his honest belief are the fact that the characters here are not simplistic <UNK> for positions but real people with real families whose home lives we are <UNK> to as well these are ordinary working class men who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating right your fellow man and in this day of <UNK> <UNK> i'll take a little <UNK> in my plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that i think we can all <UNK> to br br note apparently the ending is cut on most <UNK> where the french <UNK> the mining gate closing off the men once again this is a brutal turn of events and may have made the film a better overall film but i would have <UNK> it <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of the final sequence so in short i'm glad it was <UNK> grade 8 10 b 7 of 11 of 1931
<START> the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between but the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable br br but <UNK> allen really <UNK> in the movie her voice was so <UNK> and sexy the scenes in the bed involving <UNK> should have <UNK> but she made it so watchable and <UNK> than any one could do <UNK> really is one of the best in such roles she also <UNK> quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes which is the interesting part of the movie br br burt reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star he could have chosen a better script than this <UNK> think he did for money
<START> yes that's right it is i firmly believe that the <UNK> and the weird looking <UNK> were both designed just so this game could be made it was amazing the first time i saw it with its huge <UNK> and colorful characters and its amazing now the play control is perfect the graphics are beautiful and it has that <UNK> charm that is always so <UNK> but undeniably there a must have for any <UNK> owner and a reason to get an <UNK> for everyone else
<START> this movie has a great message a impressive cast ellen <UNK> samantha <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was 4 years old when she made this movie ellen <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> have both been nominated for best actress in a tv drama at the up coming emmy awards in new york peter masterson director has been nominated best director tv drama at the emmy awards also april 1 2001 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> best actress in a tv drama at the young artist awards in studio city <UNK> i can see why they have 3 nominations mermaid is a true story during the <UNK> they have the real family on the set something you don't see often you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores do watch it you'll be glad you did
<START> this is possibly the worst <UNK> sword fighting movie ever made that is not just because the so called sports <UNK> is poor but because the plot characters are so weak that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and later supposed group dancing around a <UNK> scene in the <UNK> club trying i suppose to maintain audience interest what a waste of f murray <UNK> talents you're better served with overblown <UNK> movies like zorro <UNK> anything that has basil <UNK> as the villain as a <UNK> myself i recognize the near <UNK> of capturing <UNK> as a sport on film but if it ever happens it's got to have <UNK> better drawn characters and a plot with more depth
<START> i am a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this was playing at the cinema i couldn't help myself i wanted to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in g b which is unique among allen's work along with what seems to be his new <UNK> scarlett <UNK> scoop is much lighter than <UNK> and the humor is <UNK> most enjoyable aspect the plot revolves around <UNK> character a <UNK> student who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave she falls in love with a suspected serial killer jackman and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by allen br br i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed <UNK> performance but i am a bit bias i could watch a three hour film with <UNK> in ever frame and remain enchanted she plays a <UNK> <UNK> bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allen's stereotypical <UNK> stricken character she adds appropriate body language for comic effect needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find <UNK> character <UNK> cute and that is a plus br br allen is allen he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the neurotic little <UNK> again however he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late br br jackman is also enjoyable as the suave millionaire murder suspect i cannot say that jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less br br in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh in fact it stinks of curse of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and allen are more detective like than anything however i must applaud allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical <UNK> hollywood version of this film instead of everything being black and white things are painted in shades of gray being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does <UNK> guilt though the plot seemed old woody still has a knack for one liners i did find his <UNK> to his last film interesting come for the humor laugh and be merry br br needless to say if you enjoy allen's work watch it if not watch something else
<START> i saw this movie a million years 5 years to be exact ago for the first the time in the light of recent events with the australian woman <UNK> <UNK> being imprisoned in <UNK> for so called <UNK> pot i decided to watch this movie again i <UNK> to cry my heart out 'cause i'm sucker for hot girls in need just read my review of 'the stalking of laurie <UNK> some <UNK> escaped my eyes but it were hardly <UNK> filled with tears why not because the two <UNK> weren't utterly <UNK> and helpless not because the movie wasn't heartbreaking at the sight of these two kids in the prime of their live locked up in almost <UNK> conditions why then why did i not cry i wanted to cry when i rent a movie like this i except to be moved to <UNK> like there's no tomorrow to feel miserable and like it this movie was simply too short to do this it was just like the script was reduced to the main plot elements and while doing this the psychological aspect was thrown aside <UNK> danes and kate beckinsale did an excellent job portraying the emotions of the two friends but this movie just screamed for more footage of these girls in their depressing and <UNK> surroundings the mental journey is missing here for some reason you only get to see the key moments of it which are very touching i admit probably because of bad editing sometimes i felt these girls were walking around in a <UNK> the relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention what's up with the relationships between the girls and the parents especially between alice and her dad you catch a glimpse of it but the film doesn't quite offer the whole picture sadly enough br br nonetheless this was a great movie and at the end i even had to bite my lip a bit but i guess this has more to do with the acting skills and the looks of the actresses and the music then with the merit of the director to be honest i hardly knew who kate beckinsale was before i watched this movie again now i am a fan great movie as long as you don't expect it to be classic cinema
<START> i am sorry to say that it was one of the worst films i've ever seen although visually fascinating e g the use of colour was absolutely stunning it was pretty boring and disturbing see the father son incest br br what's more music is totally absent and if you think of those wonderful <UNK> by michael <UNK> who wrote the <UNK> for most of <UNK> films then you can imagine what a difference it makes br br
<START> i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor i <UNK> found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts her character's rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian <UNK> company from <UNK> <UNK> flying a canadian designed and built twin <UNK> aircraft the trip had been turned down by the us <UNK> navy and coast guard as beyond their <UNK> the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i admit i had some <UNK> when i first saw the previews for this film was <UNK> 1 <UNK> on hollow ground here i mean harris and quinn don't really look or even sound like john or paul but i have to admit this film really surprised me it's far from the exploitation film i expected instead it's a character study a low key whimsical and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship and the ultimate lesson we all learn it's hard if not impossible to capture what we once had and what has passed us by
<START> i have not seen this movie in ages but figured i'd comment on it anyway mostly because the memory of <UNK> it so <UNK> is burned into my memory cells the original the <UNK> was no prize to begin with but at least had the <UNK> of being 1 a sam <UNK> movie 2 featured steve mcqueen ben johnson and slim <UNK> 3 was a relatively <UNK> way to blow away an hour and a half of time br br by comparison the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot alec baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife kim basinger mcqueen and his then wife <UNK> <UNK> also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the <UNK> at their marriage <UNK> arguing over who's stupid idea it was to make this movie br br let's just get it said and out of the way alec baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the <UNK> king and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on <UNK> part to presume to challenge our memory of steve mcqueen in the lead role like someone else points out <UNK> 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action adventure heist genre by contrast baldwin <UNK> company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone with only michael <UNK> and james <UNK> slimy <UNK> villain characters coming off as real people br br the movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words one viewing was more than enough not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how <UNK> it was made <UNK> movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood where this version is a <UNK> that takes too long to amount to little or nothing there's no artistic urgency to it's existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy br br so i don't know this was probably one of the films that helped to <UNK> the wave of pointless artistically vapid big budget remakes <UNK> up around a then name brand actor actress which in itself isn't a really good thing i'd always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie fall flat with something original this movie just made me want to pull my <UNK> out and it's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it's release mr baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest <UNK> in hollywood thank god for team america for putting him in his place br br 3 10
<START> ever watched it deals so gently and subtly not only with aids which is only <UNK> and gay life but also with old age dying and death it's a deep and beautiful movie also visually of a very special director highly <UNK>
<START> hardly a masterpiece not so well written beautiful cinematography i think not this movie wasn't too terrible but it wasn't that much better than average the main story dealing with highly <UNK> teens should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was should have really gotten into it instead of <UNK> the surface with basically because mom says we can't some parts should have been dropped altogether or <UNK> to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters couple times i was wondering if the writer director was a fan of george <UNK> classic american <UNK> not that it's wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that i mean come on worst part of this was that <UNK> <UNK> had such a small part i mean double come on she was the only one in one or two lines who actually tried a southern accent take a good listen it was there even though her character was from california <UNK> maybe if she was the star others could have followed and we would have had a more <UNK> sounding movie oh well what can ya do when you have a director who's just a director and not an artist also too bad overall i give this a b and that's being a little generous 'cause i'm partial to ms <UNK>
<START> another norman <UNK> hit <UNK> the problems that african americans had to go through in the <UNK> 1960s and 1970s br br with esther <UNK> and husband along with 3 children living in a chicago high rise project in a <UNK> black neighborhood the show depicted what black people were going through with a <UNK> black agent mr <UNK> as well as <UNK> and the day to day problems of just existing br br the 3 children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently from the comical <UNK> to the <UNK> ralph carter to their daughter who also <UNK> to <UNK> success this show was a perfect description of african american life
<START> that was the first thing that <UNK> to mind as i watched the closing credits to europa make there was across the screen never in my entire life have i seen a film of such technical genius the visuals of europa are so impressive that any film i watch in it's wake will only pale in comparison forget your michael bay <UNK> scott slick hollywood cinematography europa has more <UNK> beauty than anything those two could <UNK> up in a million years now i'd be the first to <UNK> lars von trier a genius just off the back of his films breaking the waves and dancer in the dark but this is stupid the fact that europa has gone un noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like <UNK> tiger hidden dragon and life is beautiful clean up at the academy awards but what do the know europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and until recently any british tv channels br br the visuals in europa are not mtv <UNK> it's not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance <UNK> style much like his first film the element of crime von trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like element the film begins with the main character or in the case of europa we the audience being <UNK> as we move down the tracks the voice of the narrator max von <UNK> counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in europa this allows von trier and his three <UNK> to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the <UNK> who will be colour von trier is trying to show us how much <UNK> the <UNK> item or person has over the plot for instance it's no surprise that the first shot of leopold <UNK> jean marc <UNK> is in colour since he is the only character who's actions have <UNK> over the film br br the performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von trier films but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jean marc <UNK> in the lead role whose blind <UNK> is slowly warn down by the two <UNK> sides until he <UNK> in the films final act again <UNK> like the element of crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von <UNK> to seal his fate europa is a tremendous film and i cant help thinking what a shame that von trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes his dedication to composition and <UNK> en scene is <UNK> not to mention his use of sound and production design but since his no <UNK> <UNK> turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent 10 10
<START> for columbo fans such as myself this is the episode of episodes that made a case for why columbo was so popular and just how good it really was ruth gordon has a field day as ever playing the <UNK> intelligent crime novelist <UNK> mitchell seems <UNK> calls her nephew in law to sign some papers making him her heir she never got over her <UNK> death and is convinced her dead <UNK> husband charles frank did the dirty deed to tell more would be <UNK> <UNK> hartley has a sly role as <UNK> personal assistant this episode of columbo is in a class by itself it's a truly well made television movie i recommend it most highly
<START> i barely remember this show a little but i remembered it was great my <UNK> brother reminded me about the show recently and i had seen an <UNK> for the d v d set coming out the network again screwed up in pulling this from the air so that they could put what else in it's place it should have gone at least 3 seasons why not right i think sometimes that the network executives think they are the <UNK> of the entertainment world but they <UNK> guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time let it be said that they have a lot more <UNK> than <UNK> this was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line up anyhow i am getting this for my collection
<START> last weekend i bought this <UNK> <UNK> from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of land of the dead br br boy was i wrong br br it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover art which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre br br we watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some <UNK> who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car i couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore br br some people actually consider this a so bad it's good movie they are <UNK> i didn't finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through br br this is even worse than <UNK> do not watch
<START> brutal <UNK> michael myers stabs his sister to death at age six on halloween night in 1963 on october 30 1978 he escapes from a mental institution and <UNK> a new reign of terror in his hometown of <UNK> <UNK> he is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist donald <UNK> who knows just how evil this young man is br br it opens with a bang and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric <UNK> that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire it's subtle compared to the nasty <UNK> many of those subsequent movies were subtle and scary it <UNK> the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewings how many movies are there really that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them before not very many br br <UNK> is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career jamie lee curtis in her motion picture debut became a <UNK> <UNK> scream queen after acting in halloween as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures and she is an intended victim worth rooting for br br co writer director john carpenter knows what works in this movie making excellent use of shadows and dark <UNK> notice how most of the movie is set after <UNK> with this picture he and his former <UNK> debra hill created a franchise that has <UNK> seven sequels many <UNK> and an upcoming re imagining br br it's very <UNK> who could ever forget dr <UNK> <UNK> speech in which he describes michael myers to the sheriff charles <UNK> a reliable <UNK> player in several of carpenter's earlier works br br it's fantastic and worth seeking out this is my favorite john carpenter movie of all time br br it's not totally <UNK> there are script holes after all but overall it makes a solid impact br br 9 10
<START> ok i didn't have high expectations but this film <UNK> into depths i could not imagine br br the plot as it were involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the <UNK> of the order by a sin eater the sin eater allows for <UNK> to <UNK> salvation outside the authority of the church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of <UNK> <UNK> that this makes no sense since then a <UNK> could give you salvation we'll move on br br i'll <UNK> the plot w o giving much away the priest goes to rome with his buddy to <UNK> he brings with him a mental patient i'm not making this up who shot him during an <UNK> and who loves him not one <UNK> of this btw is explained a drunk irish priest and peter <UNK> as a <UNK> they get to rome find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film meet with a bondage gear s m anti <UNK> that the drunk irish guy knows not explained and who gives information by killing people oh btw he's a bad guy so he has an industrial <UNK> soundtrack and then <UNK> seriously i'm not sure the plot <UNK> about heath chills with the sin eater flies to new york with the sin eater for an <UNK> and then some other stuff happens and then all off camera the anti <UNK> falls and the film ends br br about 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened by the end something has happened but you can't be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the <UNK> or off <UNK> you're really feeling cheated
<START> paula i may be a bitch but i'll never be a butch br br a hilarious line in an otherwise rather tiresome skin flick which features a pretty honey in <UNK> walker but that's about all this <UNK> a real <UNK> who <UNK> her boyfriends co workers and even her lesbian roommate paula into her bedroom but then turns into a <UNK> job who cries rape and calls for the police br br the <UNK> personality of this <UNK> c t is interesting for maybe a little while but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive one note affair at least the ending is worth the wait for those who will still care by that time
<START> vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career i am not too keen in romantic movies these days because i see them as old wine in a new bottle and so predictable however i have watched this movie three times now and believe me it's an awesome movie br br vivah goes back to the traditional route displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do or would do when it comes to marriage in that sense <UNK> r <UNK> has done his <UNK> well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well made highly entertaining movie br br several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately br br when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride amrita <UNK> the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family the song <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> goes well with the mood of this scene br br the first conversation between shahid and amrita when he comes to see her i e a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation also <UNK> naive nature limited eye contact shy characteristics and answering <UNK> to <UNK> questions br br the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle <UNK> <UNK> when she <UNK> him at <UNK> party in the form of <UNK> daughter in law rather than her <UNK> beloved niece br br clearly the movie belongs to amrita <UNK> all the way the actress portrays the role of <UNK> with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly br br shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a <UNK> r <UNK> film in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on screen couple without a shadow of doubt other characters <UNK> <UNK> excellent <UNK> <UNK> brilliant <UNK> <UNK> very good br br on the whole vivah delivers what it promised a well made and realistic story of two families the movie has top notch performances excellent story and great music to suit the film as well as being directed by the fabulous <UNK> r <UNK> it's a must see
<START> the <UNK> of lou was a major disappointment for me i had received an e mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie it was neither great nor inspirational the cinematography was pretty <UNK> with the whole movie a lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldn't tell at times what they were about the voices were often distorted for no reason also many of the people in the movie were far fetched the relationship he has with his ex son is never made clear also the whole movie has most him one way and then all of a sudden <UNK> he is <UNK> and inspiring people the whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life making him live his life the way that he is living it but when he changes he doesn't leave boxing he teaches others how to box thumbs down
<START> in the barbarian and the geisha john wayne plays <UNK> harris a real <UNK> from the united states who was responsible for truly opening up japan to international relations in the late <UNK> before him <UNK> perry basically pushed into japan with <UNK> and forced a <UNK> upon the japanese in <UNK> harris who arrived just a bit later worked through the details and helped ensure <UNK> as many of the japanese felt no particular <UNK> to honor the first <UNK> all this is true and shown in the film according to some other sources i found the romance between harris and a japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film hence the title br br my first reaction the first time i saw this movie was one of surprise john wayne as a <UNK> when he's being <UNK> in most films he says please and thank you as he <UNK> people so seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the <UNK> game seemed very odd indeed in fact i can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role by the way i've seen photos of harris and wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all br br however despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting the film is still very watchable the color cinematography is nice the film shows some nice insights into japanese customs and culture and the acting isn't bad all in all a likable and watchable film despite it's odd casting br br ps read through the trivia for this film you find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between wayne and the director john huston where wayne apparently knocked him out based on what i've read about huston and the way he got along with actors this is an incident i tend to believe and it's also a nice example of john wayne <UNK>
<START> many many spoilers in this review this movie was horrible i am a huge baseball fan so i thought i'd watch it and i was very disappointed it started out okay when i saw the bad influence deniro had on his young son i was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something anyways at the beginning it seemed as if deniro was supposed to be the protagonist he was the only one that believed in bobby and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of which gave me a reason to feel bad for him he wanted to help bobby by talking to <UNK> when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs <UNK> to death not to mention that <UNK> <UNK> song i want to you at random <UNK> moments br br later when deniro saves <UNK> son from drowning i was hoping that the movie could redeem itself he could forgive himself for killing <UNK> if he saved <UNK> son but of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie because all he cares about is getting credit for the murder and does so by stealing <UNK> son car and dog and holding them hostage bobby just has to hit a home run and <UNK> that deniro is a true fan while displaying a picture of him biting a knife br br now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end it is <UNK> like hell and we are expected to believe that the game hasn't been called then deniro somehow magically appears on the field in an <UNK> suit and calls bobby out at home <UNK> to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field there are seemingly no officers on the field but the police are on their way so deniro steps on the <UNK> and <UNK> to pitch a knife to bobby when he gets shot to death but don't worry this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending because bobby find his son br br this is not a sports movie it is not about a fan as far as i know fans are not <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> rob and throw knives at their <UNK> this is likely to be the <UNK> movie i will ever see in my life the plot was shallow the soundtrack sucked the movie had no purpose whatsoever i warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film
<START> the director sidney j <UNK> has created in hollow point a post modern <UNK> masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience br br sidney j <UNK> <UNK> to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> when you remove the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> br br the result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher br br one and a half stars br br p s nothing in this movie makes any sense the law <UNK> agents are flat out unlikeable and the <UNK> criminals are full on insane
<START> interesting characters lots of tension as close to black and white without being black and white i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character a quiet near deaf secretary was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist and set up someone to be <UNK> off as a <UNK> to her own get away i'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as <UNK> in this film we never know who's money it really is they <UNK> with or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing <UNK> too bad the film could have been great
<START> yes the plot is predictable yes there are a few plot holes yes it has a made for tv quality and yes britney spears wrote the book with obvious self promotion br br but forget all of that this movie is fun br br fun in an after school special sort of way but fun nevertheless br br virginia madsen as the mother does a great job so good that i'm going to start watching for her movies she reminded me of diane lane for all the good reasons br br the rest of the cast does a fine job too if i was a casting agent i'd be <UNK> some of these young actors br br the production values are above usual tv standards and the music was really great better than several big budget movies i've seen br br if you're in the mood for german noir this movie isn't for you if you want a safe fun and underrated movie this is a good one it's one you could show to your 10 year old daughter but enjoy it yourself too
<START> a very engaging documentary about scottish artist andy goldsworthy whose work consists mostly of <UNK> <UNK> made from elements from nature his work is made of rocks leaves grass ice etc that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field thus most of <UNK> works don't really last except as photos or films of what they were now one can argue that <UNK> works are a reflection of <UNK> or words to that effect but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art and at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter pretentious often mentally unstable people who live in <UNK> urban settings goldsworthy seems to be the opposite a stable <UNK> family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in scotland of course i'm sure those are the same reasons why he's <UNK> by some people on the art world who found his works <UNK> or superficial
<START> well what to say br br having seen the film i still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was v dodgy camera moves in the <UNK> at one point i had to look away from the screen i was feeling physically sick round and round and round you get the idea br br very very strange accents at many points those that should know know br br unless your getting in for free or being paid to watch it or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something then forget it
<START> it wasn't notable enough to be truly horrible it was just incredibly lame the story was not half bad but the execution was just horrendous br br to start with it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on it was just paced badly the dialog was so utterly un <UNK> just flat and boring br br and the characters <UNK> <UNK> they made <UNK> boring how the hell do you make <UNK> boring he wasn't even funny he wasn't crazy he was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly br br <UNK> was boring and since when did he have <UNK> to make the cards just <UNK> and fly around or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air and what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves i mean we know they are mutants but they still exist within the realm of physics a round bo staff is not a helicopter blade you cannot fly by <UNK> super <UNK> fast which <UNK> wouldn't be able to do anyway nor <UNK> especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreography br br and this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight <UNK> who know <UNK> they are doing and know better than to use it in every single shot as a replacement for real fight choreography br br three of the most physical fighters in marvel comics logan <UNK> and wilson and some of the worst fight choreography i have ever seen in recent film memory it was as if the stunt <UNK> just <UNK> his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guys br br and then you had the break out with all these mutants who did nothing even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers nice to see a <UNK> nod did f all when they got out only emma really lame for this film frost and <UNK> did something br br and since when was logan so pretty and the stupid the bullet will take his memory away don't you think <UNK> and the x men would have noticed the big freaking bullet holes in his <UNK> skull when they x <UNK> him in <UNK> i felt sorry for <UNK> <UNK> man he actually brought in a good <UNK> considering the script he made one of <UNK> more simple super villains feel real but he could not save the film from it's own epic <UNK> br br seriously this was <UNK> level of suck decent story good actors absolutely horrible execution
<START> knowing what to expect on the whole from a denzel washington performance quality integrity <UNK> <UNK> humour will prepare you for what to expect from his directorial debut much like robert de <UNK> a <UNK> tale antwone fisher delivers the moving drama of the life of a young man and the effects of key figures in his life much as in a <UNK> tale de niro played one of these key figures to the lead character himself a character was born to play but was too old too washington takes a similar role in this as the <UNK> <UNK> to the titular character a character that seems like he should be played by a washington from 20 years ago be thankful washington is too old to play antwone because if he had we would firstly be <UNK> of the wonderfully <UNK> and intelligently nuanced performance he gives as the navy <UNK> however more importantly we wouldn't get to see the superb we can only hope star making turn from derek luke in the title role inevitably the character comes across as <UNK> in <UNK> shape however you get the impression this is not just because washington directed it not that luke was trying to copy him but that luke is as genuinely powerful and thought provoking an actor as washington it took far too long for washington to receive the academy award he deserved for malcolm x philadelphia devil in a blue dress and the <UNK> let us hope that luke does not have to wait so long also a great piece of casting was joy <UNK> as <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> while the part could have been a forgettable support or a standard <UNK> role <UNK> <UNK> it with life tender and intelligent the role <UNK> stereotyping with <UNK> <UNK> it and she makes the part significant and interesting it doesn't hurt either that <UNK> is possibly the most attractive woman you'll see on celluloid this year the smile alone could <UNK> the <UNK> heart acting ability and looks why isn't this woman in everything being made right now providing good support in a small role in <UNK> richardson as <UNK> wife <UNK> saying more with a silence or look than many hollywood actresses can manage in an entire film she informs the audience of the entire <UNK> long before any exposition occurs as for <UNK> directing as i said it is the directing equivalent of his acting taking the story of a man few viewers will have heard of and making it genuinely interesting is a difficult feat which washington achieves with <UNK> the film is neither rushed nor <UNK> but it never feels slow or dull it is <UNK> and nuanced <UNK> the humour and drama perfectly antwone fisher may not blow you away if you like big explosive <UNK> hollywood films but for those who appreciate a finely crafted character piece with excellent performances and steady well handled direction this is for you
<START> i'm easily entertained i enjoyed hot shots and the naked gun and their many sequels even when most people found them unbearable i've even managed to enjoy most <UNK> shore movies there is only one movie that i've seen that i can honestly say was bad and this was it it's been a while since i've seen it but i do remember sitting in the theater thinking this is a dumb movie why did i see this it's honestly the only movie that i cannot recommend
<START> terribly underrated with matt dillon and tom <UNK> good backdrop for solid story and some memorable lines well acted and well cast tommy lee jones and bruce dern make you hate them with passion
<START> as a <UNK> film the lady with red hair the story of how director producer playwright david <UNK> transformed notorious society <UNK> mrs leslie carter into an international stage star is certainly not in a league with that other <UNK> biopic of similar vintage <UNK> <UNK> dandy what is but lady is an enjoyable film in its own right and shares quite a few traits in common with the cagney classic br br like <UNK> <UNK> dandy the lady with red hair <UNK> over with old time show business flavor among other things both films feature delicious theatrical <UNK> house sequences as well as the inevitable scenes set <UNK> and in theatrical <UNK> <UNK> also in lady as in the <UNK> biopic the supporting cast is made up of familiar and beloved character actors of the period all doing the sort of top notch work we remember them for br br need i add that again like <UNK> <UNK> dandy the lady with red hair doesn't let the truth get in the way of telling a good story but also like dandy lady does manage <UNK> to convey the <UNK> of its show business giant hero's larger than life personality everyone knows that cagney <UNK> <UNK> for all time in his brilliant and <UNK> portrayal in <UNK> <UNK> dandy but few <UNK> realize that claude <UNK> did a similar service for david <UNK> in the lady with red hair and did it with a <UNK> that almost equals <UNK> br br <UNK> as <UNK> perfectly captures that legendary <UNK> <UNK> personality in all its <UNK> glory <UNK> gives a tremendously enjoyable superbly observed and remarkably true to life performance as the man all broadway once called the wizard to watch claude <UNK> in action looking in every shot as if he's having a <UNK> good time in the lady with red hair is to see david <UNK> leap to life on film as if he can't wait to shake things up on the main <UNK> once again br br
<START> blank check is one of those kids movies that could have been a great suspense thriller for the kids but instead it's a tired lame home alone ripoff that isn't worth a dime <UNK> is a criminal who just escaped from jail and gets his hidden million dollars from a big score and then we meet preston a frustrated kid whose room is taken over by his brothers to start a business and obviously dad treats his brothers better because they make money the same day he goes to a kid's birthday party and since his dad is a <UNK> he goes on little kids rides while the other kids go on roller <UNK> then he receives a birthday card and a check of 11 bucks how cheap is this family so he goes to the bank to open an account and meets the gorgeous <UNK> stanley were her parents <UNK> fans he finds out he needs 200 to open a account meanwhile <UNK> gives his million to his <UNK> friend and finds out the bills are marked so he will send a <UNK> named juice to get the <UNK> ones when preston leaves his bike gets run over by <UNK> he's about to write a check when he spots the cops and <UNK> back home his parents <UNK> him about his <UNK> up bike and gets grounded what their kid got almost run over and they worried about a bike so preston <UNK> a million dollar check via his computer and comes back only to be <UNK> to the <UNK> thinking that he's juice he gives preston the money but the real juice came and realized they been <UNK> by a kid so preston buys a mansion under the name <UNK> gets a <UNK> driver who says unfunny jokes and goes on a epic shopping spree then he spots <UNK> and talks about opening his account kid you're loaded and you're talking about opening an account we soon realized <UNK> is actually an fbi agent tracking down <UNK> and his two other <UNK> then he told his <UNK> dad he's got a job working for mr <UNK> and spends the day riding go <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> games and hanging out with his <UNK> driver buddy then he goes out on a date with <UNK> in a fancy restaurant what a 10 year old <UNK> and <UNK> a 20 something fbi agent afterwards he takes her to a street <UNK> and playing around in the water messing up <UNK> 300 dollar dress yet she takes it well if this was a bit realistic she would slap him for messing up her expensive dress so <UNK> and the others still mad <UNK> a little kid and quickly <UNK> the <UNK> and preston is being chased by <UNK> in a scene taken from the original script and <UNK> he is <UNK> mr <UNK> birthday which is really his birthday when he discovers he couldn't pay for the party he sits in his chair and dad talks to <UNK> which he doesn't know it's his son he's talking to and talks about preston should be a real kid and has his whole childhood ahead of him and wants preston to go home early what an hour ago you were <UNK> him about his <UNK> so preston asks everyone to leave and sits alone <UNK> when <UNK> and the others break in to the house to make preston pay and so he faces then in a finale that rips off home alone <UNK> gets <UNK> around in a ball while preston is driving a go <UNK> juice gets hit in the <UNK> and more antics ensue until the trio get preston <UNK> and when it seem all hope is lost <UNK> and a bunch of <UNK> guys come to save the day and so <UNK> and his crew get sent to jail but is there any hope for preston and <UNK> there is and she kisses him in the lips what what what a grown woman <UNK> a kid in the lips come on is she mentally disabled i mean an fbi agent who knows the country's laws would risk her career to kiss a kid she could get arrested on the spot and the most <UNK> part of all is that isn't goodbye and she'll see him in 6 or 7 years oh dear and so he comes home to his family celebrating his birthday so the moral of the story is love and respect can be bought what are they smoking the bottom line is that is a waste of time the morals are whacked it's flat as a <UNK> the kid is annoying the villains are lame the comic relief isn't funny the brothers are unlikable the dad is even worse the romantic subplot is creepy the <UNK> shallow and the only saving grace is the cinematography from bill <UNK> which went on to shoot the matrix trilogy and two of the spider man films so people don't waste your money and go watch home alone instead br br this has been a samuel franco review
<START> i am a big movie fan i like movies of all types this is arguably the worst movie i've ever seen br br i get that it follows the book closely which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book have been called into question more than once br br these characters are not quirky they are mentally ill the things that happen are not funny they are disturbing especially considering they are supposed to be true br br this movie had the feel of the royal <UNK> another movie i hated only running with <UNK> was even more dysfunctional and less funny br br i will never get those hours back i wanted to wash my brain after watching
<START> cliché ridden story of an impending divorce or is it through the eyes of a 6 year old child corny dialogue cardboard characters stock situations a red <UNK> zombie sub plot and worst of all absolutely no payoff either emotionally or dramatically br br does no one teach creative writing any more the true sign of a weak <UNK> when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement just end the story i'm compelled to ask what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place br br good but wasted debut by child actor anthony de <UNK> the rest of the cast was at best forgettable and they wonder why no one watches indie films this is ninety minutes of my life i will never get back
<START> wow what a total let down the fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous the special effects were a direct rip off of the ring the story was there one not in my opinion just a bunch of flashy <UNK> the entire film was a boring stupid mess i guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing <UNK> however this is the worst horror film i have seen in years and that buffy chick well she's a bad actress as plastic as <UNK> and just as talented no wait that would be an insult to the talents of <UNK> i suppose many <UNK> helped this film at the box office as it was pg 13 and had it been rated r it would have bombed imo stupid movie
<START> well after watching this i can say that it ain't the worst movie ever made yes folks there is worse than this there are some good points to the movie you get to watch drunken teenagers have horrible deaths and cute looking rats eating some science experiment and getting <UNK> huge the drunk janitor the <UNK> doctor and yes a girl in <UNK> underwear that has absolutely no shame dumb <UNK> i <UNK> personally wait for the rat to eat these drunken fools i was rooting for the rat the e <UNK> time it had a good premise the first part of the movie was interesting though with the scientific <UNK> about the rats and the little back story but i think that it ruined when the dumb drunken horny teenagers come into play the rat in my opinion the one that <UNK> lost her name is brenda was so fake must have been a cgi rat looked like a guy dressed up in a <UNK> suit this was pretty <UNK> lame but not totally <UNK>
<START> it's really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official truth and caught so many news <UNK> with their pants down this movie in my view deserves every price there is in <UNK> it's objective yes courageous and a real scoop it can do without comment fake scenes or leading questions everyone including chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words the filmmakers only had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling br br the <UNK> elite teaches us how to <UNK> of a president and sell it as a victory of democracy it's amazing that they lost in the end so far from what i know the biggest tv station involved only got its <UNK> license <UNK> they're still <UNK> via cable and satellite i highly doubt whether george w or <UNK> <UNK> would be that <UNK> after an attempted coup but then they don't have to worry br br the fact that the chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians <UNK> was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so called free established media really has become or has always been only more so an important lesson to anyone interested in what really goes on in the world br br the famous <UNK> challenge always comes into play when <UNK> dare to <UNK> the mainstream view or reveal <UNK> facts that <UNK> us it has been true with the effects of the atomic bomb the us secret history of <UNK> democracy around the world or the iraq war that according to <UNK> hopkins has killed 1 3 million <UNK> by now not to mention the 60 000 <UNK> in 2003 that are never mentioned to be objective <UNK> <UNK> was less <UNK> to his people than the us and the us is ready willing to be more <UNK> to the <UNK> that he was br br i'm quite curious about the upcoming trial of some <UNK> <UNK> leaders before the international <UNK> in the <UNK> whether there will be any mention of our involvement in supporting and training <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the 80's when they had been largely defeated by the <UNK> probably not br br all the more reason to turn to the independent media for balance if not exposure of fraud
<START> i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s it was well presented but i do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> in one of the last <UNK> <UNK> for impending <UNK> i'm not sure that <UNK> with the facts br br still the film is well done the german high command reports <UNK> without emotion the russians are <UNK> down the <UNK> <UNK> as if all went according to plan br br it was my impression that this film and a later american made for tv knock off was based on the british <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> account by a similar title last days of hitler i was surprised to see no credit to <UNK> <UNK> br br i agree the <UNK> german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic the american knock off was a little flat br br few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as <UNK> yet i find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of hitler's double <UNK> to in passing in john <UNK> magnificent historical piece br br was <UNK>
<START> college students who are <UNK> out a condemned <UNK> are stalked by an <UNK> killer br br the <UNK> that <UNK> blood aka pranks is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans the movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red <UNK> in fact much of the story's build up is pretty forgettable save for one or two brutal murders but the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax in an atmospheric setting and one fairly bold unconventional conclusion br br the cast is lackluster for the most part stephen <UNK> is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character also look for a young daphne <UNK> as an ill <UNK> student br br over all this is a pretty standard b slasher effort but the finale is well worth <UNK> and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho hum br br out of
<START> this is the worst adaption of a classic story i have ever seen they needlessly <UNK> it and some points are actually just sick br br the songs rarely move along the story they seem to be thrown in at random the flying scene with <UNK> is pointless and ludicrous br br it's not only one of the worst movies i've seen but it is definitely the worst musical i've ever seen br br it's probably only considered a classic because a christmas carol is such a classic story just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean that some cheap adaption is
<START> this is a film that takes some <UNK> on the one hand we are offered a tough <UNK> shell a story that does not only <UNK> the catholic church but does so <UNK> and <UNK> on an inner <UNK> we are offered a story of <UNK> over <UNK> and what happens when people follow <UNK> a faith that they must not understand br br at first glance it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy if so then mr <UNK> needs to open a <UNK> because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word the jokes are pale the humor is awkward and poorly delivered in particular ms keaton's performance is <UNK> and over the top well below the quality of her annie hall and sleeper days jennifer <UNK> is again the model of <UNK> with her hi pitched voice and whining style all of this could be forgiven if it weren't for the last 20 minutes of this movie that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981 br br careful spoilers ahead br br it all starts with the appearance of four former students of sister mary <UNK> <UNK> by the way is a male name and a nun would not adopt it after her <UNK> under any <UNK> simply due to that fact just to show you how much <UNK> research went into the project to begin with when they all admit that they don't live up to the <UNK> <UNK> the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny all too cliché <UNK> tone flashbacks when one of them admits to having two <UNK> the nun becomes even more abusive until the <UNK> pulls out a gun after wrestling it away from her the nun kills the <UNK> presumably in self defense she then goes on a screaming rampage killing a gay former student because of his sins the last shot is of the dead female <UNK> lying in a christ like pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her can you say heavy handed ' i knew you could br br i know there have been abusive nuns in the past and i know many people have been emotionally <UNK> as a result but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie i have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about <UNK> and why one should not follow the <UNK> so <UNK> no pun intended this explanation is hard to swallow though simply because we are never given an <UNK> viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another this film is simply anti catholic tripe which in the name of fairness and <UNK> is mean spirited and hateful br br this is a film i would recommend for a catholic namely to <UNK> him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today if it were <UNK> ray explains it <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> explains it <UNK> there would be <UNK> in the streets and showtime would lose all of its <UNK> but sadly because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority it is accepted and even <UNK> by those who share the same <UNK> point of view br br i certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic so it wasn't just ignorance that brought them to make this film br br i give it 1 5 stars out of 5 not because of its offensive nature but because it was poorly written poorly directed and just a bad movie in general don't even waste your time
<START> i basically <UNK> through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about to tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't make sense the only reason i watched this movie in the first place was to see <UNK> crawford he is so hot but in this movie his hair was kind of weird but still hot br br however despite how hot <UNK> is it really did not make up for the film i guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they <UNK> in like every sentence is it that hard to express your anger without saying the f word every time the <UNK> was annoying and the whole flashy camera shaking thing gave me a headache br br all in all although the plot was ok i found the film to be a bore and over dramatic that's why i only cut to scenes with <UNK> in it lol anyways not worth renting unless your a die hard fan of a specific cast member like i was oh yeah the cast was hot the girls were hot but <UNK> is the best
<START> by 1955 five years after this one was released james stewart and anthony mann had completed another six films together four of them westerns their <UNK> was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a universal <UNK> became both a cult and a classic buffs of the period will <UNK> in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known and that's not counting ray <UNK> or <UNK> curtis later to become tony perhaps ten years later the <UNK> western was well <UNK> but in 1950 it was rare to throw <UNK> into the mix with cain and <UNK> to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way and still <UNK> a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned one to add to the dvd collection
<START> this is 30 minute show about one joke the joke <UNK> are not treated fairly <UNK> he can't <UNK> a phone because he is a <UNK> <UNK> are not as smart as human beings oh <UNK> those <UNK> are so <UNK> there is no humor in this show they can only run off this one joke for so long and they already have with the <UNK> commercials this show does not deserve a time <UNK> on national t v br br this show tries to hard to be funny but it just isn't watching this show i was thinking that it was trying to be like a <UNK> gone wild show meaning they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women the crying <UNK> is annoying the <UNK> with the glasses is too smart to be a <UNK> <UNK> all three of them have personalities but i can't figure out why i don't care about them
<START> firstly although many say it is the worst of the series i don't think that it is true considering this one <UNK> reflects the 21 century teen mentality it brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenager times when you would have liked to have same fun as the characters do br br i agree with the fact that it is a teenager movie but comedy movies nowadays aren't supposed to be for teenagers i mean cinemas are mostly the place for teenagers to hang out plus seeing such a movie during a <UNK> or something like that is very good for having a very good time br br many comment about the amount of nudity in this movie well let's get real doesn't that reflect the thoughts of teen guys like those from the movie what would you like to see smart books romantic stuff that is not at all what would be in those <UNK> minds br br to conclude i think that if you are a teenager you must absolutely see the movie and even if you are a real grown up man or a woman you should see it if you still have a teen mind or you often think about how it was being a teenager or things like that thanks for reading
<START> on the basis of the preview i'd seen i went to shower expecting a sweet little comedy what i found was a profoundly touching drama of family life told in some of the most lush <UNK> images i've ever been <UNK> to see in addition later reflection made me appreciate the abrupt cuts to scenes from the past in the <UNK> countryside of northern china and in the high plain of <UNK> isn't this how memory often works one moment i'm here the next i'm in a landscape from the past just like that br br i would not only strongly recommend this film i would place it among the two or three finest films i've seen in my 60 years br br by the way a couple of years ago another asian comedy was released in the united states as shall we dance japanese just as with shower the preview gave not the slightest indication of the depth of that film which turned out to be a subtle psychological study albeit chock full of funny moments is there a fear on the part of <UNK> of making films appear too important or deep to appeal to u s viewers
<START> to finally see what many consider to be the greatest women in prison film of all time i felt like i had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds boy it sure contained the elements i expected and delivered so much more a constant i'm discovering in these films is the <UNK> and <UNK> of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their <UNK> tolerance and resolve not to mention sanity being tested by their superiors while most of them were hired for the way they look naked because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements something else emerges other attributes such as attitude and guts that i ultimately respond to br br this as you may know all too well was <UNK> debut for his mentor roger corman and he provides the target audience with exactly what they desire while putting his own <UNK> on the proceedings for instance there are bizarre dreams certain characters have which define their current psychological states there's a particular number featuring warden barbara steele where she reminded me of alex de large of a clockwork orange br br the film has female prisoners planning a daring escape tired of the crazed antics of their wheel chair bound warden and her nutty prison doc randolph warren miller <UNK> brown is maggie the tough sassy sister who is fed up with the environment and will do whatever it takes to get out she's the one all the girls fear to cross <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> wilson the <UNK> prisoner who was <UNK> by police and sentenced for the murder of a cop unwilling to give up the names of those she was involved with <UNK> collins is belle a serial <UNK> best pals with <UNK> ella reid belle becomes the obsession of randolph who promises <UNK> mcqueen steele that through a <UNK> <UNK> he can remove her violent <UNK> <UNK> her up randolph takes nude pictures and <UNK> her <UNK> like a little girl due to his own mental <UNK> while <UNK> her naked body in his arms <UNK> <UNK> smith is <UNK> in prison for life for murdering a <UNK> whose relative was a senator <UNK> receives work in <UNK> office and is the one responsible for relating his dirty antics to <UNK> <UNK> effectively builds the movie to the expected finale as a planned break out using those behind the various <UNK> inflicted on the prisoners as <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> br br i was quite impressed with the <UNK> work of long time <UNK> <UNK> cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> as he is able to establish some visually <UNK> moments within the <UNK> confines of the prison cells and rooms not an easy task the prison is appropriately crummy and the girls despite being quite attractive look the part of desperate inmates longing yearning from the very <UNK> of their souls to escape such horrid <UNK> steele is superb as the warden understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far <UNK> able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint notice how she works her glasses and <UNK> herself without blowing her top particularly when certain <UNK> she has contempt for push her <UNK> to the edge <UNK> <UNK> score is incredibly depressing while also casting a <UNK> to the audience that the movie is still fun and games i think <UNK> score mirrors <UNK> handling of the material <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is an uncanny alliance that presents the setting as a sad <UNK> oppressive place while almost simultaneously <UNK> a humorous tone that <UNK> due to the colorful characters thanks in part to the personalities of the cast my favorite scene happens outside the prison as two of our girls joining forces with a third <UNK> a bank robbery already in progress the <UNK> is it was a bank they were planning to rob as you might expect you get naked women in <UNK> prisoner in <UNK> a cat fight <UNK> attempted escapes which go awry and other exploitative elements such as a horrifying shock therapy session not to <UNK> the shocking aforementioned sequence where the <UNK> doc takes advantage of belle interesting enough <UNK> relates the film to the audience without a <UNK> of <UNK> understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making
<START> judy davis shows us here why she is one of <UNK> most respected and loved actors her portrayal of a lonely <UNK> <UNK> is first rate a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of this country's most popular actors in years to come with future roles in the big steal the <UNK> kid dating the enemy risk and the acclaimed tv series the secret life of us incidentally <UNK> as a child was a young girl whose toy <UNK> was stolen outside a <UNK> shop in the 1983 drama going down with <UNK> mann if this films comes your way make sure you see it rating <UNK> 100 see also hotel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> possession <UNK>
<START> i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier my time was spent during the height of the troubles in <UNK> and the cold war there was times when i <UNK> myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react <UNK> the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations some years later i was in canada for a family get together an <UNK> of mine who lives in the usa and is a <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had done a paper on the effects of the british army in <UNK> she spent some time out there <UNK> although an ex pat she was very anti british she made a <UNK> line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier my only answer was see the film 'a long day's <UNK> it's the closest a <UNK> will get to realise why a soldier does what he does the answer is right at the end
<START> allen and julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night no one knows who killed the little girl but it's why they moved to the mountains so the couple moves into this cabin and it's haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it br br this movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part i didn't expect it was a pretty good movie that wasn't the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good br br i also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends it is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie
<START> how the hell did they get this made presenting itself as a caper comedy the <UNK> is essentially two hours of people <UNK> sentence <UNK> the usually <UNK> warren beatty looks drunk and the usually hilarious goldie hawn acts like she's on <UNK> as for <UNK> <UNK> his most famous role <UNK> was infinitely more admirable than his character here not even the guy with the <UNK> bottle of <UNK> can save this <UNK> of <UNK> br br am i comparing this movie to plan 9 from outer space i wouldn't do such a thing even if someone paid me <UNK> was <UNK> made but ended up hilarious this was <UNK> made and causes you to feel like your brain just <UNK> out of your ears warren beatty and goldie hawn made up for this when they co starred in <UNK> but then they co starred in the dreadful town country maybe they just shouldn't co star in movies all in all i would rather have my skin torn off than have to watch this again awful br br maybe they should remake it with jackie chan then i would pay to see it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> grace mills is a teenager turned on to satan and <UNK> by her <UNK> fiancé richard there's a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local <UNK> ancient castle where <UNK> and richard drink blood drop drugs join in sex <UNK> dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass <UNK> where the guys wear pants masks and <UNK> and the women don't wear anything at all unfortunately these kind of <UNK> activities have left <UNK> open to demonic possession from the <UNK> spirit of evil <UNK> also comes from a screwed up family which doesn't help either her older brother john is a <UNK> who seems to be in love with her her mother patricia maria <UNK> is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father's death to top it off her sister maria <UNK> is a <UNK> semi pro <UNK> named gasp debbie gibson there's plenty of hired help around also to waste more time two <UNK> a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone plus <UNK> luis <UNK> a bald <UNK> <UNK> who spies on <UNK> changing clothes takes nude pictures of her and <UNK> into the pool house to take a <UNK> of her <UNK> used bathing suit oh yeah and <UNK> the pet german shepherd br br paul naschy is father adrian <UNK> the <UNK> priest <UNK> who starts <UNK> around after john and richard both have their heads twisted around backwards <UNK> tells him they say i am perverse and i'm going to prove it is true during her birthday party she tells her guests you make me sick i hate you all and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she <UNK> i don't want to see that fat ass debbie suggests they commit <UNK> to a <UNK> but <UNK> runs off and joins the cult again she is rescued again and brought back home for the third time br br by this point in the movie there's only about ten minutes left to go and all we've basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f ed up their lives are and how <UNK> is acting weird it's almost as <UNK> to sit through as an andy <UNK> movie minus the gore and laughs but finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies an exorcist like possession flick unfortunately the best part of it are the contact <UNK> <UNK> gets to wear some cheap time <UNK> <UNK> appear on her arms legs and face she gets <UNK> lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white <UNK> she begins <UNK> of <UNK> flesh <UNK> up some clear <UNK> starts speaking in her dead <UNK> voice <UNK> into her mom's bedroom <UNK> her around a bit and calls her a filthy bitch of a whore in comes father adrian who now finally believes she is indeed possessed <UNK> off her attempts at seduction <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are in the kitchen and <UNK> <UNK> with holy water doors open and close a mirror breaks there's sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor after she <UNK> <UNK> and the two roll down the stairs the spirit is out of her and into guess who why <UNK> the family <UNK> the demon dog then turns on adrian and <UNK> him up a little before he <UNK> it on a fire poker then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film it's <UNK> on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self but then there's another time <UNK> effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly <UNK> her body it's so badly done you really have no clue what to make of it which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they've wasted an hour and a half on this worthless <UNK> br br screw the contacts 1 out of 10 it is
<START> it holds very true to the original manga of the same name aka <UNK> like us in the u s but it can still be enjoyed even if you haven't read the manga it's a different kind of tail showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else however because of her <UNK> strength she fears showing her inner feelings and thus let's those around her hurt her with their blunt comments the only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pet human <UNK> if you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful j <UNK> japanese drama actors <UNK> then this is definitely the series to watch and read
<START> formula flick of guy who wants girl guy who will lie to get next to girl guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way <UNK> <UNK> no to help <UNK> girl etc this one's been done to death and with rare exception of a few z rated <UNK> it's been done better br br stale plot aside the leads are attractive and there's a couple of good moments <UNK> <UNK> has done better and his acting here came close to being <UNK> in not a complete loss but nothing new here in this tepid affair
<START> there seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8 10 star reviews here from people who have never written an imdb review before or since given the very low average rating given to the film by other people i think you may draw your own conclusions br br this is a very bad film i'll admit it i thought the concept was kind of cute and i was pleased to see the actresses who played eve and harmony on angel getting work but it didn't take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known br br acting the leads seemed competent enough but everyone else terrible br br plot chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through br br direction non existent br br humour did they really think people were going to laugh oh boy br br eye candy ok there were some really beautiful women in this film not just the three main female characters but right across the board it was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they wouldn't notice how terrible everything else was if so they failed miserably br br in the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic it wasn't even close
<START> i really liked this movie i've read a few of the other comments and although i pity those who did not understand it i do agree with some of the criticisms which in a strange way makes me like this movie all the more i accept that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch i also love the movies such as this one which <UNK> so many <UNK> theories possible endings and hidden subtext <UNK> mr <UNK> definitely in my top ten br br p s saw this when it first came out whilst i was <UNK> in mexico it was late at night and i had to get back to my hotel and i had a major paranoia trip where does the dream end and the real begin
<START> a bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm the police have closed the bridge saying it's <UNK> and they are stuck in a little <UNK> until the road has been <UNK> however after a while their boredom is turned to concern as it seems that one of the passengers was not originally on the bus and may just be an alien this leads to a conclusion that is ironic but also rather funny in a low brow way br br this is another of the fun episodes of the twilight zone instead of the typical twists or social commentary this one features no lasting message however it's also very and watchable so who cares exactly what occurs you'll just have to see for yourself br br by the way this one stars john <UNK> a face most of you will recognize from countless old tv shows and movies in almost every case he played a real <UNK> like charles lane during the same era but boy did i love seeing him as he <UNK> the <UNK> persona and was kind of funny at the same time
<START> this is a good example of how not to make a film br br there is very little meaningful dialog no context for the events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes the result is a confused clueless viewer the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary br br this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is with an emphasis on child abuse it includes some stock footage of real horrible acts of violence including war time <UNK> although it works in the context of the movie i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without <UNK> to such extreme content this film is absolutely not for the weak <UNK> or the easily offended and should not under any circumstances be shown to <UNK> br br the climax is anti climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie if you're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it br br the director's commentary was a one shot sit the guy down and let him talk no cuts type of commentary while this isn't necessarily bad the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college filming conditions co producers bad film and a dozen other things the constant <UNK> <UNK> from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie br br the movie was shot many years ago on <UNK> and <UNK> film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget because of this the video and audio quality is poor that alone does not make it a bad movie but it does make a bad movie worse
<START> eddie murphy plays chandler <UNK> a man who <UNK> his time to finding lost children when the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> charlotte lewis enters his life she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child <UNK> and driven purely by lust and intrigue <UNK> gets involved without <UNK> he's about to <UNK> on a <UNK> journey one that involves peril and worst of all the demon <UNK> <UNK> br br is the golden child a product of its time by that i mean was eddie murphy and the golden child's popularity <UNK> to the late 1980s audiences for i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade it's box office was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> making it the <UNK> biggest <UNK> of 1986 but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny eddie murphy pictures the comedy <UNK> that they actually once had the golden child is not up with the more accepted 80s murphy pictures like <UNK> places and beverly hills cop but upon <UNK> the film recently i personally find that it contains murphy at his <UNK> <UNK> and charming best seriously br br <UNK> in on a fantasy action formula that was <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> of the lost <UNK> in 1981 the golden child hits all the required genre buttons pretty girl daring reluctant hero with a <UNK> in his <UNK> dashing villain charles dance so english i could kiss him myself wonderful colour and a cute kid with mystical powers the film only asks you to get involved in the fun not to <UNK> and <UNK> its worth as a <UNK> fantasy picture yes the cgi demon looks <UNK> now and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s 90s and beyond but really if you agree with the <UNK> rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious seriously 7 10
<START> this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen this movie has nothing positive about it some of you people actually like this movie i've seen a lot of dracula movies and i've liked everyone that i've seen but when i saw this movie i said to myself what the hell is this what a stupid movie now they have dracula becoming who he is because he is <UNK> for those of you who don't know who <UNK> is he betrayed jesus christ and then felt so guilty he hung himself you have to be kidding me that's the dumbest reason i've ever heard for why dracula became evil who asked for a reason anyway what a piece of sh this movie is who ever came up with this sorry excuse for a movie should be beaten even the dracula is horrible if you ever saw this movie you wouldn't even think it was dracula wow dracula 2000 is that title supposed to impress me don't waste your time or your money on this trash
<START> i was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that the scott brothers were involved unfortunately my hopes were <UNK> yet again we are led to believe that the <UNK> are a group of inept morons who don't have a clue what they are doing at one point there is a laughable scene where 4 <UNK> agents couldn't handle one cia agent i grow weary of these biased one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the spy game that went on during the cold war i find it laughable that the us is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in ww2 and beyond just like the pathetic u <UNK> where we are led to believe that the us <UNK> the <UNK> machine again utterly false br br to its credit the company is very well filmed and acted the locales are also exceptionally well realised alfred <UNK> puts in a great performance as does keaton the conflict between them is very well done i really wanted to like this show and no doubt i will end up watching the other 2 episodes but i really wish that us productions would stop trying to portray their spies <UNK> etc as <UNK> who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet it gets old fast and seriously <UNK> from the <UNK> of what could have been a 10 10 br br s
<START> i bought dark angel seasons 1 2 two weeks ago after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5 nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is i haven't enjoyed anything as much since <UNK> also and amazing show i'll admit season 2 <UNK> quite as good but there are still some amazing episodes see <UNK> this bag 'em the <UNK> agenda harbor lights freak nation etc and alec is great i've heard some of the plans for the would be season 3 and i have to say i can't believe it was cancelled i won't spoil it for you but it would have <UNK> i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie although at the moment it seems highly unlikely as proof of my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> number is <UNK> and in the two weeks i've had it i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice it's just too good
<START> this movie is so awful it is hard to find the right words to describe it br br at first the story is so ridiculous a narrow minded human can write a better plot the actors are boring and <UNK> perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy film br br the camera <UNK> of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie i should feel <UNK> because i paid for this lousy picture br br hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline
<START> since i am so interested in lake monsters i really <UNK> this movie this movie is worth a see if you like the so awful they are good types of films check it out the effects are really good as well just think land of the lost i originally watched this movie in the early 90's maybe more like <UNK> 90 on a local channel monster show called <UNK> presents i didn't scare me but i was 8 and anything b felt more like an a years later i seen it on dvd at a local circuit city and bought it immediately so i can give it a 9 because it has a personal spot in my heart right there with the monster squad and <UNK> good b movie fun for all ages
<START> <UNK> cat the 4th of these cartoons is a good one at least i like it so i'm surprised that this is getting mixed reviews br br this one is more of a macabre story than a funny one although it has its moments of comedy the atmosphere is dark and spooky suspense is another strong element here as for humor it's mostly dark humor br br in this short tom <UNK> to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it is about ghosts something he believes while tom is scared to death jerry is watching everything and can't help but laugh the whole time in fact jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more with the help of a white shirt and a <UNK> <UNK> he creates a big ghost br br tom lives the scariest experience of his whole life although jerry scares tom without a good reason the way the story is made ends up being funny plus once again there is no violence here because this is one of tom <UNK> oldest cartoons however i don't get that joke of <UNK> 9 lives nearly sucked into the <UNK> <UNK> br br when tom finally finds out that it was all a <UNK> scheme and that jerry made a fool out of him jerry is <UNK> with the hand in the cookie <UNK> he deserves to be discovered yet tom shows an incredible patience before <UNK> he <UNK> looks at jerry for about a minute the funny thing is that jerry invites tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that tom is looking at him with a very serious face jerry tries to be funny but tom doesn't laugh br br overall this is a different peculiar and remarkable tom jerry experience
<START> we saw the silent version of this film and it is quite simply <UNK> beautiful it's quite hard to see how a sound version could have been created since it is shot with pure silent technique long <UNK> <UNK> of narrative without a single <UNK> save for a few <UNK> sequences where louise brooks playing a french <UNK> is quite <UNK> speaking in english the only section that obviously cries out for sound is the final scene where brooks is watching the rushes for her test <UNK> a sound <UNK> footage which plays constantly in the background as the action unfolds with her mouth moving in <UNK> <UNK> song i was <UNK> to learn afterwards that this passage alone in the <UNK> version had been <UNK> as an <UNK> of new technique br br in the sunny beauty of its opening scenes and the fairy tale <UNK> of what follows the film resembles a dream as a <UNK> brooks <UNK> it was not at all what i was expecting either from her hollywood comedies or from g w <UNK> german <UNK> i found the <UNK> more <UNK> and enjoyable than either and brooks herself is a different creature a <UNK> laughing young animal rather than a shop window <UNK> or manipulated doll br br but what gives this film greater depth than at first appears is the unexpected second half <UNK> by the rich <UNK> who <UNK> around her beauty the <UNK> princess returns to a tear <UNK> reunion with her <UNK> born true love and the tale might very well have been ended there fairy tale however turns to tragedy the <UNK> <UNK> confident in his ability to manipulate the woman he desires is yet all too correct in his self interested <UNK> the young lovers cannot make each other happy and <UNK> ironically was right to <UNK> the social influence of beauty <UNK> after the <UNK> of her <UNK> glory <UNK> <UNK> herself to despair over the <UNK> routine of married life while her husband in turn is driven wild by any reminder of the whole affair if it were a simple case of a <UNK> matched marriage that would be one thing but the true tragedy is that they do love each other br br in many ways <UNK> de <UNK> reminds me of <UNK> sunrise but if so the <UNK> and photographer scenes here would form a distorted mirror image of the <UNK> <UNK> in sunrise no dream but an <UNK> nightmare and the following dawn brings not a <UNK> reunion but an empty bed and deserted home leaving a letter to say that she loves him and will always love him <UNK> <UNK> again from <UNK> life in quest of <UNK> and freedom and this time she will never come back br br <UNK> <UNK> confirm all <UNK> worst <UNK> as he learns of his wife's <UNK> through reports <UNK> her name with <UNK> when the young <UNK> <UNK> at last to the lavish <UNK> of the screening room it is with drawn gun to be <UNK> by the sight of his rival <UNK> and <UNK> a laughing <UNK> the same woman who had <UNK> her <UNK> affection as she left him he kills her but even as he kills is <UNK> by the living image on screen <UNK> in all her transformed glory as he never saw her the two women are <UNK> in an endless powerful moment as <UNK> is seen <UNK> <UNK> and pulled away the dying girl and her singing self still projected above caught <UNK> out of time into celluloid eternity playing on unconscious of life or death or love beneath her br br the main jarring element in the film is the character of <UNK> co worker <UNK> who appears to serve no role throughout other than to be the <UNK> butt of his <UNK> <UNK> he is the ugly one who can never get the girl the <UNK> <UNK> who is <UNK> and tormented in the <UNK> and at work and must take it all with an uncertain <UNK> smile in his <UNK> hope for social acceptance a typical product of the bullying of the more gifted and popular in other words but one the audience is apparently being invited to laugh at along with his <UNK> unless the intention is to expose a darker side to the protagonists for which i perceive no sign the character seems to exist merely as comic relief but comic relief with a distinctly nasty edge when we know him only as an inept <UNK> tom at the <UNK> it's easy to laugh although the <UNK> revenge seems a little over the top when we discover that he is no chance met stranger but <UNK> colleague and regular sidekick the continuing attacks rapidly <UNK> to be very funny br br but it is the images that remain beauty nightmare and dream
<START> one of my all time favorite so laughably lousy that it's totally lovable el <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> independent horror creature features an <UNK> dreadful marvel that was released by the <UNK> <UNK> exploitation outfit crown international pictures so it could play numerous crappy double bills at countless drive ins back in the 70's and eventually wound up being <UNK> like crazy on several small time secondary cable stations throughout the 80's i naturally first saw this <UNK> ghastly abomination on late night television one <UNK> saturday evening while in my early teens and have had a deep <UNK> albeit completely irrational <UNK> <UNK> for it ever since br br a <UNK> falls out of the sky and crashes into the still waters of a <UNK> country lake thereby causing a <UNK> <UNK> dinosaur egg to <UNK> of course the baby <UNK> immediately grows into a gigantic <UNK> <UNK> teeth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with goofy <UNK> an extended neck and a huge mouth full of little sharp <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> our southern fried male cousin to the <UNK> <UNK> monster promptly starts <UNK> down on various <UNK> local <UNK> residents of a previously quiet and sleepy <UNK> resort town it's up to <UNK> <UNK> sheriff richard <UNK> <UNK> by the painfully idiotic <UNK> comic relief <UNK> fishing guide duo of glenn roberts and mark <UNK> <UNK> gal pal <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> insipid nerdy scientist bob <UNK> to get to the bottom of things before the over sized <UNK> jurassic <UNK> ruins the tourist trade by eating all the <UNK> and <UNK> that the <UNK> hamlet makes its cash off of br br director co screenwriter william r <UNK> displays a wonderfully <UNK> and thoroughly clueless incompetence when it comes to pacing atmosphere taut narrative construction and especially <UNK> sound credible acting from his hopelessly all thumbs rank amateur community theater level cast the performances are uniformly abysmal <UNK> is way too bland and wooden to cut it as a solid heroic lead while the <UNK> dopey redneck comic antics of roberts and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of slack <UNK> disbelief you aren't laughing with these two <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so much as at them particularly when the <UNK> <UNK> discover a severed head <UNK> up and down in the murky lake water better yet a clumsily integrated sub plot concerning a vicious on the loose criminal leads to a spectacularly ham <UNK> supermarket hold up scene which <UNK> into a hilariously stupid mini massacre when a young lady <UNK> <UNK> the stick up artist in mid robbery a subsequent car chase is likewise severely <UNK> as well it's so <UNK> staged and unimpressive that one feels more <UNK> than scared when the monster abruptly pops up to <UNK> the <UNK> fugitive moreover david allen's funky <UNK> jerky stop motion animation dinosaur is the authentic <UNK> article <UNK> a certain raw charisma <UNK> <UNK> personality and overall <UNK> screen presence which makes all the <UNK> <UNK> human characters seem like <UNK> <UNK> nobody <UNK> in comparison and as for the rousing conclusion where the sheriff takes on our <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> the <UNK> word for this thrilling confrontation is <UNK> all the way
<START> i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ago i watched it for what it was a collection of music videos it's not a movie it doesn't have a plot nor a central storyline it's a rather artistic anthology of mostly long form videos all of them rather <UNK> or <UNK> done michael jackson may be considered a freak these days but after all this was the man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set <UNK> with <UNK> jean and beat it with <UNK> he and the filmmakers and artists who <UNK> with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff <UNK> <UNK> special effects live performance footage and even self parody the <UNK> sequence and for those wondering what joe <UNK> was doing there this video came out just a tad before he became a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the choreographed section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point
<START> i wanted so much to enjoy this movie it moved very slowly and was just boring if it had been on tv it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes maybe what happened to the story a great cast and photographer were working on a <UNK> foundation if this is loosely based on the life of the director why didn't he get someone to see that the writing itself was loose then he directed it at a <UNK> pace which may have been the source of a few people <UNK> off during the movie the music <UNK> but for a different film not this one for soap opera saga possibly there were times when the dialogue was not understandable when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was speaking i was not alone because i heard a few <UNK> about who said what to whom why can't hollywood make better movies this one had the <UNK> of a great story but was just poorly executed
<START> watching this movie was a waste of time i was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie but i <UNK> i don't know what <UNK> scott intended but i learned that in the army women get as stupid as men they learn to spit to insult and to fight in combat and that's also a waste of time in my opinion and anyway what the hell was that final scene in <UNK> are they still fighting <UNK> or is it that it's easy for everyone to believe <UNK> people are always a danger
<START> down to earth is about lance barton a black comedian who gets hit by a truck he goes to heaven and he gets to get another body lance gets the body of charles <UNK> a white guy so lance does a few things in the body of charles the movie has a few laughs but it's nothing special it's a good movie if you're a fan of chris rock <UNK> the 2005 animated comedy is better this is a good movie but chris rock has done way better things than this it will only make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie and it's not really laugh out loud funny you'll laugh to yourself and you might giggle but you definitely won't be rolling on the floor laughing
<START> one reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what welles actually says or does he moves you i <UNK> he was and remains a unique force in film more than a triple threat who could act write and direct he had a genius uniquely suited to film one can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter this film certainly <UNK> that impression a musician a theatre actor an heir to shakespeare hard to tell but i am very grateful that his time <UNK> with film and he have him captured on film i like the accent i like the face the size the style the mind and the games i love all of his movies and wish there were more i particularly love how other actors <UNK> with him on film many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was o firmly there even towards the end when his beauty was ruined perhaps by his own intent he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in rita was a gorgeous blonde a <UNK> turner look alike but perhaps even <UNK> and even then the eye goes to welles and one wishes for another minute another film another hour in his company that is why we all wish we could come upon the lost <UNK> cut from his films because we know we all know that there is not part of him not worthy of our time watch it and be grateful for the chance
<START> grey gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away it was so strange and funny and sad and sick and <UNK> really no words can describe the move grey gardens is beyond bizarre i found out about this film reading my uncle john's great big bathroom reader by the bathroom <UNK> <UNK> and it was well worth the rental and <UNK> to the top of my movie watching <UNK> this movie is about the <UNK> most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed one should watch it for their favorite edie outfits which i am sure include <UNK> when i get old i almost wish to be just like big edie <UNK> my nose at <UNK> and society
<START> i was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous modesty blaise movie which is why i left it <UNK> for so long but i was very pleasantly surprised br br far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car boat chases it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails with nothing being <UNK> or over <UNK> br br it's likely that the <UNK> constraints actually helped with that less time and effort was spent on finding ever <UNK> ways for stunt men to pretend to die and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching hell the biggest gun battle takes place off screen and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise that adds to the suspense who's winning who's dying br br alexandra <UNK> might not be as drop dead gorgeous as monica <UNK> but few are and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that's needed to make the character work and the shape of her face her hair and her tall <UNK> body could have been lifted straight from the comic strip graphics br br <UNK> coaster <UNK> was the perfect choice for a blaise bad guy in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch even likable and i doubt i'd consider taking on many brutal <UNK> murderers as drinking buddies i can't think of a single one of hollywood's former <UNK> who could have pulled the role off that well br br fortunately blaise baddies always die in the end no spoilers there that's a really good thing because all the girls who would have spent their time <UNK> over such a <UNK> handsome and interesting hunk can now <UNK> settle for us ordinary <UNK>
<START> they should have called this movie adopted mouse brother that is slightly inspired by someone's vague <UNK> of stuart little who just kind of <UNK> the book a little but mostly just remembered the cover if it wasn't so misleading i'd give it a better review br br but seriously people do your kids a favor and have them read the book they might actually learn something instead of having their mind <UNK> by what we all know as hollywood film br br the book stuart little isn't about a mouse it's about a person who happens to be very small and mouse like he's born to his parents not adopted the book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he <UNK> on there is a cat named <UNK> who thinks he's food and wants to eat him but <UNK> can't talk br br in the movie they screw all of that up i think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names
<START> i watched this movie when joe bob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad but it took all my <UNK> <UNK> to sit through it though it's like watching your great grandmother <UNK> with a 15 year old boy excruciatingly painful br br if you took the actual film <UNK> it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining seriously br br if you see this movie in the <UNK> bin at s mart back away from it as if it were a <UNK>
<START> not knowing what this film was about i checked it out at the video store and after seeing it i enjoyed it little seen multi genre flick from director bernard rose <UNK> immortal beloved great story and characters as a fan of <UNK> <UNK> i was surprised of her british accent the only exception for this film was the ending however it is worth the rent
<START> as a mystery science theatre 3000 fan i can <UNK> any motion picture that can be <UNK> upon me but there is absolutely no reason for this br br rated super action in the blockbuster video section and given the <UNK> <UNK> viewing <UNK> i'm assuming these are the only methods that film maker ha robert <UNK> could use to get at least 4 50 from one unsuspecting person br br shame on you robert <UNK> shame on you for <UNK> these poor mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in american cinema you are a disgrace br br there isn't one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action did you use <UNK> on these people oh look they're having a rave in a field like all 6 of them and isn't that an asian guy in the background why is it always daytime why did it take 1 2 of the movie to show anything and more importantly why did we watch the other 1 2 br br ps you owe me 4 50
<START> i would perhaps give 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film becomes successful if there are people who watch this piece and think that well then jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in ww2 then the movie is very cleverly made to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> as well as mix correct and false observations on how a people live what more can a propaganda movie aim for the part in which an american movie about the <UNK> family is included is re used very <UNK> here for instance the question of why the jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked no one mentions the system of <UNK> within that particular social <UNK> br br besides the level of excitement or the level of disgust in the movie <UNK> slowly and the solution like end of the movie suits the aim and the <UNK> of doing propaganda the audience would leave in joy and <UNK> to the times that are coming up well done br br in the movie there is a kind of simplicity that <UNK> the most basic emotional perception of the audience the movie is kind of history today so no need to fuss much about it actually however in this simplicity of words of ethnic <UNK> a careful watcher can find relevance to today's cultural hatred violence <UNK> as well as the problems of <UNK> overall fine trash
<START> i am a current a s l student was forced to watch this movie in class and what i got out of it was the blatant bias involved in the film the film is obviously <UNK> towards to p o v of the common deaf perception their is no middle ground also the film didn't make mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic i e deaf people who were born hearing and later went deaf is it right or wrong in that instance the film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the deaf w a capital d not that this is bad but for it to be a true documentary film is should attempt to be slightly <UNK>
<START> relying on the positive reviews above we saw a free screening of this last night now i know that filmmakers plant positive reviews because there is no way an objective individual could have written these destined to become a <UNK> <UNK> the theater was packed apparently with friends and families of the production crew because only a few of us walked out by the first hour br br the songs were the most literal i've ever heard in a musical  don't take the short cut honey there's a wolf in the woods <UNK> <UNK> eyes <UNK> <UNK> as she <UNK> to sing fortunately most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines br br now whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive instead we get joey <UNK> ex <UNK> living up to his last name as he's not aged well he's not exactly <UNK> with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school quality makeup and out of tune singing seriously this guy was in vocal group the rest of the actors are semi adequate but can't do much about the unimaginative script you know it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time  see under pixar br br on the positive side the virtual sets looked nice and were well integrated with the actors and it wasn't as offensive as crash
<START> i don't think any movie of van <UNK> will ever beat universal soldier but u never know this movie was good but not as good as 1st <UNK> returns a luc must do battle again he tries 2 b funny here but its maybe worth a <UNK> of a chuckle <UNK> has a kid this time from ally w good it showed a <UNK> of them 2 goldberg was cool he does his famous move forgot what its called cause i don't watch wrestling sucks <UNK> goldberg had some good fights it was the ending like the 1st but just not that good <UNK> does his best move in his career like always the helicopter kick even though the final ending should've been longer anyway it is worth seeing but it will never top the original
<START> an absolutely brilliant show the second season began where the first ended with much mystery suspense in most if not all episodes and mystery everywhere one that made me think and think again it's truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful never fail to <UNK> and i am looking forward to the new season hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time more mystery to be solved good selection of cast too for this show fit the characters perfectly really can't wait to finally discover the secret hopefully all the hype won't spoil the ending
<START> a bum gives a secret <UNK> a tip about a secret service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president <UNK> how did the bum know the script then turns to a most detailed examination of how the secret service works but who cares most of this just slows down the movie all the chases that follow are this film's version of the tiresome car chases of many movies then after a lot of impossible <UNK> in which our hero <UNK> and out guns all his buddies we have a shootout in the toronto city hall the <UNK> are clearly marked with <UNK> <UNK> but how did they get into this finally all is worked out but it still makes no sense
<START> what reviewers and mst3k left out is the best part and only memorable scene of this otherwise dreadful movie there is a very good rape in the shower scene committed by the bad guy ben <UNK> look alike on maria as mentioned killed later through t j 's <UNK> perhaps rape is too strong a word prison <UNK> ritual may be more appropriate the background behind this chance yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding ben <UNK> introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool the 30 ish blonde <UNK> him but our villain must be quite smitten by her because the <UNK> is on at that point his first move is to attempt drowning her until his mafia don <UNK> tells him to knock it off kind of like the girl in high school you didn't like but still wanted to have <UNK> knowledge of anyway let's just say he catches up with her in the <UNK> later
<START> this was a very good movie i wished i could find it in vhs to buy i really enjoyed this movie i would <UNK> recommend this movie to watch i would like to see it again but can never find it in tv it would be well worth the time to watch it again
<START> the whole biker movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made this one delivers a lot of fighting generous amounts of blood <UNK> fighting indians and a <UNK> town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time the acting is beyond terrible what ever happened to robert walker jr at one point he was in some major studio productions and then he just faded away this movie really blows but if you have not seen a biker movie in a long time it is a good one to watch at the end of the movie you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it
<START> i'm a huge fan of the twin sisters although this was one of their not <UNK> good movies i'm not saying it's bad i can't say it's bad but this whole popular and not popular <UNK> isn't good although i give this movie a 4
<START> we have reached the ceiling of <UNK> with this movie basically dinosaurs come aboard this ship <UNK> by some weird old fart named <UNK> which i needed after i watched this movie apparently <UNK> hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation the dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter too bad the screenwriters didn't have it by the way does it seem weird that out of all the wishes of the children in the world <UNK> <UNK> the wish of bringing dinosaurs to modern times why not grant the wishes of kids to stop <UNK> disease war i mean come on doesn't <UNK> have anything better to do with all this power he has finally when the dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing dancing and <UNK> havoc basically the kind of thing you might see on a bad <UNK> trip i mean where else could you see a t rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of spider man they end up in the circus and <UNK> brother <UNK> makes the kids that have <UNK> the dinosaurs sign a blank contract why why would kids sign a blank contract <UNK> says that if the dinosaurs take some brain drain that he will let the children go the dinosaurs instead of <UNK> apart the evil <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> give in and agree to his terms what this is stupid they could have just <UNK> him made him drop the contract eaten it then walked off with the kids i think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad which is a <UNK> point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and apparently completely eat him oh yeah that's not violent at all we're back makes no sense it's not fun it's goofy it's stupid poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film even for a kid's film this is bad
<START> passing stones definitely one of the best comedy independent films ever you must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one this film for some reason hasn't received its credit due first lets start with the story line everyone loves a good treasure hunt when a dead father leaves letters behind <UNK> of a hidden treasure it not only brings two families together but starts a <UNK> adventure mix in a polish <UNK> a <UNK> mother a crack head with <UNK> syndrome a twisted homosexual <UNK> and one drag queen money not only makes the world go round but can turn family into enemies my favorite character in this film would have to be the sister crack addict with <UNK> syndrome her sudden out burst will have you crying and <UNK> for weeks
<START> i had recently been watching johnny test in an attempt to find humor in it i failed horribly cartoon network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences but johnny test is entertainment in it's lowest form the writing is incredibly predictable and the running gags aren't much gags at all kids will love it and that's about it br br now this isn't to say that it's all bad the original opening theme was actually pretty catchy but for some reason they took the <UNK> of it and <UNK> <UNK> it with a <UNK> <UNK> bat it's a shame because that was really one of the best things it had going for it br br some of the characters could be very interesting in theory with a little work the characters could work well together but they're too one dimensional then again this makes it easy for the kids to follow br br the pace is a bit too fast as well the episodes are too busy leaving little time for clever writing this is a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth on the upside however the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest and that's really the entirety of the target audience br br overall the show looks very good on paper but just doesn't succeed in being funny or interesting this is a show i want to like but i'm incapable of it there's just so much potential that isn't realized kids will enjoy it but that's about it
<START> the season finale sent mix messages i felt feelings of joy and also feelings of being <UNK> to and <UNK> <UNK> tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband dan had died she also admits the family never won the <UNK> and what season 9 was a lie just being how she wished or wanted it to be i'm still confused about when she said <UNK> ended up with david and <UNK> with mark because <UNK> and mark admit to being pregnant so i believe that is just how she wanted it to be but it wasn't so the season finale was good but sent mixed feelings i will always be a fan of the show
<START> a movie has rarely left me as cold as this one there is not a bit of tension not a second of fear not a moment we jump even a little bit the girl is cute yeah that's it was that worth a movie i knew it wasn't supposed to be a great movie but i was at least expecting one
<START> i <UNK> disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film the only reason why i didn't rate it 1 for awful was due to the great talent of carmen miranda the beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing br br the problem is with the rest of the picture alice faye comes off quite hollow don <UNK> has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material he comes off so terribly corny br br the plot is a real stiff here with <UNK> assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to faye br br it seems that by playing the song and dance man <UNK> marriage gets a second change to <UNK> some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both parts br br s z <UNK> is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine <UNK> for j <UNK> <UNK> who actually appears uncomfortable in his role br br this is a <UNK> <UNK> boom bomb of a film
<START> i stopped five minutes in when beowulf was given a double shot automatic <UNK> with sights on it not only do <UNK> not have <UNK> sights but beowulf beat grendel in hand to hand combat the terrible wooden acting and eternal darkness that <UNK> all sci fi original movies didn't help either having only gotten a few minutes in before i felt my <UNK> rise and decided to watch i love lucy reruns instead that's really about all i have to say but you might as well just realize that it's a made for tv movie and skip it right there br br a travesty
<START> this film was a disaster from start to finish interspersed with performances from the next generation of beautiful losers are interviews with <UNK> and the edge as well as the performers themselves this leaves little time for the clips of leonard cohen himself who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence wisdom and humor the rest are too busy trying to <UNK> him as st leonard or as some old testament prophet many of the performances are forgettable over interpretations especially <UNK> martha <UNK> or bland under achievements only beth <UNK> and anthony got within striking distance of <UNK> own versions by using a little restraint annoying little pseudo avant garde gestures are <UNK> throughout the film like out of focus <UNK> of red <UNK> over many of the concert and interview shots shaky <UNK> camera work use of digital <UNK> on some of leonard <UNK> comments making it harder to hear what's being said and a spooky pretentious low <UNK> under a lot of the interview segments an attempt at added <UNK> for the real thing see the songs from the life of documentary produced by the bbc in 1988
<START> i was really hoping that this would be a funny show given all the hype and the clever preview clips and talk about hype i even heard an interview with the show's creator on the bbc world today a show that is broadcast all over the world br br unfortunately this show doesn't even come close to delivering all of the jokes are obvious the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame and they are not given any new treatment or twist all of the characters are one dimensional the acting is well mediocre i'm being nice it's the classic cbc recipe one that always fails br br if you're muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either <UNK> ignorant or both not that making fun of white people is a problem most of the better comedies are <UNK> in that it's only a problem when it isn't funny as in this show br br canada is <UNK> with funny people so many that we <UNK> them to hollywood on a regular basis so how come the producers of this show couldn't find any
<START> my family goes back to new orleans late <UNK> early <UNK> and in watching the movie i knew it was a history my grand parents never talked about but we knew it existed i have cousins obviously black aka african americans and others who can pass as white and chose not to it's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that <UNK> river is all a part of that history it makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the <UNK> of my great <UNK> who owned those <UNK> and wonder in awe of how my great <UNK> of african <UNK> lived under that oppressive and yet <UNK> existence and at the same time had i not come out of that history i probably wouldn't be the successful business woman i am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world the acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor but it is a movie that needed to be made anne rice is incredible and i ask myself why is she <UNK> writing about my family and i'm not i recommend this movie to everyone <UNK>
<START> this is one really bad movie i've <UNK> my brain and i cannot come up with one positive comment to make the acting is atrocious i've seen more believable performances on cable access the plot is ridiculous stolen <UNK> secret <UNK> of the president and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst night of the sharks isn't even so bad it's good the dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed and to top it off night of the sharks has the worst soundtrack i've ever heard i'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s <UNK> <UNK> sounds that someone actually bothered to record br br from everything i've read the italian film industry was dead by 1987 night of the sharks is like a final nail in the coffin
<START> maria <UNK> got married right in the middle of combat all around her and her husband <UNK> an explosion ripped through the building to begin with and she and <UNK> had to sign the papers on a pile of <UNK> on the street perhaps this may strike some as a heavy handed metaphor for what's about to come marriage on the rocks so to speak it's a <UNK> where the husband goes off to war and is held in a russian prison camp <UNK> to the helpless but hopeful and proud maria who keeps standing by the depressing <UNK> of the train station as some come home others don't with a sign awaiting <UNK> br br trouble <UNK> as happens in rainer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and as its one of his best and most provocative we see as maria <UNK> gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> in this role will do a two face she'll stand by her man even if it means working at a bar for american <UNK> and even still after she hears from a fellow soldier that <UNK> has died will still stand by him as she sleeps with a black <UNK> and comes close to bearing his child that is naturally until he <UNK> and a murder occurs and he takes the rap so she can be safe or working for a german businessman effectively sympathetic <UNK> <UNK> and becoming his sometimes mistress and rising star in the company maria will do whatever it takes to be successful but she'll always be married br br it's hard to say there's anything about maria that isn't fascinating money sex power all of these become <UNK> for maria she's like the feminist that has her cake and eats it with a <UNK> smile she gets to have a husband more or less actually a lot less until the last ten minutes of the film while <UNK> things a man who <UNK> on her whenever he can a new and expensive house with servants a secretary money that others around her aren't getting due to already being with a man or too weak in a position to rise anywhere such as the secretary played interestingly enough by <UNK> own mother br br maria is sexy confident and all alone with an <UNK> life going against a life that should be made in the <UNK> she says of the two men the american soldier and poor old and sick <UNK> that she's fond of them and at the same time will stick by those <UNK> the confused and soul searching husband <UNK> sends from canada after being released from prison she's casts a profile that a feminist would love to <UNK> but understand where she's coming from and going all the way br br fassbinder employs this inherent <UNK> and moments with maria appear to go against the conventions of a melodrama for example <UNK> walking in on the <UNK> and half naked maria and <UNK> is just about a masterpiece of a scene with <UNK> reaction not of surprise or guilt but pure happiness to see that he's there let alone alive while sticking to his guns as a director of such high minded technique with a storyline that should be predictable but it isn't really it's like one big metaphor for a country that after the war couldn't really move on to <UNK> a few times fassbinder puts sound of the radio on in the background and we see maria walking around her family house <UNK> and <UNK> going on around her and the radio speaks of a divided germany of things still very <UNK> of a <UNK> maybe the only way to cope is excess or maybe that's just my interpretation of it br br it's hard to tell really under <UNK> stare face and eyes anyway it's such an incredible performance really one of those <UNK> that captures the <UNK> and <UNK> of an old time hollywood female star while with the down and dirty <UNK> of a girl of the streets most telling are the <UNK> costumes one sees in one scene when she finally is with her husband where she stars in one of those super <UNK> black <UNK> pieces and high heels and then moves on to a dress without even thinking about it that's almost the essence of what maria is and <UNK> wonderfully gets it down a <UNK> but somehow loving figure who is <UNK> and <UNK> by the men around her sometimes in a single sentence this is what fassbinder captures in his wonderful first part of his trilogy while i might overall prefer <UNK> <UNK> as a masterpiece maria <UNK> is perhaps just as good as a character study of what makes a woman <UNK> and <UNK> with almost nothing to lose
<START> man what a <UNK> this turned out to be not because it wasn't any good as i wasn't really expecting anything from it but because i was <UNK> by the dvd <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> its stars as being stuart <UNK> stella stevens and tony bill sure enough their names did not appear in the film's opening credits much less themselves in the rest of it as it turned out the only movie which <UNK> those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady 1975  but what that one has to do with the <UNK> lake monster is <UNK> <UNK> br br even so since i paid 1 50 for its rental and i was in a monster movie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and <UNK> it <UNK> apart from the fact that it had a no name cast and an anonymous crew an <UNK> amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jaws like <UNK> and intentionally so at the <UNK> antics of two moronic <UNK> <UNK> boat owners who frequently <UNK> among themselves with the <UNK> local sheriff looking on the creature itself  a <UNK> i e half dinosaur half fish  is <UNK> realized naturally but as had been the case with the giant claw 1957 which i've also just seen this didn't seem to bother the film makers none as they <UNK> it as much as they can especially during the movie's second half
<START> perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> ends ' from a really excellent script by ben <UNK> based on the novel <UNK> <UNK> by frank <UNK> br br dana andrews is the honest tough new york policeman always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong arm methods as much as he <UNK> crooks when he hit someone his <UNK> hurt and the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain gary <UNK> who points up the title <UNK> are you always trying to push me in the <UNK> ' he asks andrews 'i have as much right on the sidewalk as you ' br br dana <UNK> obsession and <UNK> are <UNK> in his hidden painful discovery that he is the son of a thief his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private <UNK> br br by a twist of irony unique to the film itself dana andrews and gene tierney of <UNK> are united once more and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later but no longer the romantic beaten down by his job by the cheap crooks this time he goes too far and accidentally kills a suspect the killing is accidental the victim worthless yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail br br using his knowledge of police <UNK> he covers up his part in the crime plants false clues and tries to <UNK> a gang leader but cannot avoid investigating the case himself the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without <UNK> himself in the murder is beautifully <UNK> and the final solution is both logical satisfying and in no way a compromise br br the film is one of the best detective films of the 50's with curious moral values also one of <UNK> best br br preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique <UNK> pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to <UNK> his suspense in realism
<START> i'm not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan an advice <UNK> who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend its a story thats been told before but not like this there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be the cast is wonderful and even if carell is not my cup of tea he is quite good as the widower who's suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film worth a look see
<START> think of the ending of the grudge 2 with the following br br a man who repeatedly says the word sunshine a cowboy a love story sarah michelle <UNK> cutting herself and a creepy mirror br br oh and underwater sea animals <UNK> br br not a good movie i seriously did not enjoy it whatsoever the poster for the movie is extremely misleading as well and i found that it was just to suck people into watching it i can't believe i went br br save your time and money go watch saw iii a film where the writing makes you feel like there was effort put into it br br im mike and im out
<START> the only thing serious about this movie is the humor well worth the rental price i'll bet you watch it twice it's obvious that sutherland enjoyed his role
<START> the <UNK> animated disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story even though a little dated it deserves a place in the list of disney classics br br it's not among disney's top works but is satisfying one of disney's most simple works yes but keeps a certain magic and <UNK> which old disney is well known for this was an important movie because it saved disney from a delicate situation if this was a failure there wouldn't be any more disney animated classics br br cinderella is somehow like a return to disney's 1st animated classic snow white and the seven <UNK> because it brings back the fairy tale genre it's not clear where the story takes place but i suppose it's somewhere in france because this is based in a tale by charles <UNK> br br there are plenty of likable characters such as cinderella the prince bruno the dog <UNK> and gus the two main mice the fairy <UNK> for a fairy she sure is funny the birds the king and the grand duke br br <UNK> is very smart and amusing i love his voice really has that mouse like quality gus might not be that smart but he's humorous br br the king is hilarious but i think that what makes him so funny is his short temper the grand duke is a very cool <UNK> and funny too they're two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments br br the prince is certainly one of the most charming in disney no doubt that prince philip from sleeping beauty was inspired on this prince because they are very similar looking br br on the other hand lady <UNK> the stepmother isn't supposed to be likable because she's cold jealous bitter and cruel her daughters <UNK> and <UNK> aren't much better than her however the stepmother isn't as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters cinderella the main character has nothing to do with them cinderella is gentle kind pretty and lovable by the way i think her beautiful pink dress is much <UNK> than the one given by the fairy <UNK> br br <UNK> the cat is hilariously <UNK> the way he walks sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and <UNK> facial expressions make him funny ironically he's very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality he always agrees with the <UNK> attitudes towards cinderella <UNK> has the right name for him because he's such a <UNK> and mean cat yet there's nothing annoying about him br br the soundtrack is simple but pleasant although not among disney's best the best song in this movie is <UNK> <UNK> boo br br there are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this such as james macdonald marion <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and luis van <UNK> br br despite being simple looking the movie has good artwork as well as its nice details although never something out of this world however the king's palace is a spectacular masterpiece being truly <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series it has a down to earth kind of feel with darker and less <UNK> <UNK> br br the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential one thing that is fairly disappointing with all star trek series really is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the <UNK> between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else earth has stopped war <UNK> etc br br the female characters here are two <UNK> <UNK> who is <UNK> and <UNK> officer <UNK> who is human <UNK> is quite <UNK> and <UNK> is made to be a <UNK> babe br br some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american as opposed to the more international feel of the <UNK> crew but creates interesting dynamics br br a very good pilot though for a very good series
<START> this movie for what it is may be one of the most amazing indie films of recent day made on a super small budget the film has special effects that blow away alot of the current films if you have a chance watch it
<START> standard <UNK> for swedish movies today seem to be to start by throwing <UNK> out the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process <UNK> is another fine example of a movie making very little sense br br banks in <UNK> are being robbed by a highly efficient military <UNK> gang of robbers two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first br br as usual in swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again <UNK> <UNK> must be in every swedish film from the last few years but that's ok i guess since <UNK> is one of few that performs <UNK> here like he usually does the problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself first of all the <UNK> feel mostly like background rather this is more a movie about a young <UNK> fighting to prove herself in a male world like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of <UNK> <UNK> also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as aliens landing but still i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then it <UNK> things up a bit and actually saved the rating from dropping another step br br in the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other swedish movies of this kind simply that the action and suspense doesn't live up to the standards we are used to from other movies of this kind mostly hollywood it feels cheap and rather weak in comparison in my opinion swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting and forget about trying to make hollywood action light like they do now because this becomes yet another forgettable effort from the swedish movie industry i rate it 3 10
<START> chan <UNK> park is nothing if not inventive i'm a cyborg but that's ok is chock full of amusing little technical <UNK> with some ingenious ideas <UNK> in between attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of marc <UNK> and <UNK> city of lost children <UNK> park <UNK> on a <UNK> lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare hardly one to be <UNK> for his ambition or his vision it is genuinely unexpected then to see all <UNK> effort add up to so very little br br i'm a cyborg but that's ok seems astonishingly to <UNK> from itself as it goes along with the the end result being a <UNK> of the sum of its parts the premise is promising gags are <UNK> and offbeat humour <UNK> but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience the characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast but try as i might i could not bring myself to care for any br br sympathy for lady vengeance was a <UNK> <UNK> perhaps that park was <UNK> himself a little bit but it still managed to showcase some of the director's unique <UNK> and in the wake of an impressive filmography was readily forgiven none of the assured confidence that <UNK> joint security area or sympathy for mr vengeance is evident here i'm a cyborg but that's ok left me so utterly <UNK> i caught myself <UNK> fast <UNK> from time to time more regularly as the film progressed i gave lady a 5 10 and by that measure this probably deserves no more than a 3 for old <UNK> sake i'll be generous 4 10
<START> save the 8 <UNK> you'll spend at <UNK> to buy this dvd and go see the real film by steven spielberg br br i'm a filmmaker and being an avid fan of h g wells i had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment instead it took four days to finish watching this because i couldn't stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time it's horrible br br there are reports that timothy hines had a 20 million budget for this production where the heck did it go did he use most of it to buy a new house <UNK> his retirement or what let me start with what is actually good about this film it does stay true to the book and there are a few good performances in it i can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film but good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible and i do mean horrible special effects any <UNK> film school student could have done a much better job with the cgi to me most of it looked like stop action card board <UNK> that were used rather than sophisticated cgi <UNK> that a 20 million project should be using br br there's no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film my own partner and i sat down and <UNK> our version of the ferry scene using <UNK> that cost less than <UNK> 00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what hines created i've seen films with budgets of less than 2 million look better much better br br in my opinion the special effects used in the original king kong were more sophisticated and better than <UNK> special effects in this film in fact i have a much better appreciation for attack of the killer tomatoes because of this film there's no excuse with today's technology for a film to look like a 50's b movie unless that was the intention which shouldn't have been with this particular project br br a problem i had with the dvd transfer was that the film is jerky another <UNK> of amateur film making br br overall i have to say that i produced a 45 000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film br br i strongly encourage anyone who <UNK> good film making or who is a fan of <UNK> to leave this film on the shelf and watch attack of the 50 foot woman instead it would be easier on the eyes
<START> we've been served a terrible film br br okay i'll admit that since i'm white and have had no practical experience in the <UNK> world of step dancing i might not exactly be an authority on this type of film on the other hand i do know a bad motion picture when i see it br br and boy have i just seen it br br filmed in low budget vision and directed by ian <UNK> <UNK> a touch of pink how she move tells the tale of how important it is to follow one's dreams even if those dreams include <UNK> around to loud irritating hip hop music and speaking dialogue the average person would not understand if he or she had an international <UNK> br br i'll try to give a small synopsis of the plot first of all there are two actors that look like ll cool j who work in an auto shop in toronto the <UNK> of racial diversity but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day br br there are a few other guys in this crew including a token white dude and a guy that looks like denzel washington in malcolm x there are also two women in the movie one resembles <UNK> williams and the other looks like <UNK> from the old flip wilson show one of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all of her <UNK> on a drug addicted sibling the other girl a member of salt n <UNK> no doubt is just plain no good br br there's another guy who looks like eddie murphy's <UNK> while still another actor who's a <UNK> bear knock off these guys are rival step dancers evidently this activity is very hard core in the <UNK> and they are all practicing for the big step monster jam in detroit br br since i was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue perhaps some subtitles would have been useful as in a bergman film or that one music video by snow it's hard to explain what happens other than there's a lot of arguing the <UNK> williams girl who never smiles by the way becomes a <UNK> <UNK> moving from group to group there's some step dancing and a lot of irritating hip hop music br br it's a typical <UNK> to <UNK> story sort of like rocky with a really bad soundtrack <UNK> with annoying rap music in the background cry freedom without the laughs br br but why does a film which could have made a big impact on black audiences have to contain drug addiction bad parents and a title that sounds like a first <UNK> saying the phrase how she moves br br i was moved by this movie however moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible
<START> well i guess i'll have to be the one to say the emperor has no clothes when i saw this show listed for <UNK> last night i was both hopeful and <UNK> i loved morse even going so far as to buy the complete dvd set and felt that while i always liked kevin <UNK> sgt lewis character the show was john <UNK> period after watching the new inspector lewis as it is billed here i am more convinced then ever that i was right <UNK> is fine even though he looks awful both badly aged and too fat but he simply doesn't have the charisma to carry the show as did <UNK> br br and as for his sidekick fox well perhaps the reviewers here from england can understand what he's saying but i for one mostly could not br br as for ms innocent all i can say is that i miss james <UNK> br br i'm sorry to say that they should have left morse rest in peace
<START> this movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of <UNK> the ever shifting limits of <UNK> race relations and desire granted it is not a movie for everyone there are no car chases no buildings exploding no murders the drama lies in the tension suggested by <UNK> minimal gestures <UNK> boundaries lighting and things left sometimes very ostensibly <UNK> it's about identity memory community <UNK> the different parts of the movie work together to <UNK> the <UNK> of self and other identity desire limits and loss it will reward the <UNK> and sensitive viewer it will <UNK> those whose <UNK> require explosive massive <UNK> action it is a beautifully filmed human story that is all
<START> kids of whatever age do not want to know about their parents' sex lives and grown up children are often seriously <UNK> and <UNK> by any evidence that aging parents possess an active <UNK> lastly many <UNK> are very uncomfortable watching a <UNK> <UNK> widow who would pass <UNK> almost anywhere discover her <UNK> capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age br br the mother is a provocative look at a <UNK> filmed reality a woman who isn't ready to stay home watch the telly and <UNK> after her husband of nearly three decades and a controlling <UNK> <UNK> at that packs it in with a massive heart attack br br may anne reid and her husband have two children each dysfunctional in his or her own way the male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the <UNK> court with her <UNK> commercial venture paula <UNK> <UNK> is a teacher with aspirations of <UNK> as a writer she's attractive not pretty and she seems to have a close relationship with mum at first br br back at her house after <UNK> her husband may <UNK> to not stay there <UNK> typical <UNK> with its legacy of boring days and no adventure she goes to stay with paula who has a young son <UNK> boyfriend darren daniel craig is a <UNK> handsome <UNK> who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to <UNK> son's house may is quite taken with hard drinking coke <UNK> darren whose treatment of paula ought to have <UNK> may that he was for sure a fellow of the royal academy of <UNK> br br what follows is a <UNK> affair between darren and the <UNK> and now <UNK> alive dare i say <UNK> widow the love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist <UNK> pen and <UNK> sketches of their <UNK> which then play a role in the <UNK> drama or <UNK> take your pick br br the theater in manhattan was packed for today's early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of <UNK> age that some were shocked or disturbed to see her <UNK> herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement br br this <UNK> honest look at an older woman's <UNK> passion after decades of <UNK> <UNK> her husband's desire that she stay at home and raise kids she also mentions he didn't like her to have friends what a guy <UNK> a number of issues while <UNK> <UNK> with darren doesn't <UNK> incest there are real psychological <UNK> and issues with a mother <UNK> her daughter's lover and paula isn't made of the <UNK> stuff to begin with the affair once <UNK> allows the <UNK> open of the mother daughter relationship which from <UNK> viewpoint left something to be desired ms <UNK> is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother's support as well as her love she hasn't been dealt a terrible hand by life but it isn't a bed of <UNK> either br br may is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect indeed demand a future of happiness but she is also <UNK> vulnerable she's fishing in <UNK> emotional waters who controls her relationship with darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand much less resolve in her sixties she's still a work in progress br br <UNK> gotta give recently <UNK> mature sexuality but in an <UNK> <UNK> way <UNK> no viewer would be <UNK> after all it's jack nicholson and the always beautiful diane keaton <UNK> in the world of the rich and to <UNK> that no serious psycho social issues were explored keaton's young girlfriend amanda <UNK> daughter of keaton not only <UNK> the match but <UNK> that the audience knows she and her old er would be lover never <UNK> into the sack br br no easy out here anne <UNK> inspired performance forces <UNK> on some while drawing respect from others her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views br br kudos to director roger <UNK> for <UNK> a fascinating story with <UNK> and empathy br br 9 10
<START> while it contains facts that are not widely reported it is not exactly the truth they took a lot of liberties in <UNK> events <UNK> people and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30's there were more than just bonnie clyde and w d in the gang at various times and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included buck and <UNK> went to convince clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout and in fact got drawn back into crime some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night <UNK> wound was much more severe and never <UNK> right it was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it <UNK> up and even then it <UNK> up so she walked <UNK> clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe i know i'm being <UNK> <UNK> and it was a tv movie but even without these factual errors in this true story the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate <UNK> of their lives rather than being a cohesive flowing story br br i'd recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth
<START> the industry dropped the ball on this the trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens had people had an opportunity to see this work of mouth would have made it very successful the 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters i checked this out based on the rave recommendation richard <UNK> or ebert and <UNK> in his book an example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens which gave it no chance to be seen some movies go to video quickly because they aren't that good this is oscar worthy and it's a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on dvd or cable if you haven't see this movie you should great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie it could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films girl interrupted comes to mind if you like that you will like this br br both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic even though alicia is angry and deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic the movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school <UNK> is even better in this than in traffic i hope both of these actors get more roles that <UNK> their talents as well and let them shine see this movie and if you like recommend to friends so it doesn't get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year this movie was buried while <UNK> 2 tops records what kind of word are we living in <UNK> so to make the world right again see this and recommend it
<START> this film has slipped through the cracks of film history it is by far much better than some other new york films of the same era such as the french connection or the taking of <UNK> 1 2 3 there is a gritty reality to this film which also manages to effectively use humor to further the plot line it's engaging from start to finish and hasn't <UNK> with age as is the case with the above two examples br br ron <UNK> turns in a <UNK> performance as batman and it's a shame his career didn't take off as a result of this project br br gordon parks directs and coming as it does after <UNK> it at first appears to be a strange choice yet it is the flip side of that earlier effort and approached with just as much in your face <UNK> br br unfortunately this film has not been made available on either dvd or vhs in the united states united artists really has a gem on their hands and it's a shame they're not doing anything with it
<START> as some other comments show this movie might scare you when you're a little child and that is probably all that it is good for br br however if you're older this movie only does one thing suck <UNK> and thereby i don't mean the acting its soundtrack cutting or s <UNK> like that i'm simply talking about the plot if you can call it that br br spoilers ahead br br i don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary if after reading this you really still want to watch this movie but if you <UNK> from any school this is just a big insult of your intelligence when watching this i was stunned most of the time because what was happening was just that stupid br br this includes br br the <UNK> of <UNK> an evil un association br br we are just supposed to believe it's evil is it even evil at all if so why is it evil br br the mark of evil in the form of a <UNK> br br there is no necessity to <UNK> this on the people so why the hell no pun intended are they doing it br br <UNK> christ to your heart merely as lip service br br because there's nothing anybody who in this movie is considered a real christian ever does besides saying that stupid <UNK> so just say that <UNK> before the rapture and you're saved no matter what br br thus rating 1 10
<START> it was so terrible it wasn't fun to watch at all even the scene where the girl is using a <UNK> even that's not fun to watch in this movie i say again the scene where a girl is <UNK> with a <UNK> is not even fun to watch or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched just girl on couch using a <UNK> maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level my advice fast forward to that point watch it <UNK> the movie watch it again <UNK> repeat maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way this movie ranks alongside i spit on your grave and doom generation in the category of worst movies that i have ever seen
<START> i work in a library and expected to like this movie when it came out 5 years ago well i liked parker posey a lot she's a wonderful actress and omar <UNK> was really cute as her boyfriend he couldn't act but when you look like him who cares but the movie was bad it wasn't funny or cute or much of anything posey kept the movie <UNK> with her energy but she learned the <UNK> <UNK> system overnight and then shelves tons of books to the beat of music come on also i did have a problem with the way she looked when she became a full <UNK> <UNK> at the end hair in a <UNK> glasses no sense of humor can we let that stereotype go please worth seeing for posey and <UNK> but that's about it the tv series was much better
<START> i can't believe we don't have that 70's show anymore i have all 8 seasons of that 70's show i absolutely love it i lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before i go to sleep at the end of a long busy day it's nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep i was so sad they took the show off air at least we still have the re runs i am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion like maybe when donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and eric get married wouldn't that be awesome it would be even better if they would continue it for several years
<START> back when i was a kid and i lived with my sister she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them <UNK> had just became a household item and we didn't have but about 150 movies and we watched the hell out of all of them br br i was at a yard sale the other day and i saw this vhs copy of blood legacy and i buy any horror movie i don't have and i knew this movie looked familiar i thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought she had sold it years ago in a yard sale i am guessing who knows br br i didn't recall anything at all about it and i watched it the night i bought it and it <UNK> my memory because of a few scenes i am not sure how i felt about it as a kid but i am sure i enjoyed it because it was new to me and i'd watch and enjoy anything back then br br i am a horror freak but there are certain <UNK> in order for me to consider it good and this one fell very short it was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types what death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and thats if you're lucky you get that much br br the story is good and i have seen a few with similar plots so i think this one should be buried and forgotten don't watch this people unless you're hard up
<START> i think my summary sums it up i found it inane and stupid i also saw the ending a mile a way everyone is <UNK> that ending anymore when doing a tv theater <UNK> anymore sometimes it's better to let the movie stand alone br br others its better to forget the movie altogether this is one of the others
<START> a handful of critics have awarded this film with positive comments i don't wish to argue with their opinion but i strongly disagree when i first watched this film i was mildly impressed but after comparing it with other films particularly with the late master bruce lee i quickly changed my mind in fact if it wasn't for the title of the film i would never have bought it game of death 2 doesn't relate to the original game of death except it shares one character billy lo br br i was stunned to see how similar game of death 2 was compared to enter the dragon the plots have striking similarities both bruce lee and bobby lo are on a mission to avenge a relative the two locations are similar in which they both are very isolated and are surrounded by thousands of <UNK> there is an element of prostitution in both films women are sent two the guests rooms in both films both han enter the dragon and <UNK> henchman have a hand missing their is an underground drug operation in enter the dragon believe it or not there is one in game of death 2 han has a pet cat in enter the dragon the director has used his imagination and awarded lewis with a pet monkey the list continues br br regarding other aspects of the film such as the script and the acting i felt it was very poor it seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the film and <UNK> they could act br br on a positive scale i cannot deny that the choreography is impressive although the fighting sequences have strong elements of <UNK> in them they are none the less <UNK> performed however as the plot is <UNK> i couldn't relate to the characters therefore the fighting sequences were more <UNK> rather than having a meaning to the film br br in conclusion i would say this film is <UNK> to any martial arts fans but for those who enjoy a solid action film with a good storyline and strong characters i seriously wouldn't recommend this film my opinions towards this film may seem very bias and one sided but when bruce lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema particularly after his masterpiece enter the dragon this film failed to rise to these standards if anything they <UNK> a truly brilliant martial arts film in hope of achieving the same level of fame br br in reference to my <UNK> <UNK> this film a very harsh 1 out of 10 the film is <UNK> watchable and must be thankful that it had the fighting sequences it did
<START> my friend bought the movie for <UNK> its is not even 1 <UNK> worth because they wrote it was like american pie but we would soon find out that there is a long way from american pie to that piece of crap it is not even a comedy its more like a really really really bad documentary not only the story is bad the picture and sound also sucks to they put in some alcohol chicks <UNK> and drunken teens and the result is a disaster if you see this movie don't buy it rather spend your money on something else and better if you are gonna torture yourself then don't invite your friend s unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them
<START> when i look back on my college days at <UNK> university there will always be one event in which i will remember with fond memories channel 23 is <UNK> local access channel and until the last few years pretty much played anything they were sent this included many <UNK> movies ranging from a guy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and then <UNK> pictures of them online to a version of <UNK> starring <UNK> <UNK> who had apparently just learned how to make <UNK> br br however the king in my opinion of the channel 23 <UNK> was midnight <UNK> the first time i watched it was around <UNK> i should have been studying or sleeping or watching regular tv but no all that is for <UNK> my roommate and i watched midnight <UNK> and when it was complete i don't think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened but sure enough it was on a few nights later and we had to come to grips that this movie did in fact exist br br i could go on and on about how awful it is but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living the plot is disjointed the acting terrible the everything soul <UNK> but by god if there are others watching with you its impossible not to have a good time watching it its sort of like the first time you hear guts by chuck <UNK> you hear it you're disgusted and <UNK> but five minutes later all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the <UNK> horror you just endured br br long story short midnight <UNK> for all of its epic flaws makes for some very late night fun plus i desperately want the theme to midnight <UNK> kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it sweet god i love that song
<START> if you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old <UNK> who fall in love during the american league <UNK> race satisfying on the other hand if you are hanging around waiting for kill bill volume 3 or sin city 2 then you probably should stay away the plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl's friends girl meets guy's friends and guy meets girl's parents scenes there is even a guy meets girl's pet dog scene that's all par for the course in a movie like this however what i liked about it was that the plot <UNK> into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact a bit quirky the plot centers around answering the questions how much <UNK> is too much and how much love does it take to <UNK> those quirks it is interesting to see the characters work that out because deep down if we admit it we all have quirks barrymore does a very good job in her role and fallon sorta surprised me he's good as well i rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy add one point if you are a baseball fan or <UNK> involved with one add another point if you are a red sox fan and <UNK> two points if you are a <UNK> fan
<START> damn was that a lot to take in i was pretty much <UNK> throughout it was pretty perfect though i would say the editing had a lot to do with that i can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them anton especially to get all of this footage without any serious <UNK> the <UNK> did come off well together middle class kids who took advantage of their situation and rightly so i felt bad for <UNK> and especially for anton which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt great piece of film making and great choice of subject s i recommend this to any music film fan you'll probably learn something about film making
<START> for someone who remembers jane in the daily mirror strip cartoon viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia in that context it is wonderful but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters the <UNK> is also a bit limp for today's audience but reflects the <UNK> of the 40s and 50s very well jane you must remember was part of the <UNK> fantasy of the wartime years created to boost the <UNK> of the troops she gave a double meaning to the strip in strip cartoon br br the story has something in common with the tales of edgar rice <UNK> and rider <UNK> the theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era a bunch of bumbling nazis <UNK> by a few equally bumbling <UNK> and set in the african jungle of course br br for jane fans a must see for the rest of you a <UNK> <UNK> br br
<START> the hysterical thing about this movie is that according to the director it has difficulty finding a <UNK> in the u s because most of them that viewed it couldn't <UNK> the seemingly <UNK> messages of christianity and american angst the thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable br br because a minister at a mission <UNK> with the homeless or wishes someone <UNK> this makes it a christian movie one could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the land of plenty with all of its material excess the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible <UNK> plenty of unfortunate or <UNK> maybe plenty of useless homeless missions how about plenty of psycho vietnam vets as a <UNK> popping <UNK> survivor of agent pink are we to think america is a land of plenty of paranoid <UNK> maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients certainly we don't have plenty of people concerned about <UNK> politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film of course if you worked in a german homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how europe is the continent of plenty when it comes to sophistication br br indeed i agreed with the title in the end as the united states is the land of plenty and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts amateur acting and <UNK> directed films life is too short and one even an american doesn't have plenty of time to waste watching this piece
<START> winchester '73 was the film that moved mann from the b movies to the big league <UNK> james stewart's <UNK> post war career in the process by casting him as a conflicted hero although since he inherited the project from fritz lang maybe lang deserves the credit for that both men would go to much darker places mann with the remarkably bleak devil's <UNK> which remained <UNK> by mgm until the success of broken arrow convinced them to release it  but a movie about a man hunting down his own brother as the rifle of the title is handed from person to person along the trail before it ends up in one of the director's beloved <UNK> <UNK> is still stronger meat than you'd expect from the studio system great dialogue an impressive supporting cast  dan duryea will <UNK> <UNK> mitchell stephen <UNK> shelley winters charles drake tim mcintire jay c <UNK> tony curtis rock hudson among them  and <UNK> outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one
<START> i saw this movie on the <UNK> festival in <UNK> spring 2004 what a surprise this german production a stylish and imaginative shocker is one of the scariest <UNK> i have seen be warned this is not a joke this <UNK> has a big cast of good actors as an example peter <UNK> as a european guru has a strong presence excellent direction nice production design a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore <UNK> like italian horror movies in the eighties flesh ripped clean to the bone and the blood runs red this savage heart <UNK> will grip you and give you some dark dreams a must see
<START> first off i'd like to make a <UNK> on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the best picture academy award was <UNK> in 1958 that is <UNK> as <UNK> side <UNK> won in <UNK> <UNK> fair <UNK> won in 1965 and <UNK> of <UNK> won the year after that that said this film is absolutely fantastic the story from the novel has been somewhat altered but that's more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just didn't change back for a filmed version however i don't mind in fact i rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does i like nancy bringing oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment the subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh i love the moment mr <UNK> and mrs <UNK> start coming out at the beginning from the <UNK> office the <UNK> for that moment is brilliant my three favorite actors for this film were jack wild who plays the best <UNK> in any film version of the story ron moody a playful and humorous fagin this character is worked out much better than he is in the book and <UNK> <UNK> who is the strongest most <UNK> version of nancy the only reason i'm giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> will buy ' i always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday <UNK> and jobs it looks awful and cheesy especially when they're dancing at the london meat co they should've just done regular choreography for these scenes however this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us hopefully forever
<START> stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things action and thrills the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict <UNK> from prison in order to perform some mysterious task richard widmark edward albert and eli <UNK> are his <UNK> they presumably work for the government but that like most of the movie's plot line is never made clear hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere while it <UNK> to be like night moves and the <UNK> view the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it <UNK> direction is devoid of any style it's a very sunny movie br br the acting is fine with hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad widmark and <UNK> are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as <UNK> cruel <UNK> even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as <UNK> sidekick one <UNK> however is the casting of <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> wife we're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern <UNK> <UNK> idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig it's a role better suited for the likes of valerie <UNK> or susan <UNK>
<START> let's begin with that theme song sung by christopher cross the song is if you get caught between the moon and new york city it's a great theme and song even after all these years it never gets <UNK> it really is a great song about new york city as well anyway the great dudley moore <UNK> stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to jill <UNK> character in the film jill would later star on la law anyway he is served by his wonderful british butler sir john gielgud <UNK> who won an academy award for his performance in the film as best supporting actor arthur falls in love with <UNK> <UNK> character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her oscar winning role in <UNK> no <UNK> doesn't get to sing she plays a diner waitress anyway i love <UNK> fitzgerald as the bach <UNK> of the family who decides the family's fortune anyway she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for best supporting actress barney martin best known as <UNK> dad on seinfeld plays <UNK> dad he's great too the movie was well written acted and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it
<START> looking back over the past 28 years since my first exposure to the show all i can say is once you get it it will stay with you forever i remember my initial reaction being 1 annoyingly <UNK> 2 under produced 3 unlikeable characters br br well two years later i watched some episodes again and didn't find it nearly as annoying a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became <UNK> in it's bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness yes the show has a style that is not for everybody and i'm sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now but i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague <UNK> eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times br br btw i am a married man for all who think this is a show for females
<START> the characters are unlikeable and the script is awful it's a waste of the talents of <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> very disappointing version of <UNK> <UNK> too many missing characters no romantic scenes changes in story line too short appeared low budget hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you're not familiar with the novel in some scenes it looks like <UNK> has a cold sore on her upper lip i'm sure make up did it's best to hide it i guess they didn't want to halt filming until it <UNK> up pity most likely why this movie lacked kissing scenes only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end <UNK> <UNK> is a great epic tale and should be told true the 2000 version of <UNK> <UNK> is twice as long more romantic much more enjoyable and more true to the book
<START> and forget this completely if you really need to see madonna act rent body of evidence at least willem <UNK> is in that one br br in this film while the sets are beautiful you may want to mute the dialog you won't miss anything bruce <UNK> is wasted <UNK> <UNK> is a prop and madonna is so awful it becomes amusing why they had to butcher the original film into this mess i will never know guess they thought it was <UNK> madonna as an actress certainly is not br br if you rent the original film from 1979 though you will enjoy it and the actors in it can actually act 1 10
<START> if you didn't know better you would believe the christian moral majority in their preachy <UNK> of the sins of the young their <UNK> for satan and that hell was just <UNK> with advanced <UNK> and dragons fans br br none of these items bears one grain of truth folks this work does nothing but give the southern <UNK> a chance to take a breath while the movie continues to <UNK> their <UNK> and <UNK> views concerning a creative and original <UNK> system br br tom hanks contributes a stellar performance for this work but even that wasn't enough to save it it's crap it's beneath crap it is ignorance <UNK> ignorance and as such it rates nothing from br br the fiend
<START> <UNK> <UNK> contribution to the american cinema is enormous his legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever as is the case with the shop around the corner this film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play without the charm or <UNK> of mr <UNK> own and definite version br br margaret <UNK> and james stewart worked in several films together their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don't know of one another but who fate had them working together in the same shop in <UNK> br br the reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture in here we have the wonderful frank morgan playing the owner of the shop also we see joseph <UNK> felix <UNK> william tracy and charles smith among others doing impressive work in making us believe that yes they are in <UNK> br br that is why these films will live forever
<START> a mouse in the house is a very classic cartoon by tom jerry faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own it is hysterical hilarious very entertaining and quite amusing artwork is of good quality either br br this short isn't just about tom trying to catch jerry butch lives in the same house and he's trying to catch the mouse too because <UNK> only going to be one cat in this house in the morning and that's the cat that catches the <UNK> br br if you ask me there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon the funniest for me are for example when <UNK> two shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says <UNK> <UNK> glad you're enjoying the <UNK> and that she hopes they're satisfied because she ain't making the two cats gasp another funny gag is when tom <UNK> himself as <UNK> two shoes and <UNK> butch with a <UNK> pan and then butch does the same trick to tom of course that even funnier than this is when the real <UNK> two shoes appears and both dumb cats think they are seeing each other disguised as <UNK> and then they both attack her on the rear lol naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad she isn't someone to mess with but even jerry doesn't win this time because he is <UNK> by her too
<START> okay this has been a favourite since i was 14 granted i don't watch it multiple times a year anymore but this is not a movie for an older generation who want a deeper meaning or some brilliant message this movie is fun it's pretty dated almost <UNK> but parker posey is so brilliant that it's unbelievable if you want to be <UNK> by a 90's breakfast at <UNK> attended 90's <UNK> or love parker this movie is for you otherwise don't bother
<START> any true wrestling fan would have to consider this <UNK> to be one of if not the best of all time it was packed with excitement and surprises one of the greatest matches of all time was between shawn michaels and steve austin with special guest <UNK> mike <UNK> the show that michaels put on was unbelievable especially considering the shape that his back was in and that this was his last match
<START> the last i believe of the movies the boys made with hal roach this is also the last truly funny film they made before going to 20th century fox which so <UNK> <UNK> their talents although there are weak moments the business with the lung <UNK> for instance is a bit ah overblown but worth having just to see dr jimmy <UNK> but on the whole this flick is a good summary of what the boys brought to the screen richard <UNK> uncredited appeared in other l h flicks and he is delightfully threatening here as the convict nick granger the scene where the boys have to eat their own <UNK> meal looks good <UNK> good and it probably tastes good eat it is one of my favorite moments in the <UNK> stan ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans
<START> closer to reality and containing more depth than <UNK> stan <UNK> beat street is still a pretty dull show again this <UNK> is really only <UNK> in on the <UNK> <UNK> but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother all growing up in queens new york each has their own unique talent one is a hustler one a d j another an artist who creates <UNK> while little <UNK> lee is a hot <UNK> <UNK> dancer br br <UNK> is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the <UNK> dancing to save the day br br choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes but this alone is not enough to lift beat street to greater heights unfortunately the film really falls flat late on after showing a <UNK> of hope that it just might get interesting br br sunday august 25 1996 video
<START> larry <UNK> yep same guy who did attack of the the eye creatures and two count 'em two conspiracy movies about marilyn monroe he's to blame here br br adding onto his ever growing pile of <UNK> left over from oliver <UNK> eh i grew out of it conspiracy <UNK> here's down on us i e beyond the doors which is the working definition of historical <UNK> br br forget everything you thought you knew about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jim <UNK> says big <UNK> <UNK> this is the real deal <UNK> the three big names in rock of the '60s were killed by the government because they were <UNK> or counter <UNK> to truth justice and the american way or <UNK> like that there i knew it all along br br anyway three people <UNK> meryl wolf who look <UNK> like their real life shadows that is if you completely close your eyes turn your backs and walk five miles away from them show that instead of their recorded deaths the good old us of a put hits out on them yep it's the truth br br man i cannot believed i watched this movie it's facts when not <UNK> credibility to the <UNK> point are ludicrous the acting makes tv commercials look like high drama and if you honestly watch it through to the end you deserve the twist ending you really really do i swear genius br br but like the man said rock and roll is dead long live rock and roll br br not this flick though br br no stars for down on us and that's the movie audience describing the film by the way
<START> though i'm not the biggest fan of <UNK> based martial arts films when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting i get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of <UNK> plotting and crazy flying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much <UNK> beauty the great tragic leslie cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky <UNK> <UNK> performance is filled with naive but <UNK> charm and wu ma is <UNK> off the wall as the <UNK> monk who shows off some <UNK> and even gets a musical number perhaps best off all is joey wang as the fox spirit truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture <UNK> seductive the film takes in elements of fantasy horror comedy and romance all <UNK> together into a constantly entertaining package <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> directing and handling the choreography gives some neat <UNK> thrills and fills the film with <UNK> shadows and <UNK> enthralling <UNK> forest colours giving every forest scene a wonderfully <UNK> atmosphere also notable are the elaborate hair <UNK> and gorgeous flowing <UNK> of the female characters with if i'm not mistaken joey wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times a marvellous touch though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times this is a beautiful piece of entertainment with <UNK> characters and plotting even the odd neat character arc a near constant supply of visual treats and <UNK> dreamy atmosphere an <UNK> treasure highly recommended
<START> i heard a few friends one day saying that scarface sucks some idiot tried to make another godfather set in the early 80s now i <UNK> listen to idiots watch <UNK> so i decided i'd stay away from it then my mate handed me the dvd and said this is 1 with the <UNK> confused i tried it this is the best film ever made it's more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford <UNK> there is some humor though i e the <UNK> and the light 80s music still whats better than al pacino wielding an <UNK> i give this a out of perfect for fans of al or <UNK> vice city
<START> i remember this game it was always sitting on the shelves alone until one day i decided to try something new for a change and got this game i <UNK> in awe at it since it was the first ever game for the <UNK> that i owned that had 4 <UNK> when i played it i couldn't put the <UNK> down seriously br br the storyline of this game is so good and twisted it's almost as good as the final fantasy <UNK> storyline and that is hard to accomplish when you play the game you get so involved with the characters it's unbelievable that it's only a <UNK> game as it feels like a movie and i believe it should be made into a movie br br too bad this game is a very <UNK> of game and barely no one has played or liked it as it is one of those games that is sitting on the ends of the shelves with a 50 off sign sitting on it trying to sell well i am one of those people who always look at those on the ends and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good heck that is how i got into final fantasy <UNK> looking in a <UNK> and finding it but this is different than final fantasy br br legend of <UNK> is the only game or <UNK> that is better than most square <UNK> games surprisingly i wouldn't be surprised if it was made by square <UNK> but it's not hardly any games i play are better than the final fantasy series or the dragon quest series but this one is but what really bugs me is why it is very little known and is not praised which it should be br br graphics are pretty good for a <UNK> game but what can you expect from it it's <UNK> man made in 1999 story i have already mentioned is amazing almost beats <UNK> characters are a amazing you get involved so much with them and their actions br br a definite 10 out of 10 definitely deserved more praise and a very well done <UNK> by a company other than square <UNK>
<START> spoilers br br the unfunny radio <UNK> show host <UNK> and his mediocre band are the excuse for lugosi karloff and lorre to pick up a paycheck in this bland <UNK> watchable haunted house spoof lugosi is a <UNK> whose <UNK> are exposed as a <UNK> attempt to <UNK> an <UNK> fortune karloff is the butler and lorre is a professor who exposes fake <UNK> but it turns out that they're both in conspiracy with lugosi br br of course kay <UNK> and his band of 30 something year old kids <UNK> the truth with the minimum of possible humor along the way not recommended to any but the absolute horror <UNK>
<START> ah channel 5 of local mexican t v everyday at 2 00 a m they air horror movies from the 70's to early <UNK> it was return to cabin by the lake the movie that aired yesterday i regret for watching it br br the original cabin by the lake was a regularly popular low <UNK> and it was good accepted the problem is that this sequel is horrible not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original ugh the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word br br the movie at some points looks like a soap opera because of it's absurd dialogs cinematography and direction br br my advice is avoid this one at all costs it's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone not even for lovers of mediocre film making br br you have been warned
<START> this is an installment in the notorious guinea pig series a short lived japanese tv show that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young <UNK> by the show this short in the series is like all the other films in the series practically without any story a group of guys have captured a young woman they tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while <UNK> her they beat her pour <UNK> oil over her use <UNK> on her and finally in loving <UNK> push a <UNK> through her eye this is the most straightforward of all the guinea pig movies and one of the first it was probably this film more than any of the others that gave guinea pig the <UNK> of being snuff they certainly gave inspiration to nicolas <UNK> movie 8 <UNK> these movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles they have progressed to more polished but equally graphic movies like naked blood they probably fill the void left by the <UNK> movies that got slightly <UNK> up and became reality tv not recommended but will probably <UNK> those who will see anything once and wonder why afterwards i know i did
<START> this film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then <UNK> them in a formula 1 grand <UNK> not i might add the us grand <UNK> as everyone might pull out due to dodgy <UNK> and you might just win that is how far short this film falls now don't take this the wrong way i love b movies around half my collection is made of b movies but i don't think there are enough letters in the <UNK> to describe how bad this film is br br first of the story for a b movie isn't that bad it has potential there to make a b movie brand were not talking friday 13th potential but potential none the less but what really lets this film down is the acting at not one second do i believe anything it's like watching <UNK> except the <UNK> on <UNK> tend to have a <UNK> <UNK> br br in summary i'd like to say i've seen worse films but i can't
<START> one of the best records of <UNK> response to the murder of <UNK> extremely true and natural it captured the spirit of the nation especially important was the response of young people to the trauma of <UNK> loss and the feeling that we shall overcome
<START> the opening sequence is supposed to show the legion arriving in paris on 13 <UNK> <UNK> the troops pile off the train wearing the uniform in which the french army including the legion <UNK> off to war in <UNK> this a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey the french army realized by <UNK> that going to war in red <UNK> and dark blue <UNK> was not working <UNK> french troops were put into horizon blue and colonial troops were put into <UNK> the claude van damme <UNK> remake at least got the uniforms more or less right really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right
<START> someone actually gave this movie 2 stars there's a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn't spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary br br this film is well i guess it's pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits apart from the acting plot story sets dialogue and sound i wrongly assumed it was about zombies br br watching it is actually quite scary in fairness you're terrified someone will come over and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they'll go away thinking you're a freak that watches home made amateur torture videos or something along those lines br br i'm so taken <UNK> i'm writing this review on my mobile so i don't forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1 6 to save others from the same horrible fate that i just suffered br br i worst film i've ever seen and i can say with hand on heart it will never never be topped
<START> i first saw this movie in a theater in france a year or so ago it came and went with little <UNK> but i enjoyed it for the beauty of the landscape photography and the fascinating <UNK> footage the story while nice is really incidental if you actually thought about it there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life i just saw it again tonight here in the states on dvd again i gather it has very limited distribution blockbusters only had one copy of it and i don't recall it ever playing in the art houses in cleveland br br seen on my tv the photography is not as breathtaking though it is still very beautiful the <UNK> footage is still fascinating the story of the relationship between the 10 year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around when you know where it's headed br br still as i said the story is incidental it's a beautiful film to watch and if you like <UNK> footage you should find this fascinating
<START> over christmas break a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the <UNK> to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings to make the work a bit more difficult a murderous <UNK> wearing psycho is wandering the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> on the group in various violent ways br br <UNK> as one of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> listed by the u k in the 1980s the <UNK> that <UNK> blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing the term <UNK> <UNK> strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore violence sex etc all the things a horror fan dreams of so after hearing all of that info i settled into pranks <UNK> title expecting a sleazy slasher experience and that's what it tried to be but failed pretty much completely visually the film's not great the cinematography gore except for a couple scenes and overall direction all fail it's simply not enjoyable to watch the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason like the opening kill there are some cool death scenes including a pretty nice face melt which can be seen on the poster but that's about it for the positive the acting is pretty bad the story seems <UNK> the killer isn't cool or scary and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid it's a bit boring overall for a film done by a few <UNK> film students for 90 000 which would be over double that today the <UNK> that <UNK> blood isn't a total mess it has a couple good things and is fairly watchable but as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on <UNK> row and pieces it just cannot compare don't expect much and you may at least be entertained i hate to say it but this is one of the few films i've seen that would actually be better with a remake and yet they go after great works like black christmas oh well br br obligatory horror elements br br <UNK> slasher br br violence gore there are some brutally cool kills and the gore is okay for the most part but nothing special also they off screened some of the best murders br br sex nudity there's a little unappealing to me nudity but not very much br br cool killer s <UNK> the ending monologue s of the killer made him her pretty <UNK> br br scares suspense a jump scare or two but nothing too effective br br mystery i suppose yeah but i simply didn't care enough and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face br br br br final verdict 3 75 10 <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> this is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they're thoughts are i don't know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit it also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities put humans in the same position <UNK> the <UNK> would be out for once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice over for the first has been removed only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murder proving that after all animals are more interesting than people
<START> i watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then i'm pretty <UNK> of movies although i tried i just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on although i know it's suppose to be a comedy but i didn't find it very funny it was also an especially unrealistic and jaded portrayal of rural life in case this is what any of you think country life is like it's definitely not i do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute but the french guy was really fake i do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it it's just too annoying
<START> bad plot though good for a b movie good fast paced fight scenes at most a 5 out of 10 but something has always bothered me about this film how come <UNK> <UNK> never speaks in the tv version she shares several intimate moments with jeff <UNK> even a kiss in a garden yet in the regular video version most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all this bothers me because it not only takes out a female though cliched point of view to the film it also makes the final shot seem creepy this film would have been better had they kept her scenes in because in those scenes at least she has a personality one that <UNK> whatever <UNK> says
<START> there are so many incorrect statements in this so called documentary that i found myself shouting at the television br br bart <UNK> might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims br br he relies on either being inaccurate not telling the full story or the old favourite government always lies to us <UNK> and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims br br what's more his <UNK> or <UNK> footage is <UNK> available over the internet from various sites br br further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false <UNK> to gain interviews and has used creative editing of the <UNK> in order to promote his own opinions br br all of the claims made by mr <UNK> about inaccuracies mistakes or <UNK> in the apollo programme have been thoroughly <UNK> br br how do i get that 40 odd minutes of my life back
<START> i thought this was an awesome movie the theme song is sweet anyway the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning when everything should have been normal it was very weird and unrealistic the big cable company is mainly what i'm talking about apart from that the movie was very creative i think that all the acting was well done the actors acted out their characters' personalities perfectly everything fit together well it really is a shame that their isn't a soundtrack that would have been great because this is a canadian film and because it is one of my favorites i give this movie a 10 out of 10
<START> a previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad what the movie <UNK> child <UNK> oh but sylvia <UNK> was naked in it so let's give it 5 out of 10 stars why not a full 10 because the filmography was <UNK> the child's looks of shock were unrealistic and the fat friend was irritating nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an american movie in 1981 featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman i happened to catch this steaming <UNK> of a movie while staying at a hotel that had showtime to me even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an oscar i would still have to give the movie only 1 star that tv's howard <UNK> starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in <UNK> is particularly ridiculous but don't take my word for it
<START> holy freaking god all freaking mighty this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the <UNK> thing i've seen in quite some time this movie was more akin to lord of the g strings imho it's a real movie most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the <UNK> and you can tell there's no horse they're fleeing from alien monsters and going about the same speed as a swift <UNK> then it switches to a far shot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be sub par to <UNK> beyond the <UNK> eye i mean come on really it felt like a horrible episode of <UNK> only without kevin <UNK> there to save the day worst movie ever
<START> i watched this movie with my mother when i was in high school many years ago i definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time but he changed my views i enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since i even bought several of his <UNK> who cares what his acting abilities were he basically just played himself which was adorable he was so charming so charismatic i honestly just wanted to hug him i feel very sad that so many are <UNK> him so <UNK> it was so straight did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions he deserves to be respected and admired for his talent he will definitely be missed
<START> i found this movie to be very well paced the premise is quite imaginative and as a viewer i was pulled along as the characters developed the pacing is done very well for those that like to think enough is kept hidden from the viewer early on and questions keep <UNK> which are later answered producing a well thought out and very satisfying film both <UNK> and from an action standpoint br br it seems some people were looking for a non stop roller coaster ride with this film one of those that comes <UNK> out of the gate this would be more <UNK> to one of those <UNK> that first takes you slowly up the hill creating a wonderful sense of anticipation and is ultimately in my mind more fulfilling for the foundation initially laid br br excellent film
<START> against all hope is a very poorly made sometimes painfully so movie this is michael <UNK> first movie and it shows he isn't that good in it some people might find the story laughable an alcoholic realizes his life and family are falling apart so he calls a preacher as a last resort for help after telling the preacher his story he accepts jesus christ into his heart br br i actually found many of the religious scenes as when cecil moe madsen goes to a church but walks away from it pretty realistic i also liked how cecil knows his life is breaking apart and tries to get help but realizes only god can help him at the end he realizes with the help of god he can go through life without drinking again br br this movie is not well made at all the acting is bad the script could use some work and looks worse than my home videos but it has a good message now just because you become a christian doesn't mean you will automatically be able to stop an addiction or <UNK> your broken family and cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on track overall if your a christian you will appreciate how this movie portrays christianity and if you aren't you may find yourself being called to find out more about the faith
<START> a sober <UNK> piece a little <UNK> which <UNK> into a magnificent <UNK> <UNK> sequence which goes beyond a mere <UNK> for the screen this quiet little story will hold you enthralled if you do not have too many problems with the various spanish accents ranging from mexican to <UNK> and marisa <UNK> more authentic <UNK> <UNK> usage <UNK> has accomplished a perfect adaptation from the novel even the grand <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> should be proud of her superb work and hats off to <UNK> <UNK> who has so <UNK> <UNK> the whole effort into a gem a ruby and so <UNK> so elegant so sensitive so <UNK> br br el <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is waiting to get his <UNK> while he continues to live in his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> deep in the <UNK> jungle however filmed elsewhere not in <UNK> with his fighting <UNK> and his wife in that order and that is all there is to it br br but oh so much more this film is a <UNK> br br i must see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible worth the high side of 8 out of 10 which is very high on my scale br br this is not light commercial hollywood stuff
<START> what can i say i'm a secret fan of <UNK> the <UNK> action and horror films especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo but i'm not a fan of snake on a plane br br there are three potential draws to this film <UNK> the comedy of the situation <UNK> the horror and <UNK> the novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane br br firstly this film isn't written as a tongue in cheek horror or a comedy and there are only 1 or 2 points in the film where you'll smile to yourself if you want to get the feel of the film the trailer genuinely represents the movie a horror br br secondly if you're expecting a film full of action and shocks you won't be disappointed it doesn't stand out above other movies but it always keeps your attention br br <UNK> although the novelty of snakes of a plane doesn't wear off but you'll leave the cinema thinking what was all the fuss about br br i know this movie has a high rating but it doesn't add up a many of the reviews where written before the film was released and b the breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal <UNK> of people rating the movie 10 10 with only 7 of people giving it 9 10 why such an enormous gap
<START> anne <UNK> plays <UNK> a dying jewish mother who asks her devoted son ron silver to locate <UNK> one time movie star greta garbo and introduce the two before <UNK> <UNK> out for good <UNK> been entitled <UNK> talks as the actress <UNK> this uncertain comedic dramatic sentimental material for its duration hot or cold director sidney lumet can't get a consistent rhythm going and <UNK> constant overacting isn't <UNK> back at all by the filmmaker he keeps her right <UNK> cute <UNK> eyed and <UNK> <UNK> becomes a drag on this scenario not that the <UNK> conceived plot has much going on besides silver and co stars carrie fisher and catherine <UNK> end up with very little to do but support the star and everyone is <UNK> by her <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> when i heard that this movie was coming out the night before halloween i was very excited when i found out that it was a book written in 1978 i had to read it before seeing the movie i'm sure the movie would have been much different to me if i had not read the book the writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book with minor differences naturally i think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was boyle playing the role of <UNK> i'm not a big fan of boyle and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie she's always trying to use her over <UNK> lips and darkly makeup ed eyes to make herself seem super sexy indeed i think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house my favorite subplot was the <UNK> family which is so weird b c the son was killed in iraq and in current events there is <UNK> <UNK> whose mother went on a huge anti iraq <UNK> in the book obviously the war was not iraq but rather vietnam and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter i was truly <UNK> out overall i was impressed with the movie in that it followed the book very well
<START> the <UNK> cloud is a frustrating film to watch <UNK> enigmatic it treats each shot like a work of art you get the impression that the composition of each shot has been designed and prepared with a degree of exquisite care that borders on obsession expressing how far cinema has progressed since the very first films were <UNK> out in the <UNK> century and <UNK> their construction the camera here hardly ever moves  apart from during the camp and colourful musical numbers <UNK> noise is kept to a minimum and barely a word is spoken this curious but effective device forces the audience to focus their attention on visual <UNK> alone so that even as the story progresses at a <UNK> like pace we feel ourselves becoming immersed unfortunately for me at least this <UNK> begins to unravel somewhere around the hour mark i began to feel as if the film was challenging me to keep watching while becoming more difficult as the minutes dragged so that the mere act of watching became a battle of <UNK> br br had the content of this film not been as sexual as it is it would no doubt been even more obscure to western audiences as it is there's an abundance of female nudity and an act of sexual abuse on an unconscious or possibly dead woman that is so <UNK> that while it may speak volumes about the <UNK> to which pornography subjects both men and women the users and the used it is so over <UNK> in the manner in which it chooses to make its point as to effectively render it <UNK> of course the worst and most enthusiastic participants of the explosion in available pornographic content will seek this film out for all the wrong reasons and watch it with their <UNK> finger on the fast forward button of the remote br br for all its problems the film is definitely a <UNK> and the more you think about it the more sense certain aspects of it seem to make ironically for a film in which so little happens the viewer would probably be <UNK> rewarded by watching a second or even third time for me however once was <UNK>
<START> john ben chaplin is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from london though the internet he contacts a russian agency of brides he <UNK> sophia nicole kidman  the guy could be lonely and shy but certainly has a good taste doesn't he and when they met each other he realizes that she does not speak english the communication between each other is basically limited by sex again imagine what a terrible situation for the guy just have some kinky sex with nicole kidman on her birthday two russian friends of her visit them then lots of surprises will happen i liked this movie first it is almost impossible to be <UNK> is it a black comedy an action a thriller movie i believe all the choices are correct nicole kidman is gorgeous as usual and i am very curious about her russian is she speaking russian in a correct accent indeed or just <UNK> anyway i found it an enjoyable movie my vote is eight br br title brazil a <UNK> <UNK> the perfect bait
<START> this movie may seem scary on commercials but the actual movie was a reason to vomit this is a below below average even lower than that and has no plot i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure a dead japanese woman would scare the <UNK> out of you but so what make a movie that would appeal to <UNK> and not just show images of scared people and some hair dead japanese woman can you say horrible rip off of <UNK> the ring don't get me started with the dead child not even that scary so what he has a cat and he can imitate it big freaking deal just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being <UNK> by the grudge 1 10 <UNK>
<START> if you are <UNK> to the gundam world this is a good place to start if you are burned out on star wars or star trek here is a compelling realistic sci fi series you can become immersed in not the simplistic boy saves world in giant robot story you might have expected but rather a complex emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the good and bad guys is decidedly less than distinct br br gundam <UNK> focuses on the story of al <UNK> a young naive boy living in a neutral space colony he spends his days <UNK> about mobile suits and playing war with his friends during the course of this series al befriends an enemy soldier <UNK> <UNK> by the end little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice br br i loved this <UNK> series with its cool <UNK> designs involving story and likeable characters i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment
<START> for those with little time on their hands i'll sum it up quickly in one word pathetic there are a lot of good examples as to why this movie fits perfectly under that description so much so that you can barely go through 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and pointless forced upon you want a fully naked woman in the first 10 minutes you got it the reason she appears is so pointless though that it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of juvenile crap you can almost glimpse into the <UNK> minds of the 12 year old boys that wrote this piece of garbage just by watching this crap that they expect the public to actually pay for br br i've watched many a movie franchise decline over the years but american pie <UNK> house has to be one of the worst <UNK> when you consider that despite the average nature of the original movie it's still a thousand times funnier than this dreck br br the plot is predictable and sometimes you actually feel like you're watching a school play the things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually watch it we're talking star wars levels of suspension like the kind you need to convince yourself jar jar is real br br the plot is paper thin and mostly the events that <UNK> are only there to show another pair of breasts or set up yet another pathetic joke there is no acting talent to speak of all you get is a bunch of pretty boys trying to make us laugh and <UNK> how they fail every gag falls flat and the only thing i laughed at was how socially unaware the <UNK> appear to be how else can you explain the <UNK> t they try to pass off as a story br br they pass up every opportunity to do something worthwhile and entertaining in favour of badly written lowest common <UNK> nonsense the characters have to complete a set number of tasks before they are accepted as members of <UNK> house but this is dealt with mostly by a series of very brief montages that imply that they are <UNK> the tasks but we see little to no evidence of it actually happening its a very lazy way of telling a story it also misses opportunities to be funny in doing so imagine say the wizard of oz where all the important events happened <UNK> instead of on it and all we see is dorothy high <UNK> the scarecrow every now and again and saying gee that sure was a great adventure we just had back then lazy lazy lazy br br the female characters have little or nothing to say all they do is get naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual props through most of the movie you <UNK> that only seek t a will not be disappointed but for that reason alone shame on you if you buy this on dvd you will be <UNK> to the downfall of society in your own special way <UNK>
<START> this movie is awful i haven't laughed so hard at a movie that was unintentionally funny in a long time leno should've stuck to stand up and late night tv the cars in the movie were cool but the movie by itself is the dumbest movie i've ever seen it's pathetic the acting is horrible and the plot could've been written by a 4 year old don't get me wrong jay leno is hilarious but not in this movie
<START> i wanted to see sarah buffy on the big screen so i first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at imdb i worried about seeing a bad movie well i had fun watching the movie some parts which obviously were meant to be scary were actually quite <UNK> almost as in buffy the vampire <UNK> br br i don't consider this a bad movie it's not a great movie either just a rather well made horror movie it does not rely heavily on special effects but on camera angles acting music in my opinion the acting was ok sarah did a very good job quite convincing the other actors were definitely not bad either i liked <UNK> br br the sets are nice and i don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the japanese original br br the scary moments were often predictable but not always i have seen quite some horror and did not expect to be scared now but it happened at least twice nice br br the movie had some nice scenes that were almost original like the <UNK> of rubbish the simple special effects for he ghosts the eyes of the boy the cat that made <UNK> noises the <UNK> of the dead boy and his mother br br don't go if you want to see sarah in another buffy episode because it is very different from her buffy work much more serious don't go if you only want to see movies that gather oscar nominations it's a good horror movie enough suspense i gave it a 7
<START> it was fabulous the photography editing cinematography music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination it was the enjoyment of <UNK> without going through the danger we were there the dream sequences and flashback sequence ending were fresh it spoke to me keep up the good work another of that genre is city of god also don't laugh the comedy desperately seeking susan nice ensemble types with great performances by all sorry i think training day fits that genre as well with fantastic performances by an ensemble cast i had to switch the channel on some of the gritty sequences but all in all a great film
<START> the lovely danish actress <UNK> <UNK> steals this film from under the <UNK> of everyone no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding her br br <UNK> plays anna an out of work independent minded somewhat neurotic and perhaps <UNK> actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchair bound muted aged father named <UNK> the great danish actor <UNK> <UNK> who died at <UNK> shortly after this film was made br br spoiler alert br br <UNK> refuses to respond to anyone until he confronts the gifted anna whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old <UNK> devil back from a self <UNK> death sentence br br writer director actor eric <UNK> has made a strong film about the difficulty a <UNK> businessman son <UNK> played by <UNK> has loving a father who has never accepted him the film <UNK> toward the end but <UNK> has some important things to say about <UNK> the nature and value of loving and caring and how one person the <UNK> anna can alter the course of a human life highly recommended <UNK> <UNK> performance is alone worth the price of admission
<START> i found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the <UNK> i e chinese it becomes a story about values and causes the watcher to <UNK> their own choices in life and <UNK> toward <UNK> amazingly enough it managed to do this in a gentle mildly humorous manner which only in retrospect <UNK> threatening to one's status <UNK> i enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if i could
<START> second movie in the <UNK> originally titled <UNK> this movie was pretty average it is kinda boring in some parts but there is some good gore effects but they're not great though br br the movie takes place in the year <UNK> vampires have pretty much taken over the whole world the v san vampire <UNK> squad which also has their own spaceship and is lead by <UNK> who is captured by the vampires receives a message from an earth and the team formed by <UNK> played by the very hot <UNK> <UNK> the rookie officer <UNK> and the rebels <UNK> and roman roman being played by aaron pearl from <UNK> accused v san later meets up with the leader of the vampires <UNK> played by michael <UNK> from total recall he has no plans of living <UNK> with humans as he is bent on world <UNK> br br while this movie was not a waste of time i doubt i'll be putting back in the dvd player anytime soon
<START> i am a huge fan of <UNK> work and i'm very fond of this movie but i wouldn't say that this is a film of the mother night that i read when people say that <UNK> is <UNK> two things come to my mind one is that many of his themes are very near the <UNK> or even taboo despite the <UNK> sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively easy targets for his satire this means less every day that passes as far as <UNK> is concerned directors these days appear to <UNK> in breaking <UNK> and i have high hopes for the version of <UNK> now in production amazing to think that an innocent piece like <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> would probably have been the equivalent of r rated if filmed when it was published back in the 50s for its violence language and sexual and <UNK> content though it's a tragedy that <UNK> come up yet with a <UNK> script for it and in the present economic climate i also hope some director out there is looking closely at <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br the other thing is his narrative style <UNK> irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny it seems impossible to <UNK> and that appears to be the biggest <UNK> to making great films of his great novels because the little <UNK> comments that colour our response as readers are just not possible in movies without <UNK> to too often clumsy techniques like <UNK> <UNK> suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work himself as author narrator to its credit breakfast of <UNK> the movie tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a <UNK> for its pains as did another turkey made from a <UNK> novel slapstick in an even more spectacular way br br still there's nothing wrong with a director giving us his <UNK> interpretation of <UNK> and mother night is an excellent example of how as another reviewer put it a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this but so much of the humour is lost that though it's the same plot it's not really from the same novel i read if it had been i'd probably have been rolling in the <UNK> laughing a few times watching it for a reader of the novel i think a chuckle even at the end is forgivable the end of the film however is truly poignant and i think one of the film's <UNK> is that it can genuinely leave you feeling that you've watched someone walk a <UNK> edge between good and evil and the jury is still out br br standing alone and of itself it's well worth a look technically there are some minor but glaring errors notably in continuity and it too often looks drab and theatrical but most of the time it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagination and <UNK> the acting in general is of a high order even if maybe the dialogue is by today's standards a little stilted br br it survives quite well watching back to back with <UNK> 5 and there is actually quite a bit more good filmed <UNK> out there mostly versions of his short stories harrison <UNK> who am i this time and some other things like of course the <UNK> filmed version of his very funny but <UNK> play happy birthday <UNK> june also there was an interesting piece if it still exists done in the 70s called between time and <UNK> which <UNK> apparently didn't like much although he was involved in its production because he felt it <UNK> him in its <UNK> he said it reminded him of the bizarre <UNK> experiments performed in the <UNK> wells tale the island of dr <UNK> but it did for many people serve as an excellent introduction to his work br br but if the films don't make you want to go to the superior source material they're not doing their job br br as the man said more or less the big show is inside your head
<START> i have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed a <UNK> darkly and <UNK> ad <UNK> if you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed like me you will probably enjoy renaissance it <UNK> you into the world of a future paris it is not quite <UNK> they did the animation so well that i thought it was <UNK> but from what i can tell it was not it was merely motion capture the facial expressions are amazing not since <UNK> have i seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation live hybrid the black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene my favorite effect was what they did with <UNK> <UNK> watch for it the director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find the overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises br br the plot is secondary but it isn't terrible it is noir ish there is a <UNK> for most of the major characters giving them some depth there is weather there are sets so you can feel like you are in different places in paris there is some action and even a car chase i am going to have to see this one again to get everything i also recommend a very large screen to view it as the sets are detailed and the credits are small
<START> as an inspiring director myself this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind shot with low end digital camera probably with <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> the editing is good acting decent sound effects aren't too over the top i would have give it a 7 for an indie film but the story aren't that interesting it's more on the drama side character developments than a horror flick br br it's not for those who wants to get <UNK> <UNK> frightened <UNK> out or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy br br honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's br br this movie is about a family who has a dry field and that is just that
<START> at the beginning we get to see the start of a secret <UNK> of some sorts it all looks very promising from the get go with some supernatural elements thrown in the mystery gets more interesting by the minute the main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to temptation and other factors you really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on normally a person in his situation would have several <UNK> somehow he does not have those <UNK> in this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church <UNK> and god and they provide the answer for his problem it should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message since it always is helpful but was it really necessary to disguise this message this religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me while the message is good it's simplicity can't escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie the mystery that is presented to us never gets solved in <UNK> you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot don't get fooled because of malcolm mcdowell the once brilliant actor is adequate but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all he really must be desperate for money otherwise what would <UNK> an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this
<START> elvis has left the building and he's lucky because he didn't have to watch this unfunny stinker scene after scene director joel <UNK> finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing filled with unfunny deaths trite gay <UNK> and hack jokes this film is more desperate than amusing this is the sort of film that makes one hope kim basinger follows doris day into <UNK> retirement let us remember her the way she was talented and not what she's become david <UNK> the delicious dennis richards and the rest are all wasted talents here <UNK> finds a way to <UNK> their talents at every turn the guy playing elvis sounds more like <UNK> than the king the only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays basinger as a <UNK> she really looks like her and is actually pretty good the only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the tom hanks cameo the cameo isn't all that funny but at least its not painful one has to wonder if <UNK> has <UNK> pictures of hanks or something that would make him do this movie
<START> when i come on imdb boards i'm always fed up when i see a the worst movie ever post after watching this movie i think that i am soon going to create my own post br br the opening titles great some kind of lame zoom on a gas <UNK> yeah focus on the fire explosions great action packed movie br br the actors i think that ice t is a cool <UNK> even a nice actor sometimes i insist sometimes but the steven seagal like policeman he plays is beyond the words the rest of the cast is well i don't know where those actors were hired but <UNK> i bet my dog would have been a much better actor than them br br the plot <UNK> original isn't it br br the action sequences the first shot of the movie is an explosion i told myself well cool at least there will be some nice <UNK> i was dead wrong the rest of the movie is mostly filled with low rent stock shots taken from the air force br br the dialogs are hilarious the music is pure crap the end is happy i mean i was happy at the end because the movie was over br br my cousin who was watching the movie was delighted i'm 22 she's <UNK> well i was on the verge of taking the movie and burn it maybe next time i'm gonna watch it who said never
<START> this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind tsui <UNK> it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven <UNK> shaolin soccer from the moment the movie started there was <UNK> backdrops at every edge which were br br <UNK> with superb style if you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts geek you'll love the excessive amounts of many 3d effects and realistic computer generated weapons there comes a fine performance as always from <UNK> cheung who plays sky king he teams up with louis <UNK> red who i was very impressed by his <UNK> wing which <UNK> <UNK> attacks the fighting movements of these actors were <UNK> in every way not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline many <UNK> of this movie complain of the lack of story theme or just shoved in random bits of <UNK> and even describe as the legend of poo however the viewer cannot rely on watching dragon <UNK> and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie others who are <UNK> with wu <UNK> movies will have a better <UNK> in due respect there can be one weakness that could be <UNK> the blow that was <UNK> to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more <UNK> and <UNK> made in spite of all this its a must see
<START> leon was fantastic as always this time playing little richard in his early years the movie showed a fully fleshed out little richard without <UNK> to fill the show with lots of great music my only complaint is that the ending was a little abrupt i was hoping for a 2 <UNK>
<START> it was only on my second viewing years later that i realized two things about this movie 1 i enjoyed it immensely and 2 that because its execution is decidedly <UNK> than the premise itself <UNK> i had laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to <UNK> my initial <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> even good natured <UNK> just aren't <UNK> funny especially when drawn out to feature length but though the movie's momentum does begin to <UNK> out towards the end reeves and winter and <UNK> and hal <UNK> jr in an unforgettable scene display such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout that even the more clumsily scripted jokes e g ted failing to recognize a certain <UNK> of hell work as effortlessly as the <UNK> ones e g the challenge and the <UNK> of winter and reeves <UNK> so well that the <UNK> of bill and ted who spend only one scene separated in the entire movie disaster if they're not well matched appears utterly <UNK> br br side note i found the first movie to be only <UNK> entertaining <UNK> different comic sensibilities there it seems br br i give it a 7 75 surprisingly good fun
<START> i never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel especially a beloved one like evening but when i saw that the <UNK> author susan <UNK> was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film i thought that evening would be a good adaptation br br if you enjoyed the book don't bother with this movie it is so far <UNK> of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another br br here our characters are completely different the bride is in love with harris harris is the son of the <UNK> buddy is a drunk in love with ann and or harris i don't think a single character made it from the book to the screen oh it just gets worst with every passing moment br br and really didn't we learn from bridges of madison county that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in to scenes of our <UNK> grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights simply does not work on film this film is a disaster skip it
<START> the 700 club has to be the single most <UNK> television program in the history of television itself to make matters worse it's been on the air since 1966 <UNK> that thousands if not millions of people are buying into its hate and lies headed by pat robertson the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and leader of the christian <UNK> the 700 club takes us from <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> news as they like to think of it and trying to convince its audience that all of the world's problems are to blame on <UNK> <UNK> new age <UNK> muslims jews <UNK> non <UNK> christians <UNK> single mothers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scientists and anyone else who doesn't share their <UNK> religious views it's actually the best fake news since the daily show or the weekend update segment of saturday night live or since fox news for that matter of course <UNK> always the one who makes each of the decisions saying whatever comes to mind and not giving a damn who it <UNK> or hurts in the meantime he continues his part in the struggle to <UNK> the united states into a <UNK> police state by having the religious wrong stick their <UNK> in everything they can and asking for one <UNK> after another no less than a <UNK> 100 to become a member by the way to <UNK> <UNK> african diamond mines and buy oil from companies <UNK> by the government in the past for their abuse of the environment no never mind that pat was good friends with the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> in order to help him <UNK> such wealth it's all for the greater glory of god don't you know and of course the <UNK> of the 700 club are always willing to read letters written by viewers as they like to put it <UNK> each <UNK> in the same format and all on the same color of paper by viewers supposedly <UNK> of various <UNK> by the said <UNK> they claim to have words of knowledge come to them but who never appear on the program to say what happened to them honestly how can anyone take a show seriously when they're using a poor applause recording it should make people wonder why there's no studio audience br br the sad thing that <UNK> <UNK> and viewers don't realize or just don't want to realize are the horrible things he's done and said this is a guy who agreed with jerry <UNK> that the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states were the result of god <UNK> us for our acceptance of homosexuality and <UNK> ironic considering that pat has twice <UNK> referred to the <UNK> of a nuclear weapon in the state department i have little doubt it was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements his <UNK> against <UNK> single mothers and any number of sexual practices he considers <UNK> are interesting considering he was known to frequent a number of <UNK> during the korean war as the bible says be <UNK> and <UNK> so <UNK> pat thanks to you there's probably a number of children born to single korean mothers then of course there was the time he called for the assassination of <UNK> president hugo chavez not that he's a saint but still oh yes and let's not soon forget the time this <UNK> for human life supported forced <UNK> in china very christian of him wouldn't you say br br and just in case pat has forgotten i haven't forgotten his little speech that <UNK> christians today are being treated exactly as the jews were in nazi germany honestly to compare his plight to the horrors of the holocaust is almost unforgivable speaking of which need i mention about how he blatantly <UNK> that homosexuality ran rampant among the nazi party in a pathetic attempt to <UNK> <UNK> of course history shows us that the nazis acted toward <UNK> the same way they acted toward jews pat robertson is one of the biggest <UNK> in history if he was <UNK> his nose would <UNK> the earth br br unfortunately more and more people continue to believe him every day this is your wake up call people the 700 club is one of the most if not the single most vile program in television history it's evil <UNK> as good it's a wolf in <UNK> clothing it's <UNK> filth that tries to look clean pretty and loving it's living proof that hateful dangerous religious views aren't confined to certain groups in the middle east even those who are not of the christian faith know that it goes against everything jesus taught and if jesus was to appear to this club he wouldn't be <UNK> them instead he'd be <UNK> them as he did the <UNK> of his time and <UNK> the money <UNK> of their <UNK> as he did in front of the <UNK> in his time all i can say is thank god that pat had no chance of becoming president if he did he'd be the <UNK> of <UNK> and not on the side of the good guys
<START> george lopez in my opinion is an absolute abc classic i haven't seen every episode but i still enjoy it there are many episodes that i enjoyed one of them was where amy sandra <UNK> walked into a moving piece of <UNK> if you want to know why you'll have to have seen it for yourself before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though new episodes can currently be seen i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> only a 9 10 from me a perfect ten would have been if there was more of a plot to the movie but nevertheless <UNK> to this day remains a fun fest of music dance and entertainment beginning with the montage of video clips from jackson's long career it reminds the viewer of just why he is often regarded as 'the king of <UNK> from his hit 'i want you <UNK> to <UNK> are the <UNK> the multi award winning charity record for the benefit of africa following this a short movie of sorts although <UNK> in an oscar winning script nonetheless provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience ending with a perfect sexy rendition of <UNK> <UNK> something the whole family can watch and enjoy
<START> this is <UNK> bad and <UNK> <UNK> for a canadian we grow good wine our writers and <UNK> are among the world's best the national ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world but we make bloody awful movies this one isn't especially bad it's especially typical and typically bad shot in two bit <UNK> and public parks with thin direction high school level acting and gee <UNK> lets see what this button on the camera does photography if michael <UNK> was so intent on doing a jack nicholson <UNK> couldn't he at least have done a good jack nicholson <UNK> and if the movie was shot in <UNK> truly one of the <UNK> cities on earth and also a centre of <UNK> building part of the plot why in god's name do we let that <UNK> canadian <UNK> complex <UNK> that it be disguised as seattle not only am i mad about this film i'm <UNK> and more than a little ashamed the <UNK> turn out some splendid stuff we produce pretentious second rate <UNK> <UNK>
<START> ok not possibly honestly the worst movie i've ever seen br br this made absolutely no sense there was no plot no characterization no acting just nothing br br here's what i thought when i first saw it may <UNK> 2003 caution this is a spoiler alert it's also alot of me complaining about how bad the movie is br br ok so the movie begins and the characters are introduced but there is no character explanation as far as i knew the main character was new to this school but apparently not also it appeared that he lived by himself then that he was a foster kid then that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him still also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived by themselves br br now we come to a main plot point this insane guy has broken out of the insane asylum and is running rampant now our main character is obsessed with this guy and <UNK> <UNK> on him for the <UNK> of the movie i think i must have missed a main plot element here there was no reason for the main character to get hooked even if that's the point having no reason why do all his friends who are skeptical like 5 minutes before suddenly follow him and do what he wants br br so the movie continues on and it gets all right they're running havoc on the school blah blah blah but wait a minute suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the <UNK> here wait a second didn't the insane guy specifically tell the main character not to do that it was supposed to be <UNK> br br ah another important plot element has been <UNK> over the insane guy was supposed to not be insane everyone said he wasn't insane but as the story goes on he is very clearly out of his mind but i thought the news people said he wasn't <UNK> br br now the movie comes to a close that was the close what the hell was that not only did the ending not answer any questions about the main character it didn't answer any questions about the insane guy are these people in the same situation if yes then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this if no then what is the point in saying that's you in two weeks br br end of the thing br br that's what i thought then that is pretty much what i still think now it's 6 months down the line and if i can get it for free i might give it another chance but i doubt it i highly doubt it
<START> i remember back when i was little when i was away at camp and we would <UNK> under the stars there was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out well when i found wendigo at the library i checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp well much to my <UNK> i was so far from the truth wendigo is really bad the story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods and they run into a deer well it seems the local <UNK> were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk the movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film it wasn't until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the wendigo my suggestion is that you stay very far away this film it will leave you wanting your hour and a half back
<START> he <UNK> himself as a great supporting actor in <UNK> he proved he was no malcolm in the <UNK> mediocre actor in malcolm <UNK> he showed his <UNK> love for acting in <UNK> he pulled a slam <UNK> in he got <UNK> he pulled no punches and <UNK> us like a <UNK> in the <UNK> he provided us effective <UNK> education in training <UNK> and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct denzel <UNK> directorial debut antwone <UNK> is the most moving film of the year this <UNK> <UNK> story is in no relation to the <UNK> that happened to the miami <UNK> in the 4th quarter against the new england <UNK> in the last game of the 2002 season unlike that <UNK> tragedy antwone <UNK> possesses an emotional <UNK> conclusion the movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the <UNK> he suffered as a foster child denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother derek <UNK> debut performance as antwone is the best admirable acting i have seen by a <UNK> actor in some time now i actually saw some of the detailed <UNK> in <UNK> acting as i have seen in <UNK> past performances it was like if washington was telling luke la la la luke i am your acting <UNK> ok i will lay off the star wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away speaking of the great denzel his work as the psychologist was masterful but what can you expect from the acting master <UNK> himself antwone <UNK> was written by no other than antwone fisher himself the emotional pathos he inserted in his <UNK> screenplay was of fisher <UNK> material i <UNK> to the chief mr <UNK> in catching the right bait in antwone <UNK> excellent
<START> had i been familiar with the stage production of guys and dolls before seeing the movie i might not be as fond of it as i am although in all fairness i would probably still like the film production better because of my general <UNK> of both brando for his acting and sinatra for his voice although he is quite the actor as well see the <UNK> candidate or from here to eternity br br as for some of the other <UNK> statements about the songs i have the broadway soundtrack and though <UNK> <UNK> voice <UNK> that of jean simmons it is not more pleasant i find it to have a rather shrill quality jean <UNK> voice is much more realistic though admittedly that is not always a huge concern in musicals also the only time i particularly noticed marlon <UNK> particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of luck be a lady and only there because i was previously familiar with sinatra's version i also find vivian <UNK> voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on broadway and sinatra's voice alone would be able to redeem the <UNK> of all the others if they indeed were in need of redemption they weren't it is infinitely better than sam <UNK> particularly in my favorite song <UNK> <UNK> br br also the complaint that lots of songs were <UNK> from the movie for inferior songs i beg to <UNK> 'a <UNK> and a <UNK> is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it <UNK> me <UNK> and its accompanying performance is more hot box material i personally do not care for <UNK> the man <UNK> at all and <UNK> that it was not included in the movie i adore <UNK> never been in love <UNK> and though it was not sung in the movie the <UNK> version can be heard when nathan is in <UNK> dressing room the song 'a woman in <UNK> the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more <UNK> reach and the movie wouldn't be the same without the song <UNK> not included on broadway in fact if the movie soundtrack were available for sale i'd recommend <UNK> it instead of the broadway br br though i have not seen the original production i cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movie's lead actors br br the important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so
<START> i enjoyed this show for two reasons 1 richard dean anderson 2 amanda <UNK> these two performers carried the show with able support from the <UNK> and recurring actors the replacement of <UNK> in seasons 9 10 was enough to take the heart out of the show br br the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling this relationship carries over into the program we get to see br br <UNK> gives his <UNK> character believable personality he never knows when to give the <UNK> in him a rest you watch the others roll their eyes in <UNK> at some of his <UNK> still they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is <UNK> br br there is a lot going on between <UNK> and <UNK> under the surface they manage to keep the <UNK> on but often just barely the episode <UNK> in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television the love between the two made the <UNK> of dying bearable because they faced it together br br <UNK> and <UNK> often have to smooth over some of the <UNK> created by <UNK> yet <UNK> <UNK> instincts always seem sound he understands what to do without having to think about the matter the team has several times been placed in <UNK> by the others not listening to his orders br br the quality <UNK> <UNK> in seasons 9 and 10 the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest ben <UNK> was far inferior to <UNK> in carrying the show he had his rare moments with <UNK> black but that was all amanda <UNK> was <UNK> in her performances these two seasons you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby she was probably thinking more about the child than the show br br the spin off <UNK> <UNK> has a few moments but is mostly a weaker effort the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original the villains <UNK> are so improbable as to be ludicrous maybe amanda <UNK> can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season br br there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show to have <UNK> shaped as <UNK> is a design monstrosity seldom <UNK> in sci fi the use of <UNK> for <UNK> in these ships is just as bad the campy use of <UNK> from ancient egypt <UNK> ultra modern technology is just as hard to accept br br i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too in the season 2 opener <UNK> <UNK> is shot up and his uniform has a <UNK> hole where he was wounded he <UNK> into a <UNK> and it <UNK> his body and <UNK> his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet the episode <UNK> has a <UNK> fall into the hands of the <UNK> yet it is never mentioned again this device could have been used in several later episodes on <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> at mst3k should see this dog of a film it's basically about a dopey hack actor in hollywood who can't land any acting <UNK> and he has this strange obsession with the movie taxi driver so what does this dumb actor do he <UNK> his hair blonde and starts acting like a l a <UNK> dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles you'll laugh <UNK> head off at so many of this movie's inadvertently funny scenes like when the actor <UNK> girlfriend is heart broken and <UNK> and saying lines like how could you do this to me and why is she crying <UNK> he <UNK> his hair blonde and became a <UNK> dude to get acting <UNK> this movie makes no sense at all the actor who played the <UNK> on benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with <UNK> dumb funny dialog this movie will crack you up trust me you <UNK> to me
<START> i'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made the story takes place in a fictional state but obviously it deals with the murder of kennedy a truthful and honest district attorney played by <UNK> <UNK> does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man <UNK> <UNK> and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team br br the screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end just the part dealing with the <UNK> experiment about authorities is though not uninteresting a bit out of place the ending sequence explaining who <UNK> really is partly shot in slow motion and <UNK> by a <UNK> soundtrack is the most powerful sequence i have ever seen in a movie
<START> shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful film i've seen all year it's about a prison program somewhere in california if i recall correctly where the inmates have <UNK> and performed a different shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years the film follows their production of the <UNK> from casting through performance and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men who are all in for the most serious of crimes truth is indeed stranger than fiction if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film the audience would never buy it but knowing that it's real makes it breathtaking to watch literally i <UNK> out loud when i learned of one particularly gifted <UNK> crime it's like some <UNK> episode of oz and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real
<START> this film is the most cult movie on metal there is premise a kid gets a hold of the final recording of his favorite artist sammy <UNK> who recently dies in a hotel fire he plays it backwards and <UNK> him back from the dead to get revenge in the name of heavy metal on those b <UNK> <UNK> who torment him any fan of true metal will enjoy this movie and if you are a metal head being tormented by <UNK> play a sammy <UNK> album backwards no wait he is <UNK> well get a hold of this movie and watch it with your fist in the air your head <UNK> and the volume at 11
<START> saw this movie the first time while drunk at a motel in canada while flipping through channels came across the easy <UNK> part my friend kept flipping but i told him to go back something about the name easy <UNK> just didn't sound right watched the rest of the movie it was pretty damn funny <UNK> down a couple of names from the credits and got home to look it up turned out to be chevy <UNK> first movie i didn't remember him in it didn't remember much about it so i rented it and gave it a second <UNK> it's pretty funny and quite graphic it's just like kentucky fried movie except not as funny love the fingers easy <UNK> and i'm da f <UNK> president parts dealers skit is pretty cool too i give it a 6 5 or 7 out of ten
<START> this was the first sequel i'd seen apart from return of <UNK> and i honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original i was horribly disappointed br br the storyline was basically the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around ariel and eric have a daughter melody who isn't satisfied with life on land she wants to become a mermaid however ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her and when melody finds out she's upset and angry and she then decides to run away and she becomes a mermaid so she's happy swimming around and ariel sets out to find her as a mermaid br br the story doesn't sound too bad written down but the clichés and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious and adding the fact that melody is overall extremely annoying and the movie becomes almost unbearable br br there's also a whole load of other new characters tip and dash being two of them they aren't too bad as characters in themselves just try not to think of timon or pumbaa the songs leave a lot to be desired too they just don't have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did the animation obviously didn't have a whole load of work put into it either in parts it's <UNK> and not much imagination is used for the characters movements br br another piece of advice try to forget about <UNK> original character while watching this movie the beautiful rebellious curious teenager has <UNK> grown <UNK> into a bland boring wife and mother and her trademark red hair is all tied up this is much better viewed if you've never seen the original you'll have nothing to compare it to br br however all in all it could have been worse it's not as bad as certain other sequels such as cinderella ii but it's not in the same league as the original but it for your collection if nothing else but if disney go on like this they'll lose all their older fans
<START> i have done quite a few reviews on imdb and this film is unique in that i never saw the entire movie it was so terribly stupid and unfunny that i just couldn't sit through it though i tried br br the biggest problem with this and any mel brooks movie i call the mel <UNK> in other words the better his movie the less of him you see in the film think about it the producers and young frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them at all but films like life stinks and space balls are chock full of mel and are pretty dopey movies yes i did not like space balls but this isn't the place to talk about that br br second apart from cancer <UNK> <UNK> and mental <UNK> i can't think of a less funny topic than <UNK> this is just a comedy <UNK> think about it folks the funniest scene in the movie has mel making <UNK> with leslie ann warren in a <UNK> and this is funny in what way
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen with robert de niro the fan is a pointless cliché of an exercise in slasher flicks it tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic the movie <UNK> into nothing spoiler we're to believe that a knife wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness security or cameras the movie is nonsense trying to <UNK> at our heart strings through the <UNK> of baseball ending up <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got <UNK> this <UNK> this is as big a dud as they come stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies
<START> i am a <UNK> <UNK> at my high school in my current world affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch so we did i am firm believer that we went to the moon being that my father works for <UNK> even though i think this movie is the biggest piece of crap i have ever watched the guy who created it has some serious balls first of all did he have to show <UNK> getting shot and how dare he use all those biblical quotes the only good thing about this movie is it sparks <UNK> which is good b c in my class we have weekly <UNK> this movie did nothing to change my mind i think he and michael moore should be working together and make another movie michael moore next movie could be called a funny thing happened on <UNK> <UNK> or a funny thing happened on the way to the white house
<START> just kidding br br seeking <UNK> <UNK> in the form of <UNK> in new york city jon voight is young <UNK> cowboy almost forest <UNK> like joe buck from texas it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the <UNK> of new <UNK> and cons from its street thugs given his pure heart he takes pity on one of these thugs ratso rizzo dustin hoffman and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive br br while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory <UNK> <UNK> party cinematography and <UNK> it with ultra urban new york city the film <UNK> cowboy joe buck somewhere in between thereby <UNK> his out of place position we feel for his struggle to fit in but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzo br br midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart i imagine this film must have inspired both forest <UNK> with its pure hearted and out of place lead character and to an extent the crocodile <UNK> films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour a contrast between country <UNK> and slick new york <UNK> very compelling and <UNK> creative film that i highly recommend br br 8 5 10
<START> going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab <UNK> in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac so right away you're guessing who will live and who will die the survivors end up being exactly who you'd expect them to be so no points for plot twists there br br and if you're not sure if this is a b movie or a movie that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story william <UNK> plays a part instant b movie status br br the movie is promising in the beginning at the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent <UNK> foreboding the best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again great special effects same thing when they make bacon invisible br br there are a couple of bare breasts a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an r rating that it really didn't need br br for a thriller there weren't really any surprises except when <UNK> makes like <UNK> in the <UNK> which is more of a <UNK> ' ok there is one surprise that's when caine bacon comes back one last time in the elevator <UNK> it was a surprise but only because you're yelling at tv <UNK> you're dead already end the movie ' speaking of yelling at the tv that's all i did for the last 25 minutes or so <UNK> on your f ing <UNK> ' instead of putting their <UNK> <UNK> on so that they can see him they try every other trick in the book fire <UNK> <UNK> systems br br the story really lost it at the end but the special effects were good that's the only reason i give it a 2 10
<START> i watched this movie on march 21 this year must say disappointment but much better than <UNK> plot is hackneyed tells about <UNK> who lives with his father wife and his little brother the movie opens when he saves a bride anyway <UNK> <UNK> makes a plot to kill his young brother he makes a plan by sending few man they come to a school <UNK> to be <UNK> friends kill that kid his father throws him out of the house then later comes back he and <UNK> go to <UNK> to find him sunny gives a good performance <UNK> was annoying at best <UNK> is wasted <UNK> did good <UNK> was wasted <UNK> was wasted but looked cute the kid which played <UNK> brother in the movie was cute too sad he had to get his character killed the girl was cute but was annoying the other kid did good <UNK> did good <UNK> was adequate <UNK> and <UNK> did good the cinematography is excellent in both india and <UNK> script is weak but has a few good dialogs also drags the movie the music was alright i only liked one song <UNK> <UNK> the lyrics of that song was good the other songs were forgettable don't watch this rating 3 10
<START> the funky yet strictly second <UNK> british <UNK> rock band strange fruit breaks up at the end of the <UNK> excess ridden 70's the individual band members go their separate ways and <UNK> settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and <UNK> 90's <UNK> <UNK> stephen rea winds up <UNK> and down on his luck vain neurotic pretentious lead singer bill <UNK> tries and fails to pursue a <UNK> solo career paranoid drummer timothy <UNK> <UNK> in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a <UNK> back <UNK> debt and <UNK> bass player jimmy nail <UNK> <UNK> for a living former loving <UNK> turned patient understanding long suffering manager juliet <UNK> gets the group back together for an ill advised largely <UNK> and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of europe our <UNK> <UNK> bunch try <UNK> but <UNK> to <UNK> a flame that once burned quite <UNK> back in the day <UNK> <UNK> out <UNK> billy <UNK> and cocky eager <UNK> young <UNK> hans <UNK> tag along for the delightfully <UNK> trouble plagued but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride br br director brian gibson shows tremendously <UNK> respect and <UNK> for both his <UNK> <UNK> characters in particular and loud <UNK> <UNK> overblown <UNK> 70's rock in general this <UNK> this <UNK> little <UNK> with an utterly engaging sense of big hearted charm and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> written script by dick <UNK> and ian la <UNK> likewise <UNK> with spot on dry wit and finely observed moments of <UNK> on the road <UNK> capturing a certain <UNK> affecting and frequently <UNK> vibe that gives the picture itself an <UNK> <UNK> glow ashley <UNK> lovely elegant cinematography <UNK> that the movie always looks quite visually <UNK> while the perfectly catchy and <UNK> music does the trick with right on <UNK> flair and <UNK> kudos also to the across the board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt out soul and <UNK> but still <UNK> beating heart of a past its prime has been <UNK> rock outfit desperate to regain its <UNK> <UNK> glory in one final <UNK> for big time success all in all this <UNK> and touching gem rates highly as one of the true <UNK> sleeper treats from the 90's
<START> sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands wayne's world the first one not the second but most often they have <UNK> it's pat comes to mind rather quickly this time out it's tim meadows as the ladies man this movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud it was very funny for the first 20 minutes but then as usually happens with snl skits it starts to slow down before finally ending long after it should have br br tim meadows is leon <UNK> a radio dj with a <UNK> show called the ladies man he answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships usually in the <UNK> way possible everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt after pushing the buttons of the station manager leon along with his producer julie <UNK> parsons gets fired and needs to find another job out of the random blue comes a letter from one of his ex ladies the letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life the only problem being that the letter isn't signed so leon needs to track down all the women he's been with to find the woman of his dreams but sometimes as billy dee williams says in the film the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you there is also a sub plot about a bunch of guys who's wives girlfriends have all slept with leon and they want to first figure out who he is by a <UNK> he has on a part of his <UNK> then kill him leading this bunch of guys is surprise will ferrell from snl first off i thought the sub plot was rather lame the singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless i usually like will ferrell but here he just never <UNK> for me and the rest of the guys were just <UNK> who <UNK> along and in the end all decided that having their wives girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault so back to the main story the story basically centers around leon and sex so what it comes down to is if you don't like the character of leon you won't like the movie his voice his mannerisms his dialogue is what carries the movie i am not a big fan of tim meadows i never thought he was a particularly good actor on snl the only thing i ever really liked of his was his ladies man skits but the best thing about those is that they usually involved the guest host remember the one with cameron diaz and they were short for about 5 minutes they were pretty funny and here for about 20 minutes it's really funny what i thought was good about the character in the movie is that he stayed in character throughout he never <UNK> from his wanted to just get laid persona until right at the end where there was this transformation and the ever present speech to tie things up other than that it was pretty good at keeping leon as leon and not changing him into something less crude than he was there isn't a lot of substance to this movie if you couldn't guess but like i said earlier the beginning of the movie i found to be very funny some real laugh out loud moments all revolving around sex and his <UNK> the problem of course with this movie and most other snl spin offs is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time <UNK> the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult that difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub plot because without it this movie would have been a little under an hour when it was good it was good but when it wasn't good it got to be boring br br so overall the ladies man wasn't as bad as other snl films but it wasn't as good as others it had some funny moments the first 20 minutes was pretty good but the rest of it dragged on there was an unnecessary sub plot whose only purpose was to <UNK> the film the bottom line is if you like tim meadows and his leon <UNK> character you'll be able to watch the film if he <UNK> you don't even bother going unless you just want to see <UNK> <UNK> in some nice revealing clothing br br
<START> i guess there are some out there that remember nicole <UNK> from her little girl days on such tv shows as t j hooker charles in charge and who's the boss you <UNK> you maybe you remember her from <UNK> when she grew up and got breast <UNK> no matter you will certainly forget her in this supposed comedy about man eating aliens br br there are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained how did she recognize the alien why was the alien hot for <UNK> and <UNK> why didn't the alien eat her you get the picture br br before the alien eats her boyfriend and assumes his identity you get to see her in the body of alex <UNK> this mexican <UNK> beauty is the only reason to watch this trash stay for the shower scene and the boyfriend and go on about your business
<START> well i don't personally like rap but i still found fear of a black hat hilarious i'm sure i didn't get some inside jokes but some i knew and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after i'd stopped laughing i'm a big fan of spinal tap so naturally i had to check this out it was <UNK> from this is spinal tap sometimes blatantly but this film still stood on it's own as an original intelligent and funny satire my personal favorite back in the time of slaves they didn't have hats to protect them from the sun so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt now we have hats
<START> astronaut steve west alex <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of <UNK> his <UNK> are killed instantly but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones steve returns to earth a constantly <UNK> mass of <UNK> pulp as he turns into a savage killer melting every step of the way he is <UNK> by his friend dr ted nelson <UNK> <UNK> br br this is often so <UNK> funny with enough absurd lines and situations to go around that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional it seems to me to be kind of a goof on low budget genre efforts from the <UNK> and 60's and as such it's a <UNK> entertaining movie that sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious we're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything but is still a gas to watch br br writer director william <UNK> deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea his ultra slimy character is a memorable one indeed i think his pacing is a little off some scenes like the one with the elderly couple go on a little long but ultimately he delivers solid <UNK> b movie goods with a degree of <UNK> the climax is especially fun br br <UNK> <UNK> music is <UNK> <UNK> yet also <UNK> silly during some moments and willy <UNK> cinematography creates some really great shots at times that brings me to rick <UNK> fantastic and convincing makeup effects which form a highly respectable <UNK> for the movie right down to the ultimate final melt br br <UNK> is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie <UNK> also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running and does what he has to do well enough <UNK> makes for a rather <UNK> and silly hero and ann <UNK> isn't so hot either as his wife but <UNK> <UNK> michael <UNK> and <UNK> wilson are fine in support it's also worth it to see folk like <UNK> <UNK> smith doing an <UNK> topless shot <UNK> <UNK> of tobe <UNK> eaten alive and wes <UNK> the hills have eyes and even director jonathan <UNK> in a bit part br br this is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore chills and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low grade sci fi horror everywhere br br 8 10
<START> while others may <UNK> that by viewing other works by <UNK> one will better appreciate this movie it does fail in one major way it does not stand on its own the plot is a <UNK> that is <UNK> symbolism with substance here's an idea start with a definite story then craft symbolism around it we start with two different <UNK> this female that is somehow turning human a god that is for some reason being judged but getting one last <UNK> on earth and this mysterious john character who seems to be developing some sort of resort just beyond the <UNK> of the city why none of these questions are answered but do we care no there is no development to want us to empathize with any character in the story the closest we get jill and even then the development is <UNK> at best unfortunately the movie gets caught up in the the whole visually impressive which it is but at the expense of <UNK> development i would love to see this <UNK> by someone who could distance themselves from the material a bit and not have to feel that every image has to be in the picture
<START> first of all i too was expecting another hero a fantastic work of art for the action genre i've only seen parts of <UNK> tiger hidden dragon but i can imagine that it is better than <UNK> br br basic elements from hero are found in <UNK> great landscapes mesmerizing cinematography and sincere acting i mean if you can't understand a word they are saying without the subtitles but you still care that's good acting br br what went wrong what begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story worse it's a soap opera like love triangle you have three characters who i guess fall in love with each other for no good reasons this movie basically falls apart after the escape from the jail i fell asleep about forty minutes into it it's almost as if they changed writers at that point the remainder of the movie is about how a character is like the wind <UNK> also you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the action set pieces this isn't unique to this genre but since the story is weak you can't wait for the action and then when the fighting does breaks out it really wasn't that good the beginning grabs you but then this movie just runs out of gas
<START> <UNK> its long title the movie finds ways to come close to the <UNK> mark the beautiful sets are here with all that made the <UNK> production values a trademark yet paris drowned in the fog is a sign of <UNK> neglect the story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there comes nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than 5 of your attention to be expected br br the directing is heavy as a direct transfer from the stage play actors are mostly stiff as wax figures ok this is a <UNK> feature only it's sometimes better featured in the whole package my conclusion this movie is trash not worth the time i spend that evening eternal life is a boring matter and i should have hoped the guys in charge of programming at the <UNK> would have known better
<START> i found this movie to be charming i thought the characters were developed since as i watched i found myself caring about these people this is a period piece that i believe took place during the depression a single mother who is known as the town <UNK> she has reason to be puts an ad in the paper for a husband christopher reeve plays a ex con who happens into town looking for work he sees the ad and he goes out to see her she hires him i really had some chuckles as their relationship progresses because i found it easy to put myself in their shoes everything went on so matter of fact he needs the work so he doesn't want to upset her and she needing his help but doesn't want him to get the upper hand they dance around the fact that they begin to really need each other things start warming up until the big <UNK> i won't spoil it by telling you what happens but the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful i found the story to be very believable for the time it's taking place i think this is one of the better relationship stories out there maybe the younger generation won't get it but if you are over 40 i think you'll like it and if you liked christopher reeve in somewhere in time you'll like him in this one also
<START> saw this film in august at the <UNK> <UNK> national association of black <UNK> convention in <UNK> <UNK> it's first public screening the film is great derek luke is wonderful as antwone fisher this young actor has a very bright future the real antwone fisher did a great job writing the film and <UNK> direction is right on the money see it opening weekend you won't be disappointed
<START> here is a favorite tom jerry cartoon perfect for halloween i know it <UNK> have much creepiness but has the <UNK> as in trick or treat as jerry did to tom with the window blind and the <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> shirt hanging on it to make it like a ghost but still like to put it on my list of halloween cartoons in this short tom was listening to the <UNK> hour a ghost story program on the radio and being frightened by the horror story being told halfway into the story the <UNK> hair standing on end heart <UNK> into throat icy chills on spine begin happening to tom literally and jerry has been <UNK> the whole thing and laughing to himself thought he <UNK> tom fears by <UNK> him br br i love the ending it was a little funny and you know this short is the first of four cartoons in which tom attacks <UNK> two shoes the others being the <UNK> mouse a mouse in the house and <UNK> witty kitty and also this short is the first of twenty five cartoons where tom speaks the others are the <UNK> mouse the <UNK> cat the million dollar cat the bodyguard mouse trouble the mouse comes to dinner quiet please trap happy solid <UNK> mouse cleaning texas tom <UNK> mouse and the cat above and the mouse below directed by chuck jones
<START> to me this just comes off as a soap opera i guess any depiction of <UNK> people can be considered social commentary but in the final analysis i simply don't care how you <UNK> this film none of the characters are very likable or engaging i felt no chemistry between hudson and bacall if there is a love story here it is lost in the <UNK> and despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate and therefore incomprehensible <UNK> by dorothy maguire on the witness stand the story is <UNK> to hold my interest no matter how much <UNK> symbolism and psychology are throw in this story is sleazy melodramatic and trite br br rock hudson is <UNK> wooden this is lauren <UNK> least engaging role and one of her <UNK> performances dorothy maguire and robert stack deliver more inspired performances but her character is vile and his is pathetic robert keith as the loving out of touch father of two <UNK> adult children is the most sympathetic character most interesting of all however is the severe looking robert <UNK> in a small role as the bar owner he is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless westerns but here he is an honest likable fellow br br i take my social commentary with an interesting engaging story and a few likable characters thank you
<START> i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite appealing these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature but with the right dialog and junk they made the movie a complete success i enjoyed this movie more then others but i highly recommend releasing and watching this movie it is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality capturing the essence of high school high school record has topped my favorites list and hopefully has a chance to be released into theaters i truly thank all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film it helped me cry my eyes our in laughter
<START> with the massive advertising this is getting on <UNK> and nick jr and that <UNK> my son was <UNK> us to see it between dvd and the theaters i've seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding <UNK> shrek to the really bad wall e brother bear but this was easily the worst movie i've ever seen kids or no kids it was a when it this stupid thing going to end kind of experience ok it's aimed at <UNK> or it better be it's insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3 but i've never seen something so predictable repetitive and slow moving then once you're finally fed up but <UNK> that the movie is over there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke but there isn't one it's serious though it's hard to tell what they're trying to accomplish the 3 d effects yeah if you've never seen a <UNK> they're a big deal otherwise no if you look at the screen without glasses it appears to be the same process even my son was bored by the end both my wife and i looked at each other and said wow at the end bad in every respect
<START> though this series only ran a season it has stayed with me for 20 years it was by far and above my all time favorite cartoon ever i would give nearly anything to have it on dvd or whatever format i can get if you find any means of seeing this series i suggest you take full advantage this series was the first one in my opinion that had a truly coherent storyline that <UNK> across multiple episodes it also made me truly care about the characters and what happened to them heck the character <UNK> actually scared me sometimes he was just that odd at the time also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of a combination of clint eastwood tommy lee jones if anyone has any way of <UNK> the creator <UNK> of the rights to the series and can get them put out on dvd please by all means do so
<START> okay i'm not going to critique this film in depth i note the many <UNK> reviews in advance of me and as i generally like maria de <UNK> i have been long <UNK> to make a <UNK> comment and in such fashion nearly a year has passed but each time i see that dvd on my shelf i sense an inner <UNK> anyway let the <UNK> voices <UNK> me but for other <UNK> like me beware br br expressed in <UNK> and <UNK> terms here's my stance br br the political turmoil and <UNK> providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life via <UNK> i read daily in my local middle european pub at that time i followed the <UNK> but never fully <UNK> what the heck was <UNK> the <UNK> tended to report either in non <UNK> terms or with a <UNK> which <UNK> upon any groups disturbing the peace or <UNK> rebellion against the establishment those were times when other winds of <UNK> <UNK> through paris berlin <UNK> and various places in the u s all of whose issues i understand clearly at the time but <UNK> or not my papers tended to treat the <UNK> of <UNK> simply as the establishment not as a well fleshed out evil empire to use <UNK> star war terms br br so week after week i read of <UNK> but never found an intelligent <UNK> that might provide the history behind them or <UNK> the practices and social economic <UNK> of the <UNK> etc br br so in <UNK> this film i had at least two hopes to finally understand the details leading up to the social <UNK> and to enjoy a well conceived drama this film gave me neither br br the film <UNK> that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts and the drama well as i said i want to encourage maria de <UNK> and the <UNK> film industry but it was trite and shallow br br i <UNK> my copy of the dvd from france selection official cannes 2000 un certain regard the box shows smiling clean <UNK> actors the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the playboy bunny after seeing the work i wondered what the french could have thought of it though as a shallow piece of cinema <UNK> with sensitive ethnic content i can understand their natural <UNK> to praise it for its honesty but br br look at the back of the box un regard <UNK> <UNK> la revolution a warm regard try describing <UNK> <UNK> and murder with a a warm regard try it with <UNK> in 1968 try it with the whole line up of <UNK> and civil <UNK> br br another review maria de <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> son pays son <UNK> et son <UNK> rubbish rubbish rubbish at least for me br br i love <UNK> in all of europe <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are my favorite cities but my love for a city and a country doesn't flesh out a vacuous film i'll hang on to my ancient vhs tapes of <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> de <UNK> meanwhile i'm stuck with a zone 2 by the above title that might as well go in the trash
<START> just like final fantasy brought cg to a whole new level this is a <UNK> for motion capture neither movie nor cartoon this motion picture looks like a homage to the film noir <UNK> sin city blade runner and the new generation of european <UNK> you see paris the way it almost could be the characters seem as real as you and i they blink trip <UNK> like real actors in a way never achieved before br br don't go watch it hoping to find a mind <UNK> you will most likely figure it out before you're half way from the movie the scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers but this definitely is bliss for the eyes
<START> i thought the river of souls was a very good <UNK> 5 movie with some exceptional performances from martin sheen tracy <UNK> and ian <UNK> if this were an episode of the series without the humour it would probably be one of my favourite stand alone stories of the series br br personally i've always preferred <UNK> to christian although granted <UNK> didn't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the byron <UNK> plot if you take out the <UNK> humour about the <UNK> and the <UNK> actors in those scenes then this movie is solid stuff probably my third favourite of the four movies but in no means bad at all
<START> now i really liked this movie it was so funny both akshay kumar and john abraham are brilliant actors i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future br br akshay kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch he acted really well <UNK> his film and i hope that he makes more great <UNK> like this one in the future john abraham plays his best friend he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really good actor i just love john <UNK> <UNK> has a small role in this film and plays it well br br the <UNK> is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone
<START> the energetic young producer of theatrical <UNK> those staged performances usually musical that often <UNK> the movie in the larger cinemas in <UNK> days must deal with crooked competition <UNK> partners <UNK> lovers amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the <UNK> parade br br while closely resembling other <UNK> musical <UNK> notably the <UNK> films this movie had a special attraction none of the others had jimmy cagney he is a wonder loose <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> as any <UNK> a creature he actually <UNK> a few times during the movie cagney grabs the viewers attention never lets go <UNK> the rapid fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma <UNK> charm br br the rest of the cast gives their best as well joan blondell is perfect as the smart mouthed big hearted blonde secretary <UNK> with cagney major <UNK> why wasn't she given a musical number dick powell ruby keeler once again play lovers <UNK> off the fact that her singing acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are <UNK> for by her dancing powell still exudes <UNK> enthusiasm in his <UNK> position as second male lead br br guy <UNK> hugh herbert are lots of fun as brothers in law both scheming to cheat cagney in different ways ruth <UNK> scores as <UNK> wealthy wife a woman devoted to her handsome <UNK> frank <UNK> <UNK> choreographer is an apt foil for <UNK> wit herman bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music <UNK> <UNK> will spot little billy <UNK> jimmy <UNK> maybe even john garfield during the musical numbers br br finally there's busby berkeley choreographer <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> throughout the decade of the 1930's were a supreme example of the cinematic <UNK> that depression audiences wanted to enjoy the big joke about <UNK> creations of course was that they were meant as part of the plot to be stage productions but no theater could ever hold these products of the <UNK> imagination they are perfect <UNK> of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera br br <UNK> musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches either a story often rather bizarre told with song dance or else stunning <UNK> designed numbers eye candy featuring <UNK> chorus girls <UNK> <UNK> a romantic tune in a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> parade <UNK> with three berkeley <UNK> honeymoon <UNK> and its pre production code telling of a <UNK> wedding night by a <UNK> dozens of <UNK> females <UNK> floating diving in perfect <UNK> designs <UNK> closely you'll see how the <UNK> effects were achieved and finally shanghai <UNK> a fitting tribute to the talents of both cagney berkeley
<START> john garfield plays a marine who is <UNK> by a <UNK> while fighting on <UNK> and who has to learn to live with his <UNK> he has all the stereotypical notions about <UNK> and is sure he'll be a burden to everyone the hospital staff and his fellow wounded marines can't get through to him neither can his girl back home played by <UNK> parker he's stubborn and <UNK> by his own fears self pity and prejudices it's a complex role that garfield carries off <UNK> in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present <UNK> melodrama the best scenes are on <UNK> where he's in a machine gun nest trying to <UNK> off the <UNK> japanese soldiers in a <UNK> looking night time battle and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a train platform with a white <UNK> dark glasses and holding out a tin cup all the while his girlfriend walks <UNK> away from the camera
<START> spirit of a murdered high school geek <UNK> a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone br br this movie really annoyed me it has a great looking monster has some good low budget effects some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad half way in i started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the dvd br br the problems with this movie are many first off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school you don't believe anything from the get go as a result the scarecrow while looking great isn't much beyond that he says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary is this a comedy or a horror movie its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up it seems more send up of every cliché than heartfelt horror film i some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it br br despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks you're paying too much br br avoid
<START> actually i'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie i saw it as part of a <UNK> film festival at a major american university but nobody in usa has heard of it which is a real shame the dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad they are stuck together on a long bus trip <UNK> most of us have been but i never had one like this br br my favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral then the man woman sneak off for some <UNK> in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing just as she raises her <UNK> and he enters her all the way the <UNK> starts <UNK> they realize everybody is watching talk about surprised but you really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny when you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did <UNK> humor at it's best
<START> this movie has great stars in their earlier years <UNK> stevens never looked <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was a very convincing jean <UNK> conflicted about his <UNK> and <UNK> to keep <UNK> with the united states charlton heston did a pretty good job as andrew jackson but some moments were a bit stilted it's really a good flick for students to learn that part of our history and it shows that all happy endings do not include the lovers getting together with each other sometimes the happier ending is that they <UNK> away and find partners of similar background who will understand them better in the long run i have viewed it every year at least twice for 16 years now and though it is not the best movie i've ever seen i love it every time
<START> what why are people saying this is mind blowing just face it the ending is on of the worst endings in the history of cinematography 4 left and the whole world has ended not to mention the character 9 was a idiot the whole time he got everyone killed 1 was right the whole time if he sacrificed 9 then non of this would have happened people giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what to make it rain i admit the movie had it's parts and the whole concept was fascinating but a lot of it was clichés one after another and did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like lord of the rings characters died for stupid reasons there was almost no character development and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guys left in the world its pointless and stupid it was one of the <UNK> movies i've ever seen and thank god how is robots turning against humans creative in any way it's been done like a hundred times this movie is really stupid go see a movie that's worth watching like star trek the <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> those were good movies
<START> what an insult to the <UNK> film industry i have seen better <UNK> films the comments i read about <UNK> stories by saying it is worthy of a ten out of ten is quite scary a movie's rating should not depend on oh a movie from a developing country lets boost their industry by saying nice things about their work even though it is bad we have the expertise to make good movies don't judge the film industry on what people say how great they think <UNK> stories is we can tell great stories such as cry the beloved country and <UNK> <UNK> cry the beloved country i'll give 9 out of 10 great directing by <UNK> great acting by two great elderly actors <UNK> from where they are <UNK> stories i'll give 1 out of 10 it could only be people involved in the project who would give it high scores i would've done the same if it was my movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> 1963 ' was my first film from samuel fuller and there i was impressed with the director's <UNK> <UNK> of b movie and big budget <UNK> even if the story itself was pure schlock <UNK> on south street 1953 ' was released a decade earlier in <UNK> career obviously produced on a larger budget from a big name studio <UNK> century fox nevertheless the visuals are still notable in that there's a somewhat raw <UNK> element to the photography not unlike <UNK> 'the night and the city 1950 ' and <UNK> <UNK> in the streets 1950 ' the latter was also shot by cinematographer joe <UNK> in some scenes fuller <UNK> the camera so close to his actors' faces that they're out of focus <UNK> <UNK> the intimate thoughts emotions and brief <UNK> that are <UNK> through that most revealing of facial features the eye though unexpectedly prone to melodrama and with just a hint of anti communist propaganda <UNK> on south <UNK> is a strong film noir that succeeds most <UNK> in its <UNK> of setting  the underground of new york city br br when just out of prison <UNK> skip mccoy richard widmark <UNK> the purse of a woman on the subway jean peters he <UNK> more than he'd originally <UNK> for the woman candy and her cowardly ex boyfriend joey richard <UNK> had been <UNK> top secret information to the <UNK> and <UNK> has unexpectedly <UNK> an important roll of <UNK> film will he turn in the <UNK> to the proper authorities or sell it to the highest <UNK> if <UNK> on south <UNK> has a flaw it's that the story seems designed solely to <UNK> an anti communist agenda <UNK> of propaganda like nothing since wwii dwight taylor who <UNK> the story also notably wrote 'the thin man goes home 1944 ' the only <UNK> movie of the series for no apparent reason every <UNK> character  even the <UNK> self serving skip mccoy  eventually becomes a self <UNK> <UNK> the transformation predictable from the outset in traditional film noir the <UNK> criminal always gets his <UNK> the rational punishment for his sins but apparently not when they've served their country <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> clean br br richard widmark an actor who i'm really beginning to like plays the <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> though always with that hint of ill ease that suggests he's biting off more than he can chew the opening scene on the train is the film's finest as mccoy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> around in his <UNK> hand bag <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1959 ' thelma ritter is terrific as a tired street woman <UNK> <UNK> information to anybody willing to pay for it though of course she draws the line at <UNK> jean peters is well cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side playing the role almost completely devoid of <UNK> fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow <UNK> <UNK> of a prostitute nevertheless peters must suffer a contrived love affair with widmark that really brings down the film's attempts at realism <UNK> upon its release <UNK> on south <UNK> was promptly condemned as communist propaganda by the fbi and the communist party condemned it for being the exact opposite go figure
<START> this movie is little more than poorly made fetish porn and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era this was recommended to me by friend as a unique film experience he was right i suppose he meant that as a joke not disgusting not even that shocking just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art a little bit of camp value though i don't believe the makers of this film intended this and yes as a previous reviewer mentioned it's sex with a guy in a bear suit don't spend a lot of money on this try to borrow it if you must see it or contact me i'd be happy to sell you my copy for half price br br i may have to see another of this particular director's films as he seems to have a certain following but if it's anything like this i will again regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever

<START> i was watching this movie at one of my usual time which is real real late at night usually if a movie doesn't interest me i start falling asleep and have to raid the <UNK> to stay awake br br at first i thought that's what i had to do since this movie's pacing started off slow along with the fact that its shots tended to <UNK> with the character for a long time but after a bit i start getting more into the movie as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling by the end you feel like you've known him your whole life the movie kept my interest so much that i didn't even know the sun was about to rise br br not much of lynch's <UNK> style but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing
<START> as a kid i thought this movie was great it had animals it had beautiful music and it had my favorite actor michael j fox now i still love this movie for different reasons it has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera it has beautiful well written musical that fits the scenes perfectly with rousing fast paced <UNK> and the heart wrenching main theme that still makes me cry even when people hum it and it has my favorite actor michael j fox br br based on a book this is the story of three house pets an intelligent overly <UNK> and considerably <UNK> lab by the name of shadow a witty and vain but still smart cat with a fear of water named sassy and a street smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic <UNK> chance the three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away <UNK> and worried the pets break out and plan a trip across the <UNK> mountains for the trip of their lives a truly incredible journey so what maybe home is just over that mountain but what if it isn't br br i suggest <UNK> bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters and for anyone else that yeah everyone go watch it
<START> rob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a crap load of kids that look nothing like either of them br br basically rob and <UNK> have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during a vegas vacation they each come home to find that their respective children already know of the <UNK> due to <UNK> like not so fodder they rob and <UNK> move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other's house br br rob builds furniture i think which is close enough to frank <UNK> patrick <UNK> construction job on the much similar step by step to warrant eternal <UNK> br br <UNK> is some sort of cookie making queen though it doesn't look like she makes any of the <UNK> not close enough to carol <UNK> suzanne <UNK> <UNK> job to warrant <UNK> <UNK> but hilariously preposterous enough to warrant atrocity <UNK> br br unlike step by step they were a couple before the vacation and actually knew one <UNK> last names or so one assumes if their serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together br br anyhow there are eight kids <UNK> sandy jeff lily daisy nathan andrew l and andrew b i personally think they should've just called the younger andrew <UNK> br br there's a lot of product placement particularly for soup at hand which is disgusting and <UNK> pocket packs there are also some stupid senseless moments it's also not a great film to promote happy families br br but hey rob <UNK> this concludes my review of <UNK> by step on some really bad drugs ' watch it for rob <UNK> and his pretty eyes there are some great pretty eyes shots
<START> devil dog sets your heart racing it's brilliantly paced the ending comes like a <UNK> out of the blue and <UNK> itself into the very centre of your being you'll never look at your dog the same way again in fact you'll start thinking of having it put down by a priest fantastic
<START> this 1973 tv remake of the billy wilder classic is inferior to the original surprise br br first the good things lee j <UNK> makes a terrific barton <UNK> he's not as good as edward g robinson of course but he's the only reason to watch this this <UNK> only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of lola <UNK> the step daughter of the femme fatale <UNK> <UNK> br br and that's it for the good things br br the bad things are many the director records everything in an indifferent manner if you watched the film with the sound muted you'd hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening because of modern bad taste the film must be in color instead of black and white because of 1970s bad taste all the sets are <UNK> ugly walter <UNK> expensive apartment in particular is hideous br br the modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways train <UNK> were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s so mr <UNK> decision to take a train seems more of a <UNK> men stopped wearing hats which <UNK> walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white haired mr <UNK> women in mourning stopped wearing <UNK> which <UNK> samantha <UNK> of a prop barbara stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene oddly lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and <UNK> before she had need of them br br stephen <UNK> keeps much of the billy wilder raymond chandler script the same but he makes a lot of tiny inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly <UNK> where once it was lean and muscular outrageously the famous motorcycle cop banter is gone but look closely and you'll see what looks like a post production cut where those lines should have been <UNK> may not be to blame br br richard crenna is passable as walter <UNK> what might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid <UNK> <UNK> instead we get samantha <UNK> who comes off like a standard issue <UNK> from <UNK> jones but who can blame <UNK> with a director who barely seems interested in what's happening in front of the camera how could barbara stanwyck herself have come off well
<START> on rare occasions a film comes along that has the power to expand the mind warm the heart and touch the very soul lou is such a film i got lou from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film business she watched it for a second time with me we were both enthralled her as if for the first time again br br lou is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment at which all of your dramas started taking place it does this while being relentlessly entertaining <UNK> <UNK> acting and pacing as a director do not let you look away from the screen he <UNK> a character which <UNK> with a bugs bunny like <UNK> innocence but <UNK> carried with such <UNK> sincerity that you forget you're watching a movie when the <UNK> hits during the brilliant climax i saw my wife in tears for the second time br br as a life coach i <UNK> individual growth and transformation and this film is a must see for life <UNK> and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation it is a brilliant creative masterpiece with the power to change lives
<START> dressed to kill is surely one of the best horror thriller movies ever made it's taut stylish and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and violence the acting is pretty good the <UNK> score by <UNK> <UNK> is unforgettable and there's plenty of surprises to keep thriller fans intrigued dressed to kill is a murder mystery that involves a sexually frustrated housewife angie dickinson her teenage son keith gordon her <UNK> michael caine and a high price call girl nancy allen the murderer in the film is a <UNK> named <UNK> who is also one of <UNK> patients the film is full of breathtaking moments the infamous elevator murder scene is extremely stylish and pretty gory as well highly recommended
<START> seriously this is one of the most stupid family shows of all time br br plot a family without a mother and 3 <UNK> raise 3 little girls in san francisco california br br characters neat freak danny cartoon loving joey hair obsessed jesse spoiled brat michelle stupid dj and almost normal stephanie the creators of this show really want you to hate the characters don't they br br therefore i do not think anyone should watch this show i only <UNK> at a few moments in the show's whole running and i think that instead of lethal <UNK> all criminals should be forced to watch this show a torture far worse than anything else br br 1 5 10 or d
<START> for starters i would like to say that i'm a fan of the american pie series even though 'the naked <UNK> and this one are the two worst this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series br br first of all the best part of the film was that it was an american pie film which is always appreciated br br however there are <UNK> of bad things to say about this film first of all the story has a very stale <UNK> structure first there is the introduction of the characters then the <UNK> of the <UNK> house and finally the greek <UNK> each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length apart from the general <UNK> of the plot there is little to no character development which makes a double <UNK> of a bad plot br br apart from that i deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film that is showing the <UNK> as the extremely cool only thinking about sex guys and <UNK> displaying the <UNK> as inferior also it shows females only as sexual objects and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects br br apart from that the acting was also poor with perhaps the exception of steve <UNK> br br so in the end a generally horrid film if seen from a critical point of view if seen from a teen point of view i guess that it's better but this film is rated 18 in most countries so it shouldn't really be seen by <UNK>
<START> kate beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet <UNK> charming emma in this tv adaptation of jane <UNK> novel when i read that novel i was sometimes quite <UNK> whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story for honestly she is so terribly self righteous and scheming that one is tempted to dislike her seriously kate <UNK> interpretation however saves emma from herself so to speak she is portrayed with all the innocence and <UNK> of her character in full view and one <UNK> help but give in and like not to say love her in spite of her less <UNK> qualities kate beckinsale is the main but not the only reason why this tv series is so delightful raymond <UNK> is perfect as mr frank <UNK> expressing this <UNK> personal <UNK> to the full which is all the more <UNK> because of this role being not very well handled by ewan <UNK> in the 1996 screen adaptation of emma and mark strong samantha <UNK> bernard <UNK> and olivia williams are all as they should be in their respective roles this production is in short a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure
<START> i wasn't at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit hostel and most of these lame ass knock offs are just as bad or worse yet live feed managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings followed by some good death scenes involving the chinese organized crime squad and a 7 foot leather <UNK> butcher what put me out of the movie was the tough <UNK> with the guns and a grudge saving the day i would call this movie mediocre at best since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater <UNK> as a <UNK> for the mafia is appealing to me if only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective then my rating would have <UNK> greatly unfortunately most of the <UNK> is <UNK> together in one scene leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge type scenario so basically it is just a low budget hostel rip off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex almost constant during the first half of the film overall i would say don't bother with this one
<START> the best cheech chong movie so far of all the cheech and chong this is most certain the best so far i think i've seen them all about twelve times at least and i love them all but this is most definitely the best compared with the others this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs part of the <UNK> are still part of our language today after 25 years i hope that one day they can make another one because they still are great comedians i heard they are writing a new script so who knows i guess these guys are the only ones who succeeded in making decent movies in this genre i wonder if john <UNK> ever watched one of them
<START> big <UNK> film of the broadway music nathan frank sinatra loves to roll the <UNK> and <UNK> illegal crap games blonde loving <UNK> vivian <UNK> wants to marry him if he gives up <UNK> he decides on one last game when sky masterson marlon brando who <UNK> big is in town he <UNK> sky that he can't get mission worker sarah brown jean simmons to go with him to <UNK> that may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie br br this is a real mixed bag there's some wonderful stuff here the songs are all good and the dancing is incredible the real show <UNK> is at the crap game at the end also brando is really quite good here it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off i have to admit seeing big <UNK> brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun also sinatra is pretty good and <UNK> is just wonderful as his long suffering girlfriend her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here br br now for the bad parts jean simmons is a wonderful actress but she's stuck with a drab <UNK> role and can't do much with it the movie is far too long at 150 minutes the scenes between brando and simmons really drag and should have been <UNK> also most of the characters speak in very precise english <UNK> are never used maybe it's trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but i found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie br br it's worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while i give it a 7
<START> battlestar <UNK> was so great because it had tight writing a great look excellent actors and interesting stories and yeah had hot men and women running around in and out of uniform br br caprica was just lazy lazy writing actors smoking up a storm to give them character <UNK> sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else yes that is a ford focus sitting in the background lots and lots of teenage angst lots of <UNK> naked women but in the background which i'm sure will be cut for the series and a token view of some men in <UNK> none of the actors except polly walker took my attention at all at an hour and a half i was still wondering when it was going to be over br br so what exactly is it that's supposed to bring me back the science fiction it's awfully light on that the actors besides polly <UNK> fine turn there isn't much interesting being done here there aren't even any <UNK> in the cast except for maybe <UNK> although for the younger set he's pretty old since he's over 25 br br i loved bsg i was skeptical when i heard about caprica and unfortunately i think i'm right i predict a very short run for it as a series unless they really <UNK> their <UNK> over at scifi and get to work making this more than the <UNK> on another planet
<START> while the premise of the film is pretty lame ollie is <UNK> with <UNK> the film is an <UNK> and enjoyable little flick it's also a darn bit better than the films they went on to make after this one probably since this was the last hal roach produced laurel and hardy film in fact it wouldn't be a bad idea not to see any of their latter films as the entire chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their parts purely for pathos something true laurel and hardy films never would do they had a bit of an edge that all the later films lack br br stan and ollie work at a horn factory this sounds pretty funny but it isn't not surprisingly with all the <UNK> ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and must take some time off work the doctor james <UNK> in his last film with the team <UNK> an ocean voyage however they don't like <UNK> and stan has an idea of just renting a boat tied to the <UNK> then they can get all the sea air they want without all the bother once they are on the boat a dangerous escaped criminal boards the boat and they all accidentally set out to sea fortunately this portion of the film actually was well paced and the very end worked out very well br br while not a great full length laurel and hardy film it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers like in the devil's brother or babes in <UNK> additionally there is still a decent amount of physical comedy something you would see almost none of after this film part of this was due to the <UNK> <UNK> health and <UNK> increasing <UNK> and part of it was due to the overall <UNK> of these later films
<START> not that i dislike <UNK> movies but this was a <UNK> with few redeeming qualities m j fox was the perfect voice for stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted hugh laurie can be amazingly funny but is not given the chance in this movie it´s sugar <UNK> sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years of age see toy story monsters inc or shrek instead 3 10
<START> british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types the quiet <UNK> usually romantic study and the <UNK> social satire settings characters and concepts <UNK> but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories <UNK> is perhaps the <UNK> of the first type br br the scripts are very verbal including long interior monologues by the main character <UNK> a basically happy but <UNK> housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she <UNK> on a thoroughly conventional life when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman who makes his interest in her quite clear she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered br br the acting and scripts are always on the money which makes one's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one i was neither blown away by it nor turned off my mother on the other hand <UNK> this show i think the degree to which one <UNK> with <UNK> dilemma is the most important factor in <UNK> one's reaction to <UNK>
<START> it's a good thing the score came along for marlon brando as a farewell performance because i'd hate to think of him going out on free money not what his fans ought to remember him by br br brando in his last years is looking more like orson welles and free money is the kind of film welles would have done looking for <UNK> of his own work brando is the warden of a local prison which in america when it's located in a small rural setting is usually the largest <UNK> in the area that gives one who is in charge a lot of <UNK> br br unfortunately he has one weakness he <UNK> his two twin <UNK> otherwise known as daughters even when they get simultaneously pregnant by a pair of losers charlie sheen and thomas <UNK> church their hearts still belong to daddy br br not to fear because <UNK> willing to give them jobs in the prison where they work under conditions not much better than the <UNK> have what to do but commit a robbery of a train which goes through the <UNK> every so often carrying used money to be burned by the <UNK> br br although free money has some moments of humor for most of the time it's quite beneath the talents of all those involved some of them would include donald sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and mira sorvino as his <UNK> but also straight arrow fbi agent br br of course these people and the rest of the cast got to work with someone who many rate as the greatest american actor of the last century were it not for <UNK> presence and were it some 40 years earlier free money would be playing the drive in circuit in red state america where the <UNK> could see how they're being <UNK> br br or a feeble attempt is made to <UNK> them
<START> this independent film was one of the best films at the tall grass film festival that i have ever seen there i loved it there are so many things that was great about the film on top of all that the cast and crew that i had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenal i thought that <UNK> did a great job in his role and ricky <UNK> was absolutely true to his role for a disney actor i was amazed at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role with no problems the talent in the film was just amazing the cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent film this is one really that you should see i think that mr <UNK> would have been so proud to have such a <UNK> in his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite they went and saw it again this truly was a great film it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous i am honestly just so <UNK> by this film and i really don't want to spoil it for any one just see it and truly be amazed at it i think that these film makers really have what it takes to go places and i hope to see more work from them in the future
<START> let me say first that this show was top <UNK> when john ritter was there upon his death the show did drop off a bit but the producers didn't give up on the show adding james garner and david spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005 br br the show centers around the <UNK> family paul john ritter may he rest in peace his wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their daughters bridget <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> amy <UNK> and their son <UNK> martin <UNK> when ritter was on the show i would <UNK> in laughter and proud to admit it i am but now that he's gone i'll only laugh a little with the occasional <UNK> laugh i'm very glad that i fell for this show's <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> death because it made the <UNK> with ritter so much better br br <UNK> character is just so well acted and well rounded that you can't help but love him he is always <UNK> the girls around about dating but he really wants them to be happy it's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment br br <UNK> <UNK> is great as well and she too is a likable character after <UNK> death her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids but i believe <UNK> has shaped the lives of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> because she and ritter had been friends for a long time br br the funniest person on the show would have to be bridget <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> she is the ultimate blonde gorgeous slow dim witted yet she is a smart person she is off the wall hilarious with her innocent <UNK> humor and how <UNK> she is br br amy <UNK> can get a tad annoying as <UNK> but that's the purpose of her character the only fault of the show is that the show never really gives <UNK> anything to be happy about she's always after bridget and her character feels like it's just thrown in there br br martin <UNK> as the lone <UNK> son is hysterical and when ritter is on the show he's mostly comic material upon the death of ritter the show does provide some story lines for <UNK> br br david spade and james garner are all nothing but laughs with the occasional side story for c j <UNK> character garner plays <UNK> father as a bit of background information br br all in all i give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it you'll enjoy it br br 9 10 spy
<START> every year i watch hundreds of films including many low budget amateurish straight to dvd <UNK> that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see i have seen thousands of films in my time many excellent many forgettable zombie nation i will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable <UNK> films i have ever seen  in fact i still haven't <UNK> from the experience of watching it br br the day after it seems like some kind of weird dream did i really see what i thought i saw why do the police work out of a warehouse did the voodoo <UNK> really recommend that the <UNK> eat <UNK> is it safe is it safe is it safe br br i wouldn't recommend zombie nation if you want to see a <UNK> film and neither would i recommend it as <UNK> bad its <UNK> however if you are entertained by the <UNK> of watching probably the most <UNK> abysmal film ever  this is for you now whenever anyone asks me what the worst film i have ever seen is i will say zombie nation br br seriously  i think it's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one and <UNK> <UNK> deserves credit for producing a film that actually <UNK> you with its <UNK> he really is the ed wood jr of the digital age and i for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one
<START> <UNK> but naive big joe buck leaves his home in big spring texas and <UNK> off to the big apple in search of women and big bucks in nyc <UNK> meets up with frustration and with ratso rizzo a <UNK> but <UNK> con artist somehow this <UNK> pair manage to survive each other which in turn helps both of them cope with a gritty sometimes brutal urban america en route to a poignant ending br br both funny and depressing our midnight cowboy rides head on into the <UNK> of <UNK> cultural change and thus <UNK> to 1969 viewers that they themselves have been swept away from the 1950's age of innocence and dropped dorothy and <UNK> like into the 1960's age of <UNK> br br the film's direction is masterful the casting is perfect the acting is top notch the script is crisp and <UNK> the cinematography is engaging and the music enhances all of the above deservedly it won the best picture oscar of 1969 and i would vote it as one of the best films of that <UNK> decade
<START> the last reviewer was very generous i quiet like the first movie but can't say i enjoy this one very much the beginning is bearable but it goes downhill pretty quickly i just don't see jon bon <UNK> as a bad ass vampire hunter and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary a lot of the scenes just do not make sense i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you let alone an experienced hunter why <UNK> is able to communicate with <UNK> nothing was ever explain in this movie you wouldn't mind if it was entertaining but that was too much to ask this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen
<START> i thought this movie had absolutely no moral i mean how would you feel if your fiancé left you on your wedding day for your cousin i would be <UNK> it's classified as a comedy but i didn't find it funny at all i thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them i normally love julie stiles movies but this is an exception jason lee stars in another <UNK> show which once again proves that class and decent morals are not relevant in todays society it had a complete lack of taste and i despise movies like this i understand that people will defend this movie and it's morals because it is <UNK> a <UNK> but i still stand by my mark that this bad behaviour shouldn't be allowed on screen i'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie you are a bad person as everyone is entitled to their own opinion and parts of this movie were enjoyable i'm just saying that in real life people acting like the characters in this film were doing is shameful
<START> br br this is definitely a <UNK> <UNK> for those who occasionally smoke a <UNK> in their secret hide out trying to avoid being caught by parents teachers the police etc the protagonist is a lady in her forties living in her mansion <UNK> <UNK> and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her when he all of the sudden dies she is confronted with the truth the <UNK> comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt she doesn't know what to do until her <UNK> tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start <UNK> pot instead the story is quite original the performances outstanding i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one still the melodramatic touch is present the film is typical british the jokes aren't vulgar there is no violence involved it shouldn't be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few <UNK> before watching <UNK> <UNK> it will be so much more fun especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious i thought my <UNK> would burst 9 10
<START> first off i want to say that this film is worthy of more than the four stars i rated it i gave it four stars because for me this <UNK> minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all however the big alligator river the title my dvd calls it is better than your average nature strikes back movie br br a tourist resort in the <UNK> of <UNK> asia is just opening and employs the natives while trying to manipulate the <UNK> around mother nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god <UNK> a giant alligator but the creature isn't the only thing the tourists and the main characters a photographer and the resort staff have to worry about the natives are getting <UNK> the wrong way too br br this movie is a pretty well done adventure horror story with a good musical score and direction but the alligator itself the main attraction of the movie is obviously fake looking some of the close ups of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see some of the underwater far away shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator <UNK> toy you can probably get at a <UNK> <UNK> shop but the natives are believable if not authentic br br probably not the movie that will give you non stop thrills if any but shot and produced well enough to be given good mention and like a lot of creature movies this one ends with an extremely high body count it also has lots of good jungle scenery acting is below par though but who was expecting it to be better eh br br much much better than its recent american counterpart <UNK> but nothing to be compared with jaws but remember it may not be engaging at a few points
<START> this movie could have been so much better especially considering the talent <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of frankie <UNK> was not good especially in musical performances he doesn't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are <UNK> <UNK> when he should have been frankie <UNK> the portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold <UNK> has hollywood written all over it the powers that be obviously pushed it but it only made the characters more unrealistic the <UNK> of the movie were <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of little richard and the cameo of little richard himself <UNK> <UNK> is eye candy as usual even in a conservative role it's too bad that the talents of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a fox were wasted the whole frankie <UNK> saga was fascinating in real life too bad this film was a wasted opportunity
<START> i have no idea why they made this version of <UNK> when they already had that fine mini series with amanda root and <UNK> <UNK> i suppose that they wanted to make a feature length version but of course a lot had to be deleted alas what ended up on the cutting room floor was all the lovely wit and humour leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of english country manners and <UNK> br br also the characters were shallow and uninteresting they had poor anne chasing up and down the streets after captain <UNK> like a silly modern adolescent and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this let me tell you running after a male like a female in heat is not cool that is something a well <UNK> woman of the <UNK> era would never have done and certainly not this level headed heroine br br some have said they found this <UNK> laughable my reaction was not laughter but outrage the very idea of such a corruption of an austen work is beneath contempt br br it was ghastly
<START> this movie forever left an impression on me i watched it as a <UNK> in high school and was home alone that night i think i lost all respect for robert reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the brady bunch i also thought the role of chuck connor was horrendous and evil however this movie made such an impact on me that i am now a <UNK> in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change <UNK> lives one at a time what <UNK> me is that so few people actually watched this movie none of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when i discuss this movie because they didn't see it
<START> the fourth man paul verhoeven <UNK> 1983 br br a film based on a <UNK> by gerard <UNK> that works best as a thriller that's quite surprising considering <UNK> roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work br br the fourth man is top heavy on symbolism paul verhoeven is generally extremely <UNK> with proving something to mostly hostile critics and i'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove he usually <UNK> his audience and tells his story in such an <UNK> way he quickly <UNK> from the original idea or storyline and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out in the fourth man he is not as explicit on <UNK> the plot as he is with sex and nudity of which there's plenty but as in most of his films he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and <UNK> home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes there's hardly a scene without sex or full frontal nudity most of it so <UNK> gratuitous and in your face it <UNK> an otherwise good story br br nevertheless when you can cope with verhoeven's pretty obvious <UNK> approach it's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round <UNK> hoffman and <UNK> <UNK> in particular br br camera <UNK> 7 10
<START> wow <UNK> the worst movie i have ever seen this person should never make another movie i cant believe anyone would have produce this in good conscience you have have wasted every <UNK> no concept of real life i have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back ever everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed i'm embarrassed for them all of you should be ashamed if i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by 5 years please never watch this movie i have never written a <UNK> about a film before but the <UNK> for this film has compelled me to do so
<START> this movie is an amusing and utterly sarcastic view of pop culture and the producers thereof i was impressed with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin <UNK> settings especially when you think that this is <UNK> first large scale attempt br br one warning do not take the movie's message that seriously it is not for mass <UNK> and that is not a compliment the message is a somewhat stylized post college <UNK> view of society br br i did enjoy the basic plot line of a <UNK> <UNK> editor <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the 90's
<START> i was unsure whether or not andy <UNK> could repeat his success with the cinematic hit <UNK> express with his film fit to kill he has proved that <UNK> is a serious filmmaker and not just a one shot director the plot written by <UNK> which was <UNK> passed up by the academy is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns the main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as <UNK> cleverly <UNK> is actually their secret <UNK> in fit to kill they confront their long time nemesis kane who is trying to steal one of <UNK> most <UNK> <UNK> a well written screenplay is not all excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic <UNK> by the critics and the box office this film will be appreciated in years to come it is now suffering the same fate as clockwork orange and taxi driver did but in the future will <UNK> become recognized i am disappointed no critic circles have recognized andy <UNK> trademark filmmaking the costumes the special effects all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking it may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself my personal rating is 10 10 the drama is as thick as the blockbuster runaway bride and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece last action hero andy keep up the good work
<START> i just saw this at the <UNK> film festival and can't quite decide about it we were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them maybe that was the point that we are all in a bubble of our own but these people didn't <UNK> me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various <UNK> at a running time of just over an hour the characters weren't very well developed lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the slightly creepy looking baby dolls with surprisingly <UNK> eyes that most of the characters made for a living were somehow more interesting than the live people an interesting experiment but somehow it never quite came together
<START> after having read two or three negative reviews on the main page of imdb for pushing daisies and having literally minutes ago finished watching the final episode i thought it was about time i said what i thought of <UNK> br br first off to address what some of the issues that i have seen other people having with this show something along the lines of i expect the people who have been <UNK> from the dead to have a more realistic reaction realistic on this show pushing daisies is truly pure and utter <UNK> it's colour palette the dialogue used the scenarios situations music all of it to me is just an escape from everyday life an escape from the mundane and boring it is here where pushing daisies <UNK> exceptionally well pushing daisies isn't for everyone a large majority of the television audience don't get it for some people it's just too out there and silly but for people like me even from the first episode i watched of it season <UNK> <UNK> and i was just blown away by the show from then on i bought both the box sets and they have barely been out of my dvd player other people i know can't stand it it really seems to be like <UNK> br br the show follows the adventures of ned the <UNK> with a magic finger who brings back childhood sweetheart charlotte charles works in association with private investigator <UNK> <UNK> owns the pie hole and employs waitress <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the main cast members are aunts lily and vivian whom charlotte chuck is never allowed to see they live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life everything is shown with a wonderfully bright <UNK> of colour and narrated by jim <UNK> br br other than <UNK> the <UNK> of the show i really can't praise it much more without saying just watch it despite being screwed over by the writer's <UNK> of america strike with only 22 episodes ever to be made it provides wonderful plot twists story lines characters and situations while providing for me a satisfying ending yes i could tell it had been tacked on the end and rushed but i was still happy with the way it went out whether it is creative or just pretentious for a lot of people me included it made the most <UNK> and wonderful viewing and i hope for the future of television that more shows like this are created so i'm not left with just 22 40 minute memories of what true entertainment can be
<START> arthur <UNK> great skill as a comic was in the way he <UNK> with his public his juvenile jokes silly songs and <UNK> dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world a lack of a live audience was a distinct <UNK> to him and he was never completely comfortable in films he has his moments in the ghost train and his character tommy <UNK> has been <UNK> to make the most of his talents but <UNK> the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated br br <UNK> support in the film is not strong it includes regular co star richard <UNK> betty <UNK> and stuart <UNK> as a dopey honeymoon couple <UNK> <UNK> going over the top as a <UNK> <UNK> also on board are peter murray hill who off screen married <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> leading man giving a totally bland reading of the part and leading lady carol <UNK> who turns in an equally insipid performance it is left to character actress kathleen harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets <UNK> on dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i was never quite sure where this thing was going these people seem interested in what is going on on some mountain they investigate have narrow escapes leave come back leave put each other in danger <UNK> get attacked by witches who have consistent <UNK> etc etc the guy seems to like the girl but leaves her <UNK> numerous times she gets taken off he gets her back leaves her again you get the point the whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice i think but i'm not sure or turning people into witches but i'm not sure it's just dull and endless and not worth the time there are some atmospheric scenes but the print is so bad that there times when twenty seconds of <UNK> is not unusual is this caused by age or the <UNK> of night <UNK>
<START> i had intended to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> passing with numerous <UNK> films of his that i own on vhs however given my ongoing light hearted christmas marathon i had to make do with just this one as it happens it features one of his best performances and he was <UNK> oscar nominated for it with the film itself being likewise <UNK> this was also one of 14 <UNK> with that other most widely recognized star to emerge from italy sophia loren both incidentally are playing against type here she as an <UNK> housewife and he a homosexual br br by the way the film's title has a double meaning the leading characters are brought together on the historic day in which hitler came to italy to meet <UNK> the event itself being shown in lengthy archive footage but it more specifically refers to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in which they share moments of friendship revelation and briefly passion though each knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable which leads to the film's abrupt bittersweet ending this is virtually a two <UNK> with all other characters save for the <UNK> <UNK> of the apartment block in which the story takes place in its entirety which include <UNK> gruff and <UNK> patriotic husband surprisingly played by john <UNK> appear only at the beginning and closing sequences still the <UNK> setting doesn't <UNK> director <UNK> for the record this is the <UNK> film of his that i've watched and own 3 more on vhs and cinematographer <UNK> de <UNK> so that the result though essentially low key is far from <UNK> the camera is allowed to <UNK> the various sections of the large building <UNK> the proceedings <UNK> or <UNK> as the situation requires but always <UNK> br br the narrative of course depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be convincing and they both deliver their on screen chemistry is quite <UNK> it's interesting however that while loren walked away with the <UNK> in their home <UNK> it's <UNK> moving yet <UNK> <UNK> the film somewhat <UNK> does seem to <UNK> his sexual <UNK> with anti <UNK> who generally impressed international audiences
<START> following a sitcom plot is so <UNK> easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of <UNK> that sitcoms could really use the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> persona which beyond general <UNK> has no specific recurring traits for <UNK> expectations to be based on making her less a character than a <UNK> to be <UNK> in every episode if not scene <UNK> ability to see everything from an outside perspective <UNK> her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go <UNK> every time she speaks it's like a self contained 5 second skit she <UNK> a lot <UNK> the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can <UNK> but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied this may be the most creative original and experimental tv program ever
<START> ella was excellent <UNK> was <UNK> over the top but he played similar parts in other films such as the man on the <UNK> tower and alan was nearly non existent but the film certainly thrilled br br mild spoiler ahead i wonder how many times elisha cook got <UNK> in his films but i seem to recall various other examples i will avoid <UNK> the murderer but i think it's necessarily obvious because of the plot thriller demands br br a very well done but dated film <UNK> for example everyone <UNK> like crazy and the police were really stock characters and no dead bodies were ever shown unlike today's gore <UNK> done in the familiar short scene <UNK> format of the period br br 8 out of 10
<START> for some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion someone makes a film about a killer shark then all of a sudden the film world s <UNK> are <UNK> with giant <UNK> killer <UNK> and sea monsters of every <UNK> a man is stalked by an <UNK> lover from hell then every film character is stalked by a cop from hell or a <UNK> from hell or a babysitter from hell then when a major hollywood company produces a big budget fx laden blockbuster about <UNK> then other film producers jump upon the <UNK> the fact that they don t have the budget to pull it off <UNK> t stop them night of the <UNK> is a case in point what struck me about this made for television film is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting to the ad breaks <UNK> a <UNK> appears the <UNK> locks onto the horrified expression of the actors as they scream things like oh my <UNK> it s heading this way and run for your lives then the screen fades to black saving the producers the need to up the special effects budget unfortunately night of the <UNK> budget should have been <UNK> to include better actors the cast are by no means bad but they are unimpressive and lack the skill to carry a film which is character driven where s josh <UNK> and <UNK> wood when you need them br br and the last word on this being a <UNK> clone yes <UNK> was released a couple of months before <UNK> but <UNK> had been hyped for several months as being the summer blockbuster of 1996 and <UNK> has a rushed feeling to it which leads me to believe that it was made and released to tie in with the hype surrounding <UNK>
<START> um okay i guess i get the whole shaky <UNK> gorilla style filming technique but unfortunately i think a gorilla could have made a better movie this thing was just a complete mess from the get go bad acting bad directing bad story and horrific cinematography how this piece of garbage was released i will never know but it has and unfortunately i watched it filmed on location in <UNK> by the directing team of greg <UNK> and ryan <UNK> harry and lloyd five across the eyes i'm assuming is supposed to resemble a blair witch type film but falls short okay it nose <UNK> off a cliff i was actually embarrassed for these young women whom i'm sure were promised hollywood stardom but ended up in this dung heap the dialog is ridiculous and actually <UNK> you as you listen to it how this is supposed to be a horror flick is another mystery as there is nothing even remotely scary about it except for the fact that i watched it try this one on for size there is 5 of you and 1 of her do the <UNK> and beat her ass the end <UNK> it went on and on for 95 more minutes of mind numbing stupidity br br i saw it for free and wanted my money back
<START> this film is a <UNK> rip off of one of the best novels of all time <UNK> <UNK> by george <UNK> br br the details of the film shown on imdb do give <UNK> to the original <UNK> but i did not see this at the beginning of the film only a credit at the end of it saying suggested by the book <UNK> <UNK> suggested it was nothing but a complete rip off of all the essential elements of the story br br a <UNK> and sad old man an <UNK> poor and lonely has all his money stolen one night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside the man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local <UNK> or rich politician here demands to adopt the child it is he who has <UNK> the child during an <UNK> affair years before the battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child br br in this and every other aspect of the film the story is exactly the same in only one can i find a difference <UNK> <UNK> had <UNK> but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of mr martin too far on top of that he has his hair <UNK> in some <UNK> juice <UNK> presumably to make him look younger but actually making him look more the clown that he is there is also the addition of meaningless jokes that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the <UNK> of the story like when the child cries in the <UNK> <UNK> she can only be happy with the man who has <UNK> her all these years this is conveyed in the film by the girl <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the bridge of her nose to make her <UNK> br br i am surprised that <UNK> and integrity within the film industry <UNK> such a film to be made if i was a <UNK> of george <UNK> i would insist on <UNK> if i was steve martin i would send the <UNK> to that estate or to the poor at the very least it should be entitled <UNK> <UNK> adapted by s martin or better still removed from the <UNK> br br if you are interested in this story and i hope you are dismiss this completely and watch <UNK> <UNK> or read the book the bbc made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980's
<START> first of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book especially when you're dealing with master writer like <UNK> this adaptation wonderfully <UNK> <UNK> universe with 1970s <UNK> <UNK> and liberal culture yes the animation and background painting is sometimes a little rough in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less and very <UNK> in terms of giving a unique sense of place to each of the scenes beyond the absolute <UNK> in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting acting that's far superior to the acting in the new live action movies and while the cell animation might not be the most technically <UNK> animation it superbly captures the <UNK> <UNK> and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced the background paintings <UNK> from traditional fantasy <UNK> to outright <UNK> but the transition to <UNK> settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film if you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is <UNK> for you then i can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting <UNK> imagery and <UNK> <UNK> then this film is a must see
<START> i just came back from the <UNK> premiere of zero day and i'm surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie basically the blame is about <UNK> doing an easy and <UNK> social message well mr i'm a reviewer it's an easy and <UNK> critic of movies with a social charge br br not that i want to expose my life here but i come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go reject ignorance on the menu thing is i understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror high schools have became battle fields of <UNK> it's a real ugly sight you need to fight your way into being like the others it's hard to explain bit a lot of people <UNK> realize that high schools are becoming <UNK> of human intelligence meanwhile parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable <UNK> is perfect br br the real motive of the movie isn't about what is driving them it's about this death like calm <UNK> and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town cal expressed it well it's a wake up call drama is everywhere and it can take every shape in that case little dramas like andre being called a <UNK> for wearing a j c penny shirt are <UNK> into being the worse nightmare of a whole town andre cal took the most extreme way to express their pain the <UNK> of <UNK> in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted br br i like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of andre cal like if with the pain they <UNK> cal andre have <UNK> their blind rage to their community their <UNK> to think about the causes of some acts br br it might seemed aggressive as a movie but <UNK> is <UNK> more than whining or <UNK> what andre cal are living is a reality and a scary one that might get to other kids br br disturbing movie home making and strong feeling made ben <UNK> do a very very disturbing movie
<START> the haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography yes remakes aren't all bad but remakes directed by <UNK> da <UNK> definitely are i suppose that the a list actors liam neeson catherine zeta jones owen wilson are there to distract us from the boring plot ridiculous special effects and terrible attempts at <UNK> it's audience however this is a movie not a <UNK> magazine we don't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed the storyline is like taking the classic novel the haunting of hill house and ripping out four chapters and then using <UNK> left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained the characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you don't really care about any of the characters at all lily taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible <UNK> she is lily taylor isn't made for the horror genre at all the ghosts are stupid and cheesy they look like a bunch of casper the friendly <UNK> and the ghost of hugh cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim <UNK> for halloween with a smoke machine there is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad the house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesn't save it from it's brutal everything else i can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching the haunting on tv for no price so i would've been even more <UNK> ed if i had paid to see it but luckily it was on scream channel overall the haunting is a boring remake that tries to <UNK> you with bad special effects a poor attempt at horror
<START> this one is considered a key pre code film  from the director who later made the musical biopic the <UNK> story 1946 but also the paranoid sci fi invasion u s a <UNK>  and features one of barbara <UNK> best early roles br br she's supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and <UNK> character performers of the day  george brent <UNK> <UNK> edward van <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and john wayne at one point addressing stanwyck with the titular <UNK> derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout in the former category and in the latter robert <UNK> as <UNK> father donald cook as her most tragic conquest <UNK> <UNK> as her elderly mentor  more on this later arthur <UNK> as a <UNK> politician and henry <UNK> as <UNK> boss and father in law whom stanwyck also <UNK> curiously scenes in which walter brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors br br <UNK> by <UNK> i e typically hard boiled dialogue and realistic anton <UNK> sets the narrative contains unexpected overtones of <UNK> philosophy fed to our small town heroine by the intellectual <UNK> stanwyck complains to him early on that she's no ball of fire which of course <UNK> her later comedy  directed by howard <UNK> and co starring gary cooper  of that name under <UNK> <UNK> she quickly <UNK> into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the new york firm she's eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly <UNK> one  relating to an ambitious <UNK> lust for power  in <UNK> <UNK> october <UNK> <UNK> it's also interesting that stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid companion br br the first two thirds of the film are simply terrific at first i found the latter stages somewhat disappointing  because i was expecting to see stanwyck get her <UNK> by falling for the <UNK> introduced george brent character while he ignores <UNK> just like the others he's soon under her spell on second viewing however this aspect felt less jarring  as it's evident that stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused and that her <UNK> in paris has <UNK> her even if she tries to <UNK> to her hard earned wealth for as long as it's possible br br released on dvd by <UNK> as part of their forbidden hollywood volume 1 collection the film is presented in two strikingly different edits  a recently <UNK> pre release version and the <UNK> theatrical release print among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue <UNK> to <UNK> life as a tramp from the age of 14 though it's heard in the accompanying trailer while many other scenes have been <UNK> i e <UNK> for content the violent <UNK> which develops between stanwyck and <UNK> after she <UNK> his advances the seduction at the <UNK> car the scene in which <UNK> is surprised with stanwyck by cook the shooting followed by a suicide only shots are heard in the shorter version stanwyck thinking about her <UNK> while the <UNK> is playing again only brent appears in the version released to theaters etc <UNK> latter then <UNK> alternate takes for some scenes  and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version however we also get an obviously tacked on happy ending the pre release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open ended note and an equally unconvincing <UNK> letter sent by <UNK> to stanwyck in new york which basically has the function of <UNK> all references to <UNK>
<START> oh dear the first time i heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot <UNK> test while we were playing video games i thought he was confusing <UNK> quest by the way one of the best cartoons i've ever seen in my life and changing the quest with test its something weird that i'm wrong but actually i was wrong he wasn't changing nothing he heard of this show br br one day while watching tv i heard that cartoon network was going to be released i wasn't sure of what was the plot of this show so i <UNK> myself to watch it and here is my answer i want my damn hour back because i watched this crap and my gym <UNK> a monkey br br this is one of the worst shows i've ever seen first the beginning with the most stupid song in the world then the plot oh where are my manners i haven't said the plot of this show is about a boy who has to amazingly intelligent sisters that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother <UNK> now i see why his name is <UNK> test he is the test of his sisters experiments br br you know i honestly miss <UNK> lab before it was transformed to the new <UNK> a total crap too this is a bad copy of that old good show except that this show is amazingly bad don't watch it make something more <UNK> in that half hour than watch this crap
<START> the line of course is from the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> will be done on earth as it is in heaven sweden especially its far north is not my idea of heaven 30 degree c winter <UNK> are a little on the low side for me but the good folk who live there no doubt think they are in god's own country br br the storyline here is a familiar one acclaimed international musician daniel suffers health breakdown in mid career goes back to the little village in northern sweden where he was born <UNK> by the local <UNK> to help out with the church choir he turns some unlikely talent into a class act and they enter a contest held in <UNK> <UNK> there are echoes sorry of the band players of <UNK> off the models of <UNK> girls and the dancers of the full monty but of course he causes plenty of emotional <UNK> as some of the more <UNK> villagers realise their worth and revolt against their <UNK> he faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious <UNK> but nothing except death is going to stop him br br despite the somewhat corny story we get to know and like many of the characters who come across as people rather than caricatures despite many of them being <UNK> <UNK> i did wonder about the wife <UNK> being <UNK> for so long  sweden is one country in the world where such violence is pretty strongly <UNK> he was also a bit young to be one of the bullies of <UNK> youth and the <UNK> <UNK> with a secret passion for <UNK> magazines was a bit of a stereotype but <UNK> realised by <UNK> falk br br michael <UNK> is simply wonderful as daniel the <UNK> but driven musician and there's some nice music as well i was <UNK> for the whole two hours the ending is what you make of it i guess but it's not spoiling it to say daniel achieves what he set out to do
<START> i recently stumbled across this film on <UNK> five minutes into it while on vacation in florida hey there has to be some down time in the hotel right i was initially surprised to see melissa joan hart in any feature length film on <UNK> i mean drive me crazy isn't that old already is it br br but i stuck with it and was thoroughly surprised and entertained melissa plays her role as the psychotic jennifer excellently the supporting cast nick the ex con boyfriend karen her best friend and her life controlling parents all added a great degree of believability the twist at the end was a nice closure to this tale of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everybody br br if you get a chance check it out br br
<START> as most off you might off seen star wars return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one live tv when they are <UNK> but before i say more when ben <UNK> wan dies in the <UNK> ship or death star they saw him disappear and <UNK> dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader real name <UNK> skywalker when they all are <UNK> at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and <UNK> stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a <UNK> as the old usual <UNK> off him and started smiling with ben and <UNK> i <UNK> that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> that got killed with <UNK> under there arms in the back ground
<START> while william <UNK> can always make me smile in anything he appears in and i especially love him as <UNK> <UNK> in boston legal well this show is all about <UNK> and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down br br it has none of the intelligence of millionaire none of the flair of deal or no deal br br this show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the time br br i watched it of course just to check it out i did watch it for over 45 minutes then i had to turn it off br br the best part of it was william shatner dancing on the stage he is a hoot unfortunately this show will not make it br br that's a given
<START> there is an awful lot wrong with this picture beginning with a script that is both obvious and redundant <UNK> cox plays a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city she immediately is stalked by a local who appears quite unhinged craig <UNK> and who seems to be attempting a third rate mickey rourke imitation d b <UNK> is a local cop who is supposedly there to protect and serve meanwhile the script <UNK> the audience as to who's really the good guy logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns and there are more unanswered questions than there should be if you think blue desert might be saved by the wonderful philip baker hall you will be disappointed his part is insignificant just like the entire movie <UNK>
<START> <UNK> accent is tough to <UNK> through he speaks incredibly quickly like he is in a rush to get through the lines during the <UNK> he acts as if he is talking to someone when he is supposed to be talking to himself all that and his bald spot just annoyed me he was just too old for this role in reading other accounts of <UNK> maybe he got this role because he was mad and the director decided to do a bit of life <UNK> art or forced method acting when the actors <UNK> hamlet mad you believe it <UNK> faithful is a stunning beauty and could <UNK> the role of <UNK> and still get a pass the set is dark and foreboding but it does look as if shot in a real castle especially the scenes in the <UNK> corridors where the dead king shines as a great light in the sky
<START> no awards show can please all the people clearly if your favorite movies didn't win you will say the show wasn't very good that's understandable br br however the <UNK> <UNK> academy awards will be remembered for one magical moment of hollywood history br br woody allen's first appearance ever at the academy awards br br allen has often <UNK> the awards as being self <UNK> and pointless and has never attended even though he has won several of the <UNK> awards br br when the <UNK> academy awards were held the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the world trade centers in new york when it came time to pay tribute to the city of new york they decided to show a video of the great movie moments form the city of cities then the <UNK> simply said br br ladies and gentleman oscar award winning director woody allen br br the place <UNK> in an extremely long standing <UNK> the entertainment industry finally got to give their applause to the man from new york who usually avoids the hollywood scene as the applause died down woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation br br some highlights br br thank you very much that makes up for the strip search br br i thought they wanted their oscars back he <UNK> i <UNK> because the <UNK> shop has been out of business for ages and i had no way of <UNK> anything br br but that wasn't it i couldn't work it out because my movie wasn't nominated for anything this year then it hit me maybe they were calling to <UNK> br br allen also <UNK> why he had overlooked his <UNK> oscar <UNK> for this one special night br br for new york city i'd do anything so i got my <UNK> on and came down here said allen br br it's a great great movie town it's been a great moving and exciting backdrop for movies and it remains a great great city br br
<START> as dr alan feinstone corbin bernsen turns a <UNK> deranged performance in the dentist br br with his already obsessive <UNK> <UNK> in high gear the irs <UNK> him and a very suspicious acting wife dr alan feinstone is losing his sanity more and more each day br br when the doc indeed does realize that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy it sets off a string of events that lead to torture murder <UNK> total mayhem the dentist is a solid film bernsen makes the character of dr feinstone <UNK> and <UNK> at the same time even though he is completely out of his <UNK> the audience will still feel sympathy towards him that my friends is damn good acting br br a nice solid cast of supporting actors round out this gem of a film excellent direction good killings and gore and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movies run br br highly recommended
<START> how irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me <UNK> by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie terrible script with forced character quirks the brown <UNK> <UNK> all that is bad about <UNK> the attitude of <UNK> it's a dump but sure <UNK> it great all the <UNK> plenty of <UNK> purely for american audiences the supermarket boss and his horribly forced <UNK> and the nail in the coffin was <UNK> <UNK> character a great actor forced to play this part that could've been written by a five year old <UNK> stuff the best thing about this movie is farrell and it's a bad when you have to say that well at least he <UNK> putting on his dreadful american accent international audiences be warned stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock you'll have a better time <UNK> is a walk outer
<START> what a wonderful movie <UNK> for so many <UNK> it never gets science fiction film noir with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated <UNK> audience the kind of english language movie only done in pre 1960 england and shown only in usa art movie houses when it first arrived and never ever done in the usa br br main characters in the man in the white suit 1951 starring sir alec <UNK> and joan <UNK> <UNK> use <UNK> science reference words like <UNK> and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like long chain <UNK> and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him br br the man in the white suit 1951 is the opposite of the video game explosion movies which now 2009 dominate world cinema and certainly dominate major usa cinema it's a carefully acted intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated english actors who play educated accomplished people and it's all done with comedy charm pathos and sense of irony which ancient greek <UNK> would have <UNK> of br br everybody should see this movie and someday somehow some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it br br it's wonderful
<START> it was probably just my dvd but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd br br i had to turn up the volume on my tv to the highest possible level in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog some of the talking still remained sub <UNK> if you're from scotland you might have a chance albeit a slim one br br peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all <UNK> sounds including <UNK> a package footsteps even <UNK> on a cigarette br br with the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard i can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment such as a disco and that you will <UNK> yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down br br there is art and there is art even in the field of audio mixing but this effort in a time of war would meet international <UNK> to be classified as an atrocity br br after about a half hour i gave up having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture either
<START> i agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the <UNK> genre my husband and i were captivated by it when it first aired in the us and watched every episode i tried at that time to purchase the series i did tape all of it but was told by <UNK> that it was not available i even considered writing to ian <UNK> to see if he might have a copy like others i purchased and read the <UNK> series in part to understand the complicated plot if the original version ever comes available on dvd i'll be among the first in line to snap up a copy ian <UNK> portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous bernard <UNK> was amazing he is always amazing
<START> you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers br br i'm sorry but spielberg didn't deserve to win any oscar for this piece and i think the academy was right in that vote other oscars for best actor nominations and such that i don't know about but it would be hard to justify given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product the way spielberg directs this is so contrived so <UNK> while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered sentimentality is <UNK> and unreal a false view of life this is over the top sentimentality when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from <UNK> they have found there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film all the men <UNK> around miss <UNK> car and then jumping in <UNK> like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away <UNK> falling through the <UNK> of various buildings he's working on a cheap slapstick gag the whole <UNK> of <UNK> heading from the <UNK> joint en <UNK> to the <UNK> as if magically <UNK> by the <UNK> singing on and on nothing rings true i even wondered if <UNK> name was chosen <UNK> because it's his wife <UNK> real name oprah backwards spielberg isn't above such <UNK> br br it's not that spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion <UNK> list was amazing deeply touching for me and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism even if the story is a bit contrived
<START> when i was a teen <UNK> seeing this film for the first time i thought it was one of the best movies ever made of course the reason for that is bo derek and her various states of <UNK> in this film however now that i'm older i can honestly say that this film is awful mind you bo derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful and she and husband director john derek make sure you see plenty of her but when you take that aspect out of the film it becomes one big dull ride and tarzan well he's all muscular like you think he should be but when he sees jane that's bo of course for the first time he doesn't know what to think this despite the fact that bo is wearing a wet see thru shirt with her breast <UNK> displayed tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem if you are looking for a movie to <UNK> over a beautiful naked body then this might fill the ticket if you are looking for a thoughtful entertaining and worth while film go elsewhere almost anywhere else at that
<START> <UNK> i like about <UNK> is definitely a show that i couldn't wait to see each day amanda <UNK> is such an excellent actress and i grew up watching her show 'the amanda show ' she's a very funny person and seems to be down to earth holly is such a like able person and has an out there personality i enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around and upside down so she messed herself up at times but that's what made the show so great br br i especially loved the show when the character <UNK> came along nick <UNK> is very hot and funny as well as <UNK> wesley jonathan the whole cast was great each character had their own personality and charm <UNK> <UNK> allison <UNK> and leslie <UNK> were all very interesting i especially loved <UNK> she's the best she helped make the show extra funny and you never know what she's gonna do or say next overall the show is really nice but the reason i didn't give it a 10 was because there's no more new episodes and because the episodes could've been longer and more deep
<START> wow where to begin picked this up at big lots for only 2 99 that's three bucks i'll never see again ever and for what i'll tell ya an hour and fifteen minutes of boring boring boring chat and college angst that seemed more suitable for a lifetime movie than the horror flick advertised on the box may the marketing <UNK> who designed it burn in hell for all eternity follow that up with a little bit of cheap gore not even good gore mind you and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere and makes no sense awful awful awful br br was there any redeeming qualities well on the joe bob <UNK> scale there were six breasts involved but that's hardly worth my long lost three bucks without those this <UNK> been on sci fi at say two or three in the morning br br <UNK>
<START> this film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly just painfully mediocre lacking any real wit or imagination a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the <UNK> which are predictable and <UNK> are <UNK> out to such <UNK> length that boredom and <UNK> quickly <UNK> the viewer another notch to mark the sad decline of john waters and a reminder that what <UNK> or amused us 30 years ago doesn't work quite the same way now we've seen it all before and it no longer breaks any <UNK> because they have long since <UNK> a major miss
<START> what can be said about mr moore he's the godfather of rap he's the king of the z level <UNK> flicks and here he is back as his most famous character <UNK> can you dig it this movie is one whacked out roller coaster ride of politically incorrect humor <UNK> kung fu nudity cheese violence and a whole lot of other stuff you'd never find in most modern movies or any movies really haha the stand up routine he gives early on is not to be missed at any rate <UNK> is definitely an entertaining way to waste an hour or so <UNK> he think he's bad and ain't got no class i'm <UNK> rock this shotgun up his <UNK> a
<START> born again is a sub standard episode from season one it deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesn't fly i've never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my <UNK> toward this episode it does reference the <UNK> case which is some nice <UNK> from the previous episode but the <UNK> end there which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode i think it's ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to <UNK> in the body of a completely unrelated girl and he waits until the girl turns eight to start <UNK> revenge there's even a serious lack of witty <UNK> <UNK> dialogue to keep the episode <UNK> if you're into reincarnation maybe this episode is up your alley if you're not then at least you can learn what <UNK> is
<START> i just watched this film again and remain <UNK> at the number of <UNK> who dismiss it as just new age <UNK> a great film one that takes its time to develop it keeps coming close to going over the edge but never does and ultimately is <UNK> affecting and <UNK> to life than most films people who dismiss its <UNK> can see i was angry at the time that movies like prince of <UNK> and <UNK> though i liked the latter were nominated for best picture that year let alone that silence of the <UNK> won and this was ignored completely except for one nomination for best screenplay upon <UNK> it i think history supports my initial reaction
<START> the <UNK> see something else br br this film was highly rated by gene <UNK> but after watching it i can't figure out why the film is definitely original and different it even has interesting dialogue at times some cool moments and a creepy noir feel but it just isn't entertaining it also doesn't make a whole lot of sense in plot but especially in character motivations i don't know anyone that behaves like these characters do br br this is a difficult movie to take on i suggest you don't accept the challenge
<START> secret sunshine 2007 is famous for its awards at the festival de cannes in 2007 and other film festivals <UNK> do <UNK> who played the newly widowed shin <UNK> won the best actress <UNK> at the <UNK> cannes festival secret sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and <UNK> do <UNK> received a best actress nod from asia pacific screen awards in addition this movie won the best film awards in virtually all korean film festivals masterfully written and directed and uniquely photographed secret sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy this film also talked about the forgiveness of god and people lee chang <UNK> director and writer of this movie said in an interview in a vast sense i wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense without love we can't talk about hope and salvation lee acknowledged that secret sunshine had no apparent genre this movie is not a movie about religion but it drew attention from many christians in korea because there were a lot of christian elements in the movie br br the turning point in secret sunshine comes when <UNK> shin <UNK> son is kidnapped and killed the <UNK> asks for money because he <UNK> that since she can buy land she must be rich her lie causes much sorrow br br shin <UNK> becomes a church goer and wants to forgive the murderer she decides to visit her son's murderer in prison and forgive him <UNK> chan shin <UNK> guy friend says just forgive in your heart do you have to go to the prison her church <UNK> cheer for her and say they will pray for her her <UNK> agrees with what she wants to do that is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action the result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in shin <UNK> life the murderer says with a peaceful smile that he has already been forgiven by god this sparks anger in her toward god she says how could you forgive the man before i forgive br br she begins to fight against god she looks up to the sky and <UNK> i won't lose to you she becomes a <UNK> her heart is a trap and her hands are chains it is more bitter than death she becomes <UNK> and <UNK> and is sent to a mental hospital on the day shin <UNK> is <UNK> from the hospital she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face the daughter of her son's murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair the <UNK> daughter has helped kidnapped shin <UNK> son while she cuts shin <UNK> hair the protagonist can't understand what's going on and gets out of the shop quickly br br it is difficult not to talk about <UNK> chan in the movie <UNK> chan does his best to be by shin <UNK> side although shin <UNK> doesn't care about him at all he is beside her all the time shin <UNK> leaves church quickly but <UNK> chan who started attending church because of shin <UNK> stays there because he feels peace with god lee chang <UNK> the director of secret sunshine says that <UNK> chan is like <UNK> secret sunshine the rural city or vice versa he seems to be too <UNK> and <UNK> but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her <UNK> is like him mr lee adds someone <UNK> that <UNK> chan could be an angel i think that he could be the angel who knows we can't say for sure that there is no angel if there is a person like <UNK> chan who forever <UNK> his <UNK> twists and turns we can defend ourselves against the <UNK> the life of shin <UNK> is full of <UNK> her husband died after he cheated on her and her only son was killed <UNK> by a murderer after she moved to her husband's hometown and her soul was damaged because she learned christianity in a wrong <UNK> that makes her crazy literally it is too easy to say that her life is filled with <UNK> does she still have hope in her life can she find meaning in her life the final scene gives us hope shin <UNK> tries to cut her hair by herself we walk our life's journey by ourselves she however realizes that it is hard to do it by herself and we know that we can't do everything by ourselves we see <UNK> chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair that's her hope she has <UNK> chan beside her and he is willing to help her in whatever situation she is as i mentioned earlier <UNK> chan is like an angel for her if we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us we can find joy in life even though we face <UNK> in our lives br br secret sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in korea it is like da <UNK> code while da <UNK> code helps us discuss the early church history secret sunshine <UNK> us to deal with life's <UNK> and find meaning when life seems unbearable with a shallow interpretation of the movie people <UNK> christianity and its <UNK> with a deeper interpretation this movie will help us see beneath the surface some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched secret sunshine and lee chang <UNK> responds by saying they were already anti christ before they watched this movie secret sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through shin <UNK> life
<START> i got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10 it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben <UNK> and <UNK> black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons sadly now the sci fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope <UNK> for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead this tv show is a must see for all sci fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it 10 10
<START> i have always been a fan of david lynch and with this film lynch proved to critics that he has the talent style and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he's become known for in the past decade as much as the film is g rated it's pure lynch in style pacing and tone the film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power br br the cinematography is terrific as is to be expected from a lynch film and the <UNK> montage sequences are breathtaking it's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly <UNK> folk and not <UNK> characters that are clearly labeled as being either good or evil br br richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy <UNK> in an endearing performance as his <UNK> and harry dean <UNK> in a small but infinitely crucial role br br with this film david lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with <UNK> <UNK> and 'the elephant man' critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as <UNK> peaks fire walk with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but with this film he showed that there was method to <UNK> and <UNK> and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film <UNK> <UNK> considering the high praise it's received and the oscar nomination for lynch br br <UNK> <UNK> is to me one of the most moving motion pictures i've ever seen it's a loving story about family friendship and the kindness of strangers i would highly recommend it
<START> unlike some comments mine is positive this movie <UNK> around the dinner table with a group of friends some you like some you don't a few are related mother daughter son their stories are not one smooth happy with everyone and everything type of life much like real life some story lines do not <UNK> they just happen but like true families and good friends they stick together the wanna be parents who are buying a baby are such a holes you are happy for the ending poor <UNK> is stuck between a rock and a <UNK> taking care of herself her mom her son and trying to keep all their lives together this does not end with a sunset walk or house in the <UNK> and all are living in a dream world but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day month to month overall this is a good story and a great movie
<START> in one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting it never got there br br the people are going from one point to another point with really no point if there was one it was very dull there was no action suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless so there was no caring what happened to them br br all together the movie was pretty boring br br i give it a 3 10 br br i like that it wasn't shaky choppy camera work and if there was music it didn't annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous
<START> i saw this film over the weekend and while i was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of church produced films i left disappointed that this one fell so short failing to inform members and leaving <UNK> with many unanswered questions br br the film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of joseph smith it's not a true biopic because there's no real coherent narrative most of the episodes concern joseph doing good deeds playing baseball running races and laughing with children often in <UNK> motion what a great just folks kind of guy that joseph was huh look at him out there beating <UNK> for his wife emma well <UNK> the <UNK> of his 33 <UNK> wives no mention whatsoever is made of <UNK> a glaring <UNK> br br and it is in such <UNK> where the film <UNK> it supplies too little information and leaves critical thinking audience members wondering why is joseph getting <UNK> and <UNK> why is he getting thrown in jail and why does that mob want to kill him the film's climax is of course joseph and <UNK> trek to <UNK> jail riding past a <UNK> united nations of faces looking out from <UNK> <UNK> but no mention is ever made about why nothing about smith <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> newspaper and <UNK> its press destroyed for its revealing the secret teaching of <UNK> the audience is left to wonder or to assume it's just more <UNK> <UNK> of the church no mention of joseph being charged with <UNK> for <UNK> martial law and calling out the <UNK> <UNK> br br of course i certainly did not expect this church produced film to present the joseph of richard <UNK> recent biography rough stone rolling but i was surprised and taken <UNK> at just how little of substance was actually presented br br and worse what substance that was presented was often inaccurate two examples jumped out at me first the translation of the book of mormon the film shows joseph reading right off the golden <UNK> in their two ring <UNK> which <UNK> in reality were hidden far from the site it's well known that joseph did his <UNK> by <UNK> his face in his hat <UNK> at the <UNK> stone in there the second <UNK> occurs at <UNK> jail where the mob <UNK> the cell the history of the church reports that joseph had a six <UNK> and even fired off a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the <UNK> <UNK> of distress as reported in times seasons br br maybe showing the reality of the <UNK> would have <UNK> the heart <UNK> mood the filmmakers had created but by <UNK> it they were <UNK> to history and failed to show joseph as he really was handy with a gun and able to defend himself in fact the impression the film gives is that joseph was a nice guy but also something of a <UNK> that everybody beat up tossed in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood he was far from that joseph was a <UNK> and determined man who endured a lot of <UNK> and struggle to bring to <UNK> that in which he believed br br see the film but know going in that's it's <UNK> candy then get your meat and <UNK> by reading a copy of <UNK> biography of smith rough stone rolling br br ps church produced films have no credits but seasoned eyes can pick out a couple familiar faces rick macy is excellent as joseph smith sr and bruce <UNK> beloved as thomas in finding faith in christ here plays the <UNK> <UNK> minister who failed to show christian love to a young <UNK> after truth
<START> i admit to liking a lot of the so called frat pack movies no matter how bad they are i can find something to like about ben stiller or owen wilson or vince vaughn or will ferrell or jack black but envy just left me about as cold as the white horse that ben <UNK> of this time it's ben and jack black as a couple of nutty neighbors one of whom black discovers a <UNK> <UNK> to make animal <UNK> disappear and becomes incredibly wealthy while the other stiller <UNK> in envy that's supposedly the plot but then it <UNK> off in other directions that don't really make much sense br br i guess the <UNK> thing is sort of amusing at first the problem is they try to sustain the gag for the whole picture black has a license plate that reads <UNK> <UNK> and it gets fairly tiresome but even ben and jack are used poorly the energy level for both of their performances seems significantly <UNK> down the two best performances by far are rachel <UNK> and chris walken <UNK> neo hippie <UNK> guy is so offbeat and so well <UNK> a performance that it really never suggests any of <UNK> other familiar <UNK> characters it's completely unique yet comes across as <UNK> walken and <UNK> is about the best actress in the business that nobody knows about even with limited screen time she still <UNK> every scene she's in br br the whole <UNK> of the so called drama is that ben in a jealous drunken <UNK> accidentally shoots jack's prize white <UNK> and then goes to ridiculous <UNK> to cover it up <UNK> his best friend will find out and cut him dead but the plot twist isn't believable because there's nothing about jack's character to indicate that he would do such a thing he plays such a sweet guy that it <UNK> the whole excruciating horse chase <UNK> and void you <UNK> it completely it's all filler and what's the point of the out of control merry go round except that barry <UNK> wants us to know that he's seen strangers on a train the screenplay is painfully bad and the acting of the two leads poorly directed someone with <UNK> track record should know better maybe someone will <UNK> something to make this film disappear oh wait they already have

<START> riding giants is a brilliant documentary that <UNK> deep into the world of one of the most under appreciated sports and brings to the surface a very human and raw emotion that only director <UNK> <UNK> could capture everything from the structure to the players to the amazing stock footage to even the style in which this was filmed only <UNK> the beauty and power behind the sport of surfing of all the surfing films that i have seen endless summer <UNK> odyssey and step into <UNK> this was the most consistent and relevant beginning with the early ages of surfing a brief history lesson lasting all the way till <UNK> infamous ride riding giants goes further into the mind heart and soul of the sport than any of these other documentaries how does it do this by giving us the whole story from start to finish without <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> from wave to wave br br to begin this film was <UNK> sound in the other films that i have seen about surfing you sometimes find yourself jumping from new person to new person wave to wave event to event without any knowledge of why or who in riding giants we have a very small cast of veterans and <UNK> this allows you to really go deeper into the mind of each one also instead of just riding waves we are handed more history and more personal insight to the world than before this is what really attracted me to this film i was impressed that instead of showing all these big waves because it is a big wave movie we listen to stories and see first hand what these surfers had to overcome to get to those waves i loved the information about the beach <UNK> or father's of surfing i am still <UNK> by the amazing tales of greg <UNK> and his early adventures into the harsh deep blue then to see him in person talking about what was going on in his mind only added more fuel to the fire the straightforward structure that <UNK> followed allowed me to follow and walk away with more knowledge of the sport than with any of the earlier films <UNK> shows so much emotion and passion that you cannot help but be amazed by what these brave people have done and where the sport is going br br add to a <UNK> structure some intense and creative cinematography and you have darn near perfect film using techniques that i last saw in the kid stays in the picture riding giants creates some scenes that almost feel as if they are jumping out of the screen while it isn't 3d it is that flat dimensional feeling that you get when you put two pictures on top of each other in this film it worked it created more depth to the scenes and really added to not just the shock value man these waves were huge but also the danger that these guys constantly faced if it broke differently or they <UNK> wrong these waves would kill them some did die but it didn't stop the sport it only created more excitement and more passion to do better it is this love of the ocean and sport that leads me to my final point br br the human element so many of my earlier adventures in the world of surfing documentaries left me with beautiful waves but very little about the people the films knew that people were watching for the waves so it would basically go from wave to wave to wave and the maybe a short second about the person this film was the direct opposite <UNK> created this masterpiece by still giving us the waves but <UNK> so much more attention onto the surfers and the immortal question of why they do this everyday what rushes through their minds what pushes them to go further and the bonds that are formed while out there on the wild blue <UNK> i felt like after watching this film that i not only knew more about big wave surfing but also about the emotional side to the sport this was an element not as developed in the other films and pushed riding giants to a whole new personal level br br overall this film was brilliant never have i witnessed so much passion devotion and love wrapped in a <UNK> sound film from beginning to end i was impressed i would be very happy if this film won the oscar this year for best documentary and to see a new <UNK> in the surfing world and open more doors for films of this nature br br grade out of
<START> by the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over as films were moving in a different direction <UNK> and otherwise with television <UNK> on the horizon hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time where one wonders would movies have gone had television not come along or its arrival on the scene been <UNK> by five or ten years mr blandings builds his dream house offers one particular way comedy might have developed br br ad man jim blandings along with his wife and two daughters are living in a nice but way too <UNK> new york city apartment as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the <UNK> so he buys some property in <UNK> and has one built to his precise <UNK> well almost had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind then again he might not have you decide on this <UNK> premise a wonderful film results full of conflict between the middle class dream of <UNK> one's own home and the the <UNK> unpleasant reality of <UNK> one nothing comes easy in this life as mr blandings learns but one <UNK> be miserable just because things don't always go one's way there is after all the long run but blandings asks himself every few minutes how long is long br br this movie is a delight it is not i suppose a masterpiece in the <UNK> <UNK> tradition but it is a worthy <UNK> to their thirties pictures and may well have been a <UNK> of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so <UNK> there is real warmth in the picture and a good deal of w c <UNK> hard edged reality <UNK> <UNK> but not so much as to leave a bad taste the people in the film are all very smart and <UNK> but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the <UNK> rich upper class br br lead players cary grant and myrna loy plays mr and mrs blandings to perfection while melvyn douglas is fine as their <UNK> lawyer friend who often has to bring up unpleasant topics such as how the real world works there is too a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of <UNK> which was in its <UNK> in the immediate <UNK> years as one sees the woods and <UNK> that drew people to the country in the first place these people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural <UNK> in a few short years things would change as the mad rush to <UNK> would be in full gear destroying forever the <UNK> innocence so many had <UNK> for in the small towns which soon would be connected by <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> anything one would encounter in the city
<START> i cannot believe that i wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish the previous five day offering by this author was highly enjoyable and i was really looking forward to this but most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible <UNK> jones was the principal <UNK> since she either <UNK> or <UNK> her lines but most of the rest of the cast followed her example notable exceptions were bernard hill and anne reid old <UNK> whose <UNK> was <UNK> do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is <UNK> as a result i suppose i lost track of what was going on and since the original plot line seemed to <UNK> into to the standard them and us thing between muslims and the rest i soon lost interest the ending was a complete anti climax a complete dud
<START> this is possibly one of the worst giant killer animal movies i have ever seen it follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment gone wrong and a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical in it escapes the monster looks way to much like a dinosaur having big <UNK> like <UNK> legs when it should just look like an over sized crocodile everything about this movie is unoriginal and it constantly <UNK> cliche minute after minute why are there always two drunken redneck hunters out after dark who separate plus there's always a guy and girl who share a lame obvious love interest while they are in life threatening situations to much has already been said by me and i feel as if i'm wasting my time writing this
<START> capt <UNK> lemmon and flight attendant eve <UNK> <UNK> are a supposedly hot item in this death trip a luxury <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out to look like a nightclub slash <UNK> there's even a blind piano player who falls in love karen wallace grant is the hysterical b 3 <UNK> do anything to get attention from <UNK> husband martin christopher lee and later the rest of the people on board br br memorable moments <UNK> <UNK> doing a belly flop in the atlantic ocean karen getting her chops <UNK> when she goes too far and furniture and screaming people who become <UNK> <UNK> in a sinking <UNK> machine ' br br the action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal but not much goes on in between hitchcock was supposed to have directed this sequel but i forget the reason why <UNK> he would've done wonders for the 1970 original on which this sequel is partly inspired <UNK> also got inspiration from the flight of the <UNK> br br actors <UNK> and de <UNK> reunite from their days on <UNK> <UNK> sweet <UNK> apparently here they are not playing <UNK> just reunited <UNK> <UNK> lovers and isn't the actress playing <UNK> companion the same one who played the <UNK> to death maid on whatever happened to baby jane ' br br tv actors include the girlfriend from <UNK> <UNK> her character's daughter wins a drawing contest or something lame like that buck <UNK> <UNK> gerard and <UNK> pamela <UNK> br br
<START> i saw the description of the movie on tcm and only let it run because i like both peter ustinov and maggie smith so i was delightfully surprised to find that i really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional of course it is seriously dated but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago now the only problem is trying to find it on dvd so i can watch it more often i also was quite taken with the performances of smith and ustinov as the leads and of karl malden bob <UNK> and the cameo appearances by robert <UNK> and <UNK> romero
<START> camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a <UNK> plot this time they've <UNK> slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness br br this time around there's a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants this is hardly a new idea i've seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife br br unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs i liked how there's a <UNK> sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike <UNK> behind people like a phantom br br i don't know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one the half naked <UNK> woman was a bit much for me it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for 5 just like they did in the second movie they still haven't worked out that a <UNK> is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well it's a camp blood movie what do you expect if you like crap films you'll get some fun out of this one
<START> lots and lots of information to <UNK> and if you've seen zizek you know his pace br br also if you haven't seen most of the films or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned in this doc you will be somewhat lost br br and the film list is long director includes hitchcock psycho vertigo birds lynch lost highway <UNK> falls wild at heart blue <UNK> <UNK> stalker <UNK> and the conversation coppola br br there are some <UNK> films like star wars <UNK> iii matrix but these i suspect are <UNK> to be sure zizek is never boring but if you don't buy or if you mind the psycho <UNK> then you'll be annoyed to no end br br but you should not be as the setting clips the way the film <UNK> with these clips <UNK> points are never boring
<START> just finished watching can't say i was impressed br br it starts of quite good the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should but it all ends when the first <UNK> monster appears not only do you recognize them from the band <UNK> but they are seriously <UNK> in the movie <UNK> monsters with leather <UNK> and <UNK> are so 80's br br as for the storyline it starts of as similar horror movies people trapped inside a hell hole but there is no clear story on why and what is happening the viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess br br with all the money spent on this film with an intriguing start and some good effects i had thought someone would have taken better care of the product i wonder if <UNK> made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary except they aren't br br so the movie gets <UNK> for the visuals i guess the money had to go somewhere but the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their on stage monster <UNK> scarier
<START> such a delightful movie very heart warming one can't help falling in love with the character of <UNK> he's adorable as a child and grows into a sensitive artist the whole movie revolves around him he lives in a wonderful world  living all life  curiosity desire and anticipation there is an elder brother who tries to steal his glory but really remains in the shadow all his life the father is very <UNK> italian and so is the mother i wanted the father to come and reunite with the mother in the last scene  and have them cry and laugh i also wish that there was at least something redeeming about the elder brother his personality seems to have been <UNK> entirely passion and <UNK>  that's the key to life and looking through the camera  focusing on small details and <UNK> the delicate details of life
<START> typical troma trash this <UNK> 80's flick is considered one of the highlights of lloyd <UNK> notorious production studio alongside the toxic <UNK> released one year earlier the toxic <UNK> is far superior if you ask me but this demented splatter flick is nevertheless <UNK> as well just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door the events take place in <UNK> a little town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world and they certainly aren't lying the safety <UNK> in the local nuclear power plant are <UNK> to say the least even homer simpson never was this <UNK> and toxic waste <UNK> through to the nearby high school the first <UNK> victim is the stereotypical nerd who starts <UNK> green stuff out of all his body <UNK> but his death is believed to be an accident because he had no less than two <UNK> <UNK> in his house oh the humanity shortly after however the nuclear <UNK> also affect the <UNK> <UNK> plantation and thing really start to get messy after smoking a joint at a party the <UNK> couple in school produce a gigantic worm monster that <UNK> in the basement and <UNK> on teenage <UNK> class of <UNK> 'em high is bottom of the barrel horror film making with dialogs so dumb they hurt your ears and make up effects that give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless if you enjoy watching faces melting away getting crushed or splitting in half this is definitely a must see unlike the aforementioned the toxic <UNK> this film suffers from a couple of really dull and overlong moments where nothing really significant happens like for example when <UNK> and warren try to figure out what's wrong with their <UNK> the crude humor isn't as effective as in toxic <UNK> and the acting performances are <UNK> amateurish proceed only if you're an avid troma fanatic
<START> i have seen already fantastic stories but the premises of this one are so unbelievable that it comes very close to being ridiculous a rich and young guy <UNK> a heart transplant the day after his marriage and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his <UNK> to kill him even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among say souls maybe and real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son there is no <UNK> of suspense or thrill just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of <UNK> that can never happen in life br br this is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality actually first time director <UNK> harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes hayden christensen at his first major role after having taken off the <UNK> skywalker costume fabulous jessica alba and super gifted lena <UNK> all would have deserved a better story
<START> ben thomas smith plays an irs agent who practically gives the store away to everyone's surprise what kind of irs agent is this br br most of us have all heard the line by an irs agent hello i'm from the irs i'm here to help our smile then <UNK> into a chuckle that says yeah right br br as you get further and further into this story you cannot figure this guy out he goes easy on those who are being <UNK> what is his motive is he from another planet an angel a rich guy who wants to do good he helps so much we want him to be our <UNK> should we get <UNK> of course hey irs are you listening kidding just kidding br br the pace of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on intense repeat intense focus was on ben and stays there the whole movie only works because of ben as we try to figure him out and i didn't see any clues what clues you talking about willis not reading the box before watching the dvd movie was the better way to go here by the end of the movie i finally put it all together well it was obvious by then and yes it's over the top but still a great story mostly because of will smith br br will smith should have been nominated for a best actor award the rest of the cast were very good as well br br yes it's over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong what's the message believe me you will won't need too many clues to figure it out i didn't br br violence no sex yes but nothing to get excited about bland nudity no language no
<START> this is one of the movies that get better every time you see them it's packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail as in <UNK> subsequent movies i didn't see unlucky monkey yet but the other ones are as great failure chance and <UNK> play great roles the cutting and montage is inventive and artistic without the movie being an art picture but a highly entertaining one when comparing it to run lola run you have to keep in mind that <UNK> <UNK> was made some years before and was shown on german tv as early as 1997 so it's more <UNK> that it served as inspiration for tom <UNK> movie and not the other way around <UNK> to the other reviews i have to add that i like the acting and the ending very much this movie is a lot of fun in many ways and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious
<START> john <UNK> micheal 'i <UNK> called <UNK> <UNK> works at a doctor's office as an <UNK> his mother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> him to off the people who see thinks <UNK> him but this turns out to be a movie within a movie but the lines soon <UNK> as john goes a movie theater to kill <UNK> a guy who's watching the movie to do the same <UNK> is suitably over the top in this but <UNK> repeats lines of dialog over and over again that gets annoying fast but not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie as a horror film this one fails it's too busy trying to be clever trying to <UNK> a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension or at least a jump or two no what we have here is the worst kind of slasher an art house one br br my grade d
<START> oh come on people give this film a break the one thing i liked about it was sorry still thinking oh yeah when john wayne came and shot up the the bad guys oh sorry wrong movie i was thinking of a better quality film let me see now i'm still trying to defend it oh yeah the chick that was from clueless was in it don't put down <UNK> dash i mean we all make mistakes but boy <UNK> you made a <UNK> br br hey one thing that has never been done in a western even an all female cast they actually hung a woman from the <UNK> that might be a western first even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal still you've got to give the director some effort for trying a western first also i've never seen a woman <UNK> from a horse in any western although that didn't happen in this movie i just thought i would give the director another idea for gang of <UNK> 2 which should be made right after ed <UNK> bride of the monster 2 maybe that was what the makers of this film were going for <UNK> especially with an all african woman cast and an oriental <UNK> br br <UNK> if the makers of gang of <UNK> want to make a sequel to this mess you could have such <UNK> like hey don't you be <UNK> about my <UNK> and talk to the hand baby talk to the hand you could also have a <UNK> dude type deputy <UNK> that says things like that <UNK> was totally <UNK> man totally you know things like that
<START> this is one movie that will take time to get out of your head once you have seen it the dialogs are close to perfect which was to be expected as it has been adapted from a play the actors are simply giving their best the story is simple and attractive <UNK> minutes of pure bliss br br <UNK> <UNK> is totally credible in his role <UNK> <UNK> is still the beautiful blonde but not so dumb providing as much pleasure to the eyes as to the ears jean paul <UNK> is providing an excellent <UNK> of the total jerk and proud to be such and <UNK> <UNK> is the dumb friend who is always <UNK> when you expect it least br br thumbs up to bernard <UNK> and associates for adapting this excellent play and all the best for future productions br br i wish there were more of these in nowadays production if you liked it you will also probably enjoy un air de <UNK> and <UNK> et <UNK> both were written and played by the couple <UNK> <UNK>
<START> ben a out of town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice but he's approached by <UNK> who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult so ben his sister's best friend and <UNK> travel to <UNK> to put a end to this evil br br this is incredibly awful b grade stuff and i wondered how it even got released it makes the original <UNK> look like a masterpiece what was christopher lee thinking as this has to be his worst performance i've seen br br there was a lot wrong with this real cheap ass film ranging from the really hammy and wooden performances from annie <UNK> <UNK> brown <UNK> a hunt and <UNK> <UNK> not to forgot lee cheesy fashion those <UNK> cheap and lame special effects bad use of lighting the humour if there was any trashy 80s music with some of the film just focusing on some unknown band playing <UNK> having <UNK> which is a sight to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue i thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny but i was wrong br br the <UNK> were the location and settings of the film looked great but that's about it actually i'll add <UNK> <UNK> short <UNK> scene too br br during the end credits the band plays their crap house song during a weird montage of scenes from the film which i <UNK> the question why br br an awful piece of mess however at least it isn't boring br br 1 5
<START> i once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise <UNK> for <UNK> after midnight so needless to say i can easily relate to <UNK> the tenant br br but i also enjoy the film for other reasons i'm not sure that it works on the whole the polanski character's descent into paranoia and madness which takes up the final half hour or so seems rather jarring and bizarre ebert for one was totally <UNK> and he slapped the movie with a vicious one star review but i think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully so even though i don't quite understand the whole film what does <UNK> have to do with it for example i still have an overall positive impression of it br br i love the obnoxious friend portrayed by bernard <UNK> for example god how many times have i settled for having stupid friends like that instead of no friends at all i love the movie theater scene the funniest making out moment in the history of film i'd say and boy do i love isabelle <UNK> she's so <UNK> in this movie it's almost unbelievable and she gives a great performance as always br br polanski is a good actor too i don't agree with the occasional <UNK> remarks made about his performance here his character is supposed to be low key and thoughtful so his low key performance fits i for one found him perfectly sympathetic though he did lose me a bit when he started dressed in drag for no clearly discernible reason br br yes the movie's obscure and slow but it captures the <UNK> qualities of apartment living something i've done entirely too much of so i dig it it's funny how all you need is a common reference point and suddenly a weirdo movie like this becomes deeply significant definitely worth picking up for pocket change on dvd
<START> i'm surprised no one has thought of doing a movie like this before horror is often most effective when it uses real life <UNK> as a theme and nobody except for steve martin in the little shop of horrors likes going to the dentist tooth torture has been done before see the <UNK> man for example but this brings the terror into <UNK> br br the plot revolves around a dentist dr alan feinstone corbin bernsen who <UNK> into madness now our dear doctor wasn't playing with a full deck to begin with but driven by jealousy and an obsessive <UNK> disorder he begins to <UNK> havoc on those around him the doctors <UNK> mental condition is kinda close to what we see in micheal <UNK> character in falling down but with a horror edge br br written and directed by horror <UNK> stuart gordon and brian <UNK> its witty and has a great flow also featured playing a cop is the ever welcome ken <UNK> br br now i believe this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance from corbin bernsen having really only seen him in la law before i was blown away by his acting br br the sequel the dentist 2 is also worth watching but slightly under par compared to the original br br <UNK> <UNK> a fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe <UNK> pun intended by a great performance from bernsen
<START> nobody truly understands the logic behind the <UNK> of italian zombie flicks but  honestly  why would we bother every single film in the zombi series delivers great fun nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and zombi 3 is no exception to this despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project who had to elaborate further on his zombi 2 success but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity every ingenious idea from george a romero's night of the living dead and the <UNK> is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over the top gore <UNK> for everything on a secret army base at the <UNK> scientists completed the <UNK> <UNK> virus death one and prepare it for transport after a failing attempt to steal the virus the infected corpse of a terrorist is <UNK> and the zombie <UNK> <UNK> the entire population of a nearby tourist village the last group of survivors has to battle <UNK> and <UNK> strong zombies as well as soldiers in white <UNK> that received <UNK> to kill everything that moves in the <UNK> area this movie is comparable to <UNK> <UNK> nightmare city truly bad but incredibly entertaining with fast paced action sequences and several very creative zombie madness situations the undead birds were original for example and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick recommended to the fans don't mind the negative reviews
<START> in our household we are enormous fans of a christmas carol and watch virtually every version each christmas including the old 1938 <UNK> owen and the modern 1999 patrick stewart our overall favorite is the 1951 black white classic because <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> scrooge and his <UNK> rings the <UNK> however this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely entertaining story quite faithful generally to <UNK> novel see my comments on the other film adaptations if interested br br first of all george c scott can certainly seem pretty <UNK> and doesn't make a bad scrooge i adore his <UNK> his long <UNK> hat he cuts the finest fashion figure of the lot and quite a handsome gentleman however sometimes it seems scott is enjoying his role as scrooge just a wee bit too much and not taking it quite as seriously as he ought br br this rendition has the best overall christmas atmosphere hopeful and optimistic somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending filmed in the town of <UNK> england it just seems somehow very british the film has a lovely musical score with wonderful lively <UNK> music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale sometimes i could almost smell the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> singing in the <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> ghost with his wonderful jaw dropping scene and the three spirits are all quite convincing christmas past is a lovely <UNK> lady christmas present wonderfully giant and <UNK> christmas yet to come <UNK> and foreboding as always however i found <UNK> nephew fred a wee bit quiet grim not nearly as jolly <UNK> as he should be i like the <UNK> wife whom they've named janet with her lovely <UNK> period <UNK> instead of blind man's <UNK> they've <UNK> a game called <UNK> for the <UNK> christmas dinner party which is a cute little touch scrooge getting right into the spirit of the thing br br the <UNK> and their somewhat <UNK> though much appreciated christmas dinner are well depicted with bob david warner suitably sympathetic and long suffering in his miles of <UNK> mrs <UNK> is <UNK> portrayed by <UNK> york who also starred with george c scott in the wonderful 1970 adaptation of jane eyre above all this version has <UNK> the best tiny tim not only an adorable endearing little <UNK> but <UNK> with those dark circles under his eyes the <UNK> wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hour br br this is a delightful heartwarming version of the holiday classic with its <UNK> atmosphere it's sure to put you in the spirit of the season
<START> i'm a black man living in a <UNK> black city that being said i have some major <UNK> about tyler <UNK> work i realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him because he's black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture but i honestly do believe that were perry white this film would have had the <UNK> al <UNK> and jessie jackson all over his ass br br i have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood <UNK> the characters are poorly written and acted the jokes are so bad i have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny i'm just going to break this big pile of sh t down br br <UNK> suck the character may have had some appeal but it doesn't anymore when the only thing she ever seems to do is <UNK> around children and <UNK> adults with violence she is less than useless she is unnecessary br br the situation with the wife beating fiancé was <UNK> t if a woman was so scared to death of her husband why would she try to run away when he's sleeping in bed wouldn't it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work at any rate the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that i hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was <UNK> <UNK> when he didn't br br then there are the two <UNK> a bus driver asks a woman out by <UNK> her while he's making his rounds i couldn't believe it i really couldn't believe when she agreed to go out with him even more but what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to <UNK> <UNK> at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a <UNK> mega bitch i don't use this term lightly but that woman only had two <UNK> <UNK> victim and psycho <UNK> no matter which of these two faces she showed however there was one constant the bus driver wasn't going to get any he even married her without <UNK> the goods wtf br br then there's the family reunion scene here we've got the mother load which includes implied <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for the sake of <UNK> <UNK> overly <UNK> b ball plus the great taste of <UNK> <UNK> when those babes dragged their <UNK> outside and called a meeting was i wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack all this crap is going on at the reunion in laughably easy to separate groups and then they ring a bell when they do everyone drops what they're doing and heads on over for a stern talking too just like a pack of <UNK> <UNK> wtf br br then you have the final five minutes of the film in it we see the abusive fiancé get <UNK> by his longtime victim and all around bad actress there is an <UNK> wedding where black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceiling wtf the only reason to watch it this far besides testing your <UNK> for pain is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well guess what it doesn't happen instead perry takes the <UNK> challenged way out and plays it safe ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness wtf br br i'm pretty sure that if given a day i could probably write a <UNK> <UNK> on all the ways this movie sucks don't even get me started on the rest of tyler <UNK> films i'm just going to say this in my opinion as a black guy d w <UNK> legacy lives on the irony is that it is doing so through a black man who will be praised for doing what birth of a nation did selling us down the river i only wish <UNK> films were <UNK> so i could kick them in the nuts thanks a lot dude what are you going to follow this up with in 2009 a comedy about the <UNK> and savage beating of slaves in colonial america
<START> this was such a waste of time danger if you watch it you will be tempted to tear your dvd out of the wall and <UNK> it thru the window br br an amateur production terrible repetitive vacuous dialog paper thin plot line wooden performances lucy <UNK> was <UNK> hackneyed br br seriously flawed story completely unbelievable characters the two worst concepts in film and t v are 1 the evil twin 2 <UNK> there are no twins br br the plot twist outrageously simplistic and obvious like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the <UNK> it doesn't even resolve properly the evil is not <UNK> for the original crime br br please please please don't watch this even if its free and your only other choice is to go to a <UNK>

<START> much like the comedy duo of its title the sunshine boys has become a forgotten classic 30 odd years later it's hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s this makes no sense given the <UNK> <UNK> of this film perhaps the best neil simon ever wrote br br walter matthau plays willy clark once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark now a bitter 73 year old solo act who can't get a job in a <UNK> chip commercial his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis george burns for an abc tv celebration of show business nostalgia br br nostalgia is what sunshine boys has going for it in <UNK> right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips <UNK> various <UNK> from long ago <UNK> before us to the <UNK> of cole <UNK> be a clown then there's the film's present day setting in manhattan where <UNK> <UNK> and wide <UNK> ties abound the periods <UNK> in <UNK> glorious mess of a manhattan apartment where framed photos and cartoons of long dead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid <UNK> <UNK> and empty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if you were alive in the 1970s like me you might even feel like you were in that apartment br br willy clearly has been living there too long he's sleeping in front of the television when the <UNK> in the other room <UNK> willy wakes up and picks up the phone br br hello who is this a pause never mind it's the tea br br old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone else's hands but simon's <UNK> wit and <UNK> feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold the amazing thing about the sunshine boys is how much it <UNK> your <UNK> in <UNK> almost existential condition without turning you off at all <UNK> years old and just like that he dies of <UNK> willy says of one old <UNK> friend before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that <UNK> lady with baby br br burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but <UNK> lewis but it's matthau who brings this one home his make up and proud but <UNK> bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this willy is obnoxious in the extreme fully deserving ben's description crazy <UNK> old man but you root for him throughout enjoying his small <UNK> even when they come at the cost of <UNK> patience his lines kill you too especially when he's trying to kill lewis for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad idea br br you're out of touch willy tells lewis at one point i'm still in demand i'm still hot br br if this room was on fire you wouldn't be hot lewis replies br br director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way with low lighting and mid range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film's overall <UNK> message of grace through quiet acceptance you never get the feeling you are watching a movie one of the sunshine boys many charms and <UNK> direction like the acting of the three principals goes a long way toward achieving that end br br comedy is hard especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by but the sunshine boys makes it all seem a pleasure because for us watching it is
<START> wow here it finally is the action movie without action in a real low budget setting don't miss the hilarious flying <UNK> flying by a few times of a future seattle we find a no brain <UNK> seeking to avenge her childhood br br there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only <UNK> in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly matrix without having the money to do it right yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot outs 45 <UNK> <UNK> but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid <UNK> attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then br br and yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes br br believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get in fact it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was a nice <UNK> comedy this film however actually lacks a story but is quite funny but illogical br br in fact they is no proper story yet it somehow manages a nice flow though it isn't anything great br br the first half has 2 funny scenes like the one where akshay and john invite <UNK> for a lunch and another when <UNK> enters br br the first half gets boring slowly but the second half is funnier though they is no script br br the jokes are funny though one does wonder how they never hear each person's voices from inside the rooms br br the climax confusion is treated like a stage play but it's quite funny but the film ends abruptly br br direction is okay music is good br br akshay kumar excels in his part which is now become his second skin but this is his film completely and he <UNK> everyone else br br john stumbles throughout and fails in comedy <UNK> <UNK> is hilarious <UNK> is okay the girls are loud at times and awkward too <UNK> daisy and <UNK> only <UNK> is seen now are good in parts but <UNK> too often <UNK> <UNK> is okay
<START> this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of <UNK> its last one the cat is <UNK> and scared to death all of the time hence the name <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different <UNK> in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most <UNK> of the <UNK> life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number 9 and <UNK> out lighting <UNK> very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy br br i watched this movie almost every day as a child o
<START> i think i usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will <UNK> be quirky and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the characters' simplicity in the face of a complicated context what was exceptional about big bad swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding laugh out loud humor in scene after scene there was a sophistication maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the <UNK> i've rarely seen in an indie film and even more rarely in a comedy of special note here <UNK> <UNK> turn as amy the <UNK> teacher after seeing this performance i cannot understand why <UNK> hasn't been discovered by a larger audience she brings the necessary mix of anger and <UNK> to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential this is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience i look forward to more from the director and this cast
<START> whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie i've ever seen i <UNK> <UNK> black <UNK> and to this day <UNK> ever heard of it br br i watched it alone some 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out for the evening as far as i know its only ever been shown once in the uk and sadly is <UNK> on dvd or vhs br br if anyone can trace a copy please let me know br br if i watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film
<START> <UNK> or as it is also known <UNK> is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen the blend of <UNK> and colour photography is near <UNK> a true feast for the eyes the picture was a <UNK> for a <UNK> golden palm in <UNK> the award went to barton <UNK> by <UNK> brothers a film <UNK> very similar to <UNK> here's an exercise in class rent both films and be a judge for yourself
<START> i studied charlotte <UNK> novel in high school and it left me with a stunning impression here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of victorian england this young woman was jane eyre a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own her story which <UNK> told through jane's own eyes was both sad and inspiring br br as part of our study we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story and it blew me away the mini series not only made the effort to stay true to <UNK> original text and the essence of the story but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great both zelah clarke jane eyre and timothy dalton jane's lover by the name of rochester captured brilliantly the essence of their characters i cannot imagine anyone else in their roles the other performances of rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion energy and <UNK> needed to portray rochester accurately i say that timothy dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of rochester zelah clarke not only looks like jane eyre but she captures jane's quiet but firm and passionate nature brilliantly she holds in her emotions like the jane of the book at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in jane's passionate scenes the chemistry that clarke and dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to jane and <UNK> devoted relationship as well the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly and the sets fit the gothic nature of the story br br i strongly recommend this version of the classic <UNK> tale if you have not read the book before then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story
<START> there have been countless talking animal films in the past the majority of which either feature <UNK> mouths <UNK> animated to nearly match the voice acting or are ridiculously amateur <UNK> bound the incredible <UNK> is neither br br this film doesn't need the <UNK> pleasing addition of moving <UNK> lips or <UNK> <UNK> limbs it has the ability to make you believe that the animals are <UNK> talking to one another and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart as all great boy and and his dog films should br br <UNK> bound is the epitome of all family friendly animal <UNK> to me and boasts some beautiful cinematography an inspiring soundtrack from the genius of bruce <UNK> and an impressive cast br br michael j fox chance br br sally field sassy br br don <UNK> shadow br br frank <UNK> voice god various br br it is a <UNK> version of the children's classic work of fiction 'the incredible <UNK> which was made into a semi documentary film by disney long long ago in 1963 the sequel lost in san <UNK> isn't nearly as good a film but <UNK> the adventure of my favourite <UNK> <UNK> friends and is a fun urban twist on the grand <UNK> adventure theme want to entertain your children with a witty pretty heart warming mini epic without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema parents buy all three films for your children now thank you disney for bringing a tear to my eyes with each time i watch this early 90s classic
<START> it is always satisfying when a detective <UNK> up a case and the criminal is brought to book in this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure to see the smug grin wiped off the face of <UNK> mitchell when she realises her victim has left <UNK> <UNK> which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying br br please understand while i admire ruth <UNK> performance her character really really <UNK> me she is selfish and demanding she gets her own way by putting on a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> act which is embarrassing in a woman of her age worse she has now set herself up as judge jury and <UNK> against her dead <UNK> husband br br when columbo is getting too close she tries to <UNK> him by <UNK> him into making an off the <UNK> speech to an audience of high class ladies he turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and <UNK> speech about the realities of police work br br nothing can distract columbo from the pursuit of justice <UNK> final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self respect not to do his job well here is one situation you can't <UNK> out of ms mitchell
<START> this one features all the bad effect of <UNK> cheap o movies but is so overtly racist nasty and unpleasant that it is difficult to give this piece of dreck any redeeming feature unless you plan to <UNK> in the marines skip this one oh and even if you do avoid it at all costs
<START> dick <UNK> and peggy <UNK> who were so good together in the <UNK> hand return for this very minor universal horror offering but this time instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick babe we get fuzzy knight <UNK> as a silly buddy named stuff but the results are nowhere near as charming and the scare level is virtually <UNK> br br dick is a businessman who gets the idea of <UNK> a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride but there is a tall and skinny john carradine <UNK> in a black cape and big hat known as the phantom who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself br br this phantom is not very mysterious and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or <UNK> it's always nice to see <UNK> <UNK> but otherwise you can <UNK> this up as one of <UNK> instantly forgettable <UNK>
<START> tony <UNK> underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its <UNK> tony <UNK> pro <UNK> 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what <UNK> and <UNK> could do with the series that would be different and interesting br br underground introduced the <UNK> which was very cool because it made a whole new world for tony <UNK> pro <UNK> fans another feature introduced which fans pretty much <UNK> for and that was being able to get off the <UNK> which is nice because now you can actually climb run and do all sorts of new things br br the levels are good <UNK> also improved on an issue that started with pro <UNK> 3 and that was the length of the level designs the first two games for the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some pro <UNK> 3 and 4 were <UNK> because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits in this version they <UNK> those features there isn't as many people wondering the streets in fact there are almost none in some levels and the graphics and the <UNK> physics are toned down a little but not a lot br br this game does have one con the <UNK> is a little short of course this is <UNK> first time doing this with tony <UNK> pro <UNK> so that is understandable however with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day br br overall a great addition that was very refreshing
<START> never realized that charles boyer luis <UNK> appeared with lauren bacall rose <UNK> in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together even peter lorre <UNK> had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that caused him to faint this story deals with a <UNK> <UNK> luis <UNK> who visits england during the spanish civil war and tries to <UNK> a coal mining contract that will cause great harm to other nations lauren bacall rose <UNK> comes to the aid of luis <UNK> by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then proceeds to help him escape from an angry crowd of english mine workers who <UNK> his life the real bad guy in this film is victor <UNK> <UNK> beast with five fingers who gives an outstanding performance great classic 1945 film without <UNK> bogart
<START> i really liked the first 2 seasons because a lot of good characters disappeared later on like most shows are kinda slow at first then get better in later seasons but this is the absolute reverse jenny from the 1st season and <UNK> from the 2nd season were <UNK> friends i really didn't care for the others jenny and <UNK> were her coolest friends i think for some reason the producers wanted us to not like her college friends for some reason they were so cruel to sabrina but my favorite episode from season 1 is cat showdown and my favorite episode from season 2 is witch trash that is the funniest episode i also thought it was funny how <UNK> was popular but she was always jealous of sabrina and never seemed to have a real boyfriend but was always wanting to be with harvey i just wished they could have made more better ones i also liked how the first 2 seasons during the opening credits sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume like in the pilot episode where she's in the witch costume i liked how she said this is so not me and later on she kept trying to change herself to something else is what i think but this is a really cool show it is kinda like the andy griffith show in a way because it good at first but once it turned color and barney <UNK> left it was longer good but i still like to watch it but the only reason i watch later seasons is because of sabrina what i meant about the opening sequence is the opening titles of seasons 1 3 shows sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different costumes and outfits as the cast <UNK> names quickly flash on the bottom of the screen at the end sabrina would say some sort of pun that related to the outfit she is wearing then disappear the opening sequence of season four includes the characters in <UNK> the opening credits of seasons 5 7 features sabrina at various locations around boston
<START> great cgi effects a truly oscar worthy performance by gary <UNK> as lt dan br br tom hanks is a one trick <UNK> in this movie how he got the best actor oscar that year over morgan freeman was a crime br br this movie is a <UNK> <UNK> love letter to the baby boom generation with a barely <UNK> right wing prejudice beginning from <UNK> service in vietnam all the way through to the resolution with jenny at the end br br with that said though it is hugely entertaining and an american movie through and through i found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive <UNK> <UNK> down this movie almost to the level of <UNK> himself maybe that was the point he was trying to make br br watch this film and ask yourself what is robert <UNK> saying about what makes a good american br br forrest seems to have made the right choices and been at the right place at the right time for the last 45 years those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price so is <UNK> saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and <UNK> is a patriotic even american quality
<START> i have seen a lot of movies this is the first one i ever walked out of the theater on don't even bother renting it this is about as boring a soap opera as one can see at least you don't have to pay to watch a soap opera though
<START> this wasn't all that great not terrible or hateful or anything just forgettable br br it had a sort of um <UNK> <UNK> air like it never properly knew whether it wanted to go for laughs or for <UNK> or for satire so we were left with weak mix of the three the actors seemed kinda lost br br also the ideas were really tired and recycled almost <UNK> themselves how many more times do we have to be told the 50's in the states were infected with a banal sense of <UNK> and that this was <UNK> by aggressive <UNK> and that emotional <UNK> in men is a <UNK> thing old hat br br its biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was i know it was a comedy and all but especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period you still need some sort of emotional anchor some <UNK> guide through the story to make it engaging for the <UNK> kid to watch an old woman two fellow school <UNK> and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to <UNK> it all with a <UNK> smile and a <UNK> of the shoulders then i just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way the mum was the same if you make your two main characters so <UNK> on that level then you risk losing me and that's what happened br br biggest positive i can offer is that i love the look of that sort of apple pie <UNK> and this captured it well enough it was a handsome film especially some of those wide <UNK> shots of the street and inside the <UNK> house also the opening <UNK> was cute in a been done before but still funny sort of way br br and i thought billy connolly was ok and that comes from someone who isn't a big fan of billy connolly movie star i just had this fear he was going to be <UNK> it up and trying to steal every scene but he played it pretty low key for him and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole film br br all in all not great though
<START> perhaps the biggest waste of production time money and the space on the video store shelf if someone suggests you see this movie run screaming in the other direction unless of course you're into self abuse
<START> this movie was a great disappointment for me i had been waiting for this movie to come out for years and i was a faithful <UNK> of chaos comics until they went <UNK> not only did they cut out half the story line but they altered information the statement that <UNK> is <UNK> father is untrue he did corrupt her father but he himself is not her father the voices also did not suit the characters and once you hear the voice of a beloved character the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned i can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong the bottom line is if you love lady death do not watch this movie it just did not do the comic justice at all
<START> this was the first movie i ever saw ashley judd in and the first film of victor <UNK> that i ever say and boy am i glad i did its' quiet tone its' relaxed pace its' realistic depiction of a young woman just starting out in life its' fine depiction of the struggles she has to go through to make her mark in life the decisions she makes based on real things the people she meets there is nothing wrong with this movie it is as close to movie magic as i have ever seen outside of the star wars movies and given what those films are like that means this film deserves a high rating indeed ashley <UNK> acting mr <UNK> and its' great simple worthwhile story make this a fine coming of age story and a wonderful movie
<START> great mystery but the film goes down hill from there the beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer edward he is traumatized over this and is seen popping <UNK> a mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter so ed travels to an island <UNK> of mainly woman they don't like <UNK> a lot of filler is with ed shown looking around town for the girl that made the movie too long it finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy <UNK> the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for edward br br overall not a well written story and too long br br final verdict i would skip this
<START> the pilot is extremely well done it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes i don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part although not everything was <UNK> out because it was the very first episode a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot an example would be ross and <UNK> future relationship even though the <UNK> of a first episode appeared it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice br br bravo br br a great start to an <UNK> comedy
<START> just finished watching this movie for maybe the <UNK> or <UNK> time picked it up one night previously viewed at blockbuster and absolutely loved it i've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well avoid of all the hollywood <UNK> special effects and stress on the shock factor this independent film by paul f ryan hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations taking place after a high school shooting two characters alicia busy <UNK> and deanna erika christensen form an unlikely bond alicia the girl with the stone heart the <UNK> who has a <UNK> attitude to life <UNK> deanna to overcome the issues of life and death and living in the aftermath meanwhile deanna attempts to help alicia to see some of the <UNK> and light in the world again not <UNK> on the shocking event of the shooting but on the <UNK> relationships amongst those who survived it sets this movie apart despite its low budget and short filming time this movie is far from cheesy ryan pays respect to a situation he has never endured and attempts to delve into the human psyche with an amazing up and coming actress <UNK> adds the necessary <UNK> to the dialogue and overall feel for the film and christensen helps to balance out the doom and <UNK> feeling this movie may have overall i recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school <UNK> and violence and learning more about it i also suggest the documentary it's a girls world put out by cbc in 2004 which deals with the topic of social bullying comparing and <UNK> two groups of girls one in <UNK> <UNK> and the other in victoria british columbia the group of friends and <UNK> of dawn marie <UNK> a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally <UNK>
<START> but the trouble of this production is that it's very far from a good musical br br granted one can't always expect the witty masters like <UNK> or <UNK> or porter yet the music of this piece makes even andrew lloyd <UNK> look witty it's deadly dull and <UNK> with one or two exceptions and just after i watched it i couldn't recall a single significant melody which is rather tragic coming from someone who learned the whole another hundred people from three <UNK> br br it is also strangely un theatrical it takes place on an incredibly large stage one really has to feel sorry for those people in front <UNK> who broke their <UNK> in order to see something happening 50 <UNK> on the right or 100 <UNK> on the left and does absolutely nothing with it when there's supposed to be one person singing on stage that's just what you get and the rest of the <UNK> stage is empty for me as an aspiring theatre director it was almost painful to watch br br the fact remains cole porter seems to have captured the french culture in his works better than these no talents can ever come close to and i'm puzzled by the popularity of this would be legendary musical
<START> some kids are <UNK> in the mountains and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old <UNK> gladiator he puts on the <UNK> helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other <UNK> br br this thing is just so utterly senseless it's <UNK> here's a short list of things that don't make any sense br br 1 a guy and a girl are in their <UNK> and they think they hear something outside the guy goes out to investigate and finds another <UNK> outside then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the <UNK> arriving the next morning he was only 50 feet away br br 2 these two <UNK> then hear another girl scream what 100 feet away but don't investigate because they're afraid they'll get lost br br 3 another guy and a girl are walking around and in about their <UNK> scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances <UNK> no longer requires him to address her as professor i mean what the first off that's just a really stupid thing to say secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together br br 4 a wounded girl attacks <UNK> and he stops her telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing um yeah we kinda noticed she's wounded and not dead because she's up and walking around but thanks for that <UNK> of information br br 5 one girl is tied up in <UNK> <UNK> and when someone attempts to free her she instead <UNK> this person to go and get help um look idiot if she set you free which would take about 5 seconds there would be no need to get help br br and it just goes on and on the whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods then they fight then they pitch a <UNK> and ignore the screams of their friends then they wander around some more it's just so damned boring and pointless that i turned the dvd off halfway through br br none of these characters are sympathetic especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time <UNK> himself made me laugh out loud every time i saw him he looks like a kid in a halloween costume <UNK> his face up to look evil he runs or should i say <UNK> around like he's gay the special effects are comedic the acting is for the most part awful and nothing makes any sense br br overall maybe this concept could have produced an <UNK> campy film if they put some more time and effort into it getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue creating characters with actual likable personalities having some sort of logical flow to the action and maybe even making <UNK> a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit but no instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death
<START> this time we get a psycho toy maker named joe <UNK> get it who makes living evil toys that kill people he goes after the family who has the bad luck of just simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son <UNK> again get it used to live br br easily the worst and hopefully presumably the last in this semi series this one and the previous one look like soft core porn movies but without the sex and nudity it's kind of like a low rent hybrid of halloween iii puppet master dolls and bad home movies supposedly in 2000 they started to do a sixth chapter in the series but it was abandoned and never completed we can all only hope that it stays that way br br 1 2 a star out of br br
<START> when the employees of a theater find an old reel of film they decide to show it at the midnight screening of night of the living dead assuming it's an old preview reel unfortunately it's actually an old nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a <UNK> of mindless <UNK> zombies br br i can't understand the hate for this movie it is a low budget independent production with a lot of camp but it doesn't deserve a 1 1 here on imdb it is just so much fun it is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies and they have created an entertaining tribute to them <UNK> with references and <UNK> to a variety of them it has the feel of such things as night of the living dead in many ways very similar evil dead 2 and army of darkness and various others br br i liked the explanation of how the zombies though really just <UNK> into thinking they are zombies actually come to have the physical attributes of the living dead unbelievable perhaps but i appreciate the effort by the writers to explain it the gore effects were decent for the budget the acting was all right and the story was entertaining br br i liked it
<START> <UNK> is a disturbing haunting film about life imitating art and art <UNK> life <UNK> <UNK> the director of the film plays the role of <UNK> <UNK> artistically <UNK> and sexually <UNK> playwright who finds inspiration in his <UNK> about the subject of his girl friend's documentary as an arab suicide <UNK> disguised in <UNK> and american t shirt wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves <UNK> <UNK> his girl friend's life as she films her documentary and <UNK> himself and his actors' lives during <UNK> but the <UNK> has already struck and <UNK> has left the restaurant just minutes earlier despite the manipulation of time and space the story is crystal clear <UNK> and absorbing a brilliant commentary on the <UNK> of everyday israeli life where the political is <UNK> with the personal where everyone lives on the edge and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely <UNK> bit players in someone else's dramatic narrative br br <UNK> plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone else's production brilliantly we are always <UNK> seeing what the fictional director sees <UNK> but also what the real director chooses to reveal to remind us that these glimpses are <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom sometimes the bedroom is the street and <UNK> and repeatedly frames his views within tv video or security screens actors play the role of actors who represent the real characters played by actors of course each of the actors is the star of his or her own production only <UNK> aware of their <UNK> roles in their fellow actor's personal films the detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play the actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for <UNK> on how to play the role is caught by the detective on <UNK> tapes and they attend a cast party as their real <UNK> br br despite this <UNK> of views there is no <UNK> the clear lines of this narrative the playwright <UNK> for subject matter the <UNK> seeks a target and the detective stalks the filmmaker nor is there any difficulty <UNK> <UNK> ultimate <UNK> and <UNK> israel fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action israel is <UNK> the <UNK> fictional playwright <UNK> his own life for his play israel is also the <UNK> soldier <UNK> who is the subject of the <UNK> documentary the cheating actors and actresses and the <UNK> husband they are all israel because they are all helpless caught in <UNK> or <UNK> action as the <UNK> <UNK> the landscape for his best target all the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep score of victims br br there is personal triumph <UNK> perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film but viewers will be left <UNK> for the state of israel even as they are filled with admiration for <UNK> memorable rendition of a <UNK> plight within the telling of an <UNK> story
<START> the invisible man is a show everybody s gotta love it reminds me of the old school 80's series a team <UNK> <UNK> the special effects are small but very effective but what is most important is the fun they had shooting this series it really shows the entire cast fit perfect in there roles and it looks like they can do whatever they want especially paul ben victor and vincent <UNK> <UNK> really shines in this one for me its unbelievable that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style doesn't get a shot in a big movie mr tarantino this was the show you should have directed instead of that major boring grave danger c s i get this show if you can well worth it
<START> mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series in the continuing gundam chronicles unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars this one is a little different instead of having an army vs army situation this one is led by five teenage boys due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults and their machines called <UNK> because of the metal <UNK> used in their construction which leads to problems since <UNK> are supposed to be destroyed replaced by mobile suits which are <UNK> less destructive weapon <UNK> and dolls which are ran on a i and are used as <UNK> <UNK> br br the whole point of the series is a <UNK> question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes it's way here especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines such as <UNK> <UNK> one piece <UNK> z and <UNK> which are all from <UNK> jump which is now available in america br br mobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of over the top battles between <UNK> who more resemble gods gundam is very <UNK> and seems to <UNK> in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series <UNK> normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a small battle is to have it take a half hour something that would never happen in real life gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines will be destroyed and <UNK> battles will be lost and won and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satirical br br but the magic of gundam wing is in the details and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having emotion instead of <UNK> <UNK> magic or overblown martial arts gundam wing is hard line science fiction from a country that hates hard line science fiction note the author would like to state that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is not hard line plausible in real life science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series they love star wars but hate a i the movie <UNK> why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for both japanese and u s releases at the same time with two voice teams american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon network br br the emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards the heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and <UNK> citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam wing this is not war this is total war every person every building every street is a target for attack both on earth and off br br my only complaint and the reason it didn't get the score of ten is that at about three <UNK> of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change kind of like a present time flashback which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters but at the same time it drags down what should be the <UNK> between project meteor and oz but the final two episodes and the <UNK> on cartoon network back in 2001 2003 mobile suit gundam wing endless <UNK> movie more than make up for the slack
<START> my roommate got the no no <UNK> soundtrack as a dub on a tape and she <UNK> to listen to it non stop after it finally totally <UNK> me into <UNK> i found the songs to be irresistible especially the famous i want to be happy but i can't be happy but of coarse from the soundtrack i had no idea what the film was about so the other day i saw a copy of it at the video store and i rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the film i was thinking that it was going to be amazing because the soundtrack is so cute unfortunately most of the songs that i loved were nowhere to be found in the video i saw now i've never seen the 1930 version of the musical but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing and beside that the sound was really bad through out and you couldn't really understand what people were saying a lot of the time really the only highlights of this film were the outrageous 1940's fashion <UNK> wears this crazy hat with two <UNK> that stick out like rabbit ears and kansas kitty has this bizarre <UNK> <UNK> that she keeps on her <UNK> arm and then has herself wrapped in this net <UNK> the one dance sequence is a little weird too with <UNK> doing this weird ballet stuff with pin up girl imagery <UNK> on top of her actually one more bright spot of the film was the artist <UNK> who dreams of being a fine artist but it currently condemned to drawing pin up girls for money i like how <UNK> keeps it old school and <UNK> <UNK> when his masterpiece the piece that was to make his career is sold by <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> doesn't she realize that that piece was his <UNK> silly rabbit girl with your <UNK> rabbit ears on your hat when will you learn why doesn't he just <UNK> in a cigarette before the ad men take the work away
<START> a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store after he's done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he'll be <UNK> soon bugs is happy to <UNK> into he figures out that the new job is in <UNK> and that <UNK> has to do with <UNK> animals animals like say a certain rabbit this causes a battle of wits between the <UNK> rabbit and his now former <UNK> i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940's it still remains as funny nearly 60 years later this animated short can be seen on disc 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 br br my grade a
<START> i like fulci films i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i <UNK> that they appear hopelessly inept and <UNK> to lots of people br br conquest is where fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn't really succeed <UNK> it's like most fulci films you've seen some stuff happens some more stuff happens and occasionally one scene might be <UNK> related to another really it's like conan with no sets no script no real actors yes arnold <UNK> is hardly an actor either no budget stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of gore br br this one was a hard one to get through and i could've lived without the inch of <UNK> <UNK> on the camera to give it that hair metal music video look
<START> the broken is part of the after dark <UNK> iii not a slasher or filled with gore plenty of broken glass and mirrors in this edgy thriller from france and writer director sean <UNK> a successful <UNK> gina <UNK> lena <UNK> <UNK> a strange world as her life seems to spiral out of control while attending her father's richard <UNK> birthday party the guests are stunned when a mirror crashes to the floor for no obvious reason things get really strange when she witnesses a woman that is the spitting image of herself driving down a london street in a car identical to her own gina <UNK> to her <UNK> apartment and finds a photo of herself with her father she drives away and is involved in a head on <UNK> then mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same to be exact family and friends are not easy for her to trust is gina beside herself is she in a parallel world her nightmares become more horrific is she broken br br kudos if you can figure this one out it won't be easy editing couldn't be any <UNK> lighting is questionable other players <UNK> <UNK> william armstrong michelle <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>

<START> does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film i love it one of my top 10 films of all time it just makes me feel good i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over <UNK> benson michelle <UNK> is the babe of the film imho i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film the two are like <UNK> and <UNK> the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work i believe it's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren't changed more than they are this is a very good film it is very satisfying that's all you need to know
<START> although the story is fictional it draws from the reality of not only the history of latin american countries but all the third world this is the true pure and raw recent history of these countries <UNK> <UNK> in this novel film the offbeat <UNK> stuff <UNK> up the intensity of historical events presented in this movie after all the <UNK> stuff is a part of the culture in the third world although is not <UNK> acclaimed probably because of the <UNK> stuff this is an excellent movie with a great story and great acting
<START> in <UNK> the deranged high school teacher richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is obsessed by the teenager student donna <UNK> <UNK> snow she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her but richard is arrested and sent to prison for life three years later the traumatized donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking <UNK> on her prom night she goes with her boyfriend bobby scott porter and two couples of friends to the pacific <UNK> hotel for the party but the psychopath richard has escaped from prison and is <UNK> in the same floor in the hotel chasing donna stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path br br the forgettable slash prom night is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality the stupid story is shallow and silly with a bad acting of <UNK> <UNK> in the role of an insane killer the predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to <UNK> what is going to happen in the next scenes my vote is three br br title brazil a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the death invites to dance
<START> i stopped watching lost at this episode because i thought <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> deaths were unnecessary and really depressing then i found out that they kept <UNK> around just to die in the next episode <UNK> i can't handle it br br i liked this show for the first season but it definitely <UNK> in the second season i found jack and <UNK> little religious <UNK> to be annoying the deaths of rodriguez <UNK> characters was the final straw br br i give this episode a 4 10 for being the end to my viewing of this <UNK> great series created by <UNK> legend j j <UNK> i hope his series in the future will improve on this one
<START> an anthology is always <UNK> business and i think this <UNK> should be praised there's a lot of talent involved here a great many talented actors directors and writers unfortunately i couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues i had br br first of all the segments <UNK> incredibly in tone and quality and unfortunately some of them clash with the others br br secondly several segments feel underdeveloped to me like <UNK> of good stories that never come to <UNK> i'm not talking about happy endings here or even an ending period but rather they lack even basic development or even solid <UNK> that draw you in br br last but not least i did not feel new york and its inhabitants were properly portrayed br br what you're left with is high brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer <UNK>
<START> seeing as i hate reading long <UNK> hoping to find a point and being disappointed i will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible downright terrible and not surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review i thought i might agree with him seeing as he gave the movie the rank it deserved but was <UNK> <UNK> upon reading what he said i am quite ashamed to be taking the same side as someone who commented that the movie definitely lacks good looking females let me be the first to say wow that was definitely some serious in depth reviewing there my mind can hardly comprehend the philosophical <UNK> about this movie seriously though a lack of good looking females shouldn't be considered an essential to a movie if you're desperate enough for good looking females you should really watch other types of movies not necessarily falling into the sci fi category
<START> i saw this movie back in 1984 we first started watching this is spinal tap and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep so we went instead to see this movie if you have any conspiracy <UNK> going around in your head you will want to watch this one br br the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are do you think the government would be capable of doing this in my opinion there is no doubt that they could br br but i don't want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for yourself br br but just to let you know we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the <UNK> thing in the world to do
<START> when i was younger i thought the first film was really good in childhood so i decided to see the sequel this is an example of why some films shouldn't have sequels because the first film is usually best and it is basically now that ariel and eric are married they have a daughter who isn't allowed outside the house because they are worried about the sister of ursula the <UNK> <UNK> villain from film one morgana getting to her when the kid gets out she asks <UNK> sister to turn her into a mermaid like her mum was this makes ariel go back to the sea to find her the same good voice artists it's just the story that could have had a bit more thought adequate
<START> if you weren't there then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you which as i say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish it is meant to be for realism let's face it in real life we don't say things in an <UNK> or perfect way even when we mean to in this sense it works this however does not apply to our known actors in this film notably jodie foster born a natural the fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the story jodie plays the <UNK> that struggles to keep their friendship close even with the obvious feeling of <UNK> meaning that no matter how close friends are eventually there are some people that just fade away no matter how you try br br and <UNK> is the core of the movie it's not about <UNK> it's not about sexuality but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alone br br if you have ever had a friendship like that in your life you will feel this movie it will mean a lot to you no matter what era it is set in or what era you grew up in we all knew these girls in school or at the very least knew of them we all knew the frustrated virgin half wanting to hold onto childhood and half wanting desperately to grow up and thinking that will do it for her we all knew the boy crazy one the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world her fear of acceptance we all knew the party girl the one they <UNK> about with tales of not only her sad home life but of her notorious exploits and we all knew the mother figure the one a little more real a little more grounded a little more sad because she knew what would happen maybe you were one of those girls maybe like me you had been each one at one time or another br br this film really captures that fragile time in life when want needs <UNK> <UNK> childhood the world and loneliness are all <UNK> in each <UNK> head each factor on the <UNK> which aspect do you hang on to what do you toss over the edge no matter how you may want to hold on and how painful is goodbye to everything you've known that's what this movie is steps into <UNK> while <UNK> onto childhood and how damn tough it is to keep walking if you were there you know and love this film as i do <UNK> and <UNK> done a fine piece of captured <UNK>
<START> i went to see vanilla sky with a huge huge huge tom cruise fan my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend what can i say i was totally blown away by the movie and especially <UNK> performance i thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what i was expecting br br i had read the reviews and had decided not to go and see it i am so pleased that i was <UNK> <UNK> seeing it the strange thing is i cannot say why all i can say is that i found it totally involving and could not stop thinking about it the next day as to what i felt about the film all i can say about is its not the storyline fantasy <UNK> whatever its about the people and the events that shape their life and how small events like getting into a car can change everything br br as to what the critics wrote yes maybe the original was a stunning 2nd film for <UNK> <UNK> but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject and by no means a <UNK> remake for the benefit of tom cruise and penelope <UNK> br br i cannot even consider writing a couple of trite <UNK> sentences to describe the film just go and see it br br yes i know this isn't a balanced thoughtful review but so what it's not that kind of film
<START> i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired <UNK> <UNK> off the show simply because he discovered that she wasn't a latino <UNK> but was an <UNK> from <UNK> i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired <UNK> <UNK> off the show simply because he discovered that she wasn't a latino <UNK> but was an <UNK> from <UNK> i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing
<START> well i hated knocked up i <UNK> 40 year old virgin and this little gem is a worthless piece of trash movie do yourself a favor and skip it i admit i don't like the actors in this movie and after my 18 year old son showed me the cover of the dvd i was like i wouldn't like that movie but at his <UNK> i decided to give it a try unfortunately br br about two minutes into the movie i turned it off i was so offended it's just disgusting any decent person would be offended by the filth in this movie call me old fashioned but <UNK> your <UNK> juice covered hand into your friend's face so he will know you got some is over the line of decency in my opinion yeah that's how this <UNK> little film starts and i can only imagine it gets much worse from there another real winner for mr rudd i bet he's proud as punch imagine if you could only get worthless roles like he gets would you stay in movies despite the pay i wouldn't br br i should have known better next time i will
<START> actually i liked this movie very very much not because of it s plot acting jokes no i liked it because it s one of the worse movies ever created it s so lame so bad that it becomes terribly funny some jokes are actually cool but the rest makes me pray for <UNK> for the scriptwriter men in white are so dumb and stupid that you can do only two things turn the tv off or roll on the floor laughing beer helps a lot i chose the second option
<START> this movie of <UNK> minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of <UNK> after the <UNK> war it is an epic story about the ancient <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> told at list 500 years after those events <UNK> place around <UNK> <UNK> br br this is a 1969 movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just <UNK> and there is no other language than italian even the close <UNK> is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie
<START> in war inc we find the logical <UNK> of the current <UNK> of all war related activities we are currently doing in afghanistan and iraq if you are familiar with the antics of <UNK> <UNK> brown root and <UNK> overseas you are already halfway home to fully <UNK> the satire of <UNK> latest piece cusack plays a corporate hit man named brand <UNK> who finds himself in <UNK> <UNK> a trade show in the newly <UNK> country as his cover while waiting to get access to his latest target while there he finds himself intrigued by the anti establishment reporter played by marisa tomei and pursued by the over <UNK> pop star played by <UNK> duff we are introduced to <UNK> past which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named <UNK> dillon who actually is running the entire operation for him and played hilariously by joan cusack while some moments are played suitably over the top they aren't always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise all the principals turn in solid performances <UNK> accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to <UNK> her disney image tomei is funny but understated while the <UNK> own nearly every scene they are in to be fair they are given good material the writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you <UNK> throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion in fact the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher as the story twists and turns it's way to the expected conclusion br br if you like your comedy broad and physical there is probably not enough here to keep you interested the entire movie on the other hand if you like sly comedy and broad satire this is for you
<START> james <UNK> is a wonderfully <UNK> author when one reads deliverance one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the deep south when one watches john <UNK> film version of the book one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book the camera is as <UNK> as the narration the characters are fully realized and the portrayals are fantastic i first saw this movie in 1992 after my <UNK> year of college i was in a phase where i was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973 among them were <UNK> <UNK> and all the <UNK> men fine films all of them this one was easily the class of the group that says a lot
<START> a one is the highest rating i could have given this movie considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed pee <UNK> pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b list actors who have done better work written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who <UNK> and <UNK> at stupid <UNK> and <UNK> and fart jokes for example gene <UNK> <UNK> bat from all in the family character telling <UNK> <UNK> character that she <UNK> both ways sexually was a cheap attempt at humor <UNK> of the general <UNK> of the movie you want good <UNK> humor rent animal house american pie part one only old school or office space
<START> check out the film's website more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie it couldn't be more off in it's <UNK> original story original they must have found the script <UNK> away between the old testament or face legal <UNK> for that bit of horn <UNK> high end special effects come on i could do better with an <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> of <UNK> stylish cinematography oh yes the america's funniest home video look is still a classic i'm sure they had little money available for this title so of course the sf aren't really that good or a bit bad now and then or just plain hilarious but it's the story that makes this film a waste of time and money 4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen <UNK> and done <UNK>
<START> set in the 70s seed centers around convicted serial killer max seed will <UNK> who killed <UNK> people in 6 years he is sentenced to death but in the electric chair he doesn't die even after being shocked three times br br detective matt bishop michael <UNK> and other officers cover up this secret by <UNK> seed alive seed breaks out and goes after the people who put him in his living coffin br br filmed by the worst director in the world uwe boll seed is nothing more than a snuff film about trying to stretch the <UNK> of decent society and fails to deliver in any aspect of a storyline and he said this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times they will be set free this is an urban legend and it would never happen much like <UNK> other <UNK> alone in the dark for one seed is just utterly horrendous
<START> not a knock on <UNK> as he was very funny on the carol <UNK> show he was also good at playing secondary characters in mel <UNK> movies high anxiety comes to mind he is however not a person who can carry a movie in <UNK> roles no less this one is basically a <UNK> <UNK> following a tradition of such movies as <UNK> and <UNK> it is not a very good <UNK> either on par with <UNK> but with a much lighter tone to it as it is no where near as dark as that movie got in fact this one is too light and <UNK> and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat though i did give it a 3 for a score this is only because there is a movie that is even a worse <UNK> <UNK> if you watched mystery science theater 3000 you know the one i am talking about the infamous hobgoblins this one has a guy finding a little <UNK> in some underground place i only saw this movie once a long time ago so i don't remember everything to clearly and it starts out friendly enough however this creature quickly becomes <UNK> and of course more are <UNK> and that is the movie more misses than hits in the joke department and it is also really lame to see <UNK> playing the evil brother role best to skip this one but then you may want to check it out just for kicks
<START> this 30 minute documentary <UNK> made in the early 1930's about one of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is in my opinion one of his weakest films first let's admit that 70 years later spain is much <UNK> than it was then and when i say this i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive <UNK> and <UNK> though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here and if poverty <UNK> in spain it was not exactly with the sort of <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> but with western european style capitalism but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator <UNK> that in school children are taught the value of <UNK> teaching <UNK> to poor people the horror <UNK> <UNK> is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation what is he <UNK> that children are taught exactly what at school doesn't <UNK> understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people
<START> it's nothing more than a weird coincidence that i decided to watch <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> of the day in june 1950 when president <UNK> ordered us forces into the korean war <UNK> you see is set largely at travis air force base in california in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being <UNK> out to fight in korea but you'd need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name <UNK> mentioned we see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there's no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and <UNK> america's men in uniform released in december 1951 by warner brothers <UNK> is a very obvious effort to <UNK> the success of the <UNK> star <UNK> world war two home front <UNK> <UNK> hollywood <UNK> this 1944 crowd <UNK> told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in la hoping to get a date with joan leslie but really it was just an excuse for <UNK> to <UNK> out every star under contract from joan crawford john garfield and barbara stanwyck to peter lorre bette davis sydney <UNK> and more <UNK> features two air force soldiers hoping to meet fictional <UNK> <UNK> wayne a mask like <UNK> rule and <UNK> a bunch of warner bros stars to put on a show for the <UNK> troops but in place of crawford garfield et al the best the brothers warner could <UNK> up in 1951 were doris day ruth roman gordon <UNK> virginia <UNK> gene nelson and phil harris with fleeting appearances by james cagney randolph scott and a clearly embarrassed looking gary cooper this <UNK> cast whose combined star power would struggle to <UNK> a standard <UNK> is perfectly matched by the crummy production values presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection how bad is it you can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the <UNK> to describe <UNK> as a sloppy lazy and third rate movie is to do a <UNK> to films which are sloppy lazy and third rate it's just terrible avoid it
<START> for me an <UNK> unconvincing heist movie with an a list cast particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like spike lee i was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie sub genre for a start i didn't like the pacing of the film starting off with mastermind clive <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> piece to camera unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion then finding the narrative <UNK> with confusing not to say unreal seeming witness interviews then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier of course the camera work is fluid throughout constantly on the move and <UNK> hand camera shots a plenty but director lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense falling down <UNK> by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film denzel washington is <UNK> down with the clothes and bad ass <UNK> talk of a <UNK> movie thirty five years earlier he even has that no one understands him but his woman thing going on <UNK> with his hot girlfriend <UNK> her with some downright crude and inappropriate dirty talk and his mild in the heat of the night riff with willem <UNK> in almost a bit part raises barely a <UNK> clive <UNK> plays his character with a <UNK> english accent even as we're given to believe the gang is arab based also <UNK> by having to play 90 of the film with a mask over his face jodie foster delivers another of her <UNK> tight <UNK> ice maiden sub <UNK> <UNK> turns as a well connected financial bounty hunter if you will to little effect overall it's a real <UNK> mash of a film with a light but obvious twist at the end in fact the title gives it away from the start spoiler fans worst scene of many is undoubtedly <UNK> witness interview unbelievably with an 8 year old street kid although <UNK> dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes during the film in joke references are made by characters to classic heist films like <UNK> and dog day afternoon but there's no honour in self praise more like the hot rock instead and even that was good for a few laughs
<START> although cinderella isn't the obvious choice for a sequel i love <UNK> and gus so i didn't hesitate the format of the mice writing a book for cinderella was an inspired one i enjoy writing stories myself and hope children will be encouraged by this the three stories are cute amusing although the songs were forgettable <UNK> and gus were my favourite characters but i also enjoyed seeing <UNK> bruno the mice chorus and all the rest <UNK> <UNK> proved the perfect companion for <UNK> and i liked the <UNK> a sequel done right for a change my rating 8 10
<START> only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x files fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watch a detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances the deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place <UNK> has <UNK> a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back <UNK> as the little girl and is <UNK> revenge now for the bizarre bit the little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the reincarnation i think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x files history
<START> pointless short about a bunch of half naked men <UNK> and <UNK> each other that's it for about 5 minutes we see this it's shot in black and white with tons of half naked men running around <UNK> each other to the tune of dreadful music it looks interesting but there's no plot and really the violence inherent in this got disturbing also the <UNK> <UNK> in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea some people who like avant garde material might like this but i found it incomprehensible boring stupid and <UNK> disturbing really what is the point in all this i saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence i really wish i could go lower than 1
<START> a group of hunters track down a werewolf kill it <UNK> it and then sell the head to <UNK> dr <UNK> played by director writer tim sullivan who runs a private clinic <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> research <UNK> rich stevens mark <UNK> whose eyes were destroyed when acid flew into his face during a lab explosion is the unlucky <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> it takes awhile to get to the first full moon so first we get a tender love story between rich and his compassionate big <UNK> nurse sondra <UNK> stephanie <UNK> sondra is so compassionate that she <UNK> off her clothing and starts riding rich in bed before he even has a chance to remove his <UNK> after a month in the hospital rich returns home to icy wife rita deborah <UNK> who promptly tells him you look pretty ugly before <UNK> off in her <UNK> our hero soon discovers that rita is not only a bitch but an <UNK> <UNK> who's been carrying on an affair with his supposed friend craig <UNK> johnson finally the full moon rises and rich finds himself in a hairy <UNK> as he transforms into a very silly looking werewolf creature predictable carnage ensues br br after ripping out <UNK> throat on a beach rich wakes up in the brush the next morning with his clothes <UNK> and vague <UNK> of the <UNK> events he makes friends with dwarf psychic occult expert <UNK> kurt <UNK> and is <UNK> by both local author <UNK> jason clark and lesbian police detective in a pants suit <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when rich confronts dr <UNK> the doctor sends his sadistic bald henchman <UNK> eric <UNK> who gets a kick out of <UNK> corpses with a <UNK> at the clinic after him with help from sondra rich manages to escape sondra takes him back to her place and basically rapes him on the couch during an overlong sex scene that lasts about five minutes will rich be able to control his <UNK> or find a cure for it before he claims more victims br br shot on the cheap with a camcorder this <UNK> werewolf flick has a somewhat unique premise with the eye transplant angle but <UNK> out cliché after cliché otherwise the sets are sub porn level the clinic scenes seem to have been filmed inside someone's home or apartment the wolf transformation scenes don't even look as good as the time <UNK> photography used way back in the 1940s instead they employ <UNK> editing throw some hair on the actor cut throw on some more on cut more fur and fill his mouth full of white <UNK> he can spit out cut no need to worry about continuity there's no fade no <UNK> nothing it's pretty sloppy once fully transformed the werewolf costume designed by jeff <UNK> who also edited and shot the movie is pretty awful it has red glowing christmas <UNK> eyes fur that looks like <UNK> carpet and a plastic face that's almost completely <UNK> there are several times you can see the <UNK> fingers in front of the camera lens and does the moon really stay full five nights in a row as far as the cast is concerned they're amateurish but tolerable and as far as b horror flicks are concerned there are worse out there this one is paced fairly well is only 70 minutes long and does provide plenty of the red stuff during the attack scenes as well as the aforementioned t a from ms <UNK> br br it was produced by david s sterling camp blood who was one of the first to ride the wave of digital video right when it was first starting to dominate the low budget independent horror genre scene back in the mid late 90s many of his <UNK> awful productions were released by brain damage films a label to avoid like the plague for the most part fx guy jeff <UNK> who is listed as co director here at imdb but not in the film's actual credits and <UNK> <UNK> who appears in a small role as one of the hunters went on to make the much more fun and polished exploitation flick werewolf in a women's prison in 2006 which had a similar looking creature on display red glowing eyes and all
<START> stupid mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by <UNK> who have never worked on <UNK> <UNK> by burgess meredith chasing a <UNK> race car which runs on decades old <UNK> <UNK> driven by lee <UNK> with chris <UNK> as the runaway <UNK> <UNK> who can <UNK> spare parts into a radio <UNK> which can pick up all <UNK> simultaneously and who somehow learned how to <UNK> and use <UNK> to make high <UNK> in a perfectly peaceful society as moronic as it sounds terrible waste of burgess meredith but chris <UNK> may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film
<START> i saw this at the theater in the early 1970's the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attacks with yellow cross <UNK> gas for the first time the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe or <UNK> with eerie protective suits the experienced british soldiers don gas masks only and once again <UNK> the clouds of gas and the german <UNK> the gas clouds move ever closer finally <UNK> the british <UNK> the germans move forward slowly <UNK> in their scary looking <UNK> suddenly a scream from the <UNK> this gas is like no other that they have experienced before br br now you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still <UNK> i think that you will too
<START> this is the worst piece of crap i have seen recently there is nothing good about this movie the plot is plain stupid dialogs don't make any sense humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor actors just don't play the worse they don't even try the script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with ed wood and uwe boll there is only one good thing in this flick the fights they are well choreographed as one would expect of the hong kong guys and are the only reason to watch prince of the sun although i believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter didn't have to bother thinking about the storyline however this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end avoid it unless you are fan of the dragon lady <UNK> <UNK>
<START> its christmas eve and lazy and <UNK> housewife della kim basinger receives some violent <UNK> from her troubled and abusive husband leaving her twin children in bed she <UNK> off into the night for one last shopping spree at the local mall its busy there and finding a parking space is <UNK> on impossible della takes <UNK> at one <UNK> who parks in two spaces she leaves them a note saying as much returning to her car after visiting the <UNK> she is confronted by some <UNK> <UNK> the owners of the car she left a note on they are very angry and want some fun with her a kindly security guard steps into assist her but things get out of hand and the guard is shot della <UNK> with the now murderous <UNK> in hot pursuit they shoot at her she <UNK> control of her car and crashes quickly grabbing her <UNK> from the <UNK> she hides in a deserted building site but is soon caught just before they try to rape and kill her from her magical <UNK> she produces a <UNK> <UNK> their leader <UNK> she manages to escape again into the nearby woods in the <UNK> one of the gang is killed it just happens to be the black guy here the night gets worse for all involved as a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues a similar plot line to <UNK> lake drew me to this but that is where the comparisons end this is a brainless and dumb film shockingly scripted and horribly acted by all involved the <UNK> eyed disney esquire twin kids are horrible to watch but its lukas <UNK> as <UNK> that must take the <UNK> in the bad acting department although he is given a run for his money by the equally awful husband as a film its plot line is completely <UNK> all the way through even in the set up early on <UNK> cell phone goes dead and then in the <UNK> her credit card has been cancelled by her <UNK> and she has no cash and its christmas eve now where could they be going with this i wonder the only surprising part of this hit is when after killing all the clichéd bad guys with the <UNK> of her magic <UNK> she demands <UNK> to f <UNK> her if my jaw had not already been on the floor at this films awfulness it would surely have dropped and <UNK> on the floor even the ending is messed up all the feminist <UNK> wanting their pound of flesh are left utterly disappointed i didn't think i could be further disappointed but then i saw that <UNK> del toro produced this dreck
<START> the muppets take manhattan is different in a lot of ways to every other muppet movie made so far for one it remains the only muppet film not owned by disney as of 2008 the film still belongs to 20th century fox cbs fox at the time of its release even though disney owns the rights to the muppets also this film has a story line that's very non linear and events that are otherwise unpredictable br br of course it's very hard to beat the original muppet movie from 1979 especially since that movie had more memorable songs than manhattan does however one way in which the muppets take manhattan is better than the muppet movie is perhaps the surprisingly realistic scenarios in the first movie all the muppets really have to do is go to hollywood walk into an <UNK> office and they are immediately given a rich famous contract in this movie the muppets learn that they actually have to work for their desired success and it's a lot harder to do that especially in the entertainment business than they initially thought that's an important and often times overlooked message provided one is willing to suspend the disbelief that the muppets being small and made of cloth don't necessarily have to live in a <UNK> place or even eat respectively above all their struggle to make it after <UNK> college creates a very good story another note the celebrity cameos in the movie were cool and they surprisingly managed not to take away the spotlight from the muppets that ability right there is a testament to <UNK> and how appealing the muppet characters were even to adults br br where manhattan falls flat and this is where i'm sure people will disagree with me is with some of the key songs especially in the end i thought the wedding song he'll make me happy was too somber for such a happy occasion as a wedding it sounded more like a song that's played at a funeral every time i watch this movie hearing that song makes me unusually depressed especially when the film begins on such an upbeat number as together again and ends happily for that matter saying goodbye was a sad number too but it fit better into the movie because the muppets were <UNK> and weren't sure they were going to see each other again that last song was such a let down and perhaps even added to younger <UNK> misery of seeing their favorite muppets leave the big screen br br the muppets take manhattan is overall a good film and one that <UNK> to the beat of a different drum than the other muppet films including the newer ones made after the deaths of jim <UNK> and richard hunt fortunately the film <UNK> in the same direction as well i just wished the film ended on a better song that wasn't quite so melancholy plus disney should have gotten its hands on this film's <UNK> and given it a proper dvd release maybe it will someday we'll see
<START> this movie starts out very very slow but when the action finally gets started it's a little had to follow i couldn't understand why some of the events were taking place and a lot of events happened before they were explained making them sort of confusing the only thing it really has going for it is the massive amount of blood gore it has although most times the special effects are lacking blood looks like red <UNK> aid skin <UNK> sounds like somebody is stepping on a pile of sticks again the story has a sort of amateur feel to it like the writer didn't take a long time to perfect it i feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script i honestly wish i hadn't watched it not because of the gore but because i feel that i wasted 90 minutes of my life if you like extremely gory movies this is for you if not stay away
<START> this is the first of these 8 films to die for collection that i've seen and it's certainly not made me want to see any of the rest although i've heard at least a couple of them are decent i don't know this wasn't terrible but it didn't really do much for me your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in <UNK> kind of thing mom dad died the family sold the farm moved to san francisco where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible the best part of this was the creepy <UNK> sister who of course invites a friend over from school that never leaves anyway of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on this family is sort of like the white bread version of the <UNK> clan they're nasty they do bad things but they ain't go no soul i see a lot of reviews from people that liked this and i guess i don't know what i missed but i found it to be very mediocre i wouldn't recommend it to anyone really 4 out of 10
<START> there were a lot of things going against this movie for me before i watched it br br first i was a typical high school senior in a shakespeare class i didn't really even like much less understood half of shakespeare would be no more than <UNK> without me <UNK> all my concentration into his almost <UNK> plays <UNK> with his extremely difficult to understand language and then i still wouldn't get most of it br br second it was 4 hours long i never thought that could be a good thing br br well let me tell you something this movie was so masterful so beautiful i actually understood all the language as it was being performed now the script was followed to the letter in this movie the same script that was incomprehensible to me in shakespeare class and here i was my mind opening and me understanding it i was <UNK> myself while watching the movie almost but lo and behold when performed and only then shakespeare comes to life so this version of hamlet showed me that shakespeare is indeed a master who wrote great stories when i saw it on the big screen especially in the high budget major motion picture style with beautiful cinematography and photography and acted amazingly by <UNK> and cast somehow i understood what was going on what was being said the language is awesome and passionate it allows for more raw emotion when words can't describe something maybe shakespeare's words can br br i still hold to this day that fist of the north star animated english dub is the greatest movie ever made no movie provides more sheer entertainment but for a movie to come close to <UNK> fist from that position which hamlet did it came close is truly amazing awe inspiring it wasn't a movie it was an event br br even more amazing it made me appreciate shakespeare wow powerful powerful is the word one of the rare truly powerful movies out there br br this gets 2 hundred <UNK> stars out of <UNK> stars yes yes br br by the way all you kids out there in a shakespeare class forget it you're wasting you're time you have to see the plays performed only then will justice be done to them
<START> there seem to have been any number of films like this released during the 70's and the fact that i cannot <UNK> the title to a single one of them off hand is a measure of their impact these are what <UNK> would call <UNK> <UNK> they are <UNK> more than a vehicle for keeping movie stars in the public eye br br we have micheal caine peter ustinov omar <UNK> rex harrison and william <UNK> more than enough names to get <UNK> on cinema seats every taste in hero is <UNK> for though one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointed br br their talents are simply thrown away and i wonder that stars with so much money and such reputation can be yet so desperate or lacking in good sense this sort of movie hardly adds <UNK> to a <UNK> sometimes maybe actors should choose their director instead of the other way round br br it was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the outset that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jazz theme music which also <UNK> up every time some incidental noise is needed had all the atmospheric conviction of elevator <UNK> who imagined <UNK> a jazz band when a scene depicted the steamy <UNK> of central africa or the endless <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> as a backdrop definitely a serious goof ball <UNK> <UNK> would have known what to do and his results would have <UNK> enough atmosphere and tension to raise my rating a good two points this director should have taken the trouble to watch <UNK> of <UNK> or even sergio <UNK> westerns he might have <UNK> a few things but then again probably he wouldn't br br alfred hitchcock played the disappearing wife theme to good effect in his film <UNK> it was later remade with equal <UNK> staring harrison ford in each case the confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was <UNK> here when michael caine might be otherwise compelled to employ a little brain and <UNK> rex harrison kept popping up out of no where like some <UNK> old <UNK> to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled br br at least the photography was rather good with excellent use of the often beautiful environment but then the dumb music must <UNK> up and blow to <UNK> what little ambiance this created br br action scenes were also contrived and stilted with such <UNK> choreographed fight sequences that they might have been staged in a first year drama class and of course the players must fight to a jazz <UNK> as you do br br and that's about as much comment as this item deserves except to say that the script was pretty wretched as well br br stick with your <UNK> on this one even if it contained your favourite movie stars you're sure to be disappointed too
<START> apparently the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so called movie they described <UNK> choreographed intrigue and violence i saw no intrigue i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie i saw no violence at least i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with <UNK> skin but here i am perhaps revealing too much of the plot furthermore as a viewer of many and <UNK> films some of which include the occasional kung fu movie i can <UNK> say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable whatever you may choose to do i will always remain br br correct br br jonathan <UNK> br br br br p s i was not <UNK> by the choreography
<START> despite louis b <UNK> reportedly not being interested in <UNK> the young greta garbo to a contract this first american and mgm film for the actress looked quite beautiful it's obvious that the film was assigned some amazing talent to film the production and make <UNK> paintings as it has all the nice polish and <UNK> you'd expect from the best pictures the studio could produce it simply looks beautiful even <UNK> years later br br as for garbo herself like her other very early american films she too looks different while she's quite recognizable her makeup is much <UNK> than it would become just a year later giving her a less severe look and a <UNK> about her you just didn't see in subsequent films i kind of wish they'd kept this look but considering how famous she'd become with the trademark look who am i to say they shouldn't have gone that route the film is about garbo and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the <UNK> while the <UNK> the much <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> claims it's because the bank has <UNK> <UNK> it's because her son has fallen for garbo and what better way to get rid of her than to force them out on the streets nice lady huh years pass and by now garbo has become a new singing sensation who is world famous when she returns to her hometown years later her old boyfriend who had promised to marry her but <UNK> out when his mother <UNK> <UNK> refused to allow it sees her his new love for another lady is now tested will he be content to marry this lady who is the heir to a huge pig fortune or will he want his old flame and more importantly will garbo even take him back after he <UNK> so <UNK> in the meantime a huge <UNK> hits the land begins to <UNK> and homes soon are being washed away by the <UNK> cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the <UNK> breaks in a scene where they obviously <UNK> his row boat over the <UNK> stream he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where garbo is now staying she <UNK> them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes then he admits that he still loves her and had <UNK> the storm to make sure that she was safe she tells him to get lost next you see <UNK> about to get married to his second choice the daughter of the <UNK> king he obviously has little enthusiasm for this and you feel sorry for the lady as she did nothing wrong soon cortez is seen wandering back to <UNK> home he's love sick and needs her in this scene garbo is quite <UNK> and can't tell him to leave as they <UNK> in each other's arms once again he tells her of his love for her br br when <UNK> <UNK> learns of this she is not pleased evidently a <UNK> queen is a better catch than an <UNK> known singer because of the <UNK> of this nasty old lady garbo leaves unwilling to come between the mother and her <UNK> son but cortez comes running <UNK> he must have her and won't rest until he has her as his wife moments after making this <UNK> a family friend talks to cortez and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation so much for won't rest until he has her for his wife huh despite cortez being a <UNK> through and through for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him and so he marries the <UNK> queen and lives a very dull life when years later garbo meets cortez again he is a dull looking middle aged man while she is as beautiful as ever and not surprisingly she tells him once again to get lost br br at the time this film was made garbo was not a star in the us and cortez was so in light of this it's surprising they gave cortez such an unlikable character to play instead of the usual confident <UNK> like role they'd been giving him here he is an <UNK> <UNK> a huge <UNK> and from here on his career was on a slow <UNK> spiral as for garbo the role helped establish her as a big star as she was the focus of the film and played a character much like her later <UNK> br br as for the film the new music composed for it was very nice though a tad repetitive the print oddly was nearly perfect throughout except for the <UNK> cards which could use some <UNK> br br a most enjoyable film expertly constructed <UNK> and worth seeing and for one of the few times i can think of it i have no real complaints in this excellent film
<START> <UNK> entertaining period piece set in the 30s it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series as much as <UNK> of the lost <UNK> only done on a low budget and much <UNK> by director michael anderson the opening scenes <UNK> liberal amount of gothic art <UNK> <UNK> batman by two decades starring ron <UNK> tarzan as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela <UNK> as the local <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on to our hero on a <UNK> in the non existent latin american country of <UNK> best line our hero to <UNK> holding a fist to her <UNK> just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug <UNK> you're a brick br br paul <UNK> ham and cheese <UNK> captain <UNK> is a an absolute delight expect a little <UNK> a dash of batman a little the lost world a little lost <UNK> and a whole lot of <UNK> and you'll get it just right watch out for cult favorite michael <UNK> in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip <UNK> patriotic music a prime candidate for dvd release it is certainly <UNK> an <UNK> treat for the whole family 9 10
<START> i love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years it does get better with every viewing i agree with all of the positive reviews here yes it's gritty and brutally realistic as life on the <UNK> was in those days i found myself doing commentary as i watched it someone on here said rip torn was miscast i couldn't disagree more he is brilliant as the <UNK> <UNK> clyde stewart who says little and works like a slave <UNK> <UNK> farrell is fantastic as the widowed <UNK> whom clyde hires as a <UNK> cook along with her 7 old daughter <UNK> <UNK> is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma also a star is the stark montana <UNK> it is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle there are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary no special effects here what you see is real it even has a <UNK> perfect music score and a great script once you see <UNK> you'll never forget it it deserves all the <UNK> it gets here
<START> oh brother after hearing about this ridiculous film for <UNK> years all i can think of is that old peggy lee song br br is that all there is i was just an early teen when this <UNK> fish hit the u s i was too young to get in the theater although i did manage to sneak into goodbye <UNK> then a screening at a local film museum <UNK> finally i could see this film except now i was as old as my parents were when they <UNK> to see it br br the only reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous <UNK> of time was because of the <UNK> case <UNK> by its u s release millions of people <UNK> to this stinker thinking they were going to see a sex film instead they got lots of closeups of <UNK> repulsive <UNK> on street interviews in bland shopping <UNK> <UNK> political <UNK> and feeble who cares <UNK> sex scenes with <UNK> pale actors br br cultural icon holy grail historic <UNK> whatever this thing was shred it burn it then stuff the <UNK> in a lead box br br elite <UNK> still <UNK> to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political <UNK> but if it weren't for the censorship scandal it would have been ignored then forgotten br br instead the i am blank blank <UNK> title was repeated endlessly for years as a <UNK> for porno films i am curious <UNK> for gay films i am curious black for <UNK> films etc and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead to be viewed by a new generation of <UNK> who want to see that naughty sex film that <UNK> the film industry br br <UNK> avoid like the plague or if you must see it rent the video and fast forward to the dirty parts just to get it over with br br
<START> <UNK> out every stereotype and <UNK> you've heard about semi <UNK> <UNK> and you'll see they've all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film finally kurt <UNK> <UNK> have changed thank goodness and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters br br the cinematography was amateurish i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes the plot was limp and very unfunny you really didn't understand why anyone did anything it was like i had sand in my eyes and a 300 pound lady was sitting on my face it was that painful br br the only reason i didn't give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won't let me
<START> i just don't get some of the big premises of this episode that miranda is so remarkable and that there's anything so ugly it would make you insane someone here made the remark that maybe it's the <UNK> of the light waves or something rather than it being <UNK> miranda is just a jerk the episode is slow inconsistent and way too talky i also don't quite understand why <UNK> is an <UNK> why doesn't the <UNK> just leave the damn <UNK> be there's one part i do like when <UNK> is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience overall i love <UNK> and even at its <UNK> i'll always tune in this episode though <UNK> i wouldn't purchase it except for a used copy under 3
<START> now many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title if you do not have the stomach for gory movies then what are you doing reading this review anyhow i borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately this movie is chock full of wonderful gore plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience if you're a lover of good quality experiences then by all means watch this great flick
<START> the original <UNK> series of novels is a classic of the genre it's pure adventure sf with some substance here and there and i've always wondered why hollywood hasn't filmed it <UNK> because it's just the kind of thing they love massive explosions super weapons uber <UNK> hero gets the girl aliens great cgi potential good versus evil in the <UNK> form etc etc instead and bear in mind i'm a japan o <UNK> and anime lover we get this horrendous <UNK> movie that rips the guts out of the story mixes in star wars ironic as the latter ripped off the books occasionally <UNK> and <UNK> the whole thing down to <UNK> level to see <UNK> <UNK> the epitome of the <UNK> <UNK> officer and second stage <UNK> portrayed as a small boy is pitiful etc i just can't understand why the makers did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could have made far more money far by telling straight it makes no sense
<START> there really wasn't much of a story in this film it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their <UNK> but there isn't much more than that br br it mixes some scenes from the original then it <UNK> <UNK> about how this movie changed them a little bit but still is that it i was hoping for something a little more instead all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation br br i guess if you wanted to see other <UNK> in the lion king universe then this is it but other than that it does little justice for the animators disney really should stop these direct to video productions it really was quite boring and could have used jason <UNK> d
<START> in nyc <UNK> michael o'hara orson welles <UNK> elsa <UNK> rita hayworth from a <UNK> rape as she takes a horse <UNK> through central park and lives to regret it <UNK> haired <UNK> a <UNK> blonde in this one as dazzling as fresh fallen snow but nowhere near as pure br br to reveal any more of the convoluted plot in this <UNK> noir would be criminal it's as <UNK> as the mirrors used to <UNK> effect in the final scenes but the film holds far darker secrets from the ny times childhood shadows the hidden story of the black <UNK> murder by mary <UNK> mary <UNK> who was 5 years old when she was <UNK> by 15 year old bette short <UNK> <UNK> steps <UNK> friends and associates she also offered a detailed if <UNK> analysis of orson welles particularly in regard to his movie the lady from shanghai according to ms <UNK> the movie along with related <UNK> <UNK> has many of the same <UNK> elements associated with <UNK> murder she raises the question could welles have been the killer interesting theories and with the <UNK> of books now out on the black <UNK> much more may come to light fritz <UNK> brutal film noir the big heat 1953 was a roman a <UNK> telling of the <UNK> killing in the city of <UNK> that was l a but it's the orson <UNK> that the <UNK> had a hands on connection to in reality it was <UNK> <UNK> and the hollywood mob wars of the 1940's that did the <UNK> in but that doesn't <UNK> much of what <UNK> wrote almost all of hollywood <UNK> with elizabeth the black <UNK> short and her tale aura legacy curse is <UNK> in a number of golden age films br br the black <UNK> was always on the <UNK> edges of shanghai even before it started filming barbara <UNK> on <UNK> tone it was when he was thinking about making the lady from shanghai before he lost the option to orson welles <UNK> said he'd been in a bad state over that deal when he ran into the <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> across from the <UNK> studios the floor above the <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> office and the <UNK> one of his on again off again working girls br br it gets deeper and darker after the 1951 <UNK> over barbara <UNK> between tom <UNK> and <UNK> tone that sent <UNK> to the hospital with a

shoot a 45 bullet through her head barbara <UNK> and norma jean <UNK> later marilyn monroe knew the <UNK> and their stories are well known it seems all who crossed the path of the <UNK> like the proverbial black cat entered a twilight zone darkness and or had an incredible string of bad luck afterward tone <UNK> welles are only a few and this includes a butchered film called the lady from shanghai br br lady from shanghai took two years to be released thanks to extensive re editing and all because columbia president harry <UNK> couldn't understand the story it's dark noir to be sure one of the darkest in fact it's also a wicked satire on life in the new atomic age br br nicolas christopher br br shanghai pushes forth an <UNK> subtext of nuclear apocalypse and contains the definitive noir statement concerning the atomic bomb and the american city the film's principal murder victim and there are many a psychotic and double dealing lawyer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at every turn claiming he can feel it he <UNK> that he plans to escape to a remote pacific island a particularly acid joke on welles' part since this was the very year the u s began testing atomic bombs at just such a place the bikini <UNK> <UNK> all the inhabitants and destroying the <UNK> by the time of bikini the erotic <UNK> of hayworth with the bomb appears to have been <UNK> with the <UNK> of the military <UNK> the first bomb dropped in the pacific testing ground in named <UNK> and has <UNK> image in provocative dress painted directly on its <UNK> br br its ironic that orson welles' broad interpretation of an <UNK> is considered a <UNK> to the film by many welles is giving a clue to viewers that michael o'hara is only the <UNK> not part of the story even though it revolves around him o'hara <UNK> the shark <UNK> throughout the film sharks on a feeding frenzy won't stop until there's nothing left michael o'hara lives to tell the tale elsa <UNK> causes a feeding frenzy during <UNK> trial and her <UNK> <UNK> suggests she's <UNK> in so as not to <UNK> the human <UNK> to a roman <UNK> the <UNK> are on a feeding frenzy of their own <UNK> and carrying on about elsa a human <UNK>

<START> this is the most messed up entry on imdb that i've yet to stumble across all the previous reviewers act like this is the movie this is not the movie rather it's merely a <UNK> that's an extra on the dvd of the movie the one it also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that it's listed here as in <UNK> it's barely over 13 minutes of how cool jet li can do martial arts and his <UNK> on the movie so yeah this imdb entry is quite a bit <UNK> don't listen to any of the other reviews as they are all wrong you can trust me because i never feed you dear reader <UNK> br br and that's the truth i guess u can say that i'm the one reviewer that matters
<START> admittedly i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure he was a fine actor until <UNK> of a woman where he apparently <UNK> on himself <UNK> i hoped this film of which i'd heard almost nothing growing up would be a nice little gem an overlooked ahead of its time intelligent and engaging city political thriller it's not br br city hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters names and realistic <UNK> issues that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and <UNK> that once you find out the truth it will blow your mind in truth however these subplots and <UNK> result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story <UNK> such as corruption of power two faced politicians mafia with police ties etc and <UNK> this setup allows for some thrilling tension the fear that none of the characters are safe and anything could happen but again it really doesn't br br unfortunately the only things that happen are quite predictable and we're left with several confession monologues that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the real world of politics and society but after <UNK> minutes of names and missing reports and a spider web of lies and cover ups the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal i don't think we're left with that in city hall and while it's a very full film i don't find it altogether rich
<START> the film as entertainment is very good and jimmy stewart is excellent as chip <UNK> with well done co starring turns by vera miles and murray hamilton but the film directed by legendary director <UNK> <UNK> was constantly <UNK> and script <UNK> as well as every aspect of the film down to clothing was closely watched and controlled by j edgar hoover not that j edgar hoover didn't have something to be proud of his management of the <UNK> from <UNK> to his death <UNK> on of the finest <UNK> services in the world but by 1959 hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already started to collect <UNK> on powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom and he was determined to make sure that no motion picture showed even a single <UNK> about the <UNK> the films shows only continued <UNK> and <UNK> over the failures which occurred and the <UNK> part in the witch <UNK> of the early 1950's enjoy the story but with tongue firmly in cheek
<START> the tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of scotland winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants both humans and sheep alike are <UNK> down to much <UNK> times ahead michael <UNK> james <UNK> a former <UNK> in the british army is the local dentist he's not an <UNK> by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is always being viewed with a little suspicion not <UNK> but just out of the protective instincts the tight <UNK> community have for their <UNK> the islands <UNK> is broken when <UNK> out for a <UNK> round of golf finds the <UNK> remains of a brutally <UNK> woman he immediately reports his gruesome find to <UNK> <UNK> maurice <UNK> at the islands police station <UNK> <UNK> for delivery of the remains to local <UNK> dr <UNK> for closer <UNK> a quick search for the killer proves <UNK> as does a search for a missing local woman over dinner that night with michael <UNK> <UNK> realises that the dead woman might be sheila anderson a woman from the <UNK> who lives on the island through the winter months a quick search at her home <UNK> <UNK> reveals the missing remains of her body her home proving to be the murder scene but why did the killer drag her <UNK> over a mile into the woods suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island one colonel howard jonathan <UNK> who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together br br <UNK> asks <UNK> for some dental expertise on the victims body it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind a sheep is found <UNK> and then a canadian <UNK> is found <UNK> with a heavy fog rolling in the island is cut off from the <UNK> and any possibility of help the radio also doesn't work seemingly being <UNK> and the phone lines have been cut reports of <UNK> and the <UNK> of a <UNK> soldier are <UNK> by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach <UNK> is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off <UNK> idea that aliens might be involved but a rise in <UNK> levels on the island has him <UNK> himself br br the nightmare man is based on the novel child of the <UNK> by david <UNK> it is here adapted by dr who and <UNK> 7 scriptwriter robert holmes and directed by douglas <UNK> who also had directing experience on both sci fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board the nightmare man though is on the whole a <UNK> better crafted piece that builds its plot alongside solid character development even down to the minor characters time is given to giving them all a firm background the island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that has been used over and over but its one that i enjoy very much the <UNK> the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra <UNK> by having an <UNK> fog close in to <UNK> all efforts in many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama but credit to <UNK> he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times there is an authenticity about proceedings the characters even speaking <UNK> at times to further this point if there is one negative about the killer its that we are given his her its <UNK> for the killings an acceptable cliché on its own but when seen through a red <UNK> and a fish eye lens it just screams of <UNK> and dates the film just a little still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer given the clues presented but it's a fun and very well acted piece the local scottish cast are exceptional the local <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in particular <UNK> well off each other and are a delight to behold <UNK> never one i've taken to in other works is also pretty good and displays <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as if she were in a hammer production the outlandish maybe even preposterous ending may <UNK> some viewers it disappointed me in some ways but taking into account when it was made its an understandable and acceptable <UNK> that if you think about it is even more terrifying
<START> i watched <UNK> and <UNK> by the vocal and physical acting the roles each character played were done with excellence the lyrics the words every gesture the sunrise told it all the movie spoke to me it <UNK> me to a different perception of a person who believes in mankind who believes in peace and gentle behavior i was also held in <UNK> by the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed power without grace is demented and without feelings to want power at the cost of mankind is so unbelievable this movie made me so afraid for the people who are no longer in this world and it is with sadness that i think of them i like this movie for the conversations and face expressions to it all may this movie be blessed
<START> i loved this movie i knew it would be <UNK> full of camp and silliness like the original series i found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank <UNK> and julie <UNK> all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed return to the <UNK> you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film especially adam west and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original <UNK> episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt
<START> i'm not alone in <UNK> the first superman movie a film that richard <UNK> executed masterfully i am also not alone in <UNK> richard <UNK> superman 2 which brings us to the richard <UNK> cut of the same movie sadly it is still an absolute abomination br br <UNK> world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses but superman 2 stretches things too far it doesn't matter who directed superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first <UNK> in a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do unlike the original superman with or without his powers <UNK> strength or lack thereof is handled in the least believable manner there is too much to criticize so i will not bother i <UNK> this movie perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on super <UNK> bad
<START> i had never heard of larry <UNK> before but judging by this effort into writing and directing he should keep his day job as a <UNK> actor like many others on here i don't know how to <UNK> this film it wasn't scary or spooky so can't be called a horror the plot was so <UNK> thin it can't be a drama there was no suspense so it can't be a thriller its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project people who liked this film used words like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn't there like the blair witch people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some <UNK> that it was terrifying this movie actually started off well with the family meeting the locals after hitting a deer it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes well over half the film nothing happened the family <UNK> about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but <UNK> clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie finally when something does happen its not even clear how the father was shot how he dies the nurse said his <UNK> was only <UNK> and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent <UNK> in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way the film ends all muddled and leaves you very <UNK> i would have <UNK> out with 15 minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself it didn't
<START> this was basically an attempt to do the same thing with batman that was done with <UNK> island in surviving <UNK> island for those of you who missed it and shame surviving <UNK> island full title surviving <UNK> island the incredibly true story of the longest three hour tour in history was a special from a few years back where bob denver <UNK> dawn wells mary ann and russell johnson the professor related the story of the show's creation <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> along the way stories were <UNK> with actors portraying the original cast and crew it was very well done it was funny well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show br br return to the <UNK> the <UNK> of adam and burt is in a similar style the re telling of the history of the show the re <UNK> the general feel are all the same what's missing is the straightforward approach that surviving took br br in return adam west and burt ward both receive <UNK> to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited after being allowed to stay adam and burt witness the <UNK> of the <UNK> of the show the legendary <UNK> adam and burt decide to chase after it themselves leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show this eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the <UNK> and why br br choosing to use this <UNK> actually having a plot is the biggest letdown of this show unlike surviving return forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline the <UNK> of the <UNK> instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in the history of the show it is the historical sections that work the best the casting as in surviving is excellent jack <UNK> adam west and jason <UNK> burt ward capture the feel of the actors without looking too much like them brett <UNK> frank <UNK> bears a stronger resemblance to his subject but captures none of the late <UNK> charm only his characterizations other actors' portrayals are short and <UNK> with none standing out as especially good or bad many of the stories have been told before but they mostly play out <UNK> with only the occasional clunky presentation another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for the part of batman the only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story this <UNK> the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly br br the main plot if that is what we must call it is of course ludicrous this is not really a fault in and of itself but it's just not carried off well enough to cover up the <UNK> strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot especially in these kinds of things but we really get neither here the performances by west and ward seem somewhat flat even for them the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural again i think the comparison to surviving <UNK> island can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback in surviving that's all it <UNK> to be in return it tries to do double duty and unfortunately often fails <UNK> and <UNK> do well although i agree with others that <UNK> had not aged well and that <UNK> had and what's <UNK> taking to look that good but aren't given enough to do again i think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here br br another odd point about return this special is about the batman tv series and its history yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie even the <UNK> footage is technically movie footage if you know you're bat history then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first only to be <UNK> in favor of the tv show when cbs needed to fill time fast so when <UNK> and west were testing for the role it was for the movie not the tv show why return only uses movie footage is unclear it most probably has to do with rights issues but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know seeing julie <UNK> in the present but only footage of lee <UNK> as <UNK> in the past br br overall i liked the show mainly for the flashbacks i would have preferred the style used in surviving <UNK> island but i can understand why they'd want a more story oriented piece given the subject matter besides i like these people it's nice to see them out and about still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history i just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there
<START> i read john <UNK> story years ago in <UNK> <UNK> and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make and it probably would have been had michael <UNK> never got his hands on it as far as i'm concerned <UNK> was one of the worst actors on earth and his artistic license went way over the top similar to his massacre of the little house book series is proof the acting for lack of a better word is atrocious the screenplay sloppy and there are more close ups of <UNK> <UNK> than should be allowed br br this movie reflects <UNK> story as much as little house on the <UNK> reflects the books is was based on it's just another vehicle to show off <UNK> horrendous hair
<START> i've never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production while a comedy <UNK> radio dj in 1988 i got a call from the production company they asked if i'd write and record a bit they'd drop into the soundtrack as sounds <UNK> from a tv the television screen itself would never be shown i said sure wrote a parody of <UNK> sci fi monster clichés rounded up some sound effects and called in another dj pam <UNK> to play the female part as she happened to be on the air at the time she put on a long song joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the <UNK> in a single take <UNK> she then went back to her show while i mixed in the goofy sound effects we'd have never done it if we'd known that <UNK> massacre was going to be such a turkey but then again we never got paid for our efforts either gary <UNK>
