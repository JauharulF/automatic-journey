<START> if you're a long time fan of the doctor and you <UNK> when you heard they were making another series rest easy it more than meets the high expectations of the original the pacing is much <UNK> than the original shows fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes the writing is excellent the acting superb the hardest and best thing to get used to is the production values of the new series compared to the original it's got some now although i will always have fond memories of bubble wrap and hand puppet monsters if you're not a fan or if you tried the original and couldn't get a handle on it jump in with both feet now everything you really need to know about the doctor they'll tell you as they go along this series was written with minimal references to the doctor's enormous back story specifically to encourage new viewers admittedly i'm only seeing the first new series now as it's being shown on the sci fi channel in other words probably cut to <UNK> for time constraints but i'm looking forward to future episodes either on broadcast tv or on dvd july 4th can't come soon enough
<START> this is a new <UNK> movie the graphics were really good they made the movie seem partially realistic i used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it this movie was kind of like a cinderella movie but a little bit different a father of 12 <UNK> gets very sick his cousin <UNK> him and wants the throne the girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother's stories its up to them to save their father and society with the help of their handsome prince it was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it we enjoyed it a lot and also enjoyed the indian talking parrot the music was very nice and made the movie even greater it had a great classical orchestra the voices were great and the characters were <UNK> sweet and cute i liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family all in all i'd watch it again
<START> after watching desperate living i was hooked on john waters films i heard about pink <UNK> and had to watch it and boy was it worth it believe what you hear it is trash it is packed with everything filthy which is actually the main plot of this film it contains the following incest <UNK> rape chicken <UNK> nudity like you never seen before beware of <UNK> birthday party <UNK> poo eating <UNK> trailer trash <UNK> egg cross dressing you get the picture above all this is a definite must just beware of the birthday party entertainer and divine wondering around the park
<START> paul who plays <UNK> in this tv film has to be the <UNK> thing on two legs ever wow br br but this film is a 100 <UNK> of the <UNK> story just like <UNK> this film has nothing to do with the original story zero what makes it especially insulting is that they actually contrived a gay character just so people could hate him making him as <UNK> and evil as any character in the history of tv or cinema this is insulting since <UNK> may have had a wife since that was the expectation of those <UNK> days but he also had at least a dozen male lovers so it is ironic that they should create a gay royal <UNK> character for this film no not ironic evil the creators of this travesty should hang their heads in shame
<START> i remember watching police squad when it first came on abc in 1982 and i thought it was a very funny show thanks to the many sight gags non and scripts filled with word play in one episode there was a line where a man named once was shot twice br br but unfortunately abc canceled the show after only six episodes i felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show <UNK> too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode one that i remember was in the opening where the <UNK> title was different from the one shown on the screen br br leslie <UNK> portrayal of frank was deadpan yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of jack <UNK> of <UNK> alan north did well and peter <UNK> in one of his few roles since mission impossible wasn't bad as but the one character that stood out was johnny the boy played by william after giving advice to there were cameos from dick clark dr <UNK> brothers and then <UNK> manager tommy <UNK> br br even though police squad had a short life on abc the <UNK> brothers didn't give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the naked gun movie franchise i'll close with a regular closing gag freeze the ending right here
<START> i have read the last comment made on this film and have to utterly and totally disagree with it br br you see i am of portuguese <UNK> and even though this film may say little to someone coming from boston it surely says something to both portuguese and brazilian people as well as immigrants everywhere br br and why you may wonder well firstly this film deals with two sibling nations <UNK> and brazil brazil gained its independence in the early 19th century by the hands of the heir to the portuguese throne and since then relations improved greatly br br however meaningful as this may be there is still a lot of prejudice because of the economic climate in brazil during the 1990's <UNK> to <UNK> grew <UNK> you see <UNK> is not only a country sharing a similar language culture and beliefs as brazil but is also a <UNK> to the rest of europe some people were thus forced to make the decision to cross the atlantic and look for a better life and <UNK> was the first logical place to try to <UNK> to br br as it happens still with a lot of immigrants they were paid <UNK> below the minimum <UNK> and were treated like dirt only in this case because the language is similar they were constantly made aware of their status as immigrants br br another curious thing in this film is the idea it conveys of how a man so <UNK> of the history of his own country still tried to make a quick buck through <UNK> national resources it is exactly people like this that keep brazil in a constant state of arrested development as the country is well <UNK> in natural resources and could easily climb the economic ladder should it be given a fair opportunity br br in a sense this goes to show how <UNK> still exists <UNK> representing the exploited people <UNK> the man whose status as a <UNK> or at least rich or well off is assured by the foreign <UNK> power which is in turn represented by <UNK> br br if you have seen other films by <UNK> you will recognize this as a recurring topic the struggle against an <UNK> power i do not mean to lecture or be <UNK> as to teach anyone history but i thought this film was <UNK> speaking very powerful i am not saying there wasn't room for improvement as there always is but i think the last comment written on it was not only narrow minded but hands down ignorant br br one last thing to be said on this i have to assume you have watched this film with the eyes of an american film watcher no harm intended by this remark but i mean foreign films cannot all be about beautiful scenery art deals with the problems of its time you would not expect otto <UNK> for example to paint all the lovely places in and the black forest why should you expect a film maker to focus exclusively on scenery when he feels there are more relevant issues to attend to br br in a nutshell do not judge films lightly and with only two or three <UNK> in scope this film is very interesting its photography is quite good and even the idea the black and white <UNK> conveys goes hand in hand with what it deals with i believe the image is <UNK> grainy like reality no br br watch it and reach your own conclusions
<START> ok so i saw this movie at this year's sundance and i was sorely <UNK> it took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense and it took another 30 minutes before the ham <UNK> script gave way to a working plot that wasn't <UNK> on a close up of ryan smile or contrived <UNK> after the first 45 minutes however the script <UNK> into a watch able albeit not completely entertaining or thought provoking the highlights certainly include both <UNK> and acting <UNK> being an up and coming star and morse being an extremely well established character actor with a good feel for <UNK> emotions as a <UNK> after the screening i was talking a little <UNK> about the movie to some of my friends when david morse walked right behind me he looks like the <UNK> guy in the world but he's a solid and probably <UNK> me by 50 pounds i removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject
<START> great film from the late 1970's says much about corporate corruption at the expense of the common person so that the powerful can gain gain huge <UNK> and disregard the environment and safety of others br br nearly 30 years later this film is compelling about the power of certain corporate <UNK> that since the films release have gained ten <UNK> in their ability to control it shows the need for <UNK> of the public against powerful business interests whose primary goal is profit br br jack lemmon is brilliant while jane fonda and micheal douglas are as equally compelling in their roles the <UNK> 70s where damned for much this film <UNK> the decade br br a film that becomes better after each watching
<START> dramatic license some hate it though it is necessary in retelling any life story in the case of lucy the main points of lucille <UNK> teenage years early career and 20 year marriage to <UNK> <UNK> are all included albeit in a <UNK> and <UNK> way br br the main emotional points of <UNK> life are made clear <UNK> struggle to find her <UNK> as an actress finally <UNK> into the brilliant <UNK> who made the character lucy <UNK> a legend her <UNK> romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to <UNK> <UNK> lucy <UNK> creating the first television empire and forever <UNK> their place in history as tv's most memorable sitcom couple br br as lucille ball rachel york does a commendable job do not expect to see quite the same <UNK> transformation like the one judy davis made when playing judy garland but york makes ball strong <UNK> yet likable and is very funny in her own right even though her comedic timing is different than <UNK> she is still believable the film never goes into much detail about her <UNK> behaviour on the set and her <UNK> of vivian vance during the early i love lucy years but watching york portray lucy <UNK> <UNK> is a nice inclusion br br daniel <UNK> is thinner and less charismatic than the real <UNK> was but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with <UNK> accent especially in the opening scene <UNK> <UNK> was decent if not overly memorable as the teen aged lucy br br vivian vance and william <UNK> were not featured much thankfully since rebecca <UNK> and russell newman were not very convincing in the roles not that they aren't good actors in their own right they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing most of the actors were from <UNK> and new <UNK> and the repressed accents are <UNK> at times br br although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact there are many <UNK> some for seemingly inexplicable reasons jess <UNK> the head writer of <UNK> radio show my favourite husband which began in 1948 is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with i love lucy in 1951 completely <UNK> the fact that he was the main creator this movie also depicts marc daniels as being the main i love lucy director for its entire run completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by william <UNK> after the first season also though i figure this was due to <UNK> constraints the <UNK> are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in new york when in reality they changed apartments in 1953 the kitchen set is slightly larger and off scale from the original as well the <UNK> home looks pretty close to the original except the right and left sides of the house have been <UNK> and <UNK> br br there's also <UNK> talking about buying rko in 1953 during <UNK> red scare incident even though rko did not hit the market until 1957 these changes well could have been for dramatic license and the film does work at conveying the main facts but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to <UNK> and <UNK> two vital figures in i love lucy history the biggest <UNK> comes in the i love lucy recreation scenes at least a few of them it's always <UNK> <UNK> something that is captured on film and has been seen by <UNK> of people but even more so when obvious changes are made the scene with the giant bread <UNK> was <UNK> and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away the we're having a baby number was <UNK> as well but other than that it was practically dead on by far the best was the <UNK> <UNK> scene with rachel york really <UNK> <UNK> mannerisms the producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly <UNK> the <UNK> and candy factory bits instead showing the actors <UNK> them these scenes proved effective because of that approach br br the film's main fault is that it makes the <UNK> the viewers already know a great deal about <UNK> life since much is <UNK> over or <UNK> at all overall though it gives a decent portrait of lucy <UNK> marriage and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively
<START> ha ha first of if you've never seen a dimension film your in for a real treat known primarily for super low budget horror slasher films beowulf was no exception br br however this video was more in the style of ultra cheesy i missed the k r a f t label on the side br br consider the <UNK> something out of place and time br br we had <UNK> <UNK> swords br br yet we saw <UNK> <UNK> shoes cigarette <UNK> <UNK> electricity body <UNK> <UNK> foil <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br not bad for something that takes place in like the <UNK> century br br this is not a horror film is a horrible film its very laughable its really a comedy made to look like a horror film i couldn't stop laughing br br christopher <UNK> the <UNK> series must have really taken a <UNK> in his career if he's working for dimension films br br i've learned my lesson though i'll be looking at the film studios on the videos a lot more closely now br br rated no <UNK> out of five if you want a good laugh though its hard to pass up on this piece of work br br this move had some <UNK> in spots i especially liked the blonde br br <UNK> br br
<START> i saw dark harbor at the <UNK> seattle film festival filmed against a <UNK> <UNK> backdrop this movie boasts an excellent cast and a plot that keeps you guessing throughout at times eerie at times funny i have to say that it stayed with me for days after seeing it <UNK> and walker are wonderful as the icy and <UNK> is someone you'll be hearing more from i'm sure the opening shot of a <UNK> deserted road in a <UNK> at <UNK> and the score that accompanied it set the tone so well just terrific nice nice work from a new ish director screenwriter and his talented crew
<START> but it definitely still only deserves 4 10 stars and no more a moronic dumb kid's father is a fighter pilot who gets shot down by some arab country they never name the country in the movie its really ridiculous they just vaguely refer to some arab nation this movie is really ignorant like that but <UNK> from revenge of the <UNK> is in here he is friends with the main character doug masters well doug masters who lives on an air force base his father is an air force pilot yet he fails to get into the air force academy <UNK> of a plot with help from his retarded friends to steal two <UNK> and go rescue his father <UNK> exactly this is one of the greatest films ever made louis <UNK> jr is fantastic in his role you can tell he basically wanted to <UNK> the hell out of doug masters the whole movie well anyway you can probably guess how the plot ends i can't believe they made 3 sequels to this movie
<START> you can generally ask two questions concerning 80's low budget horror films and this demon <UNK> in particular 1 is it a good film no 2 is it a fun film you bet demon wind is a <UNK> filthy and nauseating tale filled with cheesy make up effects and nasty violence the story is pretty much non existent and involves a group of young people revealing the horrible secrets of one of the <UNK> apparently his grandparents used to live in a devil <UNK> neighborhood and evil in the form of demons and fog still <UNK> around there but i got to hand it to this film from start to finish it <UNK> <UNK> the diabolical undertones the playful gore and the relatively decent acting all together make this film raise high above the mainstream uninspired 80's slashers for sure it shows some creativity and guts literally where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily this creators clearly got inspired by the success of the evil <UNK> and perhaps even <UNK> <UNK> demons but what the heck it's fun and made with lots of enthusiasm although this film does have a pretty high what the f ' standard at times especially near the end when flashbacks and laser shows are happily being mixed and what the hell is the story on those two wannabe <UNK> nonetheless demon <UNK> gets my recommendation if your likes aren't too high concerning crap horror
<START> what looks like a ho hum <UNK> rip off turns out to be quite a touching film about being young and in love br br the story concerns three friends gary ricky and david who spend their after school hours looking for sex when a new girl arrives in town gary falls head over heels in love with her br br the film goes from being a sleazy sex film to an examination of teenage <UNK> it is funny and sad at the same time it never completely gives into that love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made you know the guy meets girl guy loses girl guy gets girl back in the final frame formula that formula is tossed aside after guy meets girl maybe that is why i liked the film so much br br the soundtrack is especially good and the ending is a definite tear <UNK> it also might be one of the most realistic endings i've ever seen in a love story br br
<START> this story had the potential of a good film the difficult choice of love versus money and the angst and regret of making the wrong one however the movie was ruined by the horrible <UNK> of robert redford as the villain who offers 1 000 000 to sleep with <UNK> moore like redford has to pay for it <UNK> <UNK> good looks and all american charm just don't cut it as an unlikeable threatening <UNK> <UNK> acting are <UNK> to make his character menacing i can see it now 1 000 000 to sleep with robert redford ok says the lady but you will have to give me some time to raise the money jack nicholson would have been perfect as the <UNK>
<START> it seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence in fact violence both disturbing and cartoonish is the last of <UNK> 's deep flaws the characters are <UNK> underdeveloped primitive the intensity an obsession and a goal in itself with this director is served up with the <UNK> of means let's not confuse a mindless shot of <UNK> with artistic worth by the end of the movie it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of horror to continue to shock an audience which is already <UNK> by the <UNK> of dumb soap opera revelations already served up in big <UNK> it would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash imagine homer simpson <UNK> in front of the cinema theater should i go in or should i buy five <UNK> of ice cream for the same money be smart homer go for the ice cream
<START> there is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will and it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated at the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system br br i saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968 my senior year in high school i went because i like science fiction and wanted to see a space movie remember this film was made before the first moon landing br br there we sat waiting for it to begin but surprise there was no cartoon no coming <UNK> the theater owner at the cooper theatre for some reason chose to play the star <UNK> <UNK> with the lights still up so we all stood never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended then the theatre went completely dark and the strange <UNK> began with the blank screen barely visible br br the <UNK> ended and my seat began to <UNK> as the blue screen with the mgm lion appeared along with the first deep bass notes and then my senses were overwhelmed hearing also for the first time in my life the ride had just begun br br i highly recommend you watch this opening this film in a dark room with your <UNK> turned up as high as possible to get the effect i felt in that theatre of course it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science fiction movie <UNK> came a good thing highly under rated and <UNK> these days and we all looked at each other in wonder caught our breath and then the ride <UNK> wilder than before br br i saw it 7 more times within the next year always in a real full size theater like all theaters were before <UNK> i might have been high once but i didn't go to see it again and again because i was <UNK> i went because i knew i was seeing a work of art it was so damn beautiful the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence the sights <UNK> and <UNK> the affection for hal turning to terror and of course wtf was kubrick really trying to get across to me years and years and many more viewings later i understand it as well i think as i ever will read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web you'll find explanations that's not my purpose in writing these comments br br what i hope to do is encourage you to watch it <UNK> enjoy it's beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of e g ballet <UNK> or the blue <UNK> <UNK> it like you would a wonderful meal <UNK> it like a fine wine look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that are there and then draw your own conclusions stanley kubrick wanted to share some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you a human came from and where you're headed br br if that's too much work for your brain and you can't see and hear and <UNK> the beauty and mystery of kubrick's film then <UNK> my <UNK> but your life is about as meaningful as that of a or a pre <UNK> ape if you want mindless escape this isn't for you br br but if you like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in music mysteries and <UNK> and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life
<START> i don't know any idiotic <UNK> cliché not used in this movie rock <UNK> life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of <UNK> trying to ride with you say it to stupid young boys the filmmakers seemed to have read too much or <UNK> <UNK> stories i have seen everyday life of usual rock band closely and there are nothing to do with reality in this movie if you are successful enough your life is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep just sleep because you must be fresh sober and clean in <UNK> after live you have a little time to <UNK> your stage excitement then you have a bit time to have fun but its not any luxury or dream artistically this film was zero stupid characters and idiotic dialogs the ending of movie was funny main character left heavy metal band and formed a <UNK> band yeah what a moral real 90s
<START> when i first saw this movie i had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset being directed by first time director <UNK> <UNK> what i saw in the next <UNK> minutes completely and utterly changed my mind based on the novel by jonathan <UNK> <UNK> everything is <UNK> tells the story of a young jewish american collector masterfully played by <UNK> wood who is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis in wwii he travels to germany and <UNK> in the help of a 20 something club hitting <UNK> and his grandfather this results in a rigid search across the country and they are determined to find what they are looking for shot in some of the most beautiful countryside in the world everything is <UNK> delivers tension between the <UNK> and his grandfather and of the help that jonathan needs to find his <UNK> there is much religious matter as well as the grandfather refers to jonathan as the jew all in all this is a movie that deals with finding yourself and loving family i give this wonderful if not <UNK> movie a 10 out of 10 <UNK>
<START> i guess my biggest mistake was to watch this remake of <UNK> <UNK> back to back with joe <UNK> <UNK> original i did the same last week with the omen curiously enough watching the remake right after the <UNK> original really made me appreciate the 2006 version quite a bit for various reasons br br but this approach sort of <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> version it enhanced the fact that it really is a lesser picture basically the <UNK> version is more or less the exact same film as it tells the same story and follows it practically scene by scene only <UNK> character and the military <UNK> were written out of it but the cinematography wasn't as good the acting was worse too especially alexandra paul playing heather <UNK> character showed me again what a horrible actress she is <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> version had his charlton heston way of acting going which was amusing while in the <UNK> version william <UNK> does a good job at being william <UNK> so i didn't mind him really but the whole cast is pretty much inferior and the only worthwhile event was <UNK> james karen return of the living dead parts 1 2 in a cameo john carl make up effects aren't as neat as rob the musical score had some ring to it but <UNK> score was much more memorable in the original so all these shortcomings really <UNK> through with having just re watched the original as part of this double bill br br since scott p remake does follow <UNK> original i guess it is entertaining enough to sit through though it's lacking the wit <UNK> original had but what really made me not like version very much is the fact that quite a bit of stock footage from the first film was re used during the <UNK> attack scenes i never like it when filmmakers do this and i'm not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons i mean if you don't have the budget or imagination to come up with newly shot material then for <UNK> sake don't do a <UNK> remake but roger corman produced this cheaper remake so i guess i shouldn't be all that surprised about the re use of footage br br if you do decide to watch <UNK> then make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original you might enjoy this remake a little more then and oh yes that cool little stop motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film as to be expected but what's worse there also isn't any female nudity in this one the original really had quite some <UNK> shots going for it and that blonde girl from the opening scene even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit down too far when <UNK> her <UNK> figures as this <UNK> version was made for tv
<START> this is one of those movies that was never <UNK> and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters br br i came across it while switching tv channels and was immediately <UNK> in this story of an aging <UNK> bum whose <UNK> and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him i've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name and have never seen it in the rental stores br br james coburn and slim <UNK> were excellent in their roles and the <UNK> footage was first rate while being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films
<START> my family two 40 somethings an 8 year old and my <UNK> <UNK> old mother saw this at a sneak preview on april <UNK> we all enjoyed the movie very much the story was a good one and knowing it was based on real life events made it that much more enjoyable luke wilson was a hoot pun intended to watch as was tim blake nelson and seeing neil flynn play something other than the mean janitor from <UNK> was nice the kids in movie did well and i'm sure they will all appeal to a certain <UNK> on the <UNK> level the visuals were just lovely and the jimmy <UNK> music added to the florida feel ok maybe the story was a little too neat and well <UNK> for some adults but hey who cares i can't compare it to the book i honestly hadn't heard of it until the movie came out br br it was just a nice movie and it had a good message plain and simple
<START> imdb lists this movie as a comedy i have no idea what genre this movie falls into but it certainly isn't comedy tragedy maybe br br i won't say whether this is a good movie or not all i know is it is not a comedy i wanted a laugh tonight and what i got was some bizarre notion of <UNK> <UNK> to some ugly chair br br this movie is not what is advertised it's film school tripe that i can only assume is intended to make people think i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone that i know or even that i don't know it's ridiculous drivel that makes no sense whatsoever br br it made me think alright it made me think i wish i had those ninety minutes of my life back br br i'm sure the world is full of <UNK> critics who have a liberal bent on their world view that will make this movie something worth watching to them br br i am not one of them
<START> mario from europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film yet again another difficult film to purchase in the uk i had to go through midnight video who have a swedish branch i went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only a title br br this film goes under many a k <UNK> depending on when and where it is <UNK> i had previously purchased the <UNK> leads the dance which you will find if you search on imdb under people and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the actor who plays the count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from italian into english by an actor with an <UNK> <UNK> and rather tired sounding voice i <UNK> when i heard this same voice dubbing on the english soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the in the subject film my choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious <UNK> <UNK> br br there are quite a few rather <UNK> sub plots in the movie involving blackmail <UNK> sleazy affairs with mothers a <UNK> cycle chase resulting in a <UNK> hit a by a <UNK> motorcycle friends sleazy photography cross dressing by <UNK> etc which give a <UNK> to this film <UNK> in a word sleaze but artistic sleaze the aforementioned <UNK> liked this film but the <UNK> rating suggests other imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their <UNK> and personally i thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these <UNK> characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long having made their point so that the film appeared to drag in places e g the scene of the dancing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> appears in one <UNK> scene with a client but this too is but a <UNK> and i was left wanting more from her the director and the screenplay br br i love the political <UNK> shown in older films this is 30 years from its making e g smoking in <UNK> and the way some characters react to each other in the office i would suggest 4 10 as a more realistic rating and i have awarded it as such
<START> 1 if you want to make a movie that deals with social realism it's quite important that the audience identify with the characters that are being portrayed 2 the audience can't identify with characters that are highly stereotyped or with situations that are to obvious 3 if you got a bad actor then you can't build any character anyway even if you got nice actors their job will result ridiculous if you force them to speak with a <UNK> <UNK> accent br br ignores those 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes that are completely out of place his script is so predictable a woman comes out of prison she meets his old <UNK> boyfriend life's tough etc whatever the fact that the story is everything but original wouldn't be that bad if only weren't a complete incompetent writing and filming br br i wonder how long will they keep giving money from our <UNK> to make movies such as this one br br my rate 3 10
<START> when i first saw the ad for this i was like <UNK> here we go he's done high school musical but he can't coast along on that so now he's making appearances on other disney <UNK> personally i love the <UNK> life and i'm a big fan of <UNK> but for some reason i'm not too keen on <UNK> although all my friends think he's the best thing since jesse <UNK> but he really <UNK> me anyway i watched the show taking a break from english and was pleasantly surprised the performances were good all round especially from the regular characters on the <UNK> life and <UNK> wasn't as bad as i had anticipated all in all a pretty good show
<START> much better than it is generally given credit for this version of lost horizon not only had great music and beautiful scenery but also some stunning mountain photography a special edition laser disc was released some years ago which added more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material extra music and lots of bonus material so why isn't this on dvd hard to figure the studios out sometimes certainly the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than peter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> george kennedy and sally <UNK> but what do you want in a movie good acting or <UNK> <UNK> song and dance man bobby van is great fun michael york is a suitably tragic villain and seeing sir john gielgud <UNK> out as chang may sound silly but actually works very well on screen trust me you need to check this movie out if you can find it
<START> ok so there's always people out there that seem to make it a point not to like movies because they're good but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be or whether they're from a foreign country all that aside one crazy summer is the perfect example of what a great american teen comedy should be the jokes are a good mix of slapstick a la <UNK> <UNK> surreal <UNK> under the inspired direction of steve holland and dry john cusack one of the most dry and funny actors in american cinema and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line ok except <UNK> moore br br yes it's immature yes it's screw ball yes <UNK> dresses up like godzilla and <UNK> a scale model of a <UNK> restaurant it's also funny as hell watch it
<START> does anybody know why this movie is called the couch trip i was just watching it and am still not sure why this title was picked the movie was very funny and its probably my favorite dan <UNK> performance it even beats out his <UNK> performance i had never heard of the movie before i seen it in a <UNK> store i read the back and thought it sounded good so i bought and when i finally got a chance to watch it i thought it was better than what i had originally expected this movie rates as good as animal house and national <UNK> vacation in my mind i wish comedies that have come out lately were written as well as this one was nothing sad happens in it and the bad stuff that does happen are also funny parts if anyone else feels this way and would like to read a comedy script for a movie that doesn't have a sad situation in it email me at <UNK> com
<START> in this silly <UNK> a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city most of the short is the two mice exploring the dinner table the animation is fine where this short suffers is in a lack of humor perhaps i've just seen this dinner table adventure in one too many tom and jerry shorts even though this came first i just didn't find it that enjoyable
<START> jack <UNK> movie 'the d <UNK> came about from the real life investigation into the deaths of several <UNK> in a swamp in paris <UNK> in the 50's as always <UNK> being the <UNK> that he is came to the defense much like all the rest of his shows i actually found this movie tame by 1957 standards i served in the army and can understand the intensity of the training at <UNK> island camp death by some so this movie can never come close as does <UNK> metal <UNK> i think this is a good movie which is more <UNK> than it is actual but again think of the time period it was made 1957 and what could be allowed and said on film at that time i have always found jack <UNK> to be clean cut and very loyal i know many have criticized the film as one sided and government propaganda if you feel this way watch <UNK> metal <UNK> with r lee <UNK> i am a <UNK> fan and enjoy the movie for it's merit not accuracy as i have said <UNK> believed in this country and held <UNK> to high moral standards <UNK> <UNK> adam 12 <UNK> etc just sit back and enjoy this one from a very strict moral time period in this country don't be too <UNK> of mr <UNK> mark <UNK> texas
<START> i love the way he experiments <UNK> <UNK> was a thrill to watch just as much <UNK> and company was the new <UNK> also lived up to his role and <UNK> <UNK> was at his best was really irritating but i think he fit the character he was playing he had really ugly teeth the story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better i only wish he signs up <UNK> for his other up coming movies i think they are the best director and actress combination i have seen i have not seen as yet but i am looking forward for it i for some reason don't find that exciting to watch on the screen unlike <UNK>
<START> what to say about dead end road br br lets just say that edgar allen poe would have been so ashamed the acting writing effects and everything in this movie was just horrendous that doesn't even do justice this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i have ever had to sit through that is also why i stopped it about 20 minutes before the ending because personally i didn't care what happened to the characters i have seen bad but this was definitely the worst i got hyped up for this because i am a fan of poe and this was just bad just bad br br what <UNK> me more is that you can't rate films with negative numbers
<START> it was the first action movie made in banned in <UNK> hollywood action style it is not even close to the hollywood action movies of that time the plot is childish the directing is so so this movie succeeded because it was first of its kind in russia even though i watched it many times i have to admit it was kind of naive and i did not like it this is not the best example of russian action movie this is just the first experience
<START> i walk out of very few movie <UNK> and this movie managed to become one of those that i couldn't bear to watch any longer as far as the awards it won goes the ones awarded by turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion my only explanation for the queens festival award was to think that somehow a <UNK> of comedy was gained in translation as the subtitles helped distract attention from the horrendous performances br br at the beginning of the screening i attended the <UNK> briefly talked about the history of turkish cinema and at one point mentioned that early turkish cinema was appropriately named stage cinema since many of the filmmakers and actors involved were people from the theater scene br br ironically this movie falls right into that category english <UNK> reading subtitles may think that turkish is a naturally loud language and <UNK> all the yelling in the movie to that but <UNK> native <UNK> will immediately notice that all the actors are performing with exaggerated loud voices you could <UNK> this to the amateur nature of all actors but the biggest source of <UNK> out dialog is the main character played by the only professional actor in the movie not surprisingly his background is in theater my guess is that in response to his loud delivery of lines all other amateur actors raised their voices as well hence turning the whole movie into a series of unnatural performances br br put on top of all of this a storyline that develops at a <UNK> pace you get an extremely boring movie br br i have to say i also have a personal problem with turkish movies that depict entirely rural life with shallow <UNK> characters ever since one of the best turkish movies ever made turkish filmmakers seem to be not able to avoid the appeal of the rural part of the country this is only interesting in small doses and if it is as beautifully <UNK> with excellent writing and directing as in most often however it is extremely boring and frankly somewhat embarrassing to native urban <UNK> rural <UNK> make up a neglected part of the country and while this provides good material for comedy it comes at a huge cost to image br br a western audience member whose only exposure to turkey is this movie will undoubtedly think that turkey is like afghanistan i wish filmmakers would realize this and let go of their passion for the stories of the rural man and stay loyal to the majority of the country who live in cities that put <UNK> areas in europe to shame
<START> this excellent musical movie in beautiful technicolor is so wonderful it's enough to make every person of irish descent feel proud full of the joy and celebration of all things irish a fine cast with brilliant settings and superb theatrical <UNK> lovely irish music and the <UNK> irish <UNK> voice of star dennis morgan <UNK> the luck <UNK> the irish to have such a marvelous movie to enjoy over and over again not just just for st <UNK> day mind you but for all year round br br one of the <UNK> produced by jack l warner during his <UNK> as studio boss in <UNK> in the 1940s br br shame on warner brothers for not having this fine picture available on home video and dvd
<START> this film tries to <UNK> the studio era in hollywood and the morals of the 1950s guy stone is intended to be a rock hudson type but both the script and actor matt end up <UNK> a smarmy cruel <UNK> voiced version of george hamilton instead which makes for an unpleasant character br br guy stone is such a <UNK> human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin unlike hudson who was <UNK> <UNK> stone is a hateful person who <UNK> uses and then throws away the sweet handsome young men who share his bed every few hours br br <UNK> <UNK> is jerry <UNK> <UNK> lesbian manager <UNK> is very good but the director doesn't quite know what to do with her the fault lies in the dialogue which is a bit clumsy and the film suffers for it br br carrie <UNK> sally owes more to ellen greene in the little shop of horrors as written <UNK> sally is good for a laugh but little else newcomer adam <UNK> is lost in this movie he cannot act and seems to have been cast for his hot body and good looks br br like many recent films straight jacket is a <UNK> a comedy film which switches <UNK> to a drama about two thirds of the way through the film and like almost all straight jacket fails miserably br br despite the expensive services of skywalker sound the sound quality of the film leaves a lot of be desired the over use of the musical soundtrack creates a distracting amount of <UNK> as well br br the film really doesn't managed to <UNK> anything about the 1950s unlike <UNK> in the rain which perfectly captures hollywood's <UNK> about the <UNK> of sound as well as the studio mentality about formula films straight jacket doesn't manage to depict hollywood in the 1950s at all well the dialogue sets and behavior of the key characters are <UNK> rather than dead on stereotypes of the 1950s hollywood the same can be said for the <UNK> of the general <UNK> social <UNK> and <UNK> of the 1950s as a whole compare the transformation of guy's home to the dead on satire of the 1950s home in little shop of horrors there is no comparison little shop hits the nail on the head while straight jacket doesn't even know there is a nail br br motivations too seem <UNK> rick foster is supposed to be a <UNK> liberal yet he falls almost immediately for a <UNK> <UNK> like guy stone rick is fine with guy's <UNK> status for many months but when it comes time to go to italy he becomes conflicted for reasons that are completely unclear and even though sally appears to fall in love with <UNK> during the party this plot point simply disappears a few minutes later without comment rick comes off like a gay man from the 1990s not a gay author of the 1950s indeed modern morality this film which it shouldn't if it were really a satirical look at <UNK> in 1950s hollywood br br plot holes in this <UNK> film also abound <UNK> repeatedly says that he's going to turn <UNK> stevens over to the <UNK> but never does so allowing <UNK> to out guy jerry and <UNK> plot to in guy never makes any sense nor does <UNK> sudden decision to take the blame and although guy has admitted he is a homosexual apparently it doesn't matter and he ends up a famous star and playwright anyway br br unfortunately none of the production values manage to save this film the cinematography by michael is pedestrian at times the film almost looks like a filmed play rather than a motion picture especially the scenes in <UNK> office everything is <UNK> to medium shots and the film has an incredibly static the editing by chris doesn't do the film any help either long scenes which would benefit from the <UNK> of close ups or shifts in point of view remain uncut whether this is due to lack of coverage or bad editing is not clear but the overall effect is to create a sense of <UNK> br br the film relies heavily on cgi effects of guy's home created by visual effect designer thomas dickens but the cgi looks clumsy and hokey and it is very <UNK> amateurish br br my overall impression of this film is that the jokes are cheap and easy the plot muddled the characterizations wildly inconsistent and way off the mark the satire nonexistent the performances <UNK> and off the mark and the comic timing off it's almost an amateurish film it is as if someone took a high school production and threw 10 million at it
<START> sex drugs rock roll is without a doubt the worst product of western civilization the monologues are both uninteresting and pointless in the rare monologue that captures the audience's attention it is quickly lost through overly long <UNK> and unnecessary <UNK> the <UNK> angels at <UNK> comes to mind i guess one man show needed some filler material to give a length that he thought justified the price of admission br br i would rather sleep with my aunt and be hung upside down and <UNK> of my blood than see sex drugs rock roll again
<START> charles <UNK> sales is absolutely terrific as the sole member of the family willing to <UNK> against a gangster they saw murder a policeman and an <UNK> he fought at bull run in the civil war and his <UNK> runs high even after his son in law is beaten and one of his <UNK> is kidnapped by the gang <UNK> all the other members fear of his <UNK> death is no excuse he says he wouldn't want his <UNK> living in a country run by gangsters anyway the conflict between <UNK> duty and personal safety is driven home <UNK> in this oscar nominated story walter huston is also a standout as the hard driving district attorney threatening the family with <UNK> if they don't back up their <UNK> of the killer in court the rest of the cast including the sleazy killer ralph <UNK> are all excellent and the film is <UNK> directed by william a <UNK> there's also good suspense as sales disappears just as the trial is about to begin
<START> the comments of the previous user are harsh indeed one wonders if they have even seen this beautiful sweet film as for being so nasty about it in front of the writer director well thats just plain rude for those who grew up in the eighties it is an <UNK> piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well acted and produced irish film making sure has a lot of bitter angry people involved with it and the <UNK> <UNK> comment made about this is evidence of it as people we have a choice give out and <UNK> about the people who actually go out there and make stuff or make something yourself i know which one is easier do yourself a favour and watch this film and see how a short film is made you won't be disappointed
<START> this is one of the funniest shows on tv today it hits the mark 99 of the time usually after watching a sitcom after a few years the actors become to cartoonish as if they are trying to become the beloved characters they play these actors have in my opinion stayed true to their roles the chemistry is still there the writing has not gone down and i still look forward to watching it the family dynamic still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so far fetched to make it seem the writers are reaching into an empty bag trying to keep the show on for one more season it is one of the few shows i watch without the remote in my hand for quick switching
<START> without a doubt this is the worse movie every made period yes it's worse then dolph <UNK> 1989 <UNK> <UNK> worse then the 1979 1991 captain america movies oh yeah it's even worse then christopher reed scripted superman iv quest for peace movie that movie was so bad that the guy who played nuclear man only starred in one other film and it was only on t v <UNK> br br this movie is d quality i had a chance to watch it on the scifi channel back in 1997 i had heard it was pretty bad but had nothing else to do that night so i figured i check it out what a waste of an hour and a half i would have been better off watching reruns of different <UNK> besides having the <UNK> special effects and worse acting i've ever seen the whole script was just awful and not well directed at all thankfully a new fantastic four movie is being done and hopefully this version will do the heroes justice i was hoping for a new <UNK> movie in the future but it has yet to <UNK> br br do not rent this movie if you happen to see it being <UNK> on cable check it out be warned though you'll most like be flipping the channel after the first 15 mins
<START> this movie <UNK> the now infamous <UNK> where top nazis gathered to discuss the <UNK> and <UNK> of the final solution first off i want to say i was amazed to see kenneth branagh play a nazi with the <UNK> back blonde hair he certainly looked the part but he didn't really act the part well there was none of the menace cruelty and in the end he came out looking like a <UNK> <UNK> keeping the meeting going the real would not have let the <UNK> get out of control the way it did in the film br br the best performance of all was undoubtedly colin <UNK> who played dr william the man who wrote the <UNK> <UNK> race laws and who gave legal to everything the nazis did <UNK> performance was stunning the main vocal <UNK> to what was <UNK> the best part of all was when he was <UNK> dressing down one of the nazi thugs the thug <UNK> i'll remember you and <UNK> replies you should i'm very well known the film is historically accurate but let's <UNK> it down to what it really is 90 minutes of a group of men around a table discussing shouting and <UNK> there's no excitement no real conflicts except the brief argument it's just 90 minutes of talking same room same table same people br br i'm not sure if the dvd is worth the money i for one felt short changed
<START> a <UNK> movie <UNK> is a marvel she's <UNK> she is a feminist she is still very much in love br br the movie features paris in the 50's it is wonderful to look at the sites the cars <UNK> and br br a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy the music is horrendous it almost on the other hand it is hilarious but it is probably the only thing <UNK> at least looking at it with 21st century eyes br br the movie comments on the french manner of treating infidelity it is that sense modern a movie like un elephant se did it in an 80's way but the basic premise stays the the same br br thanks to makers for providing <UNK> with this opportunity
<START> this movie was probably one of the worst movies i've seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply regret <UNK> where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked br br quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies blatant dialog such as how ya doing not that great doc directly after an attempted <UNK> of a man's daughter and then his wife's attempted suicide of course he's not that great was at some points kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the <UNK> girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah and they never actually got the deed done br br the acting horrible i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played <UNK> del and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul whose acting combined with <UNK> music a gun and a half naked <UNK> white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody else's acting was horrible as well br br the lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters couldn't be counted on one hand like 50 thumbs down br br p s what is it with the climax of <UNK> movies happening in a stable anyways
<START> sometimes it is funny to watch films <UNK> from your couch but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind house party 4 down to the last minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are <UNK> with you to turn the film off this final installment to the house party series is by far the worst not just sequel but film released by hollywood it becomes very apparent early on in this feature that director chris loved <UNK> <UNK> day off with a passion i say this because it becomes very clear that had no trouble <UNK> the originality of <UNK> off john <UNK> hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor you would think that by stealing themes and images from a funnier film your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two with house party 4 proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel much less a hollywood film from his confusing and choppy story the inability to make sense of his characters and recycled old tired cliché moments all is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the house party films it reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly <UNK> together super <UNK> <UNK> cat hair chewing <UNK> and <UNK> and presents it as <UNK> crossing the <UNK> it just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator br br so where did this film first take the <UNK> into the realm of comic stupidity honestly i do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long so instead i would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest to begin i still cannot shake the <UNK> rip off it was as if director was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to house party and decided to bring in a completely random formula from a funnier film and see if he could cut and <UNK> elements from the original series into that formula that was a huge mistake when a director tries to do this what eventually happens is confusion within the audience we think that we are going in one direction but instead we head in another one that is exactly what you can witness in house party 4 in one instance we have john john trying to have the biggest party of the decade while also trying to score a record deal ok kinda reminds me of the original house party but then we <UNK> away to this random island where uncle charles is afraid of flying grandma gets drunk and some idiotic mind <UNK> moments with a supposed killer again we begin somewhat strong and end chaotic this is the confusion in which i speak director did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a <UNK> story he would rather cut <UNK> keep the jokes cheap and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone dead series one would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another house party film he would walk into it thinking that he she would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life instead just wanted to get paid br br i realize that i am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by but i do believe i still keep my hand in the younger <UNK> culture i listened to rap and r b growing up but the group immature never made it to either my <UNK> deck or my cd player why i don't think they ever quite had a following but apparently to director chris it would be <UNK> to cast them as leads in his new house party film didn't anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly or how about the option to have himself play the comedic car <UNK> nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor it was one of those few instances when i actually missed robin harris and i never thought i would find myself saying that to any film outside of a go nowhere band playing the lead role i also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film uncle charles was annoying when he attempted humor kim was completely wasted for her scenes both literally and <UNK> while  well  everyone else pretty much falls into that category br br where did chris spend most of the budget for this film not for special guest stars because while this film may have <UNK> some there were definitely none present at the unforgettable house party nor the possible dream that perhaps kid or play would make one final appearance house party 4 followed no <UNK> design which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the escaped murderer who happened to be a <UNK> driver routine for humor was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more <UNK> instead of substance for once i can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film house party 4 buried the series and while i do hear that there may be more in the <UNK> i only hope hollywood realizes that this series has died hollywood needs to let this series end forget about the past and move forward in the future i think a sequel to who's the man would get them started in the right direction br br grade out of
<START> when i saw this on tv i was nervous whats if they messed it up millions of families like mine that live with a brain damaged man in my case my dad would be let down i watched it with my mum and we both ended up crying it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as well as the person having suffered the brain injury the actors were all wonderful and i had no complaints my <UNK> told me she hasn't been able to stop thinking about it i hope this program made many people aware of what it's like living with brain damage and what it's like for the families more programs like this should be made i was surprised at how good it was and it's really <UNK> me up emotionally
<START> wow this movie was horrible as a bills fan i was really looking forward to it but this was bad they should have left it on the shelf it was on for 4 years i can't believe a guy like jon voight would sign on for something like this
<START> on the way home from a day at the beach four young people seek shelter from a <UNK> <UNK> at the home of lord and lady alexander after their car runs out of gas they don't know it but the house they're staying in is to be the site of a satanic ritual jane <UNK> keaton the only female of the group is to be sacrificed as her male companions rush to her aid one of them accidentally kills lady alexander things really get out of hand and everyone else attending the black mass is also killed the four try to make an escape but soon discover there's no escape from what they've witnessed one by one they meet their <UNK> br br <UNK> into tragic ceremony i was positive i would enjoy it slow burn gothic horror is right up my alley i'm also quite fond of some of <UNK> other movies like the horrible dr the ghost and i tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing unfortunately things don't always work out the way they should the biggest tragedy with respect to tragic ceremony is the time i spent watching this mess of a movie with a few minor exceptions nothing about the film <UNK> to me or worked for me the characters are unlikeable the plot is incoherent and <UNK> and the pacing is terrible there's a subplot about some cursed <UNK> that goes nowhere and only serves to confuse things even further in addition nothing interesting happens for most of the movie by the time the four leads realize they're in danger i was well past the point of caring and i don't understand the reviews i've read that praise the acting of <UNK> keaton i suppose it's a terrific performance if you consider an <UNK> <UNK> to be acting the three male leads are the very definition of <UNK> they do nothing to stand out the supporting cast includes some genre favorites like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and paul <UNK> but none is given anything to do in fact <UNK> main contribution is a two minute long monologue at the end of the movie that attempts to explain what happened in the previous 80 or so minutes it's a weak attempt to provide a wrap up to a very weak movie
<START> this is a novelty in danish film the mood is not unlike that of also by <UNK> thomas <UNK> but with a novel touch one difference is fewer characters leaving much more room for them to be <UNK> into and what characters the two <UNK> are perfect <UNK> is a <UNK> deranged parody and <UNK> lie an indifferent <UNK> with a twin brother more or less an <UNK> pairing of the two
<START> although i'm a girl thankfully i have a sense of humor and realize that this really is a funny anime watching it does give you an overwhelming feeling that it's definitely a guy show but that doesn't take away from the fact that its hilarious 10 10
<START> this film is <UNK> <UNK> best film the plot is amazing the acting is amazing and the directing is amazing an all time classic this should have won best picture not kramer vs kramer though it was not even nominated jack lemmon and micheal douglas are also at their best one of the best endings ever if you haven't seen this film run don't walk to rent it should have been on <UNK> top 100 see it not just for fonda but for everything br br out of 4 out of 4
<START> i feel very generous giving this movie a 2 out of 10 okay noted that the special effects are <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> did make one my favorite <UNK> altered sharks attack a research station movie that of which you may know as deep blue sea also the opening credits are done fairly well with a <UNK> of more human then and it does go fairly well with what is in the context of this <UNK> but enough praise lets get to the reason why this movie sucks so much br br not since uwe <UNK> alone in the dark did i ever feel that the special effects in a movie were totally wasted okay our story starts with four guys who are <UNK> of four different families each of which possess a never fully explained power from a never fully explained family background that did a never fully explained art of witch craft oh and for some reason these <UNK> are all 17 all go to the same school are all on the swim team and all for some reason or another sit in bed with their shirts off <UNK> and talking to each other on the phone i have nothing against gays gothic or thirteen year <UNK> but that is what this movie is aimed at 13 year old <UNK> who question their sexuality yeah there's girls in it who sit on their <UNK> in their <UNK> or whatever but how come they don't take their shirts off hey its only fair br br anyways the characters in this movie are told that when they turn 18 they will <UNK> and be granted new profound almost god like powers but before i go any further i forgot to mention that when they use their powers they age slowly and they grow more addicted to it that explains why they got people in their late <UNK> to play 17 year <UNK> oh and if something needs explaining don't worry someone will explain it all in one large piece of dialog god this movie sucks where was i oh yeah the <UNK> part br br okay apparently there was a super secret <UNK> one family that the others forgot about or some s t like that i don't know i was <UNK> off at this point but they were written out some how and the new kid at school who is <UNK> the group is one of these <UNK> from the fifth family and i say because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy he has greater power then the others because he's older i think anyways bob say it out loud things happen and we get to the final fight in the movie br br to be honest i was all game for a witch battle you know like vs <UNK> or anything along the lines with magic battle because you know this is about witches and stuff now when these two witches throw down its more of like how can i put it a very very crappy version of a <UNK> z type battle they throw stuff at each other talk throw stuff talk throw stuff talk etc when i say <UNK> <UNK> i only say that because i have no clue what the f k their throwing at each other it looks like big <UNK> of slimy water god this movie sucks anyways when our main witch he doesn't get very powerful at all he just throws bigger <UNK> of slimy water things happen and it ends in a way that you as the viewer know its gonna end the good witch wins bad witch loses br br you know how <UNK> a movie is when the bad guy says something so incredibly stupid as <UNK> gonna make you my thats where i wanted to punch myself in the face for sitting through this whole thing br br yes i admit the thought of witches doing battle using powers in the modern day does sound kinda cool but when the execution is this bad i really wished they didn't make this movie maybe if it was r rated had and threw in more deaths with a dash of gore it might have worked might have worked br br if your interested in watching this don't buy it or even rent it wait for it to come on tv or borrow it from your sucker of a friend who bought it just don't waste your time with this hack of a movie if you spend any money on it there's a good chance your putting an effort towards a sequel to be made by uwe boll called the <UNK> 2 alone in the dark with the house of the dead
<START> i am a big <UNK> of indian movies especially <UNK> and <UNK> br br shame on india for not sending this movie as their official oscar entry i have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity <UNK> cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with by the way to all we <UNK> <UNK> cinema is more <UNK> and very different from bollywood which is all about good looks <UNK> and promotion br br coming to the point what was india thinking when they sent a movie like to the oscars that was a really a <UNK> move i think they are trying to <UNK> oscar judges with boredom by sending <UNK> since the judges <UNK> <UNK> last year br br is just a colored but stale and predictable melodrama of love fate and destiny i would keep away from it anyway not sending a movie like shows how much of a <UNK> indian administration needs to save them from poor <UNK> who lack intelligence now i know why this country has so many issues they are heavily talented but not <UNK> properly
<START> this film is great being a fan of the comic strip presents i just knew i would love this film and love it i do i finally got round to buying a copy of this film early this year however i was annoyed to find that it had been cut so i'll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version br br anyway the film is about dennis carter adrian who tries to impress his girlfriend dawn french by claiming to be a drug dealer however dennis is <UNK> <UNK> one night in the pub and <UNK> so dennis turns but the trouble is he doesn't know anything and starts to make up lies and dig himself into an even deeper hole the irony of all this is that there is drug <UNK> going on down in <UNK> br br this film is not as funny as i expected but it is still a really good film with some good laughs and a great soundtrack it also has the best scene ever in a british film <UNK> <UNK> walk across the <UNK> set to two <UNK> by frankie goes to hollywood br br so if you are a fan of the comic strip presents of any of the cast members or a fan of british comedy see it a s a p
<START> this obviously was a pretty low budget production but the cast was pretty decent the basic premise had promise and something more could have been done with it but the script wasn't that great the plot is incoherent and seems almost random at times and the dialog is stilted and terrible br br basically a girl's father gets whacked by fellow gangsters and later she becomes a <UNK> and wants to avenge his death and then it goes into a mob protection <UNK> involving corrupt politicians br br alan <UNK> gets top billing but he really plays a very minor role br br i have to say i found it mildly entertaining in its <UNK> b grade but it really is shoddy and pathetic
<START> i've always loved gone with the wind and have seen it numerous times however its ending left me not only hanging but depressed with a hopeless feeling finally in scarlett <UNK> took us to a very plausible and satisfying end beginning of the original story br br it follows that someone of <UNK> obvious intelligence as originally written would eventually grow up although like most people i fell in love with scarlett in <UNK> i tired of her constant insipid to the point of <UNK> and i was disappointed that mitchell did not show scarlett using that obvious intelligence to even make an attempt to grow emotionally thankfully someone finally did after all isn't that <UNK> <UNK> that conflicted with her beauty and intelligence the very reason <UNK> finally gave up on her in the first place i think <UNK> did an excellent job of describing that long <UNK> process and <UNK> kilmer did a superb job of portraying it <UNK> w k has all the fire <UNK> and intelligent <UNK> as did vivian leigh and she is certainly at least as if not more beautiful br br there was is and always will be only one clark gable however if i had to pick an actor out of the thousands to which i've been exposed to portray him in his biography it would definitely be timothy dalton dalton possesses the same elegant charm that gable did which is essential for character i can't imagine anyone else who could come close br br in my opinion both <UNK> <UNK> kilmer and timothy dalton were superbly cast and the only actors who could have possibly played scarlett and <UNK> i think both their performances did justice to not only the late actors but also the spirit of their characters br br i enjoyed the whole cast julie harris was her usual delightful presence and jean smart was an adorable kick even <UNK> character was nicely played by stephen collins and the progression of his relationship with scarlett was totally believable br br the story became a little convoluted in ireland but so is life after all and i still found it entertaining br br all in all i thoroughly enjoyed the <UNK> of <UNK> imagination i wish i'd written it br br
<START> wow this movie is amazing it is such an excellent film has some sick scenes not nearly as sick as terror <UNK> or citizen <UNK> some nudity and this was the penis <UNK> debut on film this has set the scene for many of <UNK> movies this is a very film it mixes comedy romance and my favorite horror gore not that much gore in this flick but enough to satisfy this is the best adaption of shakespeare's romeo and juliet much better than any other version they make it so entertaining and fun to watch and we have debbie <UNK> <UNK> i like her all i have to say is this is a great film very funny and is a good host for it the acting is good and kaufman directs <UNK> as always must see for all troma fans
<START> we'll never know the truth about 9 11 and this shoddy movie proves it br br i recently watched a youtube report claiming there were no planes involved in the twin <UNK> destruction that all the news programs were supposedly provided with same angle shots of the towers from a mysterious source probably the and in that provided footage cgi planes were <UNK> for real life <UNK> which actually hit the towers br br it's a compelling video and though i am not a <UNK> conspiracy <UNK> per se i am still not sure myself whether actual planes hit anything that day the towers the field the <UNK> because there is no plane <UNK> available and what about those infamous black boxes none <UNK> a million other theories abound all of them <UNK> a <UNK> of truth <UNK> in an ocean of <UNK> but you'll <UNK> in <UNK> before you find anything truthful or worth <UNK> about in the 9 11 <UNK> report a no budget movie that is trying to close the <UNK> door after all the horses and <UNK> have escaped br br writer director leigh scott is obviously a concerned american citizen who wanted to <UNK> audiences on what the page report might reveal it would help if his movie had actors instead of a guy who looks like david duchovny a chick who looks like gina <UNK> a guy who thinks he's russell <UNK> and another guy who i'm pretty sure is trying hard to be sean bean it would help if his camera <UNK> didn't have if the lighting director wasn't trying to save on electricity it would help if his editor didn't have attention <UNK> disorder or if the soundtrack wasn't some <UNK> new world order and the <UNK> should have probably been inserted when people were actually moving their mouths br br we can't even call this propaganda it's too funny and by funny i mean unwatchable br br you can't squeeze an issue this complex into a two hour film but leigh scott tries anyway including all those sexy catch phrases we've grown to bin intent to attack <UNK> weapons from non <UNK> <UNK> with iraq attending flight school weapons of mass destruction br br the problem is we know it's all retrospect so every discussion the concerned intelligence <UNK> have with each other <UNK> of fake <UNK> all <UNK> into a neat conversation like contrived reverse <UNK> everything <UNK> is mentioned <UNK> so that we can shake our heads in wonder at how <UNK> all these <UNK> of government screwed up br br there's a ludicrous <UNK> scene with a <UNK> bimbo beating up on a guy with <UNK> <UNK> on his face now that would be considered torture if most guys didn't consider it a turn on br br the <UNK> is what if the attack could have been stopped by this movie's account and we presume according to the <UNK> report the cia and other underground <UNK> were all set to capture bin laden and didn't everyone involved with the terrorism reports you mean you actually read these reports is so concerned we just want to slap them for their bad acting br br yet the whole story goes so much deeper than the banal the <UNK> <UNK> bush <UNK> <UNK> on the american people after 9 11 we now know that even capturing bin laden before the 9 11 attack would not have changed or achieved anything the <UNK> were in motion with or without that <UNK> <UNK> whose involvement was the possible <UNK> of someone's <UNK> imagination to <UNK> america against a common enemy contrary to popular belief they didn't attack us as ron paul tried to <UNK> it was a case of middle eastern <UNK> they were so sick of america <UNK> their <UNK> feet over there that they brought the war over here so though george w death likes to <UNK> the nonsensical we're fighting them over there so we won't have to fight them over here in reality because we're over there the fight has been brought over here br br the 9 11 attack was not so much about the intricate planning of terrorists as it was the gross <UNK> of the bush administration who we know without the <UNK> of <UNK> had all the <UNK> from the <UNK> administration <UNK> information about terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intent to cause chaos but the oil idiot of texas who refused to read his daily and would rather vacation at his crawford ranch than spend one extra day at work the duty he <UNK> an <UNK> to perform protect the american public br br and then the <UNK> who called himself president used the attacks brought about by his <UNK> as a political hammer against his own <UNK> down <UNK> to score a second term shred the american <UNK> and take america into a fake war on the basis of a lie <UNK> with a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks strangely enough the movie never <UNK> near the <UNK> bush <UNK> offering no opinion or judgment leigh scott wanting to remain neutral tell that to the raped and <UNK> hundreds of thousands in the fake war on terror in iraq br br out of pure coincidence i realized i was watching this dvd while wearing my bush <UNK> thousands died t shirt
<START> i picked this up because having spent time in the <UNK> region of new york i knew a couple of people in the movie and i happened upon it by chance the attempts at comedy are lame the <UNK> girl on girl scene is sickening the plot is nonexistent the acting is among the worst i've ever seen and don't even get me started on special effects i realize this is a very low budget film made by a small independent company but if you're going to do a sci fi horror flick with giant bugs don't make the giant bugs completely unbelievable people want to see giant bugs that's half the fun right there and if you're going to make the giant bugs completely unbelievable at least get the actors to make some sort of tongue in cheek <UNK> to that fact you idiots these aren't them you've captured their stunt <UNK> be prepared to waste two hours of your life that you'll never be able to get back
<START> as i have said before in previous comments some <UNK> are there to be <UNK> so i get somewhat frustrated when <UNK> seem to be expecting a program that will reveal the meaning of life you will not get that from <UNK> and it does not presume to offer it what you get is a girl who was frozen and is brought back to life some 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic she does not settle in within 10 minutes as what happens with other time travelling adventures and neither is she the female equivalent of james bond ready to take on all <UNK> <UNK> is by her new surroundings and frightened by some of the <UNK> on display as most of us would be however it is light entertainment the stories have a beginning a middle and an end in quick time and their are some surprisingly good moments of acting the episode when there is a double of <UNK> is particularly moving and jennifer sky i think gives one of the best performances of someone dying for a long long time and being a film and television buff i know what i am talking about finally to prove my sincerity i have purchased all but four of the episodes and i am entirely satisfied with my purchase the only reason i do not have the complete set is because i purchased the other episodes before <UNK> that there was one complete box set victoria <UNK> and gina <UNK> complete the trio and for light entertainment <UNK> certainly entertained me
<START> movie <UNK> often say great movies must have 3 memorable br br scenes to be considered truly great broadcast news doesn't have br br three it has twice that this movie is extremely well written by br br james brooks holly hunter and albert brooks have never been br br better i love this movie for many reasons it is great because it br br makes you laugh and it makes you cry albert brooks has several br br great lines and many unforgettable scenes 1 laughed i can br br sing and read i am singing while i read with midnight train to br br georgia playing in the background 2 laughed telling the br br william hurt character that you really blew the <UNK> off of <UNK> br br after watching <UNK> report on date rape 3 cried when aaron br br a brooks finally tells <UNK> hunter that he loves her and she br br can't end up with <UNK> character because he represents br br everything about <UNK> <UNK> finds finally 4 laughed who can forget the scene where aaron br br anchors the weekend news hilarious this movie should have won an oscar it has everything i love in br br movies great acting intelligent script and even a jack nicholson br br cameo
<START> yes 2 <UNK> is in some ways a rip off from gus van elephant it's about some students who are dealing with their problems leading to the suicide of one of them yes it's full of clichés but that's life you just can't deny that creepy <UNK> disabled persons or popular students who despite their popularity do have problems are existing in the real world br br but that's not what this film is all about it's not about life in <UNK> it's not about the misery of life itself br br if you look beneath the surface beneath the soap like social relationships that are shown you will find some gripping thought provoking criticism of our society br br why are people committing suicide do we really understand their motives or are we just trying to understand after its already too late and why is it always someone you would never have expected it to be br br this movie doesn't answer this question but it raises it and it does so in a very intense way all the way it keeps you guessing whose blood it might be that you see at the very beginning you are following the paths of some students all of them having a more or less good reason to end their lives just to be forced to watch the gruesome act in the finale br br did you know who it would be or were you caught by surprise like in real life br br the message is by one of the surviving kids in the end we are always so fixed on our own problems we forget to see those of others there might be someone a colleague a friend who does not want to live anymore but if you don't open your eyes you'll never know until its too late br br this movie delivers well it might have some flaws but they don't matter anymore when its over either you see a reflection of society or you are blind for reality
<START> at it's core this is a fairly typical revenge western heavy on the spaghetti and if you follow it as such the protagonist comes through successfully <UNK> the main villain however there's so much going on that has no bearing on the story that you have to wonder what the film makers were thinking about i'm referring to stuff like the way miss singing number just pops up out of nowhere and the boxing match in the middle of town ok they have a loose connection to the influence villain mash has but why all of a sudden does he turn up with an <UNK> mr <UNK> br br on the flip side i thought it was pretty innovative how the camera shot showing the wounded <UNK> view of the trail might have been filmed by someone with an actual bullet in his shoulder and wasn't it great the way girl uses the old headache routine when he gets a little <UNK> don't let me forget either the great stunt work by the <UNK> pit bad guys as <UNK> guns them down as part of the finale br br still there was one thing <UNK> for and i kept waiting the entire movie for it whatever happened to that trio of <UNK> that <UNK> hires near the start of the picture you know the guy <UNK> that a funeral <UNK> wanted to hire for his gun <UNK> the devil's henchman mitchell with the rifle and the knife <UNK> lincoln <UNK> each had a five thousand dollar bounty on his head and they were supposed to protect <UNK> from the guy who survived the massacre of the opening scene they were never heard from again i like to think that maybe <UNK> just had them killed and kept the all for himself
<START> the first time i've seen this dvd i was not only happy because of the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band put out anything but also because the dvd itself is extremely loud jimmy page obviously can't live with quiet music i guess i do must say though that during the concert at royal albert hall they expanded <UNK> many more <UNK> and <UNK> too long other than that it was my favorite song of all time is now on that dvd <UNK> <UNK> it's either that one or <UNK> my time of <UNK> in that song jimmy really plays that thing good ever seen randy play well jimmy plays just like him except his guitar is lower
<START> this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it who cares about the plot or the acting this is an italian horror movie people so you know you can't expect much from the acting or the plot everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn't matter to me the italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie this is one of the <UNK> italian movies you will ever see no gore <UNK> should be without this movie in their horror movie collection buy this movie no matter what it is a dream come true
<START> sublime perfect profound a true lesson on the <UNK> meaning of life we get completely caught up in the life <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> and br br <UNK> their <UNK> desires sacrifices <UNK> long after the movie has ended seeing it years ago as it was gaining a great deal of <UNK> at the <UNK> of its subject matter half the movie being a single dinner the audience was and as some of the <UNK> took their final br br glorious shape laughing at the reaction of the <UNK> as they became totally <UNK> by the pleasures being introduced to them by <UNK> and being totally surprised at the turn of events at the end of the film subsequently seeing the film years later after my own twists and turns of life i realized just how profound the film is on this viewing tears <UNK> <UNK> the film's br br <UNK> on the passage of time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life and love and art and <UNK> is truly something to br br <UNK>
<START> a stunning piece of art you can watch every image of the film and see the beauty in it first i would like to say that i saw the soldiers i understood that it was from here that star wars been inspired the scene were they kill the baby is frightening and when i saw it i did not like it but when the film was end i thought about that scene and i changed my mind and thought that in the world war 2 that was exactly what the did br br the ice battle scene is some of the best war scenes i have seen if not the best they way this film combines music and so superbly stunning visual images is really excellent then the score is one of the most famous sound in history and i thought it was some of the best to br br what more can you say then a work of art <UNK> have created a stunning masterpiece a propaganda film and a beautiful work of art i am very happy because i have just got the <UNK> collection <UNK> set
<START> just a great soundtrack really enjoyable music outstanding cast great lead performance worth watching br br doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood you are left feeling that <UNK> is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood <UNK> br br this movie seems well <UNK> and extremely well crafted i especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like jeffrey wright br br the cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively engaging and <UNK> experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music food drink dancing gambling and sex
<START> tourist trap is among my favorite late 70's early 80's horror flicks a group of young people are heading somewhere one pair in the car ahead that car has a flat and our film opens with the young man woody pushing the tire along looking for a service station he finds a seemingly abandoned place and yet hears voices and <UNK> and ends up with a piece of <UNK> through his stomach for his efforts along comes the rest of the young folks in a <UNK> thing and they pick up <UNK> girlfriend and find this very same place <UNK> or some such thing and then mr happens along while the girls are enjoying a <UNK> in the stream of course the <UNK> thing has mysteriously died at that point so odd mr chuck <UNK> offers his help mr has a museum with lots of wax figures and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house where he says lives and who is why <UNK> he says but if it were <UNK> they'd all probably be <UNK> the girls are left alone while goes to help with <UNK> the car but of course curiosity gets the better of one she goes to investigate and finds the house full of creepy <UNK> and one rather animated one named what follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one they're taken prisoner by who says he's brother one girl kidnapped earlier is treated to a <UNK> facial which results in her death when it covers up her air supply at any rate there's somewhat of a twist to this and kind but weird mr is not exactly what he appears to be a good creepy late 70's horror flick and lots of <UNK> make for a very creepy atmosphere 7 out of 10
<START> i have seen this movie several times it sure is one of the <UNK> action flicks of the eighties so i think many viewers would definitely change the channel when they come across this one but if you are into great trash dragon hunt is made for you the main characters the <UNK> twins are sporting great <UNK> and look so ridiculous in their <UNK> dresses one of the best scenes is when one of then gets shot in the leg and is still kicking his enemies into <UNK> this movie is really awful but then again it is a great party tape
<START> seeing this movie always reminds me of what i remember summer being like god such a long time ago the entire scene involving the overnight from the <UNK> <UNK> to the end of the trip is precious and story about the homicidal maniac is urban legend right out of my youth a highly entertaining movie made many times better by the awful sequels that followed
<START> i have been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they <UNK> from the old series and for further developing the characters and the star trek universe in general even in the <UNK> country i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release however having said that star trek v the final frontier is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew i agree with many that the <UNK> of kirk spock and mccoy is well handled but the overall script the direction by william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode this is a buddy movie and at times almost <UNK> as a star trek movie the action sequences are not <UNK> and therefore build little or no tension the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs both intended and not intended the <UNK> seem thrown in as an <UNK> the whole <UNK> <UNK> concept is just silly and laurence a fine actor in everything else i've ever seen him in <UNK> on the absurd in this movie the scene where <UNK> up images of <UNK> pain and <UNK> pain <UNK> the image of the characters as we've known them spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy trying to save his father is full of insipid redundant dialogue and totally wastes <UNK> acting abilities the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters i understand that shatner didn't have the luxury of working with <UNK> for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight but that doesn't allow for such a bad story in some respects i think this story does fit in with the old series but the movies including star trek the motion picture are all much better quality than this it's a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie the focus on kirk mccoy and spock is nice but way over used the old crew really seems to be out of character i liked the old <UNK> general and the <UNK> in the bar i liked some of the humor and the idea that spock has a half brother but that's about it if this was a tv episode i'd be able to accept a lot of the faults as a movie this is just bad uninspired film making it's a shame too because i want this movie to be good even if it was the level of star trek iii i would be happy but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare
<START> <UNK> years ago the premiere of anna christie advertised by the <UNK> garbo talks the film runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the climax of curiosity greta enters the bar and gets through a long <UNK> transfer from silence into sound a few seconds closing her silent era and at last greta garbo says a historic line <UNK> a <UNK> ginger <UNK> on the side and don't be <UNK> baby br br anna christie 1930 is the movie by clarence brown that introduced a great silent star greta garbo to <UNK> nowadays we can only imagine what serious transfer it was for actors and actresses the careers of many were bound to end something we hardly or not at all see at present and it was no coincidence that it was clarence brown who directed the first <UNK> with the swedish beauty garbo trusted the director after two of his great silent productions flesh and the devil <UNK> and a woman of affairs <UNK> movies that achieved a <UNK> success at the box office both with garbo in the lead br br but we are in 2008 and that fact about the movie now purely historical appears to be of minor importance the question for today's viewer is not what <UNK> voice sounds like but if the movie is still watchable after these <UNK> years in other words we all <UNK> to answer the question if the movie has stood a test of time has it br br when i recently watched it i came into conclusion that except for some minor technical aspects including static camera anna christie is still very entertaining it's on the one hand a wonderful story of a life of a reality that the young woman faces being based on eugene o <UNK> play and on the other hand an artistic <UNK> of true <UNK> in the field of direction and acting let me analyze these two aspects in separate <UNK> br br content chris <UNK> george f marion a heavy <UNK> lives a life of a sailor on a <UNK> although his days are filled with <UNK> he is <UNK> by a letter from his daughter anna garbo whom he hasn't seen for 15 years she says that she will come back to him he starts to change everything for better however forgets that his daughter is no longer a child lacking experience but a 23 year old woman who has got through various sorts of things on a farm in where she lived and worked moreover he forgets that she has a right to accept another kind of male love in her life this brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main character but the one which is introduced to us sooner than anna her father chris makes you realize how universal it is simply no letter from the whole text that life appears to be has been <UNK> after all these years cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid br br performances there are not many characters in the movie but there are two that really shine in the roles it is of course greta garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her 15 year long phenomenon the presence that strongly marked the history of early cinema something i have already discussed in many of my earlier comments on her films but here garbo is slightly different i admit that there are moments in this movie when she does not feel very comfortable with her role that seems to be caused by her new experience with sound in english however her performance is as always genuine and unique but that is what everyone has expected from garbo the true surprise of the movie for the 1930 viewers and also for us is marie <UNK> as <UNK> she is excellent in her facial expressions in her accent in the entire portrayal of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of hitting the bottle her best moments include the conversation with anna christie in the bar <UNK> by her hilarious talk with chris the rest of the supporting cast are fine yet not great whatsoever here the german version makes up for it particularly <UNK> except for garbo herself <UNK> an absolutely flawless choice br br if you asked me what i like about anna christie nowadays that's what i would tell you it's a classic movie however there is one more thing that i must mention at the end it is humor wonderful wit that is noticeable throughout although the content is quite serious and anna christie in no way carries a comedian spirit the only <UNK> comedy was <UNK> there are such moments when you will split your sides don't skip for instance anna and <UNK> visit in the fun park particularly at the restaurant where he orders milk for her thinking how <UNK> and innocent she is beer for himself and where suddenly <UNK> joins them by chance br br anna christie is a perfect movie for classic buffs and a must see for all at least a bit interested in the true <UNK> of performance if you are fed up with many of those modern <UNK> seek such movies out and you shall be satisfied very worth your search br br <UNK> greta garbo <UNK> marie <UNK> let us drink a <UNK> to the great jobs you did in the movie <UNK> after all these years when wine tastes much better and your spirits are with us in a different sense
<START> this is by far one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time top 20 of my lifetime i laughed more than i have since <UNK> guide to the galaxy and cried more than i have since i saw the <UNK> if you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge this is the one it is real and powerful see it and you won't regret it i was reluctant at first and i only watched it because i had to do a school project about speech <UNK> but this movie is so much more than that it is about life free and independent from the way the world would have you held down its about the <UNK> that each of us have that keep us from see ourselves and what we miss but letting everything else get in the way
<START> i just finished reading <UNK> novel i thought it was one of the most in depth detailed and page turning books i ever read definitely in my top 10 i acquired a dvd version of the book starring mr <UNK> ok let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel into 2 5 hours film time would of been impossible so i understand the teams reason to <UNK> from the book version and <UNK> however when i say <UNK> what i really should say is take the characters from the book add a few leave a few out take away the <UNK> plot add a modern new plot add <UNK> <UNK> name in there somewhere im not saying this was a bad picture far from it some of the effects were top notch and the acting wasn't half bad the story sucked and didn't rely on logic or reality <UNK> novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality instead of <UNK> them this could of been so much more if it had taken its time and been made into say a 10 part series if you haven't read the book then expect a decent tv movie with a good acting cast if you have read the book then try and forget it when watching this
<START> for the record i hate spoof movies except for mel brooks and airplane because those are classics and make fun of the clichés not the actual movies itself i think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film i especially hate things created by jason <UNK> and aaron <UNK> the geniuses behind date movie epic movie and meet the <UNK> br br i decided to give the <UNK> a look since <UNK> and <UNK> had nothing to do with the production i was as objective as possible it was just like one of their movies it was basically every sports movie rolled into one with lame <UNK> jokes and disturbing images of <UNK> injury that's supposed to make me laugh and failed br br only someone high would laugh at these jokes toilet bowl who wrote this an 11 year old i was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of wedding <UNK> which was actually pretty decent but there attempt at the spoof genre was about as funny as a burning <UNK> the only reason that i gave this two stars when it clearly deserved one was because <UNK> <UNK> had nothing to do with this
<START> apart from being a clever and well <UNK> variation on the nowadays hugely popular horror genre and a splendid formula to attract potential new fans in general i always somewhat considered supernatural as a <UNK> giant homage towards the genre through the decades although not always noticeable to younger viewers and or people who only have an interest in more recent horror films each and every single episode contains a few obvious and <UNK> references towards classic and influential titles from that point of view it was only a matter of time before the writers would pay tribute to the vehicle without a <UNK> type of films and even more specifically the 70's <UNK> duel steven spielberg's acclaimed debut and the car being an avid fan of these two films i enjoyed route <UNK> a lot even in spite of its flaws and shortcomings the episode opens tense and <UNK> on a remote road where a black man is hunted down and eventually killed by a menacing monster truck with seemingly no driver behind the wheel the <UNK> daughter cassie happens to be <UNK> ex girlfriend and she calls the winchester brothers in for help the brothers can't prevent two more similar <UNK> before discovering the ghost truck sudden presence relates all the way back to a racial <UNK> of the 60's involving both of <UNK> parents as well as several more prominent inhabitants of the little town some of my fellow reviewers around here tend to label route <UNK> as one of the weaker entries in season one mainly because the script is too preachy regarding racial issues and shows a different and more emotional side of <UNK> character he's usually the strong silent type whereas here he's confronted with unfinished romantic affairs from the past here to a certain level i agree with the racism debate but it didn't bother me that much really the writers eventually had to give an explanation to the presence of the ghost truck and racial conflict is an acceptable one as far as i'm concerned concerning <UNK> emotional vulnerability i can only state it's admirable to see how the writers continuously attempt to provide depth and detail to the main characters <UNK> behavior towards cassie <UNK> a whole new light on him in fact besides what really counts in this episode is the <UNK> sinister truck and its <UNK> attacks it's an impressive and <UNK> vehicle producing <UNK> lights and grisly engine noises in case you <UNK> the brilliant aforementioned duel you will definitely find some amusement in the compelling chase sequences depicted in route <UNK>
<START> master of italian horror <UNK> <UNK> is called a lot of bad things by non fans and is deserving of absolutely none of the <UNK> in fact every time i hear something bad about <UNK> i think they're really talking about <UNK> he just doesn't get the same amount of attention because his films were never as successful in theaters in fact his best film <UNK> cemetery man was probably his least successful or just didn't get the attention he felt it deserved because after that he left film and went into directing television he's never gone back so people really don't know how inferior his other films are because by the time they've seen them they're already fans of the italian horror aesthetic which means you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and are usually very unattractive films this is where the church stands out from the pack because visually it's so cheap and ancient looking you can smell the dust but it has its' charms too though they are few the camera work is truly <UNK> and the music score is hugely elaborate and grand br br since <UNK> is the reasons people have seen <UNK> work all i don't know anyone who caught the church before <UNK> <UNK> and deep red is a bit of a hack sort of like an italian mick <UNK> the <UNK> example of a director <UNK> style over substance the flaws of the church are constant and plenty the film opens with a somewhat interesting prologue showing knights on white horses <UNK> through a <UNK> village akin to those you see in any robin hood adaptation in some long ago century these scenes are intense enough energetic and get quickly to the point then we cut to the present where the film's style takes over yeah the movie is okay to look at and for about 35 or so minutes in the present 1980's wherever italy the movie is just interesting enough to get us to the slowly revealing horror elements so now we know the purpose of the film is the build up of it's horror and it's a decent build up for the most part but as the movie approaches the halfway point we realize the movie's driving by and nothing is happening br br the plot is very simple i think two people working in a church one as a of books and the other as a of the <UNK> wall artwork discover a <UNK> <UNK> that the man thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or priceless <UNK> that he can sell and get rich off of so he follows his only to <UNK> a force underneath the church that has him while he's slowly becoming a demon who will make everyone else so while he is doing his demon work someone he passed the force onto kills himself in a manner that traps everyone in the church while the demon <UNK> onto everyone leaving a black preacher and the little girl who <UNK> out of the church every night to go <UNK> as the only 2 people who can stop the plague from <UNK> beyond the church walls that probably sounds action packed and <UNK> style is far more <UNK> than <UNK> but never before have i seen an attempted <UNK> film this <UNK> boring i kid you not absolutely nothing happens in the entire film i've seen <UNK> or <UNK> i'm no film school super <UNK> films before but most of them actually show things happening john carpenter's halloween for one br br it follows pretty closely in the footsteps of <UNK> <UNK> demons films since <UNK> co produced we're shown to a location where a bunch of people gather one turns into a demon all the others are isolated that person <UNK> everyone except a couple survivors then the demons either get out <UNK> the world or the survivors get out when the demons die this film puts all those same elements in place except unlike <UNK> work nothing happens okay a few things do happen but only one bizarre sequence has the <UNK> of much more fun demons films a random woman's neck is <UNK> by a demon using a section of fence he rips out of the floor what's bizarre about that you wonder it happens in front of about two dozen people what do they do nothing she dies her head blood in <UNK> but all those people don't even notice though it happens in plain view and no less than 8 feet away from them maybe 4 people notice the demon running up to stab anyone he can as he runs toward her so they duck out of the way she's killed and in the shot after she dies everyone is just sitting around being quiet while a boy plays a <UNK> i kid you not that's what happens that's more than <UNK> incoherent it's plain stupid br br the scene is suggesting that the woman just sort of disappears and no one saw her death they all just up and forget about it and this 15 second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the movie i'm not saying it's the only violence gore or murder we see it's not it's just the only thing we can tell is happening for example in one scene a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror looking old and ugly she starts <UNK> the skin on her face off but when she <UNK> minutes later no <UNK> people are <UNK> by fish and their faces are <UNK> by subway cars but later they turn up as totally <UNK> members of a possessed cult in a scene that commits the ultimate horror <UNK> <UNK> a famous scene from roman <UNK> 1968 masterpiece rosemary's baby the greatest horror film ever made shot for shot even if <UNK> did that i would be furious
<START> i am not a <UNK> fan which is considered <UNK> especially since i grew up near the author's hometown however i think this is an excellent movie on par with the quality of the movie to kill a mocking bird if you haven't seen it buy it anyway it's well worth having in your permanent collection tcm recently played the movie as a part of the race on film series i wish they'd play it more often very moving br br on a side note the folks from <UNK> <UNK> will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the 1940's the <UNK> city hall etc they're all on screen i never knew the movie was filmed there until i noticed the <UNK> of the buildings when i saw the arch in the front of city hall i began to get suspicious look closely at the on <UNK> wall you'll see two for <UNK> miss
<START> i understood before watching this film that it would be a low budget gore film but even by those low standards this film doesn't cut it br br the problem isn't so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting writing directing sound music and editing i expected all of that to be bad and it is br br the biggest problem with this film is that it didn't even do a good job on the guts and gore most of the <UNK> takes place off screen and all we get to see are the after effects which look very fake even by the standards of low budget gore films br br there really is no excuse for the gore being so poorly done peter jackson made the equally low budget <UNK> <UNK> at about the same time and he somehow was able to make much more convincing guts and gore than was shown in this film br br a failure on just about every level i can't recommend this film to anybody steer clear of it br br br br
<START> this is so bad i don't know where to begin br br the lead role is a good starting point it is a supreme mary sue character that has few things in common with the original one from the book who was a bit more credible no this one is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and insipid even beyond the standards that this chicks with swords era that our <UNK> are spinning out of late she is a twenty something top model thin as a match yet rich already a leader in her academic field a kung fu master a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally <UNK> anyone official like <UNK> fbi agents she is god br br to balance it out she is supposed to be socially awkward due to her typically harsh upbringing that transformed her into a spock which gives us some delighted moments where she wonders what is star wars or american idol but yet when it's really important she can conveniently reveal herself as a top <UNK> and <UNK> because she is so superior ya know to top it out she is played by a wooden actress br br the more talented <UNK> serves as a <UNK> token for this <UNK> acting as a bumbling comic relief and house watson in fact everything in there is a pop parody of better works like sherlock holmes <UNK> and x files from which it tries to <UNK> the sexual tension between main protagonists it is however cheaper as this is delivered with all the subtlety of an <UNK> poke in the <UNK> but a million million poor factory girls will <UNK> buy into it hence the crazy rating this turkey gets br br in fact the lowest common <UNK> goes a long way in this sad puppy resulting in <UNK> sex details from the legion of <UNK> that aim to pass it out as daring and trendy while the overall tone of the show carries an obvious neo conservative view on things br br story wise there's not much here to feast upon as crimes that always start out with some gruesome remains are resolved using non existent technology while the lovable but so wrong the women less than the guys goes on varied theories all of them <UNK> as the main character has it all from the start and once it is established she goes out and then punch the guy typically a real tough <UNK> with a spin kick here and a <UNK> there the end
<START> if you take the films mad max beyond <UNK> and the movie steel dawn with patrick <UNK> you will have a pretty good idea what the film is about the only problems is that the film lacks the production values of either and represent mainly cheap copy of the former two true the film has plenty of action but asks the viewer to suspend belief no one can shoot a 50 caliber machine gun by holding it in his hand and miss everything to boot nor can you shoot at a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss the whole bunch there is also a problem with poor editing when the school bus <UNK> over it is easy enough to see the cannon used to do the job and the lady driving the truck through it is superfluous since she had more than enough time to stop the truck if you are interested only in mindless action and violence then the movie is easy enough to watch but don't expect anything on <UNK> with <UNK> or even the somewhat cheap and tacky steel dawn
<START> by many accounts <UNK> <UNK> was not a very nice guy he <UNK> on dealers <UNK> people he <UNK> money to and was <UNK> abusive br br many filmmakers might choose to the man making him into some sports hero that would triumph despite <UNK> but high roller doesn't do that and that's a tough row to <UNK> br br instead we have to look very closely to see a man that never <UNK> passed the frightened little boy from the streets of new york despite all his <UNK> and the only real <UNK> he ever gets is from death himself very brave because people won't get it and very touching when you do br br what is also brave is the use of a scorsese feel <UNK> how derivative people will say really but there's virtually no violence and loved gangster movies maybe the feel reflects the man <UNK> and not the director marty and if it really is a low budget film and looks that good bravo br br finally the linear flashback structure wow will that get <UNK> yet not only does it work it works exceptionally well even for those who don't see the connection to the seventh seal proof in ss knight plays game of chess with death in <UNK> says we can play a hand of cards for ya know death says never much good at cards damn great last line br br no <UNK> effects or camera moves no shaky camera nothing trendy at all just solid tight storytelling br br maybe that makes the movie too basic and somehow flawed but then again so was the guy and that makes it just about right br br 9 10
<START> blue planet wow where do i begin the years of hard work paid off in what is without question one of the best documentaries ever created br br the sights and sounds presented in blue planet like most documentaries with the attenborough <UNK> are rare and haven't even experienced by most people that alone should be enough reason to buy this series especially if you're the curious type who <UNK> to <UNK> br br blue planet is not a perfect documentary however it does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode how many ways can different sea creatures swim kill poo mate and lay eggs and do all of these ways really need to be explored but if you have a deep interest in sea life this <UNK> shouldn't become a problem for you at all
<START> i'll put it straight to you this movie is dead boring it's about a <UNK> that's it blah blah a little about family blah blah blah politics blah blah blah boring br br blame it all on the <UNK> poor <UNK> the deputy prime minister campbell is a hard ass that expects everyone to be <UNK> a most irritating character br br if you are from the united kingdom or anywhere that it may <UNK> then you might like this film it's sort of like <UNK> movies are most appreciated where <UNK> happen br br this is not really an action film where the weather is the enemy and you must <UNK> or <UNK> it literally it is more like a time bomb that must be disabled br br looking at this movie it is understandable why the uk thinks the world is <UNK> it isn't but for them it is br br really the movie is about as exciting as picking and i can't recommend it it's over 100 minutes far far too long br br the problems with the film i won't get into them beyond this because the film doesn't deserve such <UNK> hint to you buy more <UNK> if you bring children to this movie they'll either fall asleep or become <UNK> bored screaming demons
<START> i doubt if the real story of the development of western union would ever have gained a real audience instead of talking about the building of the <UNK> system out west it was the story of board rooms dominated by one of the most interesting and disliked of the great <UNK> jay <UNK> <UNK> picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant and part of his attempt at a national <UNK> system to rival but this while interesting is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the <UNK> lines themselves at least that is how audiences would see it jay <UNK> died in <UNK> had he lived into the modern era and invested in hollywood he probably would have agreed to that <UNK> too br br the film deals with how the laying of the <UNK> system is <UNK> by indians <UNK> on by one jack <UNK> barton <UNK> a <UNK> is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a <UNK> in his abilities to <UNK> the police in the <UNK> he is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the <UNK> <UNK> edward dean jagger associate richard blake robert young and a quasi <UNK> vance shaw randolph scott who is brother blake an with little understanding of the west is <UNK> sister sue virginia <UNK> but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings but he does become a close friend of shaw especially in trying to confront <UNK> br br <UNK> was a real western criminal by the way and the subject of a section of mark <UNK> <UNK> it he was <UNK> in the <UNK> but he did not have any involvement in stirring up indians against <UNK> or <UNK> companies however makes him a <UNK> evil and totally vicious type his killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance but lang is responsible for that as well as other touches look at the sequence with chill <UNK> where he is on a <UNK> pole <UNK> it he <UNK> <UNK> juice several times while talking to young who gets a little <UNK> then there is an indian attack which we watch from the ground level at the conclusion young suddenly gets <UNK> again but it's not brown but red that covers him he looks up at the top and there is <UNK> with an indian arrow through him br br it is an exciting film to watch and well worth catching
<START> there i was on vacation when my host suggested we take in this b movie festival in <UNK> i was <UNK> as i hadn't gone on the trip to sit in a movie theater but i've got to admit that i don't regret a second of this one especially with stephen contribution it probably helped that i had no idea what to expect br br sea of dust starts out like a typical costume drama we've got a young medical student going to help a doctor whose town is being destroyed by a crazy plague which somehow involves exploding heads on the way he stops to visit his fiancé and gets thrown off the property by her father traveling on he finds a girl lying on the road another plague victim and takes her along to the doctor's yawn i thought it all seemed pretty <UNK> br br and then everything went crazy and it suddenly turned into a completely different film tom <UNK> shows up looking like dracula characters begin traveling to the other side of reality and the dialog gets increasingly humorous br br and just when i thought it had settled into a groove the picture changes again becoming really dark and bizarre i won't spoil it for first time viewers but there's an amazing sequence about hollow people lots of chat about the abuse of religion by society and some over the top gore effects and did i mention stephen this isn't a perfect movie in case you haven't figured that out from its appearance at a b movie festival but it's well worth the time for adventurous viewers great visuals cool soundtrack lots of interesting ideas the acting is a little zany at times but i think that's the point br br funny i had to go to <UNK> to see find an american picture that looked like a british horror movie you figure that one out
<START> spoilers buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business not being able to dig him out from under them undertaker <UNK> <UNK> tony lo <UNK> came up with a plan to make a load of cash with the help of his two crooked pals moon bo richard lynch bill <UNK> br br <UNK> getting close with his <UNK> friend buddy <UNK> roy <UNK> as a mob informer to win over <UNK> trust and have him tell <UNK> what's coming down on the streets of new york in regard to mob activities buddy is a cop who works in a sub <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> the seven ups that does things their way to clean up the streets of new york of criminals br br <UNK> gets information from buddy and makes it look to buddy that he's really giving him <UNK> about the mob and what it's up too and uses that information to tip off his <UNK> associates moon bo to rip the <UNK> off of their weekly take as well as kidnap top mob <UNK> sharks and hold them for <UNK> br br everything is going well for <UNK> co until the mob decides to <UNK> and <UNK> grabs beats and kidnaps a member of the seven ups ken <UNK> who was working undercover thinking he was one of the <UNK> who was kidnapping and ripping them off later was accidentally killed by moon when he <UNK> out the <UNK> of the car that was locked in thinking that there was a <UNK> full or cash <UNK> in it br br fast pace and exciting movie with that gritty and <UNK> photography of new york city that was so effective in the movie the french connection which also stars both roy <UNK> tony lo <UNK> who are in this movie too incredible car chase that started in downtown brooklyn and ended up in the <UNK> of new jersey some 15 to 20 miles away with buddy almost ending up decapitated for his heroic efforts br br roy <UNK> who is not a big man is as tough and effective as any big action actor i can think off like clint eastwood would have been in the same movie <UNK> reminds me a lot of he even looks a bit like him former and champion gene who beat the great sugar ray robinson for the championship back in 1957 and acts like him too in the movie tough <UNK> and destructive br br tony lo <UNK> is very good as <UNK> the undertaker the <UNK> <UNK> who plays off buddy and the mob to the point that leads to <UNK> partner getting killed even though he's trash you can't in a way not help feeling sorry for <UNK> since he only wants the money he gets from the ripped <UNK> <UNK> to pay his sick wife's <UNK> hospital and medical bills even the fact that was killed due to his actions <UNK> never wanted anybody to get hurt but like they say when you play with fire you end up getting burned in the end <UNK> have a lot of explaining to do to the not so sympathetic and caring <UNK> br br the movie the seven ups has the late bill <UNK> doing the dangerous stunts with the car chases as well as act in the film <UNK> was also the stunt man in both great movies that had him doing the driving on the roads streets and <UNK> of new york city and san francisco the french connection and <UNK>
<START> although i'm not too much of a religious person i still had relatively high hopes for this movie as it does have the amazing steve <UNK> and its prequel bruce almighty was actually a creative and clever christian themed comedy however <UNK> almighty comes nowhere near this originality and <UNK> that the original has and can't decide whether it's a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values if it had chosen one clear path of which of these themes to focus on it could have lived up to its potential but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor cheesy dialogue and <UNK> that attempt to give the movie <UNK> but instead practically insults the intelligence of the audience and also a very confused and <UNK> presentation of the movie's <UNK> message it was very obvious that <UNK> almighty was very poorly written there are numerous plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense for example although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the planet <UNK> to <UNK> as he builds the <UNK> for their salvation from the <UNK> is their inclusion really necessary when the only <UNK> that happens in the movie is downtown washington d c and a suburban neighborhood meaning they are at no risk of being wiped out the filmmakers it seems lacked the originality to <UNK> the bible story whatsoever and instead just had it take place in a present time without changing anything to the plot leaving many elements that just don't add up such as this and make it obvious of the idiotic <UNK> and writing within the movie overall this work is tragic in that the acting talent of steve <UNK> and <UNK> sykes isn't <UNK> because of the bland characters they portray and that it was so poorly written that it <UNK> and <UNK> many of the film's attempted themes and makes a mockery of the first film finally <UNK> almighty also is an insult to the brilliant actors in it and any halfway intelligent <UNK> in that it fails both of them miserably
<START> even not being a fan of the star trek movies or universe of shows and books and such i still find some enjoyment in some of the movies featuring the old cast and in the case of first contact even the new cast a bit this one though was kind of sad to watch it seemed to want to be so much but it failed on so many levels to be one of the worst star trek movies the plot is very far fetched seeming to want to combine three or four stories into one ultimate trek adventure but it ends up an unfunny when it tries to be not tense when it wants to be and not action packed like it tries to be mess of inconsistencies the whole movie to take a phrase from spock is illogical the effects are nothing special as i have seen episodes of next generation that are just as good which is to say it is fine for a television show but not a major motion picture the plot is laughable as the gang at first tries to stop <UNK> brother then joins him on his quest to find god yes you read that correctly the <UNK> make a tacked on appearance which actually will set up the much better <UNK> country movie all in all you know it is bad when the best part of the film is kirk bones and spock singing row your boat well spock was not really singing but rather questioning the lyrics
<START> kramer vs kramer is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son the husband now has to take up the <UNK> of taking care of the boy as he does they get to know each other better but then the mother and wife returns and she wants custody of the boy kramer vs kramer has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure dustin hoffman won his first best actor oscar for his brilliant performance here most people say his performance in <UNK> which won him his second oscar is his best he was great in that film but i disagree that its his best in my opinion the best performance of <UNK> career is in this movie scene after scene shows us why hoffman is one of the best american actors working today he's also funny at times also giving a terrific performance is meryl streep who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today streep like hoffman also won her first oscar for best supporting actress for her work in kramer vs kramer as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family justin henry who was only 8 years old when the film came out is wonderful as hoffman and <UNK> son he won an oscar nomination for his role here and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an oscar nomination in a <UNK> category best supporting actor jane alexander is also fine as a family friend she too got an oscar nomination for supporting actress where she lost to co star streep kramer vs kramer is a great film from start to finish writer director robert <UNK> has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable br br out of four
<START> at least for me i have been following the career of mr since the beginning and i was not crazy about this film i think penelope <UNK> was miscast the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good she makes the character unbelievable also the singing scene was just weird i do not get the point and the lip sync was awful br br as <UNK> another thing that drove me nuts are the accents why people coming from the same place have such a different accent the difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense and the village are we in 2007 or 1950 i found myself trying to explain to my american husband that many of the things in the movie are old school things are not like that anymore br br i was expecting more but this time mr <UNK> did not deliver at least for me i am not saying that miss <UNK> does a bad job i am saying that she does not belong there not portraying that character
<START> it's quite revealing to see this today and appreciate how far we've come along in what we expect from movies and at the same time appreciate how many notions were established br br here we have a full <UNK> narrative talking film the audio and the visuals are pushed to their period limits the framing is limited to about belt high and up no face close ups br br the compositions are remarkable there's an early over the shoulder cross cutting scene to showcase the dialogue there's a <UNK> descent into a canyon with some harrowing perspective angles a sun <UNK> <UNK> lies in the dust as the <UNK> and legs march in the upper portion of the frame the tension in the showdown between the hero and the bad guy is visually captured by filming above the long <UNK> of a large tree that lies between them and on and on early visual treats abound br br today it's unsettling to see the young wayne carry a film <UNK> by ego or mannerisms br br i have to wonder if walsh recognized the self reference the subject is the journey of a <UNK> group of <UNK> those who appear on screen are a <UNK> group of stage actors vaudeville comedians shell game artists and probably <UNK> <UNK> and ten in one show veterans they all journey together to <UNK> a trail for how movies would be made br br this is worth at least one viewing to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later movies
<START> as a spanish tourist in los angeles and a fanatic movie lover i committed a terrible mistake i went to see the women the remake of one of my all time favorites i've seen the original many many times in fact i own it my <UNK> to see the remake was based on diane english the woman responsible for murphy brown my though was how bad can it be she must know what she's doing well i don't know what to say i don't understand what happened the <UNK> women is a rather depressing affair meg ryan or whoever played mary she looked a bit like a grotesque version of meg ryan another actress perhaps wearing a meg ryan mask she doesn't bring to the character nothing of what norma <UNK> did in 1939 the new one is a tired unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce the friends <UNK> <UNK> debra messing <UNK> smith are as <UNK> as anything i've ever seen and if this wasn't enough eva <UNK> as crystal the character created by joan crawford in one of her best and funniest performances eva casting is really the poster sign for how wrong how ill conceived this commercial attempt turned up i didn't give it a 1 out respect for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> soul plane supposed to be a black comedy spoof of a much well known movie airplane this movie is black comedy done at it's worst stereotypes can be funny and a lot of times they are but in this picture it's disgusting okay you have <UNK> sex drugs everything crude that people associate with urban culture today br br tom <UNK> appearance in this movie is this movie's saving grace if it ever had any should have never accepted the script kevin hart makes a poor leading figure here his appearance in this movie will probably grow annoying to many method man and <UNK> appearance were by far their worst br br i am just happy that i didn't pay to see this movie
<START> this little <UNK> is notable only because it is the worst film <UNK> and <UNK> ever made it is dreadful in every way crummy music horrid choreography check out the awkward lead male dancer cheesy special effects and sets wooden actors the leads are barely at the high school level in their profession and were <UNK> of later and a script without a single laugh better times were ahead for the comedy duo <UNK> and <UNK> meet captain <UNK> is much <UNK> as is the television series which at times was inspired but skip this one
<START> i mean really really really high and this movie has a shot at entertainment i don't mean regular high i mean the high where reading the would have you in <UNK> otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more <UNK> with it like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence a complete waste of talent in some cases <UNK> mac john c <UNK> tom kenny and the master of <UNK> shatner and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make the <UNK> of <UNK> who insist on making movies not without it's laughs again chemical aid is crucial and certainly not without <UNK> the politically over sensitive which i'm always in favor of but ultimately not worth the time out of your life
<START> i love horror films but i think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind the devil's <UNK> the exorcist for example this is that kind of film and it's not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be it is also really beautiful a tale of two sisters starts really slow so if you're in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes you will be disappointed actually this is not a ghost story there are some it's something more complex and it's done in such a way that it beats <UNK> and the grudge out of the ring no sweat a is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits because it really cares for its characters and the direction is flawless every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you're the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie the acting is superb specially from the stepmother and the main girl those two are worth the price of the ticket alone do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film
<START> apparently in early 2005 scifi channel threatened to release the <UNK> photos they have of john rhys davies and said we need you to star in another scifi original the scary thing is he's actually pretty damn good in this movie that's really saying something since this is a silly scifi creature feature you've gotta put some feeling into it in order to be well acted unfortunately nobody else does it's your stereotypical run amok movie on a cruise ship the wants to keep the creature alive the navy <UNK> think they have everything under control but they don't know what they're dealing with and they all end up dead a girl jumps into the movie <UNK> role as rhys <UNK> daughter and the creature about 100 or so <UNK> what this movie has going for it is it's very fast paced and lively you're never bored or waiting for another kill other than that though it does nothing to <UNK> itself and it's silly that this thing <UNK> all over the <UNK> and can't be wounded by navy seal machine guns but can be karate kicked into <UNK> by rhys <UNK> daughter kinda went back and forth on giving this bad boy a 5 but for the above silliness i'm giving it a 4
<START> audio br br seriously i've never seen a movie with worse audio there are scenes where people are walking through the grass and you can hardly hear them over their footsteps they must be their feet br br you know how in some movies they forget a line so they have to dub it in on a shot of the back of someone's head here the <UNK> were not that clever there is actually a scene where shannon character says her line without moving her lips at all br br i'm pretty sure for their background sound they played effects <UNK> live while shooting because in a lot of scenes the sound effects will either be different or be absent whenever the camera changes angles br br i could write a lot more on how bad the audio is in this movie br br other <UNK> br br in this movie they probably consider the opening credits to be special effects because they seemed so challenging to produce the main title and the first few names in the opening credits are in white text over a white sky and they <UNK> as if they were carefully hand painted on each frame br br the <UNK> of extras in this movie is incredible there are about 15 rebels in the cast and yet in any given battle thirty or more of them will be killed if only the film were high enough quality to <UNK> which ones were dying over and over br br it's also interesting to note that the rebels are usually killed by explosions that are always between 30 and 200 feet away there is one scene one scene when some of the rebels are running out of their <UNK> in the rebel base and one <UNK> shakes as the rebel <UNK> the door it makes you wonder if the <UNK> will last long enough to encounter the inevitable explosion br br there is a blue helicopter that looks as menacing as a pair of running shorts but somehow is <UNK> with an <UNK> supply of <UNK> when they show the <UNK> being shot out of the missile <UNK> the often shoot of in unpredictable directions very closely resembling large bottle rockets they still manage to hit their targets with ease which as noted above is always a very safe distance away from the rebels they kill note the recycled footage of the pilot <UNK> the live button to fire the <UNK> because it's <UNK> <UNK> the first few times we saw it we read it as the evil button br br notice how the <UNK> <UNK> they use produces identical explosions to those that are created by the helicopter <UNK> it's also fun in many scenes how the actor in the <UNK> is shooting in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers that he is killing and frequently characters shoot a <UNK> number of bullets to the soldiers who are killed like when a short burst fire kills a large group of enemies br br yes this movie is very very very bad the plot was thought out almost as well as a 5 year <UNK> soccer game and the editing is the worst i've ever seen but honestly sometimes it's fun spend 90 minutes laughing at a group of adults who sincerely took part in such a terrible movie
<START> i recently saw house of wax and must say i really enjoyed it br br it's been one of the better horror thriller films in the past few years if not one of the best and most entertaining br br i've heard a lot of people bashing the so called slow start and character development which takes up the films opening 45 minutes br br yet if the film <UNK> straight into the deaths audiences and critics would have <UNK> the film for not having decent characters who they couldn't care less about br br well as for the character development i think it worked amazingly well br br taking into my own response and others from reading <UNK> off the message board a lot of people ended up wanting the characters to live one of which i've noticed many people mentioning being <UNK> <UNK> paris hilton taking into consideration warner bros have been marketing her death its a surprise turn around that many audiences ended up cheering her on for survival br br speaking of the chase death scenes they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful i've witnessed in a while and enjoyed each one very much br br the acting in the film was absolutely fine i couldn't fault any of them especially paris hilton i thought she was very decent and i was hoping for her the get more than a mere 25 minutes screen time in a <UNK> minute film yet her chase scene made up for that and believe me when i say paris can act scared watch the scene where she's hiding in a car from vincent and he walks past her the look of terror on her face comes across as very real br br overall i give house of wax maximum stars for entertainment value and suspense and even gore only criticism is i wish that during the marketing for the film they hadn't revealed the death list and who dies and who survives as it would have been ten times better not knowing if the character being chased was going to live or die and horrible death br br can't wait for the dvd but go see it at the cinema while you can it won't be the same in your own front room yet if you do wait for the dvd watch the film in the dark with no <UNK> trust me you wont be disappointed
<START> very curious that <UNK> and hanks would team up for this obviously they believe it strange because it should carry the title charlie <UNK> war the lie br br how could the time frame leave out the real history that while <UNK> <UNK> of the russians the cia was providing support for the <UNK> and today's world of terrorism in 1990 bin laden went home to <UNK> <UNK> as a hero of <UNK> who along with his arab legion had brought down the mighty <UNK> of the soviet union in afghanistan br br to avoid any connection to <UNK> bin laden is to say again hollywood cares little for historical truth charlie wilson a <UNK> hardly more like a <UNK> gone amok
<START> i walked out of the cinema having suffered this film after 30 mins i left two friends <UNK> in by a great fat bloke to endure the remainder br br as soon as the opening sequence of the film <UNK> i <UNK> something was wrong and it wasn't long before i to stop myself from hiding under my seat cringing in embarrassment i'm not one for walking out of films however bad as they usually have some redeeming feature but this one suffered from a <UNK> of bad directing bad acting bar character the impeccable jean <UNK> according to my friends awful editing in terms of theme and meaning terrible soundtrack and image <UNK> that seemed to make an art out placing the wrong peace of music over the image and scene at the wrong time the worst crime was its overall <UNK> and <UNK> a result of the aforementioned atrocities why was it so awful i do not want to waste more of my time explaining i'd say go and see it for yourself but i don't want to fill the <UNK> of this project any more than necessary oh the screening did possess one redeeming feature my friend over the <UNK> of seats in <UNK> with his <UNK> hooked over his arm as he tried to steady himself more pathos tension entertainment in those few moments than in the <UNK> mins of this sadly dire effort
<START> the relationship between the lone ranger and <UNK> was always good for a <UNK> but to take the joke out of the joke by building a movie around the gay appeal of the legend oh the horror the horror br br
<START> a trite fish out of water story about two friends from the <UNK> who move to the big city to seek their fortune they become playboy <UNK> and nothing particularly surprising happens after that the final 15 minutes are especially cheesy but at least the <UNK> looked good
<START> what is about <UNK> geniuses that get the critics <UNK> flowing a beautiful mind <UNK> t up to much in my opinion <UNK> of the ring deserved the oscar that year while good will hunting had several awards <UNK> on it <UNK> br br first off is the script when i attended film school i was told good will hunting is a very good example on how not to start a script and the <UNK> was right this movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it s very very slow if you wrote an <UNK> script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15 br br structure aside the idea of a member of the american <UNK> being some sort of intellectual god <UNK> t really ring true ask yourself this if he s the character in the movie how come he s gone through his short life without anyone <UNK> his abilities not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift highly unlikely as is the fact he s read so much mind <UNK> and if will s so clever how come he s so of what happens to young good looking boys in american <UNK> br br but it s the casting that let much of the film down you want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough irish gang members let s get matt damon and ben affleck which is like getting russell <UNK> to play a <UNK> or charles bronson to play a liberal do <UNK> i failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed damon and affleck as they about <UNK> people in the chops and <UNK> t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors after all billy bob <UNK> has written screenplays for films he <UNK> t been cast in and the same <UNK> should have been applied here br br there are some good points to the movie robin williams is excellent as the man who tries to show will his potential and also very good is <UNK> who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as williams character explains to will what he has seen in life br br but i <UNK> got to repeat that there s less plus points than <UNK> to this movie and i <UNK> got to agree with the people who <UNK> said good will hunting is boring and unconvincing
<START> it is unsettling seeing so many people giving outrageously high ratings to this film some of the praise uses such twisted reasoning and transparent <UNK> that <UNK> a simple love of anything that is in any way critical of the u s that it approaches <UNK> br br <UNK> gate is a bad movie it is <UNK> awful endless scenes using elaborate shots that serve no purpose <UNK> dialogue murky no sense of any theme aside from excess br br the high rating of this disaster is a product of <UNK> history and temporary shifts in perception br br for some perspective watch lawrence of <UNK> before watching <UNK> gate you will see just how <UNK> and lost this film truly is the issues it may have been trying to deal with are lost in a <UNK> br br i have no problem with films that are critical of the u s per se but when a terrible film gets such <UNK> praise purely because of that element that's worth challenging br br the film is worth seeing for two reasons curiosity and as a <UNK> tale for young filmmakers br br i saw this at home for free imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through it for 4 meandering hours
<START> this movie wasn't the best but it did have some good actors in it washington was pretty good as a homeless guy guy was good as his handicapped brother ice t was humorous as the <UNK> and surprisingly the actress <UNK> roman was good as the judge in the movie i didn't even know it was her and i am a die hard real world fan she was totally believable hopefully this movie won't <UNK> these actors development i know that has left this movie far behind with the success of <UNK> <UNK> ice t with his regular role on <UNK> special unit and <UNK> roman has landed a recurring role on sex love and secrets new soap opera i wish the same for the other actors because one bad movie doesn't a bad actor make
<START> hi guys this is my first review and i would had to have picked the worst movie to review as i only watched 5 minutes of it but trust me you could see this movie was going nowhere the acting was <UNK> the camera work and lighting looked as though it was shot and run by a pack of 10 year <UNK> no <UNK> to 10 year olds i just couldn't take anymore i got off my couch took the the house of adam dvd out of the dvd player and threw it in the garbage maybe if you are a colin farrell fan this movie may interest you because the character in the movie anthony is a colin farrell look a like but that is as far as it goes he certainly will never have acting abilities i gave this movie a rating of 1 awful only because there were no <UNK> in the drop down list cheers
<START> for the most part i considered this movie <UNK> of a comment but the last 10 minutes <UNK> me to write one you see right then we learn spoilers if they can be called that that the devil's <UNK> has no chance of properly preparing the <UNK> of the world by his master because he is not skilled at martial arts has been lying in a hole for centuries waiting for human greed to release him only to be defeated in a simple one on one match against <UNK> year old former karate champion chuck norris imagine what would have happened to him if he had taken on jackie chan 1 2
<START> eaten alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year's cannibal <UNK> the characters are universally bland the locations are criminally under <UNK> there's no attempt to create tension or suspense the physical effects are either laughably bad or shamelessly stolen from other movies and the <UNK> <UNK> rape scenes are barely worthy of a pg 13 even the scenes of animal are more tedious than usual the only mildly shocking scene involves crazy <UNK> going a bit <UNK> wielding a blood <UNK> <UNK> a scene that is just plain bizarre rather than graphic my beloved wife she of the <UNK> and juliet <UNK> watched this movie without so much as a <UNK> of disgust and it calls itself a cannibal movie all in all a pretty lame effort that thoroughly betrays the cannibal tradition cannibal <UNK> follow up is a far superior example of the genre
<START> i am a christian and thought this movie was pretty good while the acting wasn't academy award caliber i thought it was good considering the cast has had limited acting experience at the time this movie was made br br the <UNK> message and the <UNK> power of jesus christ was explained wonderfully the message that the director was trying to get across which is the important thing not how the characters dressed definitely got through the theme of having the main characters involved in illegal drag racing was a good idea too cool muscle cars btw i think this movie will definitely reach out to a lot of young people br br i would definitely recommend this movie it is a great witnessing tool
<START> ok this may contain spoilers but who really cares do not if you value the seconds in your life waste your time on this pile of garbage there is not one redeeming quality in this movie and i say that as a full fan of the vacation series of movies i loved the cousin eddie character from the other vacation movies but he only works well as a supporting character do i blame randy quaid for the failure of this movie not at all i think he's a great actor but this film lacks any <UNK> the pacing is off it's just plain unfunny and the actor who plays the third jake thomas was just awful more than likely due to a real lack of direction i don't know why but his whole character <UNK> me out br br some people say that this is a horrible movie because chevy chase and beverly <UNK> aren't in it that has nothing to do with it the script directing acting special effects everything is a train wreck with <UNK> and <UNK> oh and the train ran over some old people too br br please whatever you do stay away from this filth i call it filth because it <UNK> the name of the vacation franchise
<START> may contain spoilers br br an innocent trailer park or maybe la white kid witnesses a terrible childhood tragedy relating to drugs and violence an <UNK> but dedicated police partners try to take down a high end club drug ring only to be fired and <UNK> out by the the drug <UNK> high <UNK> <UNK> the plot <UNK> as more people come back to seek vengeance and justice with a predictable ending the only memorable part was a walk on by ron jeremy br br if i was in a movie theater i would have asked for a <UNK> i feel sorry for the poor actors in this movie it was just awful and painful to watch the worst part was the cinematography were the director kept flashing back within the same scene so the sound would not quite match and no it was not a <UNK> nor dvd problem but an intentional technique two stars
<START> ok here's the short of it this movie is full of corny dialogue over the top acting and a <UNK> script br br there are moments that intended to be very dramatic but simply come off humorous because of the over the top acting and poorly written lines i couldn't help laughing at moments that were meant to be very serious the bright spot in this movie is the circus seeing the circus in its <UNK> was certainly a treat br br there are moments that come through as good but then it right back into b movie territory i was tempted to stop watching it several times br br i certainly don't know how it won best picture however it must have been a slow year
<START> i gave it a rating of 3 out of 10 br br and what's sad is i made a point of looking up the movie schedule for that channel so i wouldn't miss seeing it i wanted to watch this film because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors barbara wilson as a lesbian i expected to love this film br br i don't know how ms wilson felt about the film but i found it a major disappointment br br it should have been intriguing it was a mystery set in spain and the main character <UNK> is a language <UNK> who gets <UNK> by a mysterious beautiful woman who offers <UNK> a great deal of money to locate her ex husband ben br br there are secrets <UNK> revealed but for some reason it just didn't matter it was like oh so what i could not get involved with these characters or come to care about them or feel for them i couldn't even identify with these characters br br i think a large part of the film's failure was the actress playing the main character she looked old tired worn out and as dull as <UNK> her hair was a <UNK> mess her <UNK> clothes were boring and she just was not appealing or interesting br br the best part of the film was getting to hear a dean martin recording but even that was ruined by the weird make up worn by the man who was dancing and lip <UNK> to the song believe me it was nothing like getting to see the <UNK> handsome mr martin performing it br br the ending is so <UNK> you'll wish you had some <UNK> to go with the <UNK> br br
<START> this is a truly awful film lou diamond phillips simply calls this one in the use of <UNK> models of the train are laughable the plot seems to develop on the run there is an alien on board oh and an <UNK> terrorist is on board too oh and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control oh and the train is going to run into another train one hour ahead oh and that train has nuclear waste on it i mean come on really the alien monsters are not scary although there are a lot of them and the acting is abysmal check out the guy playing the next president do you really think he could be president for goodness sake he has spent his whole acting career playing bad guys
<START> i have not seen a van damme flick for a while pleasantly surprised he still has it looking older but <UNK> kind of like sly becomes more rugged with age this is a good flick and has <UNK> me to take a look at all the van damme movies i have missed over the last ten years i would like to see a good director put van damme on the big screen with a good plot van damme still has the moves to <UNK> the audiences the last movie viewed with van damme was <UNK> that was a good flick as well in addition i looked in to van <UNK> early fighting history i too my <UNK> i realized he is the real deal very accomplished martial artist in his younger years
<START> why did they change the cute <UNK> television show we all know and love into a lame attempt to target teens they don't have to do that all ages watch the regular <UNK> when i heard about this i thought hey they made a tv series about the movie except they're really grown up as a teenager this is going to be better when i saw it it was just as if i was watching as told by ginger except they made it suck great job br br when in the <UNK> series has tommy been a director never basically all the episodes in this attempted series is about <UNK> love of directing i don't like that i rather watch plots that change every episode not the same thing over and over also when did in the old series have each character have their own sides of the story never this series did that i didn't like that everyone separated i don't want to see <UNK> side of the story i hate her br br i do not recommend this show if you like as told by ginger and the <UNK>
<START> lovely music beautiful photography some of scenes are breathtaking and affecting but the dramatic tension is lost in a film that is so poorly edited it is hard to know what exactly is going on at times the dialogue is incomprehensible then there is richard gere he's supposed to be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets work on a farm we see dozens of <UNK> and dirty in the hot sun then we see gere looking like he just <UNK> away from a <UNK> <UNK> ad sam shepard another <UNK> guy is supposed to be <UNK> ill but he looks great nice try but it just doesn't work <UNK> adams try hard but she gets lost in the scenery the real star is the girl
<START> i was a huge snl fan back in the days of chevy chase john belushi dan <UNK> <UNK> and many other memorable stars but every time i've tried to watch it in the past more than ten years i've been very disappointed and sometimes even disgusted with it ten years ago i believed the show couldn't possibly survive since it had become so utterly <UNK> of the sort of humor i could understand and yet it kept <UNK> along which i've always found <UNK> wondering how in the world anyone could possibly find its lame humor at all funny whenever i've tuned in over the past decade i've never once been glad that i did indeed i've always been annoyed at myself for staying up and wasting my time for me the absolute low point came several years ago when a popular young male actor i liked a lot was the guest host at one point that night he played a big star perhaps himself and in the skit the character i think played by chris <UNK> again i think ended up in the <UNK> of a car with him what followed was being forced up and down and up and down on the actor's lap with him screaming hysterically as he was presumably <UNK> the audience was laughing their heads off and i'm shaking my head amazed that they could find that remotely funny amazed that nbc would even broadcast such a thing in the years since then i've repeatedly tried to approach the show with an open mind hoping that it might regain the sly sense of humor i <UNK> for so many years but up until just a week ago for me it hasn't done so not even close one exception during the 2008 presidential campaign i thought that tina <UNK> was fantastic and she was the one performer who kept me <UNK> in but those sarah <UNK> skits while hysterical were still not enough to save the rest of the 90 minutes and i would always regret not turning it off as soon as i heard the familiar it's <UNK> night '
<START> once again i am amazed that thomas gibson did not come to the head of the pack earlier in his career in this film gibson once again demonstrates his ability to grasp a character regardless of sexuality social status or <UNK> gibson plays a very convincing gay male of the late 20th century tender yet not <UNK> afraid of the basic <UNK> of love <UNK> character touches a variety of emotions also worthy of praise is cameron <UNK> performance his need to be the <UNK> <UNK> as opposed to his best friend's homosexual <UNK> provides dynamics for the relationship that are in many ways unexpected <UNK> and <UNK> chemistry is apparent from the first scene they appear in together there are many <UNK> in this <UNK> from gay relationships to straight relationships from <UNK> relationships to the exploration of lesbian love this film travels across the broad spectrum of sexuality while having the story of a serial killer at its core my only regret is that it took 6 years since its release before i discovered this movie i look forward to seeing it again and highly recommend it to any fan of <UNK> gibson or director <UNK> <UNK>
<START> if you enjoyed the tv series <UNK> murder you'll love murder 101 it's great to see dick van dyke in a murder mystery again if we're lucky this one will be a start of a tv series or at least series of movies br br this movie definitely had some great and notable actors filling the roles but it didn't feel like a face movie it was really a story that drew you in making you forget about the fame of those on the screen br br i made a guess as to the ending and was so pleasantly surprised at the end that i had to watch it again this is a must see for any mystery buff or dick van dyke lover
<START> glenn close is back as sarah plain and tall a woman who keeps a family together through the good and bad times the acting is superb christopher walken unusually non spooky as her husband once again delivers a top notch performance it's good to see young christopher bell all grown up too bad we don't get to see much of anna <UNK> randall also a few years older but the new addition to the family played by emily <UNK> was very welcome and finally jack palance as the long lost <UNK> is as fine as ever
<START> how many movies are there going to be in which against all odds a <UNK> team beats the big guys with all the money there's nothing new in the big green if anything you want them to lose steve <UNK> used to have such a good resume the boys from brazil police academy <UNK> why oh why did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond so just avoid this movie there are plenty of good movies out there so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this junk obviously the green on their minds was money because there's no creativity here at least in recent years disney has produced some clever movies with pixar
<START> don't buy this film for comedy value like i did i didnt find it one bit funny but so f miserable and lame it's unbelievable i gave it to a friend for christmas which was pretty funny on my side i recently heard that he watched it and told me what an a i am br br there is nothing more frustrating than watching an over lit over dramatic poorly scored scene in which the camera is sat there on a <UNK> and doesn't move the film work is <UNK> pathetic and i can only say dont watch this movie
<START> first i will say that i am going to be as <UNK> as i can br br there will be some potential spoilers ahead so beware br br i hardly ever review movies but this one in particular i felt i had to review this movie final fantasy 7 <UNK> children based off the ultra popular <UNK> final fantasy <UNK> for the <UNK> has been in the works for quite some time after the years of hype and the dozens of trailers none of which i ever saw i had only seen stills this movie got the <UNK> of fans really excited about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen i myself had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan and being such a movie freak i was pretty excited myself so i had thought to myself what could go wrong br br well the movie started out ok in the first 20 minutes but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed without a doubt this is the best looking cgi animation around but that won't help a weak plot undeveloped characters and over indulgent action scenes br br here is the story basically these three silver haired nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game are supposedly <UNK> of he's the villain of the game who had supposedly murdered all his supposed <UNK> are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained all that well probably to make an army of kids they also center some of the story on some kid named denzel i don't know who this kid is or what his point is he just seems depressed all the time so the <UNK> also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called that only affects the children this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin br br so now cloud must save the day from these guys apparently cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time maybe if the movie wasn't so over the top then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible the real problem of this movie is logic now i know what you are gonna say but it's called final fantasy it should have those ideas in it well that is a foolish way to think the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that context context and logic in this movie is inconsistent i could explain it all but if i did i would end up writing the screenplay br br also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans they show up do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story br br if this is too long here is the simpler review br br the pros the first 20 minutes top notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunning br br the cons illogical over indulgent action <UNK> action leaves the viewer jaded at the climax weak plot super human characters no suspense the j rock soundtrack score what happened to the orchestra horrible ending br br big time spoiler br br now the ending of this movie really disappointed me they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest then cloud has his <UNK> flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of now i remember the in the game but it did not have <UNK> <UNK> if it did they could have brought back to life thus making a completely different story so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and <UNK> into the pool and we have a ultra <UNK> hallmark lifetime type moment br br not that the movie doesn't have it's moments its is worth seeing for its visuals but thats all br br other than that it's not really a good movie it is strictly for <UNK> fans of the game not for people who care about plot and character and story telling
<START> cat in the brain is a series of extremely violent sequences <UNK> together by a plot that feels more like an <UNK> describing director lucio <UNK> most notorious years of film making the movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts effectively <UNK> the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life fulci goes further than that he casts himself as the star the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore cat in the brain is not about presenting a clear story and following it instead it <UNK> fun at some of the clichés that have been surrounding the horror genre for years br br lucio fulci plays himself as a horror director struggling to keep his humanity intact years of violent film making have finally began to reach him it starts slowly and meat in general begin to disgust him his colleagues assure fulci that all he needs is some rest but that doesn't help and soon the grotesque ideas for his movies begin to <UNK> his daily thoughts in an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously <UNK> mental state lucio starts going to the local psychiatrist unfortunately that does more wrong than good and fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who <UNK> the murders from <UNK> films in real life br br the film <UNK> all the <UNK> of italian splatter cinema good or bad they are all here so any comments about the acting or the technical aspects and budget <UNK> are quite irrelevant as to the quality of the film it is a visual experience no doubts about it fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence easily <UNK> pretty much everything he's made <UNK> by chainsaw limbs <UNK> child murder <UNK> these are just some of the many grotesque acts witnessed in cat in the brain some of them are obviously recycled from a few the director's less profile movies but they don't stand out of the context and actually feel quite at home here as i noted before the movie exists much better as a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece the way some of the violence is presented does help establish that idea such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by the reality in the film as they are revealed to be actually scenes inside a movie that <UNK> character is directing this sort of film in film presentation <UNK> somewhat the impact of the gore but in no way does it make it an easy to watch film oh no this is far beyond and above the levels of gore found in mainstream horror and <UNK> will in no doubt be satisfied with that fact br br lucio fulci was a very <UNK> figure people either hate his work or love it cat in the brain won't convince any of <UNK> <UNK> in the opposite but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography one that fans should really check out
<START> is the <UNK> in the pie every thing else in it is an abortion a <UNK> failure of a film at least you can see and hear what goes on in an ed wood movie usually high schools drama <UNK> do better than this on a routine basis once you've you've seen the breast pie bit you can turn it off and go watch <UNK>
<START> this must rank as one of <UNK> greatest <UNK> i was wandering europe at the time and had the misfortune to stumble upon the crew making this movie in what was even then one of the world's <UNK> <UNK> settings i was <UNK> as an extra and what followed was an <UNK> of modern day <UNK> forget all the <UNK> you've ever heard of peter <UNK> <UNK> on this rare piece of french life <UNK> reeve and his <UNK> <UNK> on a level of <UNK> at the restaurant at les <UNK> that left the slack <UNK> in disbelief they were quite simply awful <UNK> and <UNK> of french <UNK>
<START> this was one of <UNK> later stories throughout her long career she was interested in the shifting narrative and the notion of <UNK> agents both are essentially the same thing and <UNK> down to questions of who it is that controls or creates the situation br br in detective fiction the game is a matter of <UNK> realities the murderer <UNK> to change reality to fool the detective the writer <UNK> to do the same to the reader both the reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see that's why her stories often include a writer br br in her works she explores every combination of tricks she can think of that deal with this along the way we often have bodies that are not who they seem and times and intended victims and such but the real magic of the books is this notion of control in it was literally a building br br here it is a dead man well sometimes that happens but not like this it is as if the writer were the famous mr this is particularly sweet to <UNK> readers who remember this same character from the mystery ' which in a way was also framed by her nephew in that story was the <UNK> of the story to the authorities br br the producers of this series have an almost wacky commitment to using a different creative team on each one sometimes it produces bland work the episode was rather brilliantly staged this one is the most lavish of the lot and has an active camera but unlike the work it has nothing to do with the story br br the camera moves and captures merely because it can the <UNK> <UNK> quote at the beginning was a little too literal and blunt this story is good but the <UNK> took out some pretty critical stuff and that irrelevant camera <UNK> br br ted's <UNK> 2 of 3 has some interesting elements
<START> this is a funny film and i like it a lot cary <UNK> plays robin hood to a <UNK> this is of course the usual good vs evil with robin against the evil sheriff of <UNK> the humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part but still works well a comedy for a night when you don't want to have to think much it's well worth a rent
<START> br br in the process of boring you with the <UNK> rambling storyline and the complete absence of character development it manages to <UNK> a few negative black stereotypes out there at one point i was wondering if jesse <UNK> co wrote the screenplay
<START> i'm new to <UNK> work and if this and <UNK> are any indication then <UNK> is much more a filmmaker of experience than story in his films characters are placed in <UNK> and mesmerizing horror <UNK> that literally <UNK> the logic of the world around them the camera literally flows <UNK> through sets as the characters run stumble and choke their way to an eventual horrifying conclusion it worked really well in <UNK> for some reason it didn't work here br br the problem i see with this movie is that even though the protagonist gets help by way of <UNK> the police and asking for help from her friends it still feels as if she refuses to get help in terms of actually trying to find a solution to her problem the <UNK> in this film is that she's trapped in the killer's little game one that she could easily get out of by not setting herself up so easily in a weird way it seems like the character wants the torture the killer gives her which in a way is the point and could have worked except that the whole psychology of it is thrown about mostly due to whatever <UNK> feels like doing br br as a loving homage to the phantom of the opera it's certainly an interesting and unique take for all his worth <UNK> <UNK> in operatic movements as well which well highlights the action it just doesn't make much sense especially as it <UNK> further into a completely useless ending yes i know it's a reference to <UNK> novel red dragon no it didn't work why the character should go from one horrifying experience of <UNK> to a willing one with the director is beyond me it felt almost self serving on <UNK> part br br overall a fun experience and between this and <UNK> i'm more than willing to follow up on more <UNK> productions but this is not a movie i'd want to return to or remember br br <UNK>
<START> i recently bought this movie on dvd at a <UNK> store for 5 although it is a no <UNK> dvd on the label just the movie that starts playing immediately no menu no special features the picture and sound quality were excellent the movie is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank <UNK> in history br br richard jordan who i must admit to not having heard of plays the lead <UNK> green a charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight but is not allowed to do so he portrays an american in england david niven plays the lead bad guy also with the great charm for which he is famous bad but with <UNK> as when he refuses to deny <UNK> his <UNK> for the job <UNK> in england apparently is the fair share of the take and not a bullet in the head as in american gangster films all the supporting cast do an excellent job producing a very believable movie br br what is perhaps best to me is that the whole movie is quite enjoyable and understandable i frequently find myself lost in plot <UNK> and various characters without any special effects no blood no violence not even a single car chase just a well written story well acted well directed and well photographed if i had any complaints about the movie i would question the music what is <UNK> music doing in a bank heist story that takes place in england
<START> brilliant ranks along with citizen kane the matrix and <UNK> must see at least for <UNK> in her early days watch it
<START> i think that this is a fabulous movie i watched it constantly from the time i was 4 to about the time i was 8 however watching it resulted in many nightmares i particularly got them because of the guy that was always like the and his friends i am 12 and i still get nightmares about it to this day i can't fall asleep right now because i am thinking about it i love this movie but it is so scary i definitely love this movie though i have very good memories from it kate is very good at acting in this movie amazingly i never realized that it was her i also think that the graphics were very high quality contrary to what some other people think
<START> if movies where virtual reality characters come to life and they are all either male tough guys or female eye candy sounds good to you then perhaps this movie may not be a total waste of film needless to say the overwhelming majority of people will find this to be an absolute bore with little acting talent and even less of a script yes <UNK> massey is nice to look at but that is the only positive thing that i can say about this disaster
<START> some of the reviewers here have <UNK> judged this silent film by political correctness standards of today br br battle was an excellent film for several reasons correctly noted by more rational reviewers superb cast lots of action innovative editing and photography br br its stars were in effect the d w griffith stock company and to this silent movie fan that is enough to watch it and to enjoy it br br i saw it many years ago and just watched it again at youtube that was a very poor quality print but coupled with my memory of a good print in a real theater i can <UNK> recommend this to reasonable people and film historians
<START> this is seriously one of the best low budget b movies that i have ever seen i am not one to stand up and cheer during a movie but this one was definitely worth it obviously the premise is that there is a bed that eats people well eats is a <UNK> term i guess it really <UNK> acid <UNK> to suck the victims into itself and <UNK> them in it's goodness the best part of this movie is that william russ is one of the main characters the typical family man actually started his career with this movie and an <UNK> there is plenty of nudity in this flick so obviously not for the children but that should not <UNK> anyone from seeing this movie it is my belief that everyone needs a little death bed in their lives at some point or other it's best to get it sooner than later
<START> this slightly <UNK> late 50's sci fi horror schlock isn't entirely a loser it's about a <UNK> space rocket that crash lands in a remote area a bunch of scientists go to investigate and discover that the astronaut is in some kind of coma he's being kept alive by alien <UNK> that have been mysteriously <UNK> in him anyway the title alien monster soon raises it's head causing general havoc including partial head <UNK> br br the main problem with the film is it's pacing it takes quite a while for the blood beast to appear and he really only comes into his own in the last 20 minutes or so he is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation but that's really not a problem as he provides a fair amount of comic relief at the end of the movie where we have the final stand off and this ludicrous creature starts talking with the voice of the doctor he killed earlier you will be doing well not to have a giggle so too in the brilliant x ray scene where we see the alien <UNK> floating about in the <UNK> body it's just too funny for words br br but unfortunately the fun moments in night of the blood beast come too few and far between if you're a 50's sci fi nut though then it's well worth checking this one out just don't expect too much
<START> after waiting years for a definitive collection of led <UNK> <UNK> on video fans have finally been rewarded with what is undoubtedly the greatest concert video ever much better than the dismal song remains the same this video includes performances from no less than 5 different <UNK> <UNK> a decade it also includes rare interviews and tv appearances the sound quality is amazing considering the source material used and the video quality is even more impressive this is an absolute must for any led <UNK> fan
<START> the <UNK> blue planet is simply jaw dropping i don't think i'm <UNK> when i say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured on film from familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to some more <UNK> and just plain bizarre ones in the murky depths next to nothing is left out <UNK> in at a <UNK> 8 hours some people may want to check out the edited highlights brought to you in the form of the film deep blue but i would <UNK> recommend you give the series a go i don't think it will disappoint and if your kids enjoyed the <UNK> world brought to them by <UNK> finding <UNK> i'm sure they will love this too i just wish all television was this entertaining
<START> john huston actor and director better known for more <UNK> fare such as the <UNK> and african queen directs his daughter <UNK> huston in what would be his last film indeed the film was released after <UNK> death based on james <UNK> <UNK> of the same name the dead tells the quiet story of a new year's celebration in <UNK> <UNK> huston his cast and his screenwriters including his son tony have created a gem of a movie the <UNK> is among <UNK> finest works as well as being the only one that is <UNK> the film is a tribute to <UNK> genius he has taken a small beautiful story and has made a small beautiful movie <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> huston shine although shine is too <UNK> too flashy a word to describe their quiet understated performances the dead reflects the huston family's love for ireland and is in its own quiet way a fitting final movie for a legend
<START> it's 2 stars only because they put a lot of work in making this game look good i played plenty of good and bad games and i think this game has the <UNK> story i was ever forced to listen the best thing they could have done is to let you skip the conversations but no you must listen to them talking for 10 minutes and just continue doing the same things over and over again climb the building save the citizen go kill some dude it's all the same should really hire someone with some imagination br br i'm a huge fan of prince of <UNK> series first 3 the story was good and you wanted to know what happens next all the time i don't even hate prince of <UNK> 4 but i think anyone who was in charge of developing the story for <UNK> <UNK> should be banned to write another thing for the rest of his life br br boring story and same missions over and over again if just one of these two things was good the game would be worth playing
<START> mad scientist professor drinks a <UNK> he has up in his laboratory but is turned into a blood <UNK> vampire instead when dr pays a visit sees a picture of wife <UNK> and after turning into a vampire heads for <UNK> to make her his bride brother discovers the grave of the vampire and his brother at castle and kills his brother with a knife to free his soul succeeds in putting the bite on <UNK> and once turned she tries to lure her young niece away brother races against time to put a stop to the vampire curse almost put me to sleep the plot is extremely slow but more or less follows <UNK> <UNK> famous novel the suspense is completely absent as is the gore and nudity the film is only recommended for curious horror fans that want to see the second horror film made in <UNK> after madman from 1964
<START> the always delightful kevin spacey makes us once again question certain truths in our lives after driving us into believing he is a <UNK> small time crook only to expose the true power of cinematic deception in the classic the usual suspect this time around he leads us into believing he is a likable alien who assumes a human form whilst <UNK> around the earth br br is a peculiar stranger who has seemingly appeared out of nowhere only to be <UNK> in the manhattan psychiatric institution dr mark powell jeff bridges soon takes extreme interest in him and even finds himself <UNK> if is actually a supreme being from planet k <UNK> or perhaps he is only a forgotten human being with severe psychiatric issues while the ending can be seen and discussed in many ways it remains a complex <UNK> journey which leaves a <UNK> eat deal of intriguing philosophical questions behind it
<START> this show can most accurately be described as tv bubble <UNK> it's chewing it has a good taste to it and it lasts a long time but like bubble <UNK> it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many <UNK> br br this show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games like <UNK> guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list <UNK> are the contestants and anybody can play br br the questions though are terribly easy there's some <UNK> music <UNK> into the background that's fashioned into a continuous loop it never seems to get old but it never adds much to the show anyway the <UNK> however regardless of which one that it is extremely <UNK> pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions i rather enjoy that british woman br br but there's nothing to this show it's simplistic and <UNK> although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on
<START> the ghost walks is a nifty little mystery with a great twist snappy dialog and best of all a <UNK> played to the <UNK> by character actor johnny arthur which never <UNK> or <UNK> his character mr arthur is great in his role of homer bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the broadway producer herman wood played by another great character actor richard <UNK> br br they play off of each other superbly br br although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream <UNK> are used to describe the character of homer it is never mean spirited or meant as <UNK> and are not spoken by the <UNK> males of the film but by his <UNK> who fires and him every other scene and who displays an almost <UNK> affection for his devoted employee br br there is a great scene where homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him br br the mystery angle of the film is very entertaining and the twist at the end might just leave you in <UNK> br br for a low budget poverty row picture this film has superb set decoration and great <UNK> br br director frank <UNK> <UNK> handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through br br this film is a must see for <UNK> of poverty row films old dark house mysteries they actually managed to work in the lines it was a dark and <UNK> night and it has the added bonus of being an early representation of a gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end br br this movie is available for <UNK> in the public <UNK> film section of the internet archive at archive <UNK>
<START> i'm a big fan of kevin <UNK> work but this is a sub standard film if you think it looks interesting or you saw it and liked it go and check out john <UNK> the general it is basically about the same guy but is far superior in every way and doesn't suffer from the hollywood
<START> wow talk about a film that <UNK> the audience this is a real love it or <UNK> it kinda movie personally i really enjoyed it i noticed that other reviews are comparing it to pitch black this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is sand people can be real stupid no this film is far more in common with the thing how people fail to notice is amazing they even have the same basic music lots of carpenter touches are there blue collar heroes sharp humor endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is it's <UNK> to other carpenter works not least dark star which it has something in common with i'd be interested to know how much it really cost <UNK> is that even possible maybe it was based on a short film that cost <UNK> but i did find myself strangely moved when the various space <UNK> died they are so <UNK> that it's like watching a documentary at times having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and i'm not sure the big guy playing the captain is one of them but his gun is awesome give it a chance if you like early carpenter you might fall for it just don't expect 2001
<START> one of the most underrated comedies dan <UNK> is hilarious in this over the top role charles <UNK> gives a performance nearly as good as in midnight run and walter matthau gives a superb comedic performance in this sometimes subdued sometimes wacky film <UNK> and matthau have great chemistry together
<START> i didn't even watch this whole movie now i like 50's sci fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me for one thing one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the <UNK> grade he sounds like he ought to be on a <UNK> league not a space ship out the window of the spaceship the crew is <UNK> at earth and this <UNK> says <UNK> you see brooklyn ' and another guy says and the <UNK> says <UNK> i wonder who's <UNK> ' <UNK> me a moment i think my sides are splitting br br when they first get up into <UNK> the <UNK> says 'the moon is just for looking at take me back down ' watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the g forces of <UNK> during <UNK> is also not one of the better moments of the film perhaps the film's best moment can be identified by a big the end on the screen br br we also find out that they can't open the <UNK> because 'the <UNK> it before they took off sure a space vehicle is going to be by a member of the crew who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and doesn't know anything about zero gravity as baby <UNK> the <UNK> fat cartoon duck once said that sounds logical the no gravity in space effects are so bad it's painful to watch everyone knows in the absence of gravity everything tends to go up br br how this movie gets 6 3 stars out of 10 when other vastly superior films don't rate any higher is a mystery to me i really do like old sci fi movies but this one is not realistic and the lame attempts at character humor by throwing in that <UNK> from a gas station grease pit does not work at all it just ruins the movie i think in retrospect it's not the whole movie i hate so much as the fact that 'the is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship not even to the <UNK> ' <UNK> i wonder if he checked the fan <UNK> too maybe if they'd left 'the off the trip it might not have been quite so excruciating even so it's only average what everyone else is raving about i don't know br br you want to watch a neat 1950's space movie x <UNK> beats it all to heck maybe not so much <UNK> but a more serious story and less goofy characters
<START> not just the money we paid to rent it or actually go to the movies i'm talking about how big productions companies waste so much money in things that actually are boring and not to talk about ridiculous with the millions they used to make a movie like this because i don't think the actors here would actually work for free or for an insignificant sum with that money imagine how many good independent movies you could make or maybe one good hollywood movie its just to rip you off but not anyone just the majority of teens that are willing to go and see an <UNK> <UNK> movie just because they are fans of him i don't really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie if you actually look at it in <UNK> the actors are the same quality of this movie so i guess i shouldn't be surprise i actually couldn't have expected more
<START> when i first saw this show i was 9 and it caught my attention right away when was trying to call lois on the phone in the hotel i laughed and kept on watching when the episode was finished i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly this <UNK> itself from the simpsons and other shows on say cartoon network because the jokes are more mature not too much but it's tv 14 for a reason the quick film cuts after each punch line and cute funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special talented seth is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show a good theme song and a crazy family that there's always something funny makes this my favorite cartoon along and <UNK> teen <UNK> force check it out it's funny stuff
<START> wow this movie is the voice of a climbing generation director sam keith takes us to the darkest depths of man's soul where we find love life and top world weary telly leo <UNK> follows his heart and his anchors through a cerebral journey to find sanity in a post apocalyptic <UNK> instead telly meets confrontation in don jason the <UNK> of <UNK> and a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> the epic film comes to a at a gut wrenching top competition that will make even the strongest <UNK> viewers <UNK> at the <UNK> heights br br this movie has it all top outside top in the gym cut off shorts and <UNK> <UNK> shirts awesome climbing footage some so good you see it 2 or 3 times bear and snake attacks br br i gave the movie 8 out of 10 because i wanted to see the romance develop a bit more it seemed as if the film was leading up to a <UNK> top <UNK> sex scene between telly and his new lover but alas it wouldn't fit into the already jam packed hour and a half thrill ride br br fans of cliffhanger and mission impossible ii will find this flick to be a diamond in the rough overall if you are ready to challenge your world view on humanity and climbing this is the film for you 1
<START> this movie is surprisingly good the ninja fighting sequences were unbelievable i haven't see all sho <UNK> films but this is probably the best of those i've seen probably the most impressive fighting sequence was at the beginning when ninja killed about 20 people that was one of the most impressive ninja fighting sequences i've ever seen another good fighting sequence was at a cops funeral where the ninja provide more people to bury the last fight was also very impressive also i kinda liked the soundtrack of this movie the story was good enough for a ninja movie actually it was kinda different from other ninja movies so if you are a fan of ninja movies you'll probably like this one
<START> i got hold of this film on dvd with the title evil never sleeps it gives front cover billing to carrie ann moss but she plays such a minor character that i didn't really notice her in the film br br i'm afraid that i consider this one of the worst <UNK> i have ever made the dialogue was stilted and the delivery wooden i found the acting to be <UNK> from the plot <UNK> performance to me was of someone who's wondering whether she's left the gas on at home br br all in all both my wife and i found this film painful to watch and it is not a valuable addition to my collection watch it at your peril but spending 90 minutes having your <UNK> pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time
<START> great concept perfect characterizations and voices but a complete waste of time a real shame since had it aimed higher it would probably not have been the bomb it was is way too <UNK> upon <UNK> humor for starters i'm amazed by comments from educated reviewers referring to the good science behind this piece of <UNK> trash unlike finding <UNK> where with a bit of suspension of disbelief attention to detail was <UNK> and the science was as good as the context would allow <UNK> jones was utter nonsense don't kid yourself about the science humor aimed at eight year olds but subject matter suitable more for some <UNK> teens
<START> this movie is 1 in the list of worst movies i have ever seen with lessons for an assassin on the 2 spot br br the acting is lousy sorry sandra <UNK> but even your performance was horrible the music score could have come from a bad x rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous it had this in common with a typical action movie the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one <UNK> words but contrary to the average action movie there was no real action in this one boring br br the only reason i continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie br br thumbs down on this one
<START> i have to admit i was <UNK> by the title and the summary on the back of the box so i popped it in the vcr and kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something good to happen but of course it never does the makers of this film should be tied to a chair and made to watch saving private ryan maybe they would learn something
<START> <UNK> way of acting and not only his is tremendous you really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect he gives this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult as well as which role is done very well by dennis hopper it's about choosing the right or wrong side without logical thinking about the scene friendship is more <UNK> and that's exactly what i think is what makes choices this difficult rivers edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family i really enjoyed it watching i saw it a month ago for the first time but if you like a nice 80s feel this is the one that you have to see <UNK> a same that i didn't know of it earlier
<START> john huston finished his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies i've ever seen for his farewell he decided to adapt james <UNK> beautiful short story the dead and made not only one of the most faithful literature to film adaptations yet he also crafted a movie that more than 20 years later still surpasses a lot of contemporary cinema br br when i watched this movie a few years ago as a student at university i <UNK> in awe at the screen <UNK> at every aspect of the movie acting screen writing direction costumes settings music cinematography thinking about it now i still can't of anything i'd <UNK> it for huston just knew how to tell a good story br br a good deal of credit should also go to tony huston he knew better than to <UNK> with a text that is not only perfection itself but already visual enough for cinema father and son let the story breathe and <UNK> in the long fascinating conversations between characters and in the meaningful <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> also deserves credit for the his performance as gabriel <UNK> i had never seen him in movies before nor have i seen him afterwards but he gave one of the most moving performances i've ever seen br br all in all the dead is a fine cinematic experience from a legendary director who never stopped being excellent
<START> out of all the bat films batman returns is my favorite this beautiful dark and funny film is one of tim <UNK> best work although it is much violent and darker this is the batman that creator bob kane <UNK> many years ago michael keaton <UNK> his role as the <UNK> of <UNK> city this time he's up against two deadly <UNK> danny <UNK> penguin and michelle <UNK> with a great cast and film score by danny <UNK> the movie takes us on an adventure as batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over <UNK> city christopher walken makes a great appearance as max shrek a <UNK> businessman who has an evil scheme up his <UNK> but of course michelle pfeiffer is the one that steals the show with all of these <UNK> you have a film that will blow you away this is the reason why you go to the movies it's got everything it's really a shame that tim burton didn't get to direct the other sequels if so i think the franchise would still be going strong today batman returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies
<START> this is an excellent movie and i wish that they would put it out on dvd for people to purchase it is difficult to try to catch it on tv all the time as you do not know when one of the stations will decide to air it can someone tell me what file company make it so i can write to them and see if they will release it to the public i only caught the last hour and a half yesterday and i only got to see it once last year my sisters and i are all looking for it in every store that sells any videos john denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great they put out some much older movies and i think that is great but there are quite a few that they have not put out and i think if we could contact the producers and voice our <UNK> we might get some of them put out on dvd
<START> i turned 13 when elvis hit the big times in 1956 with his first <UNK> hit a year later buddy holly stepped in to give the king some competition one of <UNK> major talents besides his unique singing style and his <UNK> ability is often <UNK> buddy was also a skilled lead guitar player developing a unique <UNK> style all his own on his <UNK> gary busey attempts to capture this aspect of <UNK> persona there were other contemporary master guitar <UNK> of equal caliber such as chuck <UNK> carl <UNK> and eddie <UNK> but <UNK> talent is often overlooked br br as noted by others busey is the driving force behind the success of the buddy holly story not only does the script play with the facts of <UNK> life but it even several <UNK> for the two years of <UNK> popularity basically 1957 1959 one that comes to mind is the scene where buddy and maria are watching a 3 d movie buddy is <UNK> with it all and tells maria that it'll never last it's just a <UNK> in reality there were no 3 d movies in <UNK> at the time the <UNK> for 3 d was in the early 1950's by 1955 the <UNK> had already faded yet another example where just a little research would have <UNK> to make the story more believable br br at times it is difficult to separate what really happened from urban legends surrounding <UNK> career the story about how the <UNK> got their name may or may not be <UNK> but it certainly did not take place the way it is presented in the movie another problem with the film is how <UNK> parents are depicted certainly <UNK> parents were supportive of his musical career maybe baby is credited to <UNK> mother and she did have <UNK> into the writing of the song br br it's good that <UNK> biggest hits were used in the movie but i miss hearing one of my favorites i'm looking for someone to love i'm proud that as a result of this movie <UNK> music was <UNK> for a new generation to hear his legacy is one of the very best from the early days of rock <UNK> roll rave on buddy rave on
<START> saw the movie last night w o knowing anything about it nothing else out seemed interesting and i had a buffalo connection to this movie <UNK> <UNK> it was a very enjoyable movie liked the pace it picks up after a slow beginning and story well written plot and good character development and relationships highly recommend it to anyone who likes to see movies that have interesting stories found myself talking about this movie afterwards over a few beers most discussions don't last more than a few minutes
<START> i really like <UNK> <UNK> she may not be the greatest actress in the world but she's rather good in this she play the <UNK> conservative reporter to a <UNK> it's a great little thriller which keeps you guessing for a good while jeff <UNK> is also good as <UNK> boss i think given a decent break <UNK> could be a top actress she's certainly no worse than some of today's leading ladies
<START> maybe i expected too much of this film but at the very least a comedy should be funny and this one has very few amusing moments it manages to be insulting to <UNK> <UNK> women the <UNK> and probably several other groups as well the scene at <UNK> where everyone claims to be gay is one of the most <UNK> i have ever seen br br tom <UNK> and matt dillon are ridiculously miscast and kevin kline seems <UNK> most of the time br br other reviewers compare the film to will and grace but at least will and grace is funny
<START> absolutely one of the best <UNK> movies of all times on so many levels <UNK> <UNK> will <UNK> over the largest single <UNK> of outside of a battle of britain <UNK> no less than eight flying <UNK> are on hand for very accurate ground and air sequences br br those that marvel over the <UNK> of flying and get misty eyed <UNK> high flight will identify with the central characters' <UNK> for the freedom of being fast free and high in their dark blue world be warned <UNK> and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional ride in this movie the core message is one that is shared by many war vets in that their finest hours their period of life when they felt most alive was in fact during the war when everything else is sad and gray br br the plot concerns czech pilots who escape from their country when the nazis <UNK> and join the <UNK> free czech <UNK> there are a few subplots all of which are worth careful attention this is just a plain old excellent movie that even the most <UNK> anti <UNK> romantic will love keep the <UNK> on hand beautiful photography first rate acting accurate details of <UNK> life during the battle of britain easily a candidate for any <UNK> personal dvd collection
<START> god bless joe <UNK> i love italian horror cheese movie wise sci fi etc br br this one admittedly was a bit harder to watch but another fun bad movie br br i like how people <UNK> a negative review with i normally enjoy bad movies but no <UNK> this was a bad movie for people who love bad movies it's one of my top bad movies br br miles <UNK> was a poor man's conan but oh what fun who can't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb a and a cheesy rubber monster it's fine to hate this movie if you only like hollywood <UNK> like titanic or pretty woman but if you truly i mean truly love bad movies check this one out br br this is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a or when you have a couple buddies around and looking for a little mindless fun br br my rating 8 10
<START> certainly this film is not for everybody but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film buy this immediately where else can you get a run down of fashion a period <UNK> <UNK> karate trained <UNK> crime a rap about the sinking shoot outs and a co star named queen <UNK> watch for her moving crying scene early on in the <UNK> office with a filming style a cross between a porno movie dawn of the dead and car wash you cannot go wrong this is one to watch over and over you put the kids to bed
<START> i just saw a terrible film called the sleeping <UNK> one reviewer on four word film review www com got it right right when he wrote from a to the story is about an english <UNK> jerk that comes to <UNK> to the <UNK> so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping <UNK> a sleeping <UNK> is a native <UNK> prostitute <UNK> in english that services <UNK> <UNK> and teaches them her native language in return for well the movie never really makes that clear but i can only assume he gives her money or something needless to say the movie focuses a lot more on the sleeping part than on the <UNK> part of the job description things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair gets <UNK> by her culture his soap opera domestic situation and his own <UNK> stupidity in every major decision he makes throughout the film br br so yes the movie has some major flaws but on the other hand it delivered exactly the two things i rented it for in the first place a beautifully photographed exotic location and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman that plays the sleeping <UNK> jessica alba my friend told me that this crappy movie was her at her most beautiful and damn was he right she's not a great actress and doesn't quite pass for <UNK> and its pretty obvious that they use a body double for the nudity but who cares jessica alba has that rare face and figure that's more than just sexy but also beautiful in the way that a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or a <UNK> painting is br br p s sorry to all you <UNK> out there who <UNK> women the male <UNK> etc etc but i hope you can understand that i mean no <UNK>
<START> note to self never ever ever again watch a serious movie with charlie sheen in it great comedian horrible seal this movie makes navy <UNK> look like a reckless group of rangers when in fact they are the most elite form of military in the world charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation thank you for making such an incredibly <UNK> group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies i have ever seen this is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie but why charlie sheen there are possibilities for a very passionate story here but sheen decides to wreck them with funny comments
<START> this was really a nightmare of a film i saw it about nine years ago on cable tv and haven't forgotten it since <UNK> is a 10 year old boy who lives in the streets of <UNK> <UNK> brazil and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends and <UNK> they steal <UNK> sell drugs and murder in order to survive each day in the first half of the film <UNK> is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses every kind of abuse from the older inmates and guards to the rest of the kids one night boyfriend is killed after a beating so <UNK> and his friends decide to escape during a riot the rest of the film shows descent into a criminal life he doesn't show any feelings or <UNK> after killing someone maybe because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he lives but there is however a gentle scene in the middle of the film <UNK> and his friends are at the beach missing and wishing one of his friends from the <UNK> was there i thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events the boys are obviously longing not only for their friend but for a better life director hector <UNK> is a brave and depressing film that doesn't shy away from showing the <UNK> reality many people including myself tend to ignore or <UNK> this film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person
<START> a good friend of mine one said a monkey is funny anytime anywhere there is one exception to this going <UNK> it is quite simply the worst movie i have ever seen it's worse than plan 9 worse than the beast of <UNK> <UNK> it is terrible the talking monkey gag gets old after about three minutes and believe me that's all there is make sure you have a bunch of people around to revive you after you go into toxic shock from going <UNK> the worst movie ever
<START> <UNK> is another multi dollar adaptation of <UNK> works like jurassic park the lost world <UNK> etc the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence i'll make this short and to the point the scenery is beautiful the actors well it's the best they can do the script try hundreds of pages into an hour and half movie you get a mess in the end but how neat of a mess is what counts and <UNK> falls somewhere below that there were some silly moments like why did the killer <UNK> decide to jump into the <UNK> and amy raised by humans surrounded by humans yet can <UNK> dozens of killer apes around her what sort of twist of common sense is that which brings me to this if there was an annoying character in every movie amy ranks of one here you see amy is this naive little female ape who can talk with a special <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to her neat idea but it gets annoying after awhile hearing her talk <UNK> is worthwhile to see and not <UNK> but certainly not a memorable film either
<START> watching plots with a view called <UNK> betty in the us i got the feeling that there need to be more movies filmed in <UNK> this one portrays a woman brenda <UNK> in a small <UNK> town trying to get away from her cheating husband so she and the funeral <UNK> manager alfred <UNK> come up with a plan but there are likely to be some <UNK> along the way br br i would actually say that christopher <UNK> character is the <UNK> in the movie how could he not be but overall the whole idea is just a really neat one <UNK> with some uh oh moments especially the haunted house scene it's the sort of movie that i wish that i could enter just to experience it br br also starring lee evans <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> as i <UNK> through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the imdb have posted on this film i find it very interesting how few middle of the road comments there are everyone either loves it or they hate it having seen apocalypse now approximately 30 times and having recently <UNK> it on dvd how did we ever live without those magical digital machines i can say without <UNK> that i am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film why would you like a film that's so confusing ask many of my associates the answer is this forget the war forget the brutality this is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status <UNK> brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done they big brother sent him out to do the job he does it too well without <UNK> to the accepted standards of death and destruction am i the only one who's troubled by the fact that we have for death and destruction so they send the <UNK> police out to eliminate the individual <UNK> draw any parallels between this and things you see every day with the deepest respect to mr coppola whom i believe is one of the best directors of all time i think he <UNK> his original intent of the movie and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie was released the subtle sub text that <UNK> the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed instead it seems to have itself like some wild flower in the middle of a <UNK> garden again i must <UNK> i think <UNK> coppola did a bang up job on this entire production as did the cast and crew but the sum of the movie <UNK> the individual efforts ten <UNK> so if you haven't seen the movie rent it watch it then watch it again and maybe a few more times and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life only then make a judgment on the quality of the film those of you that have seen it watch it again with the mindset previously described i think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film or maybe not no matter whether you love it or hate it be sure and give credit to coppola for his masterful story telling style
<START> let's not kid ourselves this atrocity is not plan nine or cat women it is bad period the performances <UNK> from drama school <UNK> <UNK> english to a care <UNK> walk through tom <UNK> the photography even in a good print is so murky it is occasionally hard to see what is happening the real problem however is the <UNK> pointless nearly plot less story and the <UNK> direction at a <UNK> <UNK> minutes it still feels endless br br the screenplay is especially inept there are two story lines that only <UNK> at the very end of the picture tom <UNK> is trying to create a super race using voodoo and modern science although there is little science in evidence which he can control <UNK> he is keeping his wife prisoner for no discernible reason meanwhile a couple of petty crooks and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village in which he is working in the expectation of gold and <UNK> when they finally arrive tom <UNK> decides that one of them the woman is the perfect subject for his experiments she is turned into a monster kills <UNK> <UNK> and then <UNK> to normal she sees a gold statue half drowned in a <UNK> pool tries to retrieve it and falls in the water and apparently <UNK> the white hunter <UNK> the wife in the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again threatening a sequel now that really is a scary thought br br the <UNK> producer samuel z <UNK> in a lecture included on the dvd <UNK> himself on <UNK> the teenage <UNK> market and satisfying it with ingenious low budget movies however it is difficult to see how anyone could think this <UNK> <UNK> would satisfy any sort of audience what appeal do they think it could possibly have the monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film the jungle action is tepid and tedious there are no teenagers in it and no characters that teenagers could be expected to identify with br br the producers exposed <UNK> minutes of film but they didn't make a movie this is a con trick and <UNK> should be ashamed of his association with it
<START> you have to start worrying when you see that michael madsen is leading the cast of any movie i wont go through the list of shame that is his movie career br br i watched 45 minutes and still was not sure what really was going on the movie consisted of a love hate relationship between madsen and <UNK> which basically was madsen insulting her threatening violence and generally treating her like dirt she on the other hand loves him then <UNK> doesn't then she does the she desires him then she loves him again whats wrong with you woman br br the script is awful lousy soundtrack and pointless aggressive and crude sexuality which i believe was added to <UNK> some viewers as the movie has little else to offer i would have given the movie a 1 but it just about managed a 2 with a little excitement in the last 20 minutes it did actually answer one question in the final few minutes but i am not going to share that i will make you suffer for the full movie like i did
<START> when my mum went down to the video store to rent a film for the night my sister and i learned a lesson to always company my mum to the video store in fact the only reason why she chose it was because colin <UNK> was in it and she <UNK> thinks he's a good actor br br it starts off with some beautiful of africa and then goes down and down and down and down after this film i was very surprised that colin <UNK> got as far as he did since this pointless film could destroy any actors career br br the story is about a divorced women who's son is trying to her to a man called matthew fields who he met whilst <UNK> his friends because of his large house br br the divorce does not like matthew at all and is going out with the local <UNK> who does not like her son john and the same with him br br i am sorry if you disagree with me and i hope i haven't offended you but to all the people who haven't seen this film i leave you with one word of warning don't watch this film
<START> a group of <UNK> rob a train of the gold <UNK> it is carrying in their escape the <UNK> split up the one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk three men have a different part of the clue that will lead to the gold can the <UNK> the <UNK> and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing <UNK> or will they kill each other first the plot is an obvious take off of <UNK> the good the bad and the ugly various scenes in the movie are also lifted from other films by <UNK> <UNK> and more but to me it's done in a way that doesn't show <UNK> to the original work instead any gun can play lovingly parodies some of the biggest films in spaghetti western history the opening scene of three men riding into town and the final face off between the three main stars are a wonderful homage to the <UNK> that came before br br <UNK> adds a lot of nice touches of his own the reflection in the <UNK> wine the <UNK> entrance with the vivid red background and the playful way the gold is discovered in the end although highly unbelievable many of the fight scenes are well staged and directed two fight scenes in particular the market fight and the bath house fight are very nicely done he is also <UNK> to try different things with his camera tight close ups <UNK> shots and shots around <UNK> are all common in any gun can play br br another plus is the cast that <UNK> had to work with george hilton is always good in these movies gilbert <UNK> is literally playing gilbert <UNK> and <UNK> newcomer <UNK> <UNK> holds his own with the two <UNK> veterans the supporting cast features among others <UNK> regular gerard br br any gun can play should not be taken too seriously nice touches of humor can be found throughout the movie if this is possible with an <UNK> it's more of a feel good movie very reminiscent of some of the <UNK> hill bud spencer films
<START> this film is an embarrassment nothing works on any level the direction screenplay acting and editing work together to <UNK> your eyes from the screen everything is inappropriate and incoherent at first you can sit there with and <UNK> <UNK> and laugh at it but very shortly the whole effort of watching just becomes too <UNK>
<START> the plot of this film is not complicated a very attractive young girl goes to europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier there she meets up with her sister's former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister went and gradually the reasons become clear br br but what makes this film so special and <UNK> above the limited plot are the beautiful portrayals of the characters although the older sister's boyfriend is a drop out hippie he has noble ideals moral standards and incredible strengths and although the older sister who we see in flashbacks shares these ideals she doesn't have a sense of <UNK> or balance of how much is too much and although the younger girl is <UNK> loyal to her sister's memory she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was only a normal girl after all br br the most special moment in the film is when the young girl and the sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting their attraction to each other i can't recall ever seeing more beautiful touching romantic <UNK> in <UNK> in a film br br in all these ways this is a truly beautiful film a film to be <UNK> and to be seen again and again 9 out of 10
<START> all ambiguity about michael myers has <UNK> away thanks to this <UNK> <UNK> habit of about with its continuity and pulling relatives out of nowhere this entry introduces the <UNK> angle that he's not just a psycho killer but is actually controlled by which appear as a star <UNK> every halloween and a cult is using him to <UNK> well this film is far from coherent and i lost track of the plot after a while the movie credibility so <UNK> it doesn't have a drop left by the end why does michael put one <UNK> clothes in a <UNK> machine why does an otherwise empty <UNK> have a deadly spike sticking out of the wall does getting <UNK> really make your head explode and so on it's left to donald <UNK> in his <UNK> film role to produce some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given
<START> i could not believe it this film was a total <UNK> of time out of my life the title is appropriate love didn't beat the hell out of me this film did i kept watching and watching and waiting and waiting and hoping for something anything to happen and nothing ever happened nothing <UNK> howard couldn't even save this lame piece of work called a film it was dark and confused and i didn't get who killed the girlfriend in the end the tone and pacing of the film was supposed to be building to a dramatic climactic ending this only served to confuse the audience because the movie just <UNK> along going no where if you want pure torture watch this film
<START> quite good don't expect anything high culture the acting is bad the storyline fails but it is still a fairly nice movie to watch why because it's dark a little bit stupid like unpredictable and just entertaining and fun to watch do not expect anything like i said just see it for yourself and you know what i mean br br it is a movie without a plot or memorable acting but there are enough scenes that will make you laugh cry or at least make you feel compelled to watch it to the end br br this is all i wanted to say br br 7 10
<START> i just spent about 1 5 hours waiting for the movie to begin it didn't the story is vague and uninteresting the speed in the movie is absent and the <UNK> irritating i can't understand why movies like this one are even distributed
<START> while the twilight zone was a wonderful show it was also very uneven with some great episodes some lousy ones and many in between don't believe the die hard fans there were some <UNK> and this was definitely one of them br br in a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on <UNK> castro a near <UNK> peter falk in lots of makeup and a beard <UNK> a magic mirror that allows him to realize who all his enemies are so he can them while i do believe that castro is a thug and dictator and <UNK> of thousands of <UNK> and political prisoners will <UNK> to this it's amazing how this sort of preachy episode actually makes audiences laugh at the american efforts to <UNK> the creep and actually makes castro seem okay think about it <UNK> and company wanted to hurt castro but instead only seemed to be obvious preachy and silly in the process br br it's indeed bad almost laughably bad when seen today
<START> i have seen so many bad reviews on de los that i felt compelled to stand for it or at least i'll try first of all of course that it looks dated it was made in the seventies with very low budget but that's part of it's charm i like contemporary films but also dig the old ones for what they worth i'm not the one to feel the urge to only see or like movies with modern <UNK> and effects besides almost every movie buff likes old fashioned motion pictures who doesn't like films from el <UNK> or plan 9 from outer space no matter it's overall quality in the aspect of pace is just a tool for covering again it's low cost and i think the constant dialogs are in order of a better character and situations development sure alive has better fx but i won't despise the old one just because of that and i don't feel quite attracted to english <UNK> in an event involving people from <UNK> and for me that gives a plus to de los it's like even if from the seventies and based on a true event too would have a better remake now due to the advance of technology but i think i would stick to that one based on the emotions that offers regardless it's production date br br all of this is based in the impact that had on me because the first time i saw it was on tv and nowadays i don't think it has lost some of it's primal force of course it's been a long time and i've seen tons of better movies in every aspect of cinema but that doesn't <UNK> it's true value it's not a bad film and i place it above alive without <UNK> just give it a break
<START> i honestly thought this movie was going to be cheesy even though i've liked alvin and the <UNK> for a long time i was was very wrong it was great it has been the best movie i have seen since october in my opinion it's the movie everyone should see this holiday season enchanted i thought anyway was awful the golden <UNK> was alright but the ending was pretty crappy to his dark <UNK> fans and i am legend well i haven't seen that yet or national <UNK> 2 but it looks alright br br i'm not about to give anything away but this movie is great for anyone especially kids
<START> this production was quite well done for a television original providing a very appropriate original <UNK> on <UNK> work to make the frame story work well the film begins with <UNK> arriving home everyone who has read the book knows that will happen anyway the frame story of the book has <UNK> crazed confusion in sections for example he is horrified that he will <UNK> little people in england because he has just returned from a land of giants but the film has all the book sections within one long voyage when <UNK> <UNK> his travels the editing cuts from england to the travel are very effective i confess i found them <UNK> and irritating at first then they became natural by the end moreover they have become a welcome addition to the story as he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience more and more people listen to his compelling fantasy even though they doubt its truth for example his hatred of filthy <UNK> and admiration of pure logic from the fourth section comes across well when he is defending his own sanity the <UNK> between events in england and similar events or scenes in the tale is very effective for example ripping the cloth from the table to suggest the motion of <UNK> a group of ships is inspired filming the addition of <UNK> family threatened by the <UNK> doctor works well swift only hints at this by having the long suffering wife protest against further <UNK> it becomes a natural part of this story the casting and acting were competent throughout some roles were <UNK> omar mad magician is superb <UNK> little emperor is <UNK> delightfully toward <UNK> many specific complaints made by other writers here strike me as simple personal <UNK> which after all is what we are about here i read the <UNK> version several times a year from fourth grade on i may have escaped the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times since and i had to start it again as i began reading about this film while the <UNK> version is superior to any previous film it does not replace the book however i think it will bring many readers to the book if you have not read the book enjoy this movie then go to the source if you appreciate the satire in it find <UNK> a modest <UNK> and his letters both are <UNK> attacking the wretched treatment of ireland and the irish during <UNK> time the <UNK> cheap <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> being dumped on ireland these were <UNK> light weight not good for face value in paying <UNK> and official <UNK> the <UNK> from <UNK> satire caused the <UNK> to be sent to another <UNK> british territory the american <UNK> the universal satire in <UNK> book and this movie just poke fun they cannot change human nature give <UNK> experiences a chance i think you will find them thought provoking and entertaining
<START> carole lombard stars in this transition period film this film is a typical example of a very early <UNK> first practical sound film was the jazz singer <UNK> overall the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic br br the viewer may easily note that the actors are still acting for a silent film and this combined with the overly <UNK> overly earnest dialog it seems most likely a <UNK> <UNK> drama coach was employed <UNK> to teach the silent actors to speak lines creates some rather comical scenes which were not at all intended to be comical br br carole <UNK> later great acting ability is all but <UNK> underneath all the broad gestures melodrama and eager <UNK> br br mainly interesting as an historical curiosity of the period and for it's completely <UNK> comedy camp value
<START> in fact it was awful the main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time it was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends also they chose not to bother coming up with a story sure these are ways to cut cost but are they smart ways of keeping costs down no they aren't at the very least they could have found a middle school student in a creative writing course those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure at the very least they could have read up on 3 act structure but acting obviously wasn't a <UNK> either watching these <UNK> run around in funny clothing that was stupid by 1980's standards was an embarrassment the fact that none of these actors committed suicide in <UNK> is probably a testament to the limited distribution this film received had the actors actually seen the final result of their hard work there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the brooklyn bridge br br i'd give this movie 10 10 stars but it only deserves 1 for being released at all this movie should be shown to film students everywhere it's better than 90 of student films i've seen and wow is this movie a piece of
<START> it was tough watching harrison ford <UNK> over nothing <UNK> scott thomas should have slapped this guy and told him to take a <UNK> br br save your money don't even bother with a rental <UNK> unless you need a good <UNK>
<START> if you're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies i guess it's kind of like <UNK> down at a car crash you can't do better than this the plot is inane the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you'll ever see 4 thumbs down seriously i have no idea how the director and the actors can sleep at night it's painful and yet hysterically funny to watch and i highly recommend it for those who want to <UNK> themselves for something if you can watch this crap without <UNK> you're a better man than i'll ever be i wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was getting himself and his money into
<START> is absolutely hot as hell in this movie but really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch br br minor spoilers as per usual the main character b is the sane one of the bunch b has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all <UNK> he applies to he's known for making fake <UNK> so an acceptance letter is no problem br br because <UNK> dad is a hard and suspicious of this university he's never heard of b gets his friend <UNK> to design a website for the university <UNK> has been accepted to a great college and is in fear of being arrested for fraud he's very quick with witty lines but his flaw is he wants to be accepted socially too much br br <UNK> hands and <UNK> are the three stooges that follow b along <UNK> got a zero on his and has no thought process he's constantly <UNK> battle <UNK> but he's very good at making which gets him a lot of hot girls somehow hands was a great football player who didn't receive the <UNK> he was counting on and turns to <UNK> to cover his lack of <UNK> <UNK> was preparing to go to <UNK> since the 1st grade and was not accepted she spends her time <UNK> br br uncle ben was my favorite character picture lewis black playing himself if you have no reason to see this movie then see it for lewis black and <UNK> hill they're amazing br br monica is a <UNK> love interest as most of these stories go she's more popular than him and doesn't even notice him until half way through the movie unlike many other stories though b actually gets her and keeps her until the end monica is actually a good character on her own but of course she's primarily there for b to adore br br there are more supporting students at the made up college who are fun to watch a d d 's name is self <UNK> and funny enough he ends up in the <UNK> class <UNK> is a hot ex stripper who falls head over heels for a chance to go to school and eventually gets a crush on <UNK> maurice is an ex military idiot who got his g i bill and wants to study rock <UNK> roll in college the final guy is only known as freaky student who thinks he can blow things up with his mind <UNK> who have little faith in him wait until the end of the movie br br of course the villains are the dean of an <UNK> university his student body president the <UNK> girlfriend and their circle of friends br br every character is lovable i believe this movie has a good plot and is well done despite what a lot of people say even thought the overall story is predictable the characters keep you guessing and make the movie great go see this film i give it 9 out of 10
<START> i have to say that i had low expectations for the movie before viewing it all the people around said it was great but i perfectly knew what they like they like song which is indeed great they like the amazing special effects which had <UNK> a lot they like the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love affleck who according to my opinion is a really bad actor who tried not to be one failed and now he is nothing and all these things plus the reviews and the ratings i read in internet gave me a clue the movie would be a huge disappointment since i am a big disaster kind of movies fan well i've been right but at least i was prepared br br the movie is really commercial it's been said but i will say it as again we have over 100 million budget we have a romance between hollywood stars ben affleck and <UNK> tyler and many other famous actors who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree on becoming a part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names aren't written with big letters on the screen such as billy bob <UNK> and steve <UNK> which are highly respected actors that i also like a lot they could play many characters in many different kind of movies they could <UNK> they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes on the whole they could turn small movies into really interesting funny or dramatic motion pictures people love and will always love such as <UNK> in <UNK> case or a simple plan <UNK> and to be honest i am really disappointed they took part of <UNK> <UNK> plays a smart and <UNK> man involved in politics if i remember correctly <UNK> is one of the members of the deep core <UNK> team which is sent to save the world by destroying the <UNK> which is about to <UNK> the world br br what i didn't like well i guess i've been already understood i pointed out bad factors the story is dull <UNK> and silly it is so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that it's ridiculous at least movies like deep impact and godzilla have something special that might be considered as art at least it ain't that obvious that the movie is made of financial purposes other than that bad performances from all the huge stars the jokes ain't funny the lines are absurd and sometimes they doesn't make sense at all in fact i recently read that on the stage ben affleck has asked bay whether it would be easier if they teach <UNK> to <UNK> than <UNK> to becomes <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> has been simply shut up which is a really funny story which perfectly shows the desperation br br and <UNK> i'll give an explanation why i give 4 to the movie well i like don't want to miss a thing and i was impressed by the special effects which are obviously the only good thing in the movie the first scene is memorable these are the the only 2 good things i liked about the movie michael bay is an average director but the rock and both bad boys were hundreds of times better than <UNK> which was is and will always be one big bad movie
<START> 1 bad acting br br 2 for a bunch of <UNK> on an alien planet it sure looked like home especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background br br 3 terrible plot with stupid making idiotic decisions and <UNK> losing precious survival equipment and clothing left right and center br br 4 cool 70's scifi possibly the only good thing about this movie br br 5 interesting ship at the beginning this crew must have been watching space 1999 a lot too bad it blows up so early the escape ship also got sunk too fast sigh br br 6 <UNK> might find some aspects of the movie interesting in terms of <UNK> group behavior
<START> years ago when i first read john <UNK> the world according to <UNK> i was <UNK> that most of the younger adults with whom i had contact didn't like the book when i loved it i began to understand that it was an age and experience thing i experienced somewhat of a <UNK> <UNK> when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers fully enjoying separate lies is surely an age and experience thing br br in this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple he a successful lawyer she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer they have a <UNK> in london and a home in the country <UNK> well until there enters the villain in the <UNK> of the son of the <UNK> man in the village this guy appears to be a <UNK> from the word go he is <UNK> of everyone and everything including his own children in the traditional form of nice guys finishing last the <UNK> wife <UNK> in an affair with the <UNK> you see the lawyer really is a nice guy but with the marriage killing <UNK> of an organized <UNK> even though he truly loves her he is boring his wife to death the bad boy is far more exciting br br all of this is <UNK> with the hit and run death of a man in the village in which all the facts point to the <UNK> being the driver of the vehicle br br it's easy to determine that this movie doesn't build to a happy ending however it does lead to a very satisfying ending in that the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and probably will be able to conduct their personal lives in a more successful manner br br three excellent actors play the main characters in this film and it is there performances that make the whole thing a pleasure to watch tom <UNK> is perfect as the husband his portrayal shows us a kind man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost touch with the world emily watson shows us a woman who has become so trapped in the role of perfect wife that she has almost lost her knowledge of passion that passion is <UNK> by the character <UNK> played by rupert everett br br if you have reached that point in life in which you understand that everyone has feet of clay and that everyone even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunities makes many many wrong decisions then you will probably enjoy watching these excellent actors creating the lives of three such people this is a beautifully acted and directed adult film about realistic adults
<START> the only reason i haven't given this film an awful rating is because i feel that it was such an awful film in every aspect that it deserves at the very least a 2 10 for not trying br br the plot is the least of your <UNK> as you are slapped in the face with over the top language and scenes like 'the singing <UNK> <UNK> in a poor attempt to shock and disgust seen as the main aim of this film is to shock and the main body of it didn't achieve this the final scene <UNK> manages to <UNK> the memory of this shockingly pointless film and <UNK> its aim to be the most filthy film ever br br a really low budget film awfully acted and the dialogue is shockingly bad br br i give it 0 10 really
<START> the weakness of this comes from the confusing storytelling plots often coming out of nowhere but it really didn't matter because i still enjoyed it to it's full length once you actually accept that this movies not to be taken too seriously then you'll enjoy it even more it's basically a love story a confusing one at first but as it <UNK> it really is something worthwhile sure it's been done so many times before but the complicated version of this is quite inspiring and touching br br the over the top fantasy and cgi was overwhelming at first but i still enjoyed its purpose and people quit whining about how it borrowed from other movies guess what we know and it doesn't really matter because its purpose was to humour and entertain sometimes people has to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start <UNK> about comparing this to hollywood standards is utterly stupid and ignorant it's a totally different style and target audience as far as i'm concerned some the best films i've <UNK> my eyes upon are from eastern producers and directors there's your police story 4 shaolin soccer kung fu <UNK> dragon tiger gate fist of legend hero <UNK> tiger etc i for one like this movie and from the <UNK> us england <UNK> and now australia i'll always be interested in these types of films now try and judge my perception but i warn you i do see things from from the point of view of those 5 countries i've lived in so you better be as experienced and open minded
<START> this is an excellent movie that <UNK> the issue of racism in a delicate and balanced way great performances all round but absolutely outstanding acting by sidney <UNK> br br he makes this movie breathe and alive his portrayal of a guy who struggles against <UNK> and violence is simply mind blowing his acting is <UNK> and delicate and subtle at the same time truly worthy of an oscar <UNK> had to wait because of his skin colour for many more years before the sheer brilliance of his acting was <UNK> by the academy br br cassavetes turns in a great performance too <UNK> troubled and realistic as it has become his hallmark he and <UNK> contrast the forces of <UNK> courage and human transformation through friendship br br the movie is enjoyable and at the same time deeply haunting in its portrayal of racism in the us the irony is that it somehow mirrors the realities under which <UNK> had to work
<START> perhaps it's just me but this movie seemed more like sequel or follow up than the separate project why when it was filmed just few years after the war most of the viewers probably knew why <UNK> was so famous why his death was so important to allied why he was hitler's favorite general but now 50 years later it isn't so obvious anymore br br desert fox the story of <UNK> is a decent war movie but it's just isn't in any way explained how <UNK> did get his <UNK> what was he doing that allied considered him as their best general why their soldiers were so afraid of <UNK> that's what is missing in this movie we see his fame his character his way to treat soldiers and enemies but f e we also see that hitler was complaining about his achievements in africa calling him coward etc so we're missing the big picture here it is the story of <UNK> but unfortunately the desert fox part is missing
<START> if there's one thing i want to <UNK> myself from all the other great reviewers here it's that i am the queen of finding strange movies in <UNK> and dollar stores that said you can't possibly imagine how happy i was when i found this one br br i can even remember that saturday morning when every station it so you were stuck if you wanted to watch something else then again i guess that was the idea as a kid i didn't know if i liked the way all the different characters were stuck together there are some <UNK> that just do not work but i guess the special had it's intended effect don't do drugs because you will have nightmares about the muppets br br now if you watch this as an adult on the other hand you will be treated to the strangest anti drug movie this side of <UNK> madness i think i'll just leave it at that before i get into trouble
<START> <UNK> and the star <UNK> in my opinion is an excellent masterpiece i felt all warm and <UNK> when <UNK> voice of <UNK> and voice of david <UNK> set out to get revenge on the princess voice of <UNK> if you ask me the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical to me she deserved to have <UNK> and seek revenge on him however i liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting in addition i thought that of pat and murky of peter <UNK> were diabolical before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast the direction was flawless and disney has scored a big hit in conclusion i highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who hasn't seen it especially die hard fans of the tv series i guarantee you you'll enjoy it
<START> i stopped watching this film half way through it was just terrible boring contrived subplots a complete lack of the pathos seen in norman bates buffalo bill or steve portrayal of ed <UNK> a movie doesn't have to be historically accurate but the true story of ed <UNK> is so much more interesting than this third rate melodrama that was completely made up for no good reason ed <UNK> as portrayed by kane <UNK> is a cartoon <UNK> the attempts to show the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are just weak <UNK> in recycled style and this movie wanted to be stylish but it even screwed that up fortunately there is a better film of this story <UNK> ed <UNK> told the story <UNK> and offered a few real chills as we watched a sick man not in control of himself steve <UNK> who played ed <UNK> that time was already famous for <UNK> portraying another famous serial killer charles <UNK> his ed had pathos his film is the one to see avoid this mess
<START> i started to watch this show by accident but i love it the fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television especially for kids shows my five year old nephew as most children do would just stare at people who were in <UNK> or had some other type of <UNK> but after he watched <UNK> it just seemed to be a normal <UNK> to him every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say like <UNK> and go on with what ever he was originally doing and yes the animation is a little crude but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the simpsons then this isn't that bad the genie is actually an angel who is there to help <UNK> learn lessons in life he can not walk some else said he could walk some of the time i've seen every episode and he never to my <UNK> walked he is a he has no feeling below his <UNK> he mentions it in an episode as for the humor if you can get a copy of the episode which <UNK> boy bands you will instantly love this show
<START> <UNK> <UNK> as i watch <UNK> ii i contemplate the inherent <UNK> of the <UNK> croc <UNK> horror genre many <UNK> may blame the poor acting nonsensical screenplay or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the <UNK> movie to <UNK> these reasons may indeed be <UNK> factors but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an <UNK> movie that is at the heart of the <UNK> br br you see the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic life size <UNK> and the cgi technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world <UNK> and characters even with clever cinematography you can only film the semi dark depths of the sea semi dark forest semi dark cave semi dark <UNK> so many times before the sci fi <UNK> becomes bored with the genre entirely the <UNK> sub genre that is br br what can be done you ask i wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness but another <UNK> needs to be explored we can't really go back to the days of the fade to black cue that someone has been killed or can we if we can't reach the goal of realism we have to compensate in other ways such as plot twists innuendo and photo <UNK> br br it will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of <UNK> so common to the <UNK> sub genre will be <UNK>
<START> if you're tired by the same repetitive <UNK> material that the mainstream movie industry releases you'll enjoy you are alone it is thought provoking well shot and riveting br br without revealing anything that you don't find out in the first few minutes of the movie this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an <UNK> and is discovered by her neighbor the vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come br br through their discussion you explore two shifting views of prostitution depression loneliness yet the movie is not depressing it talks about dark things without being depressing br br as a viewer your emotions and <UNK> notions are moved around but gently you come out of it with a lot to think about i like that in a movie
<START> this was one of the first color films i have seen at the cinema when i was a child it is good to remember it the girl liz taylor who later became a beautiful woman starred together with the tiny and excellent actor mickey rooney the content of the film plot is good for all ages good <UNK> and behavior good <UNK> of parents particularly her mother is something to take into account our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose <UNK> loves the horses and racing them and <UNK> taylor rooney brought her to an international horse racing competition in england where at the end the young <UNK> won but was <UNK> because of being female
<START> i ordered this movie on the internet as it is very difficult to get turkish movies where we live i've heard so much about the tv series from my friends and practically everyone in turkey i was expecting to see a breakthrough in turkish cinema what a disappointment br br me and my husband who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of turkish landscape and turkish dialogues in it only watched it all the way through because we had paid 20 for the dvd well that was a boring way of wasting it br br it was confusing at times <UNK> whereas other times <UNK> the storyline was not only confusing but adding a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using some toilet humor in the script to make it <UNK> didn't also work for me br br the american characters were almost too stereotypical that it was neither funny nor realistic and like another user mentioned the turkish customs and lifestyle was irrelevant br br the camera movements had no significance adding a few never seen in them in by the way and broken <UNK> greek style only made the movie even more confusing br br i am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it there are surely worthy movies made by turkish directors which deserve more attention and respect br br i give this movie 1 out of 10
<START> scarlet dawn casts douglas fairbanks jr as a russian baron <UNK> <UNK> by the forces of the russian revolution and now has to <UNK> for himself in a world not terribly <UNK> to former <UNK> he's also not terribly suited for any kind of real work br br doug might have been caught by the <UNK> but for the fact that his former servant nancy <UNK> didn't give him away <UNK> got a big old crush on doug and they do marry once arriving in <UNK> in <UNK> which throughout the film is referred to by its former christian name of they marry and settle down with doug now reduced to <UNK> <UNK> br br but former mistress who's always playing bad girls of a sort on film spots him and offers to have him get back into somewhat the style he was once <UNK> to as part of a <UNK> against father and daughter american tourists guy <UNK> and sheila terry br br good thing this film has the incredibly short running time of only <UNK> minutes usually those were given to b westerns because it's both tedious and melodramatic the ending is rather unbelievable doug knew he was in a <UNK> special and really overacts to cover up the <UNK> of a unbelievable story br br what i didn't understand was that fairbanks was trained in the military profession why didn't he just become a <UNK> soldier after leaving the new soviet union that didn't make sense to me at all br br i'd only see this if i was a dedicated fan of any the main players
<START> i got stuck in traffic i live in <UNK> on the way to the theater at a military base to see superman returns was 15 minutes late and the only other movie playing was see no evil there was no poster up for it and just a short description of the movie on the schedule but my girlfriend and i decided to check it out as soon as i saw it was produced by wwe i just knew it was gonna be awful the few people in the theater were laughing most of the time and it was the first movie that i honestly considered walking out on and i've seen the <UNK> okay i would have walked out of that one but i was too busy sleeping the death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good but other than that it was just stupid
<START> dude i liked buffy and angel as much as the next sci fi freak but this is too much the worst lead actress ever not even david hot pants <UNK> is able to save this crap no wonder i never watch fox  it blows we totally gave it a chance and it continued to suck we watched four or five painful <UNK> episodes i want to kill the <UNK> at the network so bad why is money being spent on this drivel i don't get it and i don't support it and you should never waste your time watching this show unless you like it when your eyes bleed from their <UNK> br br crap crap crap
<START> i will like to order this movie for the women in treatment i feel that this is a great movie for them to watch i can't fine it no were i have been on ebay and all the other website to order this movie now i am asking you for help to fine out where i can <UNK> this movie at or what to do to get one i will love to show this movie yes i was like this movie and a lot of peoples here in treatment in to see how people can change there life around and move on i think <UNK> post played that move very well she is a great actor i love her movies and if you have any other movie about addiction i will like to order them of the treatment center of women and men so that can look at other people go through what they go through in life
<START> let me just say i love the horror genre to the extent that i see every single one that i can get my hands on regardless except really low quality b movie horrors which i could do without and recently have become a big fan of eastern horrors little did i know that a korean horror would be the one that tops my list beating off <UNK> such as the japanese <UNK> or the american ring or even quality us movies such as the sixth sense and the others and the widely acclaimed hong kong horror 'the <UNK> br br previously 'the had stood as my favourite horror but it seems to me that i prefer the beauty of 'the tale of two <UNK> any day the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation thus allowing repeat viewings although chances are you'll want to watch this again and again just because the movie is so masterfully shot the story is likely one of the best in the genre to date the acting is top notch too from the entire cast and the scares when they come have the potential to <UNK> you like anything within the ring i did find myself glued to the screen at those points unable to take my eyes off br br still i am glad it didn't come back to haunt me later that <UNK> did from the ring after all such feelings are unpleasant and the tale of two sisters leaves you with an uneasy feeling but one that hopefully won't leave you without sleep but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special but do remember if you don't understand the plot after the first viewing a repeat viewing is more than advised i personally didn't have time for this since it was late so i <UNK> through scenes on the dvd some numerous times until i had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net seemed pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation and the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful br br all in all a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same remake its been purchased by <UNK> simply because of the korean content and everyone is advised to catch this in the theaters or on dvds while they can its one of the best you will get unfortunately due to the type of movie this is there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what i did watch it without knowing a single thing except its 'a tale of two <UNK> and be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time
<START> i was extraordinarily impressed by this film it's one of the best sports films i've every seen the visuals in this film are outstanding i love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup the film moves well offering both excitement and drama the cinematography was fantastic br br the acting performances are great i was surprised by young <UNK> <UNK> he does well in this role stephen is also good as the brooding harry peter <UNK> justin and <UNK> <UNK> offer able support the film is gripping and entertaining and for the first time in my life actually made me want to watch a golf <UNK>
<START> br br average adventure movie that took a serious story and it the <UNK> down effect done particularly towards the average script <UNK> away this movie's place as a would be solid classic why water down such a great storyline probably because it deals with sensitive colonial subject matters and the producers do not want to create political heat just quick <UNK> thank you the directing cinematography and soundtrack and acting was good the screenplay was average the charm of connery made up for his wrong <UNK> accent and all the scenes with president t <UNK> were masterpiece takes the costumes sets here was very good too bad we did not get more of a serious historical drama since this is what the story demands only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance adventure movies
<START> i will <UNK> my review into following 5 categories each <UNK> a maximum of 100 if perfect br br visual pleasure 100 this is extremely pleasing movie visually i had a great time watching it <UNK> scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing i also loved seeing the old wooden golf <UNK> and the bag br br director's work 70 bill paxton is more associated to acting but this film shows he's got talent did a decent job br br acting 90 <UNK> <UNK> was very good in his role of francis this guy can act well the rest of the cast was also good br br entertainment value 100 i enjoyed every minute of it it was <UNK> entertaining br br script <UNK> based on a true story and therefore it makes the film that much more special it was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene till the very end br br br br my advice definitely a must watch for all the sports lovers especially golf you all will love it anyone who is looking for a nice entertaining movie and doesn't hate sports can watch it br br br br 10 10
<START> i am new at this so bear with me please i am a big fan of surface i thought the script and the computer graphics were exceptional as good as any sci fi flick i've seen at the theater in <UNK> the tv guide said season finale the <UNK> for the show said something to the effect of and now for the season finale of surface season finale not series finale i couldn't wait for fall to get here to see was going to happen next so fall gets here and it's nowhere to be found if nbc isn't going to pick it up what about sci fi or usa it seems to me that bay watch didn't last long on abc then usa picked it up and it went gang <UNK> i bet abc was <UNK> ha if not a series then at least a mini series to give all us loyal fans closure what happened to our guy's trapped in the church <UNK> was the creature in the did he have a does the <UNK> guy come over to our side there are so many unanswered questions <UNK> for listening to me <UNK>
<START> while some of the things in <UNK> are dumb and unnecessary the overall package is good br br <UNK> follows ryan <UNK> and his friends <UNK> and <UNK> brandon trying to win back <UNK> ex br br the story is followed and developed surprisingly well it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of jackass or <UNK> la <UNK> although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story br br and for all the <UNK> fan boys and girls there are multiple sequences of <UNK> <UNK> perhaps the weakest aspect of the film phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances even don <UNK> got a bigger but pointless roll br br if you are hoping to see a comedy and escape <UNK> then stay away from this movie otherwise enjoy the time you spend with it if you can find it there are some truly funny scenes in this film
<START> happy days was produced and broadcast from the mid 1970's to the early 1980's and seems to get more ridiculous with age at the time of its broadcast most viewers who grew up in the 1950's were in middle age with families and the scenes at <UNK> diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them the <UNK> was of course the coolest of the cool although the actor henry <UNK> to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle <UNK> cunningham was the all american blond haired kid who would probably be elected student body president was <UNK> best friend the star of the show has to have a best friend i guess and ralph was the bumbling sidekick to the <UNK> if not the entire group i loved it when the <UNK> would beat up on poor ralph and there was mel the middle aged <UNK> who ran <UNK> diner and of course who could forget the appearance of <UNK> was this really the 1950's ironically films produced during the 1950's such as rebel without a cause and the wild one have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portrays br br unfortunately the tv show happy days is not in the same league as rebel without a cause or american for that matter happy days may have captured some aspects of the 1950's with its <UNK> diner <UNK> boxes cool cars and tacky <UNK> shirts but it is more a nostalgic <UNK> done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal american had something to say about young americans in the 1950's whereas happy days seemed more about what middle aged people of the 1970's wished the 1950's had been like the result was a kind of watered down <UNK> that really has nothing to do with the 1950's happy days is at best a comedy fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950's as its backdrop as pointed out by another reviewer the all american kid <UNK> cunningham would probably have been <UNK> for <UNK> the likes of a drop out like <UNK> and mel would probably <UNK> <UNK> from entering his diner br br a quick history happy days was originally a pilot called love in the happy days that was rejected for broadcast comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the <UNK> broadcast show love american style which was often aired in place of baseball games that had out or other unexpected programming and or <UNK> in short love american style was a throw away show that contained all these one episode comedy pilots that never made it to a <UNK> debut love in the happy days did appear as a love american style show sometime in the early 1970's but at the time tv executives could not <UNK> how a show about 1950's young people would be popular particularly during the hey day of comedy shows <UNK> around middle aged people such as the mary tyler moore show and its subsequent spin offs such <UNK> the bob <UNK> show and all in the family how things have changed since now most tv sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle aged people like the plague br br subsequently one of the young stars of love in the happy days a child actor from the andy griffith show named ron howard got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called american directed by the relatively unknown george lucas whose previous <UNK> <UNK> had bombed miserably at the box office even when it was premiered to movie executives again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950's could become popular because it didn't fit with what had been popular in the past although they didn't realize that much of the movie going audience had been young in the 1950's as everyone knows the movie was a huge hit and studio executives recognized that they had completely <UNK> their audience somewhere during the theatrical run of american tv executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like american they brought it back with the original cast plus henry <UNK> as the <UNK> re titled it happy days and the rest is tv history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970's br br happy days now seems ridiculous the characters are flat and cardboard never being more or less than what they <UNK> are the issues they deal with are trivial and their reactions appear mindless and even silly nowadays the character of the <UNK> seems to be a caricature of well the <UNK> was the idea to be a kind of parody of marlon <UNK> character in the wild one looking on the show with fresh eyes i feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950's with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks this is definitely a show that has not <UNK> the test of time american has many of the <UNK> appearances of happy days but it had an edge it had an honesty about the characters and their issues happy days took the look of american but failed to take its heart
<START> i just saw the movie through netflix i was intrigued by the way the movie was described but in the end it was better i was moved in many different directions while watching this movie i was filled with hurt hate angry <UNK> pain and finally relief to look at the young man accused would break your heart and convince you that they had the wrong person the <UNK> of the police makes you because just as the rodney king beating brought to light the brutality of the police this movie brings forth the total lack of moral <UNK> in these police and the fact that they beat this boy and got away with it only <UNK> you more br br but i have to tell you i fell in love with the attorney <UNK> guinness one of my favorite lines when he was telling us what an a hole on of the cops was the cop told him to go on keep sucking on that cancer stick <UNK> guinness told the cop 'i always have a cigarette before sex ' i was letting him know i was going to screw him br br i have a new respect for some of the law in this country
<START> <UNK> wars is a hilarious 12 minute short film parody of the original star wars movie which was released just a few months after star wars in 1977 this film uses household <UNK> as space ships and star wars look a like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in <UNK> fits of laughter this film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired mel brooks to write his star wars parody movie called <UNK> br br this is my favorite parody film and i recommend it to anyone who is familiar with star wars and has a good sense of humor br br
<START> gene <UNK> never let his fans down his death ended sci fi legacy that will never be matched earth the final conflict was proof his pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and <UNK> produced but somewhere along the way the <UNK> touch was lost the loss of lead kevin <UNK> william <UNK> definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work the story involves the human race being visited by the an extra <UNK> race who dub themselves 'the after 3 years they have given earth new <UNK> helpful information about the universe and more many question their intentions here on earth the main <UNK> on earth between the races is <UNK> parker and he is to many the most <UNK> questions <UNK> just why are they here what are their goals is aware of any suspected plots against the humans there is an underground group led by millionaire <UNK> jonathan doors david who <UNK> his millions to investigate the by the end of the first season things are going well seems <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doors in his investigation while working with and the as a <UNK> in the middle of the 2nd season things start <UNK> and the once terrific and fascinating series <UNK> <UNK> mostly because <UNK> had died and was not around to guide the producers of whom his wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was co producer still the first season remains intriguing and fun to watch
<START> a group of with a sad history take an author on a adventure through an <UNK> cave in <UNK> in these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic <UNK> the <UNK> has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years and that twist seems to be taken from an x file i like to give every film the benefit of the doubt but there were just too many little <UNK> for me here the camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up not being a it doesn't really matter to me whether the filming was realistic there is entirely too much unnecessary from supposedly experienced by the last half you're saying out loud one of two things  oh just shut up and concentrate on saving yourselves or i hope you all die by the end it must have been very <UNK> for these decent actors to make this film a <UNK> amount of gore and nothing special in the dialog or characters while you're pretty confident you know what's going on by the end the last five minutes explain all the details but i would have had a better opinion of the movie if they would have left the last minute on the cutting room floor it just wasn't necessary i suggest you hit <UNK> immediately after your <UNK> are confirmed and save yourself the setup for the sequel i've long thought that the film industry should share a <UNK> restaurant <UNK> <UNK> scheme you pay for the <UNK> to make the film before you go in but any <UNK> for the film come from the <UNK> you give when you leave the cinema i can't blame what i don't like about this film on its low budget
<START> i wanted to dog this movie but somehow i can't find it in myself to do that br br <UNK> a <UNK> of fighting styles it's li vs li in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy br br this is one of those movies where the story carries the performances <UNK> acting is extremely amateurish <UNK> and stiff for most of this movie right up to the very end at first i tricked myself into believing he was just doing that for one of his two characters you know to show a difference in personalities but it appeared to be <UNK> or a lack of talent it did get a bit better more relaxed toward the end but that wasn't enough to save his performance jet <UNK> acting does improve as his career moves forward i don't hate his acting i just hated him in this br br i also have to say that the effects were very b class effects what effects there are br br the story itself had great potential it was uniquely creative daring and fresh unfortunately either the budget was not ample enough to <UNK> better lighting effects film quality and some acting lessons or the director just did not care enough to bother with these little details he also did not bother with the science in the science fiction a fact which was a great <UNK> to this film br br the fight sequences were a bit one sided as he seemed to give more to one character and little to the other but all in all the story line made for a very enjoyable attempt br br as enjoyable as this was i couldn't help but think all the way through that this was just one of those movies that you can't help but watch it for what it should've been rather than what it is br br it rates a 6 0 10 on the b scale br br that's a 4 2 10 on the a scale for having a good plot from br br the fiend
<START> supreme <UNK> is a movie about a female assassin who works for the u s government she has to kill a known tv reporter but <UNK> his life when she sees that he has a little daughter because she hasn't killed him she becomes the next target of her <UNK> br br the script isn't good although i've seen worse b movies a hit man with <UNK> the government killing innocent people in the name of fighting terror what's next aliens <UNK> the victim no supreme <UNK> will never win any award because of the script and the acting isn't any better i'm afraid a few better known actors michael madsen and <UNK> <UNK> who clearly had a lot of bills to pay and <UNK> accepted to play in this movie together with some other actors who probably don't even know what a camera really looks like don't do any good to the movie either br br so why should you watch this movie well if you haven't got anything better to do but to watch some action flick and you are tired of the 10 <UNK> of <UNK> or the a team than this might be the movie you want to see otherwise you better leave it alone i give it a 3 10
<START> very glad to see that this excellent film gets such high marks from the users of imdb the best years of their lives remains the finest cinematic statement about veterans returning from war that i have come across easily the finest performance by the often overlooked <UNK> march in fact the entire cast shines including music legend <UNK> who treats us all with a subtle version of his classic lazy river i would recommend this excellent film to anyone who loves movies
<START> story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on halloween night in all my life i have never seen such a cheesy film but it is so d m entertaining you can forgive its bad acting effects direction and script this is the best movie created for the halloween season since the original halloween and when they introduce <UNK> <UNK> character for the first time she is butt naked in the shower for like 5 mins goodness they just don't get any better than this rush and buy this tape right away 5 10
<START> director john <UNK> of shakespeare in love fame gives us another pretty bad film in ethan the plot centers around a new <UNK> coming into the town of where he learns the story of the local crippled man ethan sick wife and one time romantic <UNK> with the maid adapted by richard nelson from <UNK> prize winning author edith novel this film isn't interesting in the least thanks to an <UNK> weak script and poor direction that turns scenes that are supposed to be poignant into laughable <UNK> still there are other aspects apart of the film that work the cinematography is well done rachel portman contributes a lovely score and while no one is at their best liam neeson joan allen patricia arquette and <UNK> <UNK> work well in their roles but overall ethan is only <UNK> worthwhile and is easily forgotten
<START> this must be one of the funniest danish movies ever made <UNK> <UNK> and thomas bo <UNK> are hilarious as they drive across sweden i don't know how <UNK> <UNK> does it but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way but if you don't understand danish i am not referring to your <UNK> here don't waste your time on this  i don't think it would work with subtitles
<START> lives on br br ray <UNK> taylor cast jamie foxx <UNK> washington <UNK> king <UNK> powell curtis armstrong and sharon warren written by taylor and james l white rating br br hit the road jack and don't come more no more no more no more who would've thought that this immortal line that has almost become a <UNK> <UNK> for broken relationships in popular culture was conceived over a <UNK> <UNK> ray charles was a genius and if there was one thing that he knew <UNK> and lived for it was music so in a lifetime that comprised <UNK> poverty a desperate struggle with darkness guilt drugs and painful affairs ray still found moments when inspiration hit him out of nowhere and words and notes took their own shape to form an instant eternal classic br br there are some lives that deserve to be transformed on the silver screen ray <UNK> life was one of them it almost comes as a shock to learn that this project had no studio backing until it was completed and that backing probably came after the initial <UNK> where jamie <UNK> performance was <UNK> and predicted as a <UNK> oscar winner in <UNK> voices jamie foxx as ray almost convinces us that it is indeed ray charles performing on screen and not an actor <UNK> from the crooked all knowing smile to the bent <UNK> of not so much a handicapped but a man dancing through his demons foxx captures every essence of the actual ray charles ray was a complicated man he never <UNK> sympathy and very rarely showed it himself an <UNK> businessman he <UNK> his success at any cost sometimes at the price of losing his loved ones he never <UNK> for his <UNK> ways and always <UNK> that he loved his family which we are convinced he did he liked sex it was as simple as that but beneath all there also existed a ray that was afraid of darkness imagine the horrors of a blind man afraid of darkness his fear was because of his guilt ray was convinced that he was the reason for his brother's death and his whole life was spent trying to redeem himself ray was a maverick who <UNK> <UNK> with jazz an <UNK> <UNK> practice in the 50's but his intentions weren't to <UNK> he was simply practicing the only way he knew of getting close to god br br it is hard to capture such an <UNK> life as that of ray and that is perhaps where the movie fails we are never really allowed to get close to ray as a person we know him only as much as we see him his relationships especially with <UNK> <UNK> king aren't explored in detail and the script barely passes over della <UNK> <UNK> washington <UNK> wife who everyone knows was a rock by his side and the biggest <UNK> of all is the rushed almost abrupt climax it's as if the director suddenly realized he was out of stock and called for a pack up nonetheless is definitely recommended for a flawless performance from jamie foxx and an able stellar ensemble the songs and age create a sense of nostalgia and we get a genuine feeling that the film is made with sincerity br br <UNK> <UNK> br br note is nominated in six categories at this year's academy awards including best picture best director and best actor jamie foxx br br rating br br poor average good very good excellent br br 19th <UNK> 2005
<START> larry bishop is 60 years old dirty and not good looking yet in this movie he's like a drug towards the women in their br br a lot of movies have been claimed to be sexist but if any movie deserves that title it's this one br br i can't even count how many boobs there were shown in this movie probably more then hours larry bishop spend writing the script br br the script is ridiculous bishop and his gang argue bike party have sex kill people and the next day they argue bike party have sex kill people and the third day well you get the idea br br i like eric <UNK> and considering what he had to work with he did pretty good as <UNK> br br unfortunately this movie is about larry <UNK> character who is so one dimensional it's not even funny br br he's also a horrible actor and apparently he never intended to do the lead himself but everybody he asked said no so what was he to do once he realized he was gonna do the lead himself he probably did a re write of the script so that he could touch up more ladies br br although visually it's kind of good looking at least the biker scenes and eric <UNK> isn't half bad this movie is just a big mess br br i hope to never see larry bishop in front of the camera again

<START> this movie is a window on the world of britain in 1973 a world of holiday camps <UNK> and birds i was actually at while this was being filmed so it's fascinating to see where i as a kid and what a world we have left behind the <UNK> such as it is concerns stan and jack's attempts to turn a job at a holiday camp 25 <UNK> a week into an opportunity for chasing young women and <UNK> up <UNK> they are joined by the rest of <UNK> family and some laughs are to be had from arthur michael robbins and anna karen <UNK> as well as the sheer <UNK> of <UNK> but the idea that young women would see anything <UNK> in stan <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> jack bob grant is just <UNK> harmless enough in its time now it's just a <UNK> from a <UNK> age
<START> <UNK> of time was an <UNK> project but ended up being a pretentious movie this film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner the plot of <UNK> of time is fairly simple and comes down to two words love triangle because of those love <UNK> crossing stories jealousy hate and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters the narrative part is seen through <UNK> eyes leslie cheung <UNK> <UNK> lives in the desert where he acts as to various <UNK> and becomes the tool of destiny through which vengeance is achieved unfortunately <UNK> of time fails in telling these simple stories of love and hate wong <UNK> <UNK> lost himself driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience in fact beside the casting of beautiful actors men and women everything else is a failure in this movie dialogs are and not original at all <UNK> quality is very much the editing is one of the worst ever seen at least by me in the <UNK> genre and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unappealing even the attempt of building artistic scenes is not always achieved the so call erotic women on a horse scene is ridiculous not erotic and useless wong <UNK> <UNK> wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is first about how a plot is told by forgetting that he delivers an awkward movie that doesn't even fulfill its artistic objective
<START> <UNK> been interested in watching this ever since it was <UNK> as the worst film ever on an entry devoted to 1950s sci fi cinema in a british <UNK> from the early 1980s entitled <UNK> incidentally the leonard <UNK> film guide also awarded this the <UNK> bomb rating when it came out on dvd last year i became interested in <UNK> the camp box set in which it was included along with queen of outer space 1958 and the giant <UNK> 1959 however since recently <UNK> queen on dvd r i had put paid to the idea br br happily <UNK> just stumbled upon the film on <UNK> â however the print <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> dvd which is said to <UNK> a surprisingly pleasant looking transfer but rather a <UNK> tv not so much that the detail is lost in other words it was like watching the film in <UNK> as opposed to black and white anyway to get to the matter at hand i have to admit that in a way i was disappointed the film <UNK> prove to be the laugh fest i had anticipated all this time <UNK> calls it actually i found it quite engaging â and thankfully brief at a little over an hour in length some undeniably amusing bits remain though â such as when the old nurse starts screaming her head off at the sight of the 50 foot woman and when the deputy almost runs over his chief and the leading butler in his enthusiasm to be of assistance in such an unusual case neither did the special effects hit me as being the <UNK> again on film â though certainly embarrassingly bad br br o k so the idea that an alien in giant sized human form clad in cave man <UNK> and <UNK> to boot coming to earth in a big ball shaped spaceship and apparently after the <UNK> <UNK> is utter nonsense â and his quasi transparent appearance does it no <UNK> at really <UNK> the human story that holds our attention relatively speaking the character of the <UNK> husband <UNK> very interesting but his two women are wealthy but <UNK> alcoholic wife allison hayes and ambitious girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> also involved in the narrative are faithful servant already mentioned a couple of cops one of them as noted elsewhere being <UNK> goofy and as many doctors one of whom is named dr cushing and another a <UNK> <UNK> called in when hayes starts growing in size after being exposed to radiation br br of course the film could be seen as the <UNK> female version of the incredible <UNK> man 1957 â though it be fair to compare the two further as the jack arnold richard <UNK> classic is far more psychological intellectual in approach actually hayes <UNK> seem to be that bothered with her and in fact takes advantage of it in order to teach her husband a lesson however her rampage â exaggerated in movie posters of the era â is rather quaint especially when considering that it only occurs in the last ten minutes or so when not shown the damage caused by her enormous but highly unconvincing hand especially when <UNK> the puppet <UNK> supposed to be her husband <UNK> mostly seen walking in long shot and almost from behind with her size even inconsistent in <UNK> to the buildings she passes by still demise via <UNK> when she <UNK> into an <UNK> cable is competently done br br finally i followed this with its 1993 tv remake with <UNK> hannah as the titular creature â which i rented specifically for this purpose
<START> i think that just sums up this film watch it and you'll find out why the acting of the lead character john is really really bad and he has no on screen charisma whatsoever it's very funny because of this thought as is the ending where <UNK> the bad guy despite the fact he is <UNK> and has <UNK> brilliant
<START> i have watched this movie countless times and never failed to be <UNK> by it's <UNK> simplicity sincerity and goodness great characterizations by all of the cast and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting role i confess i fell in love with <UNK> in 1970 and she still touches me today shown on tv in new zealand on christmas day the <UNK> present i could have had
<START> synopsis the sequel to the acclaimed silence of the <UNK> <UNK> is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver not only is it not as clever as its predecessor it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie just a totally boring time <UNK> do not be fooled by the media hype and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally <UNK> for the rest of their <UNK> because of the brain eating scene in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad <UNK> why so many people in this forum are claiming that h is not all bad and worth watching on the big screen etc is beyond me and it is not so bad it's good either it is just plain boring i normally respect other people's opinion but in this case i have to say that they clearly can not tell from shine <UNK> maybe they have fallen prey to the media hype maybe they have never seen a <UNK> scott movie before and were impressed by his excessive use of back lighting smoke and the <UNK> <UNK> fans h is totally devoid of suspense instead we get endless scenes of <UNK> <UNK> through an english speaking a totally unconvincing and <UNK> plot with more holes than a fishing net after seeing h i actually lay awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot and when i wrote them down i quickly filled 6 pages in small type before forcing myself to stop rather than wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen i would advise you to wait until it comes on tv in a couple of years and then to go to bed early br br 1 10 br br below are a couple of extra bones i have to pick with <UNK> br br h is the sequel to despite what some people in this forum are claiming and even though was a very tough act to follow there are sequels which are en par with their predecessors itself was the sequel to michael <UNK> <UNK> based on thomas <UNK> red dragon and even though the first episode was a very enjoyable film was even better another example would be the alien series <UNK> by <UNK> director <UNK> scott so much for the theory of <UNK> sequels in any case being a sequel is no excuse for a film being utter crap br br this movie has a renowned director it is based on a novel by the same author as the cast is strictly a list great cinematography big budget first rate script writers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the end result is simply a fart in the church so what went wrong i think a lot of the blame has to go to the film's producer <UNK> here is my interpretation <UNK> produced <UNK> which despite of all its qualities was a commercial flop disappointed he gave the rights for the <UNK> <UNK> character to <UNK> for free allowing jonathan <UNK> to make and the rest is cinema history <UNK> then had to wait for ten more years he is now <UNK> until thomas harris finally came up with the sequel novel i think at this point <UNK> had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the the cake before he pops his <UNK> br br another aspect that i find thoroughly annoying about this flick is that it is being given so much <UNK> hype in the media i mean it is boring yet one of the highest <UNK> productions ever so there is no need to give it free publicity and while most reviewers <UNK> on about how <UNK> the scenes in are and why jodie foster did not participate the simple fact that this movie is an utter utter utter flop goes <UNK> but there is more not only is <UNK> being hyped through the roof it is also being used as a media agenda <UNK> for a <UNK> of documentaries usually the left overs from similar productions in the wake of about serial killers <UNK> and <UNK> however not only does h not even pretend to be realistic <UNK> has also <UNK> to be a serial killer he now only kills out of necessity or to help <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is not even mentioned because we already know so there is no need to create a profile and there is also no <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the drugged up paul his own brain so that makes it <UNK> unaware auto <UNK> try making a documentary out of that br br much has been said about the acting mainly whether <UNK> moore can replace jodie foster and anthony hopkins who plays the lead <UNK> <UNK> is usually given a lot of praise i think all of these discussions are <UNK> there are several of my favourite actors in this movie namely liotta <UNK> and moore but the script simply does not give them anything to work with same for hopkins there is no development in his character and he is not being challenged in any way and by the way he plays nearly identical characters in all of his movies only that in h he has to do the odd bit of murder and is getting paid the <UNK> sum of 11 million to do it

<START> this must rate with the worst films i have ever seen it just wasn't funny my wife fell asleep i suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all <UNK> eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you if you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an english radio <UNK> saying the f word a lot hilarious the <UNK> in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to <UNK> the boredom what did happen in the strip club made no sense at all there was a great deal of <UNK> by the lead character with whom i developed no sympathy at all <UNK> <UNK> was hardly in the film presumably just there to make people think it was a serious attempt at producing a film the bad guys were unconvincing and carried as much menace as a dead sheep
<START> terrific acting by the 5 stars makes this one a must see br br based on a stage play the silver <UNK> is about mother love at its worst the film was very controversial for its implied homosexuality of the younger son and the mother's unnatural romantic feelings for both sons br br irene dunne stars as the new bride and <UNK> who travels with husband joel <UNK> to visit the family before heading off to new york city for their new jobs but something seems wrong br br the mother laura hope <UNK> seems rude to the younger son's eric <UNK> fiancée frances dee but dunne puts such thoughts aside and ignores a few of the strange things the mother says then she finds out her room is down the hall from and his room mother's room br br later she walks in as mummy is in <UNK> and kissing him on the lips good night mummy has also been working on <UNK> and getting him to doubt his feelings for dee everything blows up and with dee running into the snowy night toward the frozen pond as the boys run after her mummy shouts from the window for boys to come back and get their <UNK> dee falls through the ice and is rescued br br as the girls leave the house the following morning dunne lets mummy know what she thinks of her and her <UNK> to the boys but mummy has a tight hold <UNK> illness and forever <UNK> of her sacrifices the girls leave but the boys stay behind br br <UNK> is magnificent as the <UNK> mother repeating her stage role it's a part few actresses would dare play the sexual overtones are incredible for a 1933 film and <UNK> take advantage of her best film role dunne is also excellent as she tries to <UNK> the course without losing <UNK> dee has some excellent scenes after she gets dumped by <UNK> <UNK> all 5 stars are terrific in this drama that is <UNK> underrated and unknown br br a neglected gem for anyone who likes great acting
<START> this is a rip off from <UNK> br br bad casting br br bad direction br br bad music br br and the list goes on br br well there was no direction since story scenes and setting were lifted straight off of other movie br br even fight sequence is copied one with the <UNK> was from kill bill and another one with fire <UNK> was from either a jet <UNK> or jackie chan's movie i am not able to recall the name of this movie br br stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing br br cannot expected something original from any of the <UNK> any more
<START> this is s superbly crafted top notch washington thriller directed by the talented <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> screenwriter jeff maguire who seems to have done very little over the years so maybe he tends his <UNK> the film has clint eastwood as an <UNK> secret service agent and john <UNK> as a vengeful assassin <UNK> against each other in a massive test of <UNK> and <UNK> where the <UNK> life is at stake unnecessary <UNK> and competition between rival security <UNK> almost <UNK> the president which is an authentic touch this film was made when both eastwood and <UNK> were at their peak probably eastwood has never done a better job than he does here and it is all so <UNK> for the old pro there are some wonderful sound effects of him <UNK> and <UNK> as he runs along beside the <UNK> car as a bodyguard for which he is too old i wonder if anyone else noticed the humour of those noises having been added my <UNK> whose name is <UNK> enjoyed this movie even more than i did but then bodyguard movies are very much his thing <UNK> russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls for eastwood as she is so but so talented and she shines the tension is taut every inch of the way in this story and the psychological struggles of eastwood to redeem himself from an earlier protection failure are beautifully shown by his typical understated acting with eastwood if he lifts an <UNK> by a <UNK> watch out of course he is the master of the super cool <UNK> has the opportunity to <UNK> all the creepiness he could wish in the paranoid character he portrays and he captures the man's central vanity to perfection what a good <UNK>
<START> boy this movie is bad and not in a good cheesy fun way either even mst3k couldn't stop it from being boring and it's also confusing as all get out but the most annoying part of this dull mess is <UNK> hideous high pitched voice which i was tired of listening to in the first five minutes not to mention how really unappealing her character is even her dad ran away and abandoned her i can see why frankly if he'd had to listen to her <UNK> in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes he'd have been tempted to do her a great harm as i was by the end of the movie plus she's useless and annoying when she falls down the long hole in the earth a la alice in wonderland she'd have been done for in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably australian <UNK> <UNK> hadn't kept saving her from all of the various <UNK> she kept falling into he should have just tied her to the <UNK> version of train tracks and been done with it and this atlantis underground with the weird confusing obsession with bone <UNK> i have to ask where was the light coming from down there did they have <UNK> that imitate the sun no matter there's no real plot anyway just a bunch of oddly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> running around trying to catch kathy probably so that they can stick a gag in her mouth stupid pointless film thank you <UNK> <UNK> for this cinematic abomination may you burn in the seventh ring of hell for all eternity
<START> <UNK> is a well judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that doesn't <UNK> the main characters david <UNK> and sarah <UNK> bring to the <UNK> the complex and <UNK> emotions of a couple deeply in love struggling to come to terms with the personality changes they both endure and also must make to survive a tragic accident br br <UNK> as alan brings humour as well as a dangerous as an engineer recovering from a memory loss brought on by a road accident alan is not portrayed simply as a victim but as human being with feelings doing the best he can to make sense of his new life sarah <UNK> is not a clichéd stand by her man housewife who will do anything to support her husband she struggles with falling out of love with alan as the man she once new and loved is now a completely different person a stranger to her br br contrary to some opinion this in my view makes perfect sunday night viewing too often we are shown soft family dramas or detective series like <UNK> which <UNK> and the brain programme seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep more challenging and thought provoking drama like <UNK> would seriously change the situation
<START> hard up no proper jobs going down at the pit why not rent your kids <UNK> <UNK> story without the gratuitous sex scenes either hard core or soft core therefore reads like a public information film from the fifties give this a wide miss use a <UNK> pole if you can
<START> this is a decent effort for a b movie martial arts <UNK> ian a former north american <UNK> weight <UNK> champion is the lead and <UNK> himself well in the action scenes the muscular <UNK> <UNK> gets a chance to add more to his martial arts bad guy persona in this film than in all of his many others and if you are a fan of the <UNK> <UNK> rent this movie now br br <UNK> <UNK> is also noteworthy as the romantic interest in this film she starts off with attitude but soon <UNK> up to the hero and they make the beast with two backs in a very stylish fashion br br the fight scenes are good in the american tradition no hong kong <UNK> here with added realism from having benny the jet <UNK> playing himself as john <UNK> <UNK> br br all in all this film seems to have more sub plots than most in its genre so you get more of a story
<START> new rule nobody is allowed to make any more zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original idea br br sadly this movie doesn't they have the premise that bounty hunters go out and kill zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers well problems with that most people have ten fingers why not just collect ten for one zombie why not just kill a regular person and pass that off as a zombie finger br br not to mention the utter silliness of hunting zombies with a <UNK> action rifle br br i sometimes think films like this are resume <UNK> for makeup and fx guys hey this is what i did with ten dollars and some <UNK> <UNK> imagine what i could do if you gave me a budget do you think anyone goes to drama school or cinema school to star in a zombie movie i went to the school of the arts check me out as the tunnel zombie in quick and the undead his mother must be so proud br br these had to be the <UNK> zombies ever as a whole <UNK> of them apparently couldn't push down a wooden door or even break a glass window no they had to wait for the bounty hunter to open the door for them
<START> how i spend my vacation puts closure to the television series that aired from 1990 to 1992 i've always enjoyed the series for what it is i've never compared the series to the looney tunes of the old days the video release was split up in four or five episodes i can't remember as i'm writing this for television and it's included in the episode list of the series what's good about this series is that all the main characters of the show have a major role in the story we see what they all do during their summer vacation in different parts of the world is with his parents in a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> crossing the country with <UNK> parents <UNK> is in some beach etc the climax is very good and at the end all tiny <UNK> characters reunite for the start of a new year in the thus practically ending the good run of this tv show
<START> i very much enjoyed this movie and i think most fans of lauren <UNK> will too her character is much <UNK> than her role in six feet under and all of the performances are strong i especially enjoyed the way the role of emily a mentally challenged <UNK> was handled despite some other user reviews the role was performed accurately and without cliché by the actress taylor roberts also a standout was <UNK> whose natural ease well <UNK> the more season veteran actors although the direction hit a <UNK> here or there it seemed the only problems were with an underdeveloped script what maybe worked well as a stage play didn't hold out quite so well on screen however the lovely cinematography by paul ryan definitely makes up for that as well as the pace of the film which is surprisingly not slow i recommend this movie to fans of six feet under and also fans of plain good acting and cinematography
<START> it was amazing as a <UNK> and an at the new york library <UNK> <UNK> event on <UNK> night october 18 i was <UNK> to see a pre release screening of the new movie the <UNK> runner the release of the movie has been <UNK> because of concerns about the <UNK> of the child actors involved i am grateful that the event was allowed to go on as planned br br regarding the movie i feel it was masterfully done it had as much impact on me i think as stanley a clockwork orange even though it is much less graphic much less there is no comparison between the horrendous shocking violence and rape shown in a clockwork orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in <UNK> runner only the subject matter and the <UNK> for the human psyche are comparable i have written more details about the violence and child rape and how it was handled on my <UNK> <UNK> my overall impression was that this film was fantastic one of the best made films i have seen the depiction of the <UNK> boys flying their <UNK> captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world the subject matter is intensely serious and the movie carries the emotions of the audience into that subject matter without many jarring hollywood touches which have ruined other movies although the <UNK> <UNK> of was an obvious bit of symbolism to me br br finally i must mention the excellence of the sound track the <UNK> by the boy of poetry by as two main characters are fleeing the country during the russian invasion under terrifying circumstances truly showed the power of those <UNK> i urge anyone watching to disregard the subtitles in that scene to the extent that you can and just listen to the beauty of the language i don't even know what language <UNK> is <UNK> whether his normal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the same as original <UNK> <UNK> also please note the sound heard every time a <UNK> line is cut i found it a profound distinctive sound though the <UNK> who were with me did not notice it at all i can't help but wonder if <UNK> actually make a sound like that when they are cut or if it gives a sense of the <UNK> sound experienced by the <UNK> <UNK> during competition
<START> i don't see why everyone loves this film so much true it does have good intentions and meaning but you cannot compensate for such a poor script woody allen is a brilliant <UNK> but i'm afraid this is just a piece of garbage it's extremely predictable and the subject matter is all too visible i happen to be a huge woody allan fan and love most of his work but this i cannot <UNK>
<START> i had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show i had no expectations br br and was a muddled convoluted film lacking direction or any believability there was very little character development and i never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists the reverse was true i was more interested in seeing how the <UNK> would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the are who they are br br the film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet any <UNK> mind will realize this is highly improbable br br the climax is extremely cliché and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points it feels very tacked on and unnecessary br br the actors are not particularly believable in their roles mostly because i found it difficult to believe that scientists <UNK> and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and i had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time every time br br the most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography i found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess that i found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres
<START> i got this movie from the library and saw it had a lot of actors i like in it john <UNK> ian <UNK> ralph richardson etc so i got it and watched it i expected <UNK> to have a large role since he had first billing i was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time along with everyone else i liked this movie is amazingly pointless the characters are <UNK> the plot is non existent and the ending is one of the worst endings i have ever seen there were a few funny parts but that's about it stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going what and huh a lot and if you don't want to waste your time ignore the people who say this is a very funny movie it isn't just stay away from it at all costs please
<START> i remember going to drive <UNK> with my parent and sister i was in grade 5 and still a kid and the drive closed down 4 years later but the film still <UNK> in my memory an adult movie which a kid finds entertaining that is a mark of excellence hoffman is one of <UNK> better actors and this film proves it i like the billy put down the ice cream scene and i remember the <UNK> version in there film i factory myself remember joe crying please email me if you like the <UNK> skit not a bad film at all it is a story about a father and his son touching and i love the part where hoffman talks about and how the streets change worth a second watch 7 10
<START> if you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes this cartoon is not for you but if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation come on in br br in this cartoon <UNK> is <UNK> the <UNK> and discovers what looks like a japanese fishing boat the two japanese <UNK> trick <UNK> into thinking that they want a peace <UNK> signed but looks can be <UNK> the fishing boat turns out to be a japanese navy ship what follows is considered today to be <UNK> <UNK> propaganda br br be <UNK> the <UNK> of the japanese in the film are done in a mean spirited fashion keep in mind though that there was a war going on at the time but i strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the wwii era
<START> this is another classic seagal movie he walks no <UNK> through the <UNK> just all the other mega seagal movies nothing even comes close to challenging seagal in this movie except maybe the part where he has to find a cure for this so called <UNK> and he starts throwing things about the lab but it all works out i mean lets face it its master seagal he's got to win what about his outfit in the film masterpiece he must have picked it himself its great that everyone in the film is dying after being exposed to the virus but seagal doesn't even get a <UNK> the incident at the end when he kills the fat guy with the broken glass genius i bet seagal thought of that one as well this film is class pure and simple great plot great characters and seagal
<START> confirmed dead is an important episode in the series as it introduces four new characters the rescue team that <UNK> <UNK> before getting a knife in her back by locke however as the quote in my one line summary says their true purpose for being on the island may be something else entirely all the new characters appear intriguing especially miles some sort of psychic exorcist but at this point it's still too early to make solid <UNK> i felt that this episode was a slight step down from the beginning of the end no flash <UNK> this time short term flashbacks instead but it still has its stunning moments and picks up steam near the end out of 4
<START> keys to the <UNK> is just another one of the horrible t v shows that you can and will see on this station the show is terrible with guys claiming to be real players competing against each other there are two of them competing in each episode in stupid games where they try to get girls at a bar to talk to them get girls numbers and so on the judges are four other guys who also claim to be expert pick up artists but they also seem like just huge d <UNK> just like the contestants the show is not funny at all and not even interesting it is just boring watching these guys desperately try to convince us what awesome players they are talking even more about the four judges than i am about the contestants nothing funny has even happened in the shows i have watched and the shows are obviously <UNK> do you really think they have invited all these people to the club got them to sign releases and get them on tape while these guys carry out the same stupid games with them it's not reality at all it is just stupid it probably even tapes in the day time somebody else on here wrote how they knew somebody on the show and it was all fake well yeah that is obvious it's a fake show and even with actors it's still not funny one of the worst shows i have ever seen
<START> talk radio is of course probably not the most well known of <UNK> films but don't let that put you off this film is <UNK> for discovery i defy anyone not to be <UNK> by it along with the best performance of 80's cinema by eric <UNK> for me along with <UNK> this remains <UNK> finest moment stone doesn't seem to comment much on it these days and didn't do a director's commentary on dvd like all his other films stone has nothing to be ashamed of most directors would kill to get a shot a film like this br br the <UNK> of the studio is intense and the opinions of are still very crucial arguments for today the all drugs speech is powerful and you might find yourself <UNK> with him in my opinion the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people don't like hearing things they don't agree with the speeches and conversations with the <UNK> are very compelling even disturbing a chill ran down my spine when a crazed man calls saying he has to rape again because the city drives him crazy is totally shocking the tension is sometimes unbearable with a scene when heavy <UNK> kent becomes unhinged of course does himself no <UNK> by <UNK> him or should i say <UNK> is <UNK> in film and performance totally <UNK> a shame <UNK> other big role was the villain in under siege 2 dear god one scene <UNK> didn't ring true was when <UNK> boss dan alec baldwin gets him to calm down barry doesn't seem to be the kind of person who <UNK> up and does as he's told it seemed a bit contrived and clichéd the scenes outside the studio are <UNK> for being too formulaic it's true because stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allow the viewer to see <UNK> but it doesn't entirely work br br it is a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme close ups deep focus extremely fast cuts a fantastic <UNK> set which is used for the final breathtaking monologue must see cinema it makes it rare because it was ignored the time but is now receiving attention again which it so richly deserves a classic <UNK> should be studied by generations of film students br br 10 out of 10 for inventive use of bad to the bone before <UNK> brilliant supporting cast including john c <UNK> dr cox from <UNK> as the sleazy <UNK> leslie hope 24 as girlfriend john and alec baldwin as the suits and micheal <UNK> who plays three roles a very underrated actor the tension between the <UNK> and which is very heart racing times and of course kudos to the stars <UNK> and stone for such a fantastic piece of cinema enjoy
<START> you know i've been in some towns where the girls weren't all that pretty in fact i've been in some towns where they're downright ugly but it's the first time i've been in a town where there are no girls at all i am sure the fans of great classic remember this phrase that belongs to <UNK> one of the truly magnificent seven from the first movie br br now i'd want to re phrase him here you know i've seen some movies where the plot isn't all that good in fact i've seen some movies where the plot is terrible but that's first time in my life that i saw the film where there isn't any plot at all br br ok maybe my above statement is little bit over the top but honestly how one can call the plot a crap that is going on in this movie the bad guy oh don't ask me to give you his name because i don't remember and his not even somehow close to who's name and character is unforgettable is trying to build the church in the name of his late sons that were killed in some battle and this bad guy is kidnapping poor villagers to force them to build the church br br first of all how big must be church to have to force hundreds of villagers to build it is it some egyptian <UNK> or something but ok let's stop here about the plot and absolutely forgettable character of a bad guy and let's say few words about the seven itself br br <UNK> good old chris always calm always silent talking less but talking wise is gone unfortunately oh no he's as calm as he was but now he's <UNK> are so fake that you just don't buy it imagine he meets a good old friend <UNK> who he must rescue after so many years and there is just a few hi hello and not even <UNK> as far as i remember honestly it looks more like meeting of two strangers in some internet chat rather then meeting of chris and <UNK> that makes new chris more look like <UNK> or terminator rather then our beloved wise br br i won't stop here talking about other characters there simply aren't any imagine if strong actor like <UNK> <UNK> is so much fake forgettable then what will be other characters look like br br there still are some attempts to give us a background story for each one of them for example one is women favorite guy second is a man with dark past who's wife was raped and killed by indians and he since then is killing everyone and everything that is moving but non of these characters are making any sense or non of them can take your heart br br i remember i was a little child and when <UNK> charles <UNK> character died in the first movie i was crying here i just didn't care about each one of them even if whole of them with all the crew of the film would die it seems i wouldn't care more br br so please go and see this movie i recommend it because you won't have the other chance to see something worse then it
<START> the <UNK> airport <UNK> starts in washington where a man named carl parker <UNK> contacts high profile tv news reporter maggie <UNK> susan <UNK> in order to hand secret documents over that prove his boss kevin robert wagner owner president of harrison <UNK> that develop weapons for the military has been <UNK> selling said weapons to foreign countries however maggie sees carl <UNK> she barely escapes with her life maggie is to catch the <UNK> to <UNK> via paris the next morning <UNK> to blow the <UNK> on harrison who also happens to be her boyfriend which would ruin him determined to save himself he his hi tech <UNK> missile to <UNK> destroy the <UNK> during a test run killing all those on board destroying the documented evidence br br <UNK> airport <UNK> the <UNK> for it's cinema initial home video releases because it was released here in well 1980 rather than 1979 this last entry in the airport franchise was directed by david <UNK> rich is a <UNK> bad film that was apparently laughed at during press test <UNK> <UNK> universal to promote the film as an action comedy the first thing to say is that the <UNK> airport <UNK> is a really silly downright <UNK> film but on a purely entertainment basis i can think of a lot worse films to spend <UNK> minutes watching i really can i quite liked the absurd plot about a wealthy <UNK> wanting to kill his girlfriend tv reporter before she can expose him as an illegal arms dealer but this guy doesn't do subtle decides the best way to do it is to blow <UNK> up with his own guided missile then gets a fighter pilot to try shoot it down before finally <UNK> it so really there's three mini disaster flicks in one here as each time super pilot joe <UNK> manages to save the day you know joe <UNK> played by george kennedy appears in all four airport films goes from mechanic in the first to <UNK> pilot in this also i <UNK> he's a bit of a <UNK> since in the space of nine years he has been involved with four major <UNK> disasters i think the real reason why the airport series stopped here was because <UNK> retired after this the <UNK> was lifted some of the things that happen here are just silly <UNK> does barrel rolls flies upside down out a guided missile in a huge <UNK> not to mention he crash lands it fires <UNK> guns out of his window to destroy the missile all while keeping a calm head this guy is good very good then there's the character's there's a <UNK> playing black dude who <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> an old woman with a <UNK> problem a team of russian <UNK> with bad accents also despite being almost shot down with a missile then attacked by a jet fighter the passengers of <UNK> don't seem that bothered happily get back aboard the following day i don't know about you but after that i would probably find a <UNK> way to travel why do the police or authorities not question anyone why is the <UNK> captain <UNK> allowed to just go off sleep with a french prostitute the <UNK> airport <UNK> certainly isn't boring is full of memorable moments i was entertained in a way although it's far from a good film modern audiences may not have the patience with it hell i liked it for what it was in a <UNK> way but it's no sort of classic br br even though <UNK> no longer flies it's still quite a cool looking air plane there's plenty of footage of it here the one used in the <UNK> airport <UNK> was the seventh one built this <UNK> was also the same aircraft which crashed after a tire bust caused a fuel tank to <UNK> and the <UNK> fuel catch fire on july <UNK> 2000 while taking off in paris sadly resulting in the death of <UNK> passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground when this aired on tv in the us in 1982 almost twenty minutes of new footage was included with most if not all of it being newly shot over two years after the original production had finished i know the effects here take a bashing from most but i don't <UNK> they are too bad when you consider this was made in the late 70's i think they come across quite well the camera moves during effects shots real footage of real planes is used rather than toy models which in my opinion would have looked a lot worse i could certainly see what the makers were trying to do with limited <UNK> limited technology in a strange way they are quite impressive actually without ever looking that good if you know what i mean probably the most action packed of all the airport films there's <UNK> exploding planes daring crash <UNK> <UNK> a guy named robert <UNK> no not the singer giving head a woman in a <UNK> br br the imdb says this had a budget of about 14 000 000 which is actually more than i thought maybe those special effects aren't so impressive after all shot in <UNK> washington los angeles france the acting isn't great here people don't look worried enough that they are about to die <UNK> kennedy gets some bad one liners while robert wagner plays the bad guy br br the <UNK> airport <UNK> is fun for bad film <UNK> everywhere to be brutally honest i rather watch this entertaining mess of a film than some two hour oscar nominated bore
<START> i went straight to the big screen to view this <UNK> this is the only flick that i know of that <UNK> has directed but boy was it intense this movie was a total mind and one of the best special effects flick of this kind br br the characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare this movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and <UNK> this movie <UNK> to no other i have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd in that respect it is a fairly large step above a clockwork orange ' definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come out on tape it won't be half as good on tape br br this movie is not for the easily freaked out it will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget but for those who like to be freaked out enjoy
<START> let me first state that i rarely review movies i only comment if i'm blown away or disappointed in something that i thought was going to be good <UNK> was a major disappointment on so many levels the script was horrible the acting was sub par coming from heavy <UNK> like rourke and lane and the editing and effects were comical blowing up cars etc etc rosario dawson had a horrible role i can't believe would even accept it it was such a <UNK> of her talent i can't even put into words i should have know after i saw the trailer for this movie 3 years ago and it kept being put on the that their was a serious problem with this film b movie all the way don't bother unless your really bored
<START> recently i saw this movie again after 25 years in the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between <UNK> character and michael character the rented version did not have this scene in it did i imagine this br br or is this part of the clean up of movies where some are altered to <UNK> portions some people think are not appropriate br br i love this movie it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and i and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together her husband thought it was us as well br br thank you joan
<START> this is possibility the worst and most disappointing film i have ever seen i've spent four years at two <UNK> and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience this isn't it the acting is god awful and the plot non existent br br here are a few incidents from my one year in <UNK> of <UNK> br br 1 a posh <UNK> that <UNK> got off with a <UNK> 2 the best friend pairing of two girls one with huge breasts and the other with the <UNK> the brick 3 a couple that <UNK> too <UNK> 4 the <UNK> who gets all the girls 5 the <UNK> from northern ireland who is very difficult to understand 6 <UNK> in bed 7 <UNK> every night for a week 8 student bashing couple of my mates ended up in hospital 9 the <UNK> joint that started a fire 10 the <UNK> 11 the <UNK> who wakes up on his floor to find that every item of furniture has be taken from his room br br and if i can come up with that list in 5 minutes and from real life i'm sure a couple of script writers can do better a lot better br br and for a film named after a sleeper song where is the <UNK> soundtrack
<START> upon renting this i wasn't expecting to be blown away in fact i knew it was going to be horrible it was just seeing how horrible it really was that's what comes with low budget horror br br snakes on a train not to be confused with the <UNK> summer blockbuster snakes on a plane with samuel l jackson is about a woman who is put under a <UNK> curse that causes snakes to <UNK> inside her and <UNK> her from within her only hope of surviving lies in a <UNK> that lives across the border so she and her companion <UNK> onto a train bound for los throw in a few passengers and hilarity ensues br br come to think of it though the story isn't half bad isn't half good either br br the acting in this film rivals that of a sci fi original if not worse trust me it's horrible the snakes were another problem they were supposed to be i guess but most of what you get instead are mostly harmless garden snakes that don't attack anything and there's this <UNK> sound effect that gets really annoying br br the gore effects on the other hand while not on the tom <UNK> level were actually pretty good br br and another thing the ending alone makes up for the rest of the movie i'm not going to talk about it here so you'll have to rent this and see for yourself
<START> in a sport that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it's characters one of the greatest of them from the 1930s was <UNK> <UNK> dean he was so colorful a personality he was probably elected to the baseball hall of fame on the strength of that as opposed to his <UNK> <UNK> after all part of the dean story is that early end to his career br br in the pride of st louis dan <UNK> successfully captures the character of <UNK> dean at least the dean i remember i'm not old enough to remember him <UNK> but i do remember him <UNK> baseball game of the week during the 1960s for that's part of the dean story as well being a <UNK> <UNK> on radio and later television now that <UNK> are in the hall of fame there's no question <UNK> belongs there br br <UNK> herman dean was one of a tribe of kids who had very little <UNK> but an amazing talent for throwing a baseball at <UNK> speed in fact he had a younger brother paul dean who was a pretty good <UNK> himself br br richard crenna plays paul in this film and it's one of his earliest film roles paul dean in real life was a quiet <UNK> sort who's career was also cut short by <UNK> because of that crenna isn't given much to work with during the dean <UNK> tried to pin the <UNK> of <UNK> on paul but it never took br br <UNK> <UNK> taking a break from playing western <UNK> in dresses and <UNK> is first rate as the wise patient and understanding patricia <UNK> who met and married <UNK> while he was playing for <UNK> in the texas league br br in the <UNK> all star game <UNK> started for the national league facing <UNK> earl dean was hit on the foot by a line drive <UNK> at him <UNK> to listen to medical advice dean came back to pitch too early he'd broken a big toe and put too much of a strain on his arm he was never the same <UNK> and his <UNK> to accept that is part of the story br br had he had a career of say ten to fifteen years who knows what <UNK> <UNK> he might have rolled up dean was the next to last <UNK> to win 30 games in 1934 and after <UNK> who was something of a character himself did it 1968 it hasn't been done since br br dean went into <UNK> and while he was not the first former player to go into the broadcast booth his colorful game <UNK> made him an instant hit he started <UNK> for the other st louis team the <UNK> and the <UNK> were a pretty miserable team with not much to cheer about dean became a star attraction there br br of course part of the dean story is the trouble he got into because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself on the air that's part of the story i won't go into but in the film it's handled with <UNK> and <UNK> and your eyes might if you tend to the sentimental br br a fine baseball film a real tribute to an american success story
<START> i liked this movie a lot but the feeling that i most came away with was the memory of how much <UNK> enjoyed the novel the film features two of the best actresses working today jessica lange who is great here and the divine jennifer jason leigh who does the best she can with the <UNK> drawn character she is given as well as a surprisingly excellent michelle pfeiffer and a steady jason <UNK> the adaptation is basically faithful to the book at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes the film <UNK> really <UNK> except for certain scenes between lange and pfeiffer but it does a thoroughly competent job of <UNK> this wonderfully tragic story as far as movies adapted from novels go this was definitely among the better ones if nothing else it has sent me back to my to <UNK> favorite <UNK> from jane excellent novel and back to king <UNK> to brush up on the minor characters in order to see just how deep the parallels go worth your time as a film definitely and hopefully enough to make you remember that reading great literature is a joy as well
<START> what an absolute joke of a movie the case for this film would have you believe it is duel meets <UNK> <UNK> meets texas chainsaw massacre three good films in their own right and you would think using their <UNK> <UNK> couldn't go far wrong well that's what i thought and i was very very mistaken br br we follow two college students as they travel miles across the desert to reach a wedding they pick up a girl no she doesn't get her clothes off then they get chased by a <UNK> rip off in a monster truck whom they <UNK> name f aka monster man br br the monster truck i will admit is a very cool vehicle but the less than suspenseful chase scenes ruin it's potential br br so <UNK> decides he's got a bit of a grudge against these guys and chases them for a bit they loose him for a while and stop at a bar full of <UNK> then they go to a motel where lead character adam sleeps with <UNK> <UNK> sarah though they both wear underwear then they are caught by <UNK> taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill <UNK> but fail hence the set up for the sequel apart from a minor <UNK> that's it br br if you can get past the first 2 minutes  where <UNK> friend <UNK> pops up from hiding in the back of <UNK> car to try to scare him with no explanation as to how <UNK> even got there how long ago or how adam even failed to realise  without thinking you hate it already then you may just enjoy this film br br monster man has very poor cinematography and direction which is immediately off putting this is the kind of movie that you'll be able to pick up as one of those films in a box set of 20 horror movies that you've never heard of br br what is so irritating is blockbuster stock so many of these poor quality films that are shot on digital by some amateur film students and that's exactly what <UNK> is though imdb states this particular director was born in <UNK> br br the acting throughout this film is atrocious the script which the writer obviously considered to be funny is irritating and childish you get the impression only one draft was written before they started shooting in fact the script is do dire a lot of the film seems improvised full of those boring un entertaining conversations that are only funny or important to the actual people involved imagine you filmed yourself and your buddies having a conversation sure points are funny  to you but mostly it's trash that's what the script for <UNK> is like br br don't watch it for the gore either  it's fairly minimal and there are much better gory films out there bad taste evil dead et br br <UNK> <UNK> 1 2 even with their cheesiness and plot holes are far superior to this film compare the intro of <UNK> <UNK> to the intro of monster man and you'll see what i mean
<START> it is fantastic a sick and twisted tale of coincidence and <UNK> br br the story is <UNK> and <UNK> constructed it is really a perfect mixture it has all from suspense to humor and the story is told with lots of originality the film is built up like a puzzle which is assembled piece by piece and <UNK> the story for the viewer there are plenty of surprises till the end i also had a little impression that the director has been inspired by some hitchcock work i've also seen films before where you see the same event happening from different points of view but this film goes beyond that in this movie everything is built upon what happens to a body that appears and disappears and appears again in a different location every actor in the story has his own secret and we come to realize it in a way that contributes to <UNK> the puzzle i loved especially the dark humor scenes which made laugh the whole theater this movie is a must see for everyone
<START> the combination of dan <UNK> <UNK> and linda blair exorcist is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie and once you see the cover art to this film of a frozen zombie coming out of their chamber you'll think you were in b movie horror heaven at least that's the way i approached this film but boy was i in for a shock br br i love horror movies i love b movies as well nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies monsters murderers that sort of thing but to say that this movie was lacking is an understatement this movie was pure trash you'd think the zombies would look somewhat like what the cover art of the box displays but instead you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any halloween display counter furthermore the script is beyond pitiful our main character joseph suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks <UNK> in the warm hearted mary played by blair not once do you see any sign of sadness or <UNK> on the part of <UNK> character instead we see the head of the <UNK> a man named dr miller eager to get the dead bodies and experiment with their organs there is no emotion or anything to make you believe you should give a damn about anyone in this film br br all and all very disappointing all the elements to make a great horror film were there you had your zombies your decent actors and your story but the lack of good writing and little if any sense of direction screwed this one up <UNK> overall 4 out of 10
<START> kicked in the head is all about the <UNK> character a twenty something man on a quest to find himself and his <UNK> with a handful of quirky characters this thin and ambiguous story which was written by <UNK> has a make it up as you go feel and a screenplay which <UNK> like an uninspired low budget indie in spite of that and some annoying <UNK> scene the film has an off beat quirky kind of charm which may appeal in some small way to people with a similar sense of humor not for everyone not for most but maybe fun for some d
<START> or maybe not whatever anyone thinks of broadcast news good or bad almost all the credit for that thinking belongs to writer producer director james l brooks as a screenwriter of which he has long been one of the best it is not easy to savage an entire business in this case the business being television news but to do it with a smile a <UNK> a knowing nod and a laugh practically every step of the way to do all that takes real talent something mr j brooks has in abundance br br one user on this website in his summary asked the musical question did walter <UNK> act like this no of course not and the reason for that is in <UNK> uh mr day the only thing that <UNK> was bringing the news to the people same goes for john <UNK> and <UNK> and david and douglas <UNK> and howard k smith sure they had to pay lip service attention to their ratings if only to please their bosses but all they really cared about was the news itself br br now of course all that has changed for the last 25 30 years in the network news business the only thing that has really <UNK> is ratings ratings ratings the bottom line how many bucks will our news division deliver for the network don't believe that br br let's consider the big three tom dan rather and peter <UNK> aka stanley stunning all three have now been on the job at their respective anchor <UNK> for the last 15 20 years peter actually got his first shot at the national anchor desk way back in the 1960s but was totally <UNK> for the job of the three dan is the one with the greatest in the field training as a reporter personally i think all three do terrific jobs as news anchors and are deserving of their positions all of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually in those jobs all three are now in their 60's dan is pushing the big 7 0 and all three are still very good looking and if you think they're still good looking now imagine how good looking they were in their 40's when all three were hired for let's say put in their current jobs but do you honestly believe that any one of these three would have been put in had he looked like let's say fred <UNK> herman <UNK> or like heaven <UNK> me not only that if dan were <UNK> tomorrow a younger than he is today walter <UNK> would not be able to get his old job back why not pretty enough and it would matter not a <UNK> that he is or once was the most trusted man in america br br and this is what broadcast news is all about tom william hurt the next pretty boy national news anchor to be who has trouble with a few minor things such as thinking for himself being able to write and knowing stuff jane craig holly hunter the brilliant news producer with news business standards and <UNK> all of which get thrown to the wind when even she falls for pretty boy tom and aaron altman albert brooks no relation to james l a top notch <UNK> and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he flop <UNK> behind the anchor desk and many other such flawed characters whom you know really do exist in the news <UNK> of the various networks br br network <UNK> the trail eleven years later broadcast news carried the torch as a worthy <UNK> in the new millennium what will be the next movie to savage the business of network news you can use maybe or maybe not
<START> i would not compare it to le <UNK> which imho had more comic moments but juliette while being a slow <UNK> certainly kept your attention going throughout the film nicely paced and reaching a heart warming conclusion there were many marvellous comedic moments some brilliant pathos and realistic situation acting by all actors br br it was a typically french film in which while confronting prejudices and <UNK> which in turn the made the viewer confront his own shortcomings i am certainly pleased to have this in my library and will no doubt watch it time and time again which to me is a mark of a great film
<START> i saw this film much like did but when i could manage to see it again and with <UNK> film training psychology and life has had the time to really take me by the hand and start beating me about i really click with the film i remember the pay for service cable channels played this thing almost to death much like <UNK> when it first came out and many other popular films i felt back then it wasn't worth the fuss and constant <UNK> i know cable isn't really on air given it but i was very young and adult situation drama wouldn't have and shouldn't have worked however recent viewing of the film has <UNK> me on the film i think that susan and molly <UNK> were likely studying the script together and i would be a bit surprised if had <UNK> <UNK> during this project <UNK> other projects while good do not have her <UNK> the potential depth as this role nailed hers as <UNK> julia did also <UNK> and wife delivered acceptable performances but i will admit at times first class acting turns to mediocre a steady <UNK> and flow to the acting does take place during many scenes but overall i can see why the story might call for the dynamic to become more subtle br br all in all i don't find this film to be the take me out and <UNK> me kind of boredom fest as would have you believe i think that perhaps with the right psychological training and a bit more <UNK> in one's domestic life <UNK> placed coupled with some film <UNK> perhaps this film would appear different i would say if you are feeling a bit melancholy and <UNK> for a simpler life and you have had your share of marital <UNK> amongst dysfunctional family <UNK> then perhaps this film might provide more insight and entertainment than you might think i do feel it is a classic and find it much more entertaining than mainstream films that are supposed to share many of the same elements such as terms of <UNK> which as far as i am concerned could be stripped of a few extraordinary performances by jack nicholson then burned until nothing is left how could a film like that get more attention than this one talk about boredom best thing don't take my word or anyone else's see the film and support our industry
<START> i am a big fan of the abc movies of the week genre i am only 27 meaning i wasn't even born until after the series ended but i am trying to collect as many of them on dvd as possible i have about a dozen or so i had read such wonderful things about this film both on here and elsewhere that i was really excited to see it i just received my dvd in the mail today and watched it <UNK> i'll admit that the first one or two phone calls did give me the creeps that boy's voice would give anyone the creeps but it began to <UNK> off fast and the entire divorce subplot was stupid i also figured out that michael douglas was the antagonist about a half an hour before the movie ended as soon as that story was told about how elizabeth <UNK> character had locked up his mother i knew something was <UNK> plus didn't anyone ever think to ask him why he happened to suddenly appear that night when the fire occurred in the <UNK> i'll admit that i thought he was <UNK> a boy at the school to make the phone calls i didn't guess the mute boy part or the pre recorded tapes did they ever say whose voice that actually was i doubt douglas could ever get his voice that high br br i am only giving this movie a four out of ten because i actually liked most of the acting in it ashley especially is great br br it's a shame because this movie has such a great premise but oh well thats what happens sometimes when one gets his or her hopes up for a movie too much
<START> i found code <UNK> very disappointing i thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a movie but found that it didn't deliver code <UNK> lacked thought and structure and the storyline didn't flow well i thought that tim robbins character wasn't well developed for <UNK> i thought there should have been more info and thought put into his family life and not have it completely ignored as i felt it was when they were first in <UNK> of a code <UNK> it was suggested that they were not to know that they may have been <UNK> linked but all the technology was available to them he took her <UNK> and therefore genetic details when he was investigating the fraud i constantly found myself waiting for something to happen and the story line to develop and yet it never did i felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating but turned out to be the opposite code <UNK> tried to be too clever and in the end just ended up lacking imagination i would not recommend this film to anybody the only good thing about the film was that it was relatively short
<START> there is not one character on this sitcom with any redeeming qualities they are all self centered obnoxious or two dimensional my husband watches it claiming that there is nothing else on but i would rather watch nothing br br the only sitcom that i can think of that was worse was yes dear at least that one didn't get 9 seasons br br being overweight does not make a comic genius and kevin james does not have the talent of john goodman jackie <UNK> or john belushi <UNK> may have talent but if so she is wasted on the <UNK> wife jerry stiller is convincing as an annoying old man maybe there is a reason for that br br this is a perfect example of why sitcoms are <UNK>
<START> it was a movie that made ya think a little some parts a little cheesy some parts pretty good plot did at times and just when you thought sandra found a friend the friend was fraud or dead all i got to say is that dennis miller should have been in the whole movie his character was the best very refreshing after all the crap went through he would have lifted me and through the <UNK>
<START> watching this odd little adventure movie it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality giallo classics as the strange vice of mrs <UNK> and the case of the <UNK> tail but it has to be said that despite it's low quality production values island of the fish men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it's getting like many italian films from the seventies this is one is a rip off of a successful american film the one in question this time being the <UNK> <UNK> island of dr <UNK> sergio <UNK> film takes ideas such as <UNK> greed and adventure and <UNK> it into one slightly compelling film which makes up for what it's lacks in <UNK> and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas the central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island it quickly becomes apparent that not everything about this place is normal and it soon <UNK> that half of the population has been turned into fish men a cross between a man and a fish which exist for purely selfish reasons br br the truth about this movie is that it's a lot more fun if you ignore the trashy production values the central monsters look completely ridiculous and much of the movie takes place on sets that look like they cost someone a few <UNK> but the movie is well shot in spite of this with the underwater photography being a particular highlight and the pacing of the movie is well done in that the film never becomes boring the way that the plot comes together isn't exactly genius but it takes in a lot of ideas and i've seen films made on plots with much less thought put into them than this one the biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of atlantis to be honest i'm not a massive fan of adventure movies and therefore don't see this lost city get mentioned much but it is always nice to see it in a movie the central island location is good in that it provides an apt setting for the story and also provides the movie with the right amount of mystery as martino makes good use of the voodoo theme overall this isn't exactly a classic and there are certainly a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one
<START> just before dawn is one of the best slasher films it very realistic and atmospheric it reminds me tobe hooper s the texas chainsaw massacre and deliverance deborah benson very good plays the heroine and director jeff created very creepy and dark movie just before dawn is beautiful photographed and soundtrack is very disturbing i never br br liked slasher films or gore except with this one very impressive and convincing movie at least for me
<START> i am not afraid of bad movies i like bad movies i enjoy mocking them in the company of my friends we're all quite good at it in fact that being said let me tell you how much i hated this movie br br to begin with it was incomprehensible rob lowe attacks some people they capture him but he escapes in this big ol' shoot out there's this singer whom we think died only she didn't unless maybe there are several of them who all act and look the same cue burt reynolds to come in and question the singer he looks like he's just <UNK> into this movie off of the walker texas ranger set and is darn confused then rob lowe dies only he doesn't and the worst thing is there's not enough dialogue or action that doesn't involve killing people or attempting to to even make fun of this movie and don't even get me started on the random <UNK> then there was the fact that it was supposed to be about the old power structure in eastern europe falling apart we didn't know where we were all the accents were apparently eastern european and what were burt reynolds and rob lowe doing there in the first place br br i desperately wanted to tell the people at blockbuster what i thought of this movie and to get my money back but since i'd gotten it as a special only 99 i decided against it what i want to know however is how the director got the <UNK> to make this darn movie and what the <UNK> were thinking when they signed on
<START> if halloween 5 was a cruel joke to the fans of the series than halloween 6 is a like a vicious insult the storyline has gone to the dogs everyone michael is used as a helpless <UNK> in this film and he isn't at all scary he reminds me of an over weight alcoholic man than the boogeyman that struck fear in our hearts back in the original there are almost no <UNK> qualities about this feature and i'm so glad <UNK> came out because it would be an insult to fans to have this be fresh on our minds br br halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that i liked having an adult tommy doyle in the film was a nice touch and it linked it to the original donald <UNK> is here in his last performance what a bad film to end an otherwise nice career on when he's on screen he makes you remember the good old days when halloween was actually scary br br that's about it my friends the stalk sequences are unoriginal one of them being a blatant rip off of the laurie michael chase in the original the other characters are terribly under written and just aren't likable the music on of <UNK> highlights even when the film is bad is tortured in this film we get a silly rock version of the stalk chase theme what were they thinking when they made this film br br spoiler br br their biggest mistake was off the character of jamie now played by another actress who isn't worth mentioning we watched this character escape death in two films we <UNK> for her and when she is killed in this film you cant help but feel sorry for her and realize that the filmmakers don't care when good characters are established in a film br br end spoiler br br the less said about <UNK> embarrassment the better i wish it didn't exist i suggest skipping this film and even 5 and just going straight to <UNK> because if you watch this you may not want to see another halloween film again
<START> in 1976 a mother named norma lewis cameron diaz lives with her son walter and her husband arthur james <UNK> one night a box is placed on the <UNK> of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key by the late afternoon a man with terrible <UNK> on his face comes to their door and presents norma with an offer this man is <UNK> <UNK> frank <UNK> and he <UNK> that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash if they don't press it nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else norma and arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal the <UNK> for the family to push the button is <UNK> by their financial difficulties arthur who is currently working for <UNK> fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and norma who is a teacher learns that her <UNK> funding is being cut br br one's enjoyment for this bizarre sci fi thriller based on the short story button button by richard <UNK> will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise the opening of the film is particularly <UNK> in <UNK> itself in a sense of realism with the household richard kelly's previous film <UNK> <UNK> cleverly used the condition of <UNK> to justify its <UNK> into <UNK> activity and parallel <UNK> without the dream like state of that far superior film the box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world is entirely implausible that norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same <UNK> as two face from the dark knight and believe this offer seems equally contrived br br if this sounds unlikely so far what follows is even more absurd involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning the possibility of alien life or some other <UNK> being <UNK> these situations scenes involving <UNK> opening up in public <UNK> random nose <UNK> and mindless <UNK> stalking the lewis family become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity to a point the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films <UNK> in one scene norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot he <UNK> her about it as she is missing four of her <UNK> later at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that norma and arthur are attending this same student appears as a <UNK> and seems to be stalking them yet the eventual justification for these all of these <UNK> is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow br br what is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on many of the moral <UNK> that were initially promised are <UNK> for much of pictures duration the ending which won't be <UNK> here <UNK> these moral questions again in the hope of <UNK> that of a greek tragedy while the <UNK> can be seen by this point given the <UNK> of so much of the film and the uneven performances there is little reason to care cameron <UNK> southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly <UNK> who is the most disappointing in the film with a very <UNK> written role as the mysterious <UNK> man who seems to be hiding a military base that would make dr evil proud it really is just a shadow of his <UNK> performance in frost <UNK> there is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do in particular both norma and arthur could not be regarded as characters but <UNK> for kelly's <UNK> of ideas underdeveloped and brief conversations such as where norma <UNK> with <UNK> over their <UNK> and also when norma and arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them highlights this br br since 2001 richard kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of <UNK> <UNK> though this film might be intriguing for a little while it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film's rather illogical revelations science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions but what kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains <UNK> the box is one film this year that should have been <UNK>
<START> living in <UNK> and have a great <UNK> for history i was very put off by the taken wrong breed of dog for a start owner old jock was an old single man who came to <UNK> and died a <UNK> in <UNK> not like in the film at all for anyone coming to <UNK> and hoping to see sights of the film you will not find the graveyard in <UNK> st gardens there were a few moments were a <UNK> would have been great the actors were fantastic at padding out a rather flimsy script i don't feel the poor wee bobby actually got enough screen time possibly due to being lost at one point all that said the film was fine and any 8 <UNK> old will enjoy
<START> i loved this film the audience i was part of loved this film and the little 7 year old girl who was with me loved this film we all laughed at the <UNK> the visual humour and the good feeling you left the cinema with when it ended i could easily see why it was such a huge box office success in france i am planning on buying the dvd so i can see it again and laugh at all the bits i missed as i was laughing so hard the first time
<START> my son an avid <UNK> sat me down and made me watch this with him as i love documentaries it didn't take a whole lot of pressure on his part the whole amazing story of it all a bunch of dirt poor kids drift together and end up creating something revolutionary out of thin air well more out of some wood <UNK> and lack of waves to surf it just <UNK> me it still does i didn't think i would enjoy it the way i did nor did i think i would tear up watching <UNK> <UNK> tear up over the fate of jay adams and just watching jay adams himself the sheer genius of the kid <UNK> and the <UNK> of the adult remembering i watched it again last night for what has to be the <UNK> time and i still get <UNK> watching him fly down the hill with <UNK> <UNK> freedom playing in the background and i <UNK> up again not too many movies have the same impact with me after several viewings brilliant
<START> director don <UNK> really impressed me with this film it is <UNK> shot graphic without being visually graphic well acted by all concerned and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a <UNK> almost expected <UNK> <UNK> not seen in any other film by this reviewer i didn't know what to expect sitting down to watch this a civil war movie or some kind of 70's soft core with eastwood <UNK> on a school for girls in the south but really is is neither of those things but rather and examination exploration and descent into the soul of men and women a dark commentary on what is at the core of the <UNK> as one reviewer previously noted none none of the characters are likable by the film's end and yet each one is interesting complex and enigmatic eastwood plays <UNK> a union soldier found by young <UNK> <UNK> you'll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it a girl at a school for manners headed by <UNK> page amidst the chaos that was the civil war particularly in the south soon page teacher elizabeth <UNK> lovely young <UNK> carol and even <UNK> amy have emotional sexual ties to eastwood each having their own needs and secrets and problems eastwood is not a nice man he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage in the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from <UNK> <UNK> to incest the <UNK> for me is a masterpiece that far <UNK> my expectations on every creative front this might be except for invasion of the body <UNK> <UNK> best film it certainly is one of eastwood's best real performances page is always so very good and <UNK> et al excellent the gothic set for the school is effectively claustrophobic some of the sexual laced scenes disturbing and what happens to eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy eerie demented film
<START> i have seen most of the tarzan episodes certainly the rated x with <UNK> bo derek which is totally <UNK> br br i have seen this version several times since it was originally shown br br all the cast had memorable parts great acting the ape sequences br br last night i viewed same on spanish station and other than some french dialog all in spanish br br as far as hudson not wanting <UNK> voice he did nothing until the very end he viewed the <UNK> and could have hired a dialog coach br br it seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking <UNK> that hudson attacked <UNK> the story line in the movie was that she was an american cousin the last time i checked <UNK> was in the usa br br she was beautiful in movie and her eyes and gorgeous hair <UNK> skin <UNK> all us males she did not have to resort to <UNK> level br br she has remained a lady throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie half her life ago as a starting point her performance sincerity made this movie enjoyable believable that a half wild man could <UNK> her inner beauty br br great sending point for sir richardson he did steal the movie
<START> succeeds as at <UNK> you into a bizarre <UNK> where <UNK> haunt and curse a town it fails at being a competent horror movie while the film is sure to draw attention mainly to it's bizarre plot line and a few interesting visual treats it's going to come off better as a dark comedy than a horror film it's definitely a film you should see if your into the kind of stuff but if your looking for a scare or even a small chill you'll want to look elsewhere doesn't really have much else up it's <UNK> but a great chain of odd events br br a
<START> so i won't disagree with the critics but i really was not all that moved by this movie i was a little <UNK> to rent it as i am going through some of the same things the protagonist is supposed to be experiencing yet i did rent it thinking that i might experience some <UNK> or at the least understand that i am not alone while i understood the <UNK> <UNK> with his <UNK> cousin i didn't feel his internal struggle with isolation as much as i would have liked i felt that much more emphasis was placed on his <UNK> cousin his welcome it is a beautifully filmed movie and i did really appreciate the use of silence to bring out the feeling of isolation
<START> i was about 14 years old as i saw the musical version of lost horizon i loved the film so much as well as the songs that i went several times to the cinema to see it again and again my mother bought the <UNK> and i <UNK> the songs off by heart just as i did with the sound of music which people hardly know in <UNK> i think the problem with some of these self <UNK> critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager maybe he is an ingrid bergman fan but i was happy with <UNK> <UNK> could ingrid bergman sing and dance what was so great about her perhaps the critic did <UNK> appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact <UNK> since he sees a close resemblance between <UNK> <UNK> and bill <UNK> it was the idea and story behind the film the philosophy which was the most important and interesting factor and a musical in colour just made it more entertaining and enjoyable without <UNK> the intellectually appealing aspects it's a shame that many other films with so called great actors and actresses with <UNK> themes stories are utterly boring in comparison
<START> the main point of the movie imo is the fact the whole life has been nothing but a series of <UNK> the movie opens up with her secretly dying her gray roots and hiding the used <UNK> in an empty <UNK> box what is strange is that she is hiding this from her husband if she has to hide mundane things from her loved one one can bet that she is hiding even bigger things from others involved in her life br br when joanna accidentally hits <UNK> she leaves the scene to call the police by the time she returns the police and <UNK> are there as well as people from her community <UNK> what kind of person hits a child then just leaves her there well respected in her community she makes the decision to keep quiet about what she had done but she never realized how difficult it would be the keep up her <UNK> br br great movie i have seen it many times
<START> this is one of those movies that are very underrated again i am voting for an underrated movie this movie has a good story line maybe a bit <UNK> but it could happen sean <UNK> one of my favorite actors again shows us a good performance the guy does a great job in acting but never gets recognized for his roles he has done well since the <UNK> not only him but louis jr does a <UNK> job i thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters but who cares about money anyways all around this is a good movie that will have you at the edge of your seat at times and the plot will keep the movie moving itself i enjoyed this movie and hopefully the rest of you will as well
<START> after seeing this dvd i was <UNK> it is so wonderful not only does it capture led <UNK> during performances they span a few years this only shows the growth of the band and the growth of their great music this dvd is a must have the dvd is over 5 hours long with extras the extras are also great pieces some are of the band performing in <UNK> and other various <UNK> spots this contains footage that was once thought lost thankfully <UNK> and carefully restored to 5 1 <UNK> digital under direct <UNK> of jimmy page himself includes many timeless classics such as <UNK> to heaven going to california what is and what should never be <UNK> dick and so many more great <UNK> songs are also included this will correct any <UNK> that jimmy page isn't a supreme guitar legend
<START> the funniest movie from britain i have ever seen the is a tale of sex drugs cream and murder by the <UNK> dennis carter adrian average moron is out to impress his so called girlfriend <UNK> dawn french because she thinks he is too law <UNK> so to get her to come along with him on a romantic <UNK> he comes up with a scheme that perhaps will impress her and <UNK> her to spend some time with him trouble is <UNK> lie is that he's somehow gotten involved in an international drugs ring and while telling her a couple of policemen <UNK> his <UNK> and nick him and so begins this witty movie full of slick comedy and crude jokes dennis is <UNK> up in the local nick and much to the <UNK> <UNK> delight there seems to be no way out <UNK> earlier attempts to explain it was all a lie were <UNK> by a hilarious melody of stand by your man by the two <UNK> then comes along commander robertson ronald allen chief intelligence scotland yard he makes a deal with dennis that if he helps him catch the drug <UNK> then he will be set free and allowed whatever he <UNK> dennis agrees and is teamed up with harvey <UNK> peter richardson and <UNK> reynolds jennifer <UNK> the rest is an unforgettable <UNK> <UNK> experience with <UNK> <UNK> as sergeant <UNK> adding <UNK> colour to the film his walk along the dry <UNK> against frankie goes to hollywood's two <UNK> is superb and probably the best scene in motion picture history the two <UNK> who nick dennis are wonderfully played by michael and patrick and <UNK> as the motorcycle cop is a laugh if you want something good to watch on a saturday night then i suggest you rent this you won't forget it
<START> a dark and painful look at the <UNK> of drug addiction sinatra is wonderful in this film just watching his <UNK> <UNK> and screaming and destructive rage near the end of the film is enough to make anyone think twice about trying heroin maybe they should show this to kids in health class instead of the mindless drivel we are compelled to endure year after year br br it's the story of a man who is simply trying to make a new clean life for himself after being in prison trying to rid himself of his drug habit and his job of dealing cards in illegal gambling <UNK> who is pulled down pulled back into the <UNK> by the <UNK> of human nature he is being taken advantage of by his <UNK> the drug dealers and even his enigmatic <UNK> yet stupid wife br br even if you didn't like the film itself it's worth seeing just for the soundtrack it's all heavy swinging jazz with large drum and <UNK> sections this with its <UNK> yet slightly sinister sound helps set the mood along with the <UNK> <UNK> drug and card dealers who always seem to <UNK> like <UNK> around frankie machine br br i recommend this to anyone especially if you like film noir <UNK> suits <UNK> or jazz
<START> sorry to say but was disappointed in the film it was very very rushed as i suppose you can understand a movie length version of pride prejudice would be and i felt that a lot of the major scenes were <UNK> over just to get through the story as the movie is so rushed unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all br br not only that this movie is boring i say that with a capital b 1 3 of the way through i started <UNK> and couldn't wait for the movie to be over as i have read the book and watch the bbc version i knew how many scenes had to go before i could finally leave the cinema mr <UNK> whoever he is in this movie definitely can't act he looks also too young to play mr <UNK> every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like he needs to get through the script or something where is the build up at first he seems confused with everything he is just bizarre it all looks put on br br was trying not to compare to the colin <UNK> version but if you love that version you will most likely be disappointed anyway br br the costumes are absolutely shocking where are the <UNK> i know elizabeth is poor but i think she still knows how to dress as some sort of <UNK> fashion and hasn't been brought up in a her dresses <UNK> she might be the <UNK> <UNK> in all of england br br i didn't agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact that i don't think it would be considered proper in that society for men to do such things honestly mr who has wealth should know better there is some things that are said that sound too modern for the period this movie is set in and not at all like jane austen <UNK> character is shockingly to me he behaves like a <UNK> not a character to like and respect what about that laugh of his i hardly has a presence and mr mrs <UNK> and a couple of other characters have no presence at all <UNK> did okay but it just ain't the same
<START> absolutely amazing humor up beat music and an anti war message make this probably the best movie i have ever seen br br first of all i love how clever this movie is particularly in the vietnam part of the plot it's interesting how they make the army officials <UNK> the draft look ridiculous follow that with the serious situation of the actual war and then the conclusion which leaves me <UNK> with anger at the war and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen wow br br also the music is really cool but what is very unique in this musical as opposed to <UNK> or wizard of oz for example is that the lyrics don't tell the story the mood does along with the visuals and between songs dialog donna is an upbeat song which <UNK> the happy mood whereas flesh failures has a driving intense beat in a minor key br br also i notice the <UNK> scene is not very <UNK> now i'm definitely not going to do drugs not that i ever intended to br br all things considered this is an amazing movie the only negative comment i could say is that it's sometimes hard to hear the dialog but who cares 10 10 stars
<START> rating 10 classic waters one of his best and most shocking films divine is the most filthy person ever <UNK> stole also delivers a superb performance
<START> it's hard to imagine that the battle of <UNK> directed by the legendary d w griffith was made a way back in <UNK> it is a showcase for <UNK> <UNK> style br br the story centers around a group of <UNK> called the cameron brothers and their families which include a young <UNK> mae <UNK> sent out from the east to live with her <UNK> and a young wife <UNK> <UNK> who has just given birth a group of indians tries to capture the pet dogs and are driven off by the men folk during the confrontation the indian <UNK> son henry b is killed the indian chief plots his revenge and <UNK> an attack on the small community of <UNK> br br it is this attack which is quite brutal and graphic for this or any other time that forms the core of the picture the indians slaughter the towns folk women and children alike and drive them out of town towards the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> baby becomes separated from its mother and all hell breaks loose someone goes for help and returns in the nick of time with the <UNK> br br the battle scenes contain some graphic violence for example we see a woman being <UNK> alive and there is also a sequence where we see a horse being shot down i have never seen an animal being <UNK> so convincingly on screen mr griffith was becoming a master of staging large scale battle scenes a talent that he would use <UNK> in his epic civil war drama the birth of a nation released the following year br br even though it runs a <UNK> <UNK> minutes the battle of <UNK> is nonetheless an exciting and historic bit of film making see if you can spot lionel barrymore and harry carey in bit parts
<START> creepy and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and <UNK> throughout the lengthy <UNK> of the cycle people often assume that it was john carpenter that started the trend but as is the case with many of the <UNK> clichés the italians did it first movies like <UNK> <UNK> and blood and black <UNK> were the <UNK> of a <UNK> maniac in a murder mystery there were also a couple of american pre halloween slashers that warrant a mention <UNK> massacre keep my grave open and savage weekend clearly pre date 1978 whilst the town that <UNK> <UNK> is widely regarded as one of the first teen kill movies br br carpenter's <UNK> flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare but it certainly started the <UNK> race between directors to <UNK> the <UNK> disguise for their <UNK> over the years we've seen some memorable <UNK> but my favourites would have to be my bloody <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the sadistic soldier and wicked <UNK> <UNK> faced assassin i'm also keen on many of the killer <UNK> that have made an appearance throughout the category the final scene in the house on <UNK> row has to be listed as one of the best and the clown of midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest costumes br br a leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie probably because they are widely linked with sexual <UNK> which of course doesn't exactly make for a scary disguise but in later years both <UNK> and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be <UNK> with a <UNK> suit here's how the later of the two br br the screen lights up with the rush of blue <UNK> as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation it seems that a <UNK> out gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in <UNK> low brow <UNK> so he's decided to hold his wife and kid at <UNK> detective shine david <UNK> manages to <UNK> with the <UNK> but <UNK> for him he <UNK> the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like it's the end of the road for the grey haired officer fortunately he is saved in the nick of time by some <UNK> <UNK> from lisa <UNK> donna adams the california police <UNK> <UNK> female law <UNK> br br her heroic encounter earns the brunette a promotion to detective first class and its a feat that is heavily <UNK> by her male counterparts meanwhile a leather clad maniac is around town <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> their bloody corpses on street <UNK> <UNK> and shine are put on the case of the murderous <UNK> and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called michael walker john <UNK> lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal police <UNK> doesn't seem to apply to her so before long she's dating the cameraman even though he's suspect <UNK> <UNK> when the bodies continue to pile up around the city she decides to go undercover in an attempt to <UNK> out the s m br br if anything effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the end of its <UNK> what started as a great stepping stone for up and coming filmmakers and <UNK> had been reduced to a <UNK> of cinema by movies with flat direction zero suspense or shocks and talentless mediocre actors the boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to <UNK> their lack of strong dramatic line ups with <UNK> special effects and exciting directorial <UNK> unfortunately by this point in the cycle titles like rush week deadly dreams and the had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned characters ended up in an early grave br br donna adams doesn't even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour which includes doing a <UNK> for a top suspect in a <UNK> murder investigation is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might ever expect it to be couldn't direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial i searched and searched but found nothing here of merit or note br br on the plus side if you manage to keep the tv turned on until the end then you may be fairly surprised by the killer's identity to be honest though i doubt that by that time you'll even care and another plus point well <UNK> the disc is perfectly <UNK> which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon aside from that there's really no other reason to go out and buy bad bad bad and not in a good way this is 90 minutes of my life that i could have spent more <UNK> by <UNK> my chest hair abysmal
<START> this film <UNK> historic flight across the atlantic while touching on episodes in his <UNK> career through flashbacks stewart was about 20 years too old to be playing the young <UNK> but his fine performance particularly in the solo flight sequences makes this a minor <UNK> <UNK> rousing score is a big plus despite the long running time wilder manages to make it quite exciting and is able to sustain the drama even though the outcome is known what a year 1957 was for wilder besides this he also wrote and directed love in the afternoon and witness for the <UNK> and his next two were some like it hot and the apartment what a run
<START> <UNK> film course film was the legend of the <UNK> and during its <UNK> minute running time it managed to quickly jump into my top five most difficult films of all time that's difficult to watch films so different to everything else that you're seeing something totally alien a brief synopsis would be a group of <UNK> are trying to build a <UNK> to defend themselves from <UNK> but every time they are about to put on the finishing touches for no readily apparent reasons it <UNK> so they go and see a fortune <UNK> who <UNK> them that if they want to get the <UNK> to stay standing they need to find a youth a tall blonde blue eyed boy to be buried into one of the walls during the construction and his presence will ensure that the construction job will be completed smoothly and sure enough in those closing moments there he is gladly being <UNK> in <UNK> and eggs <UNK> as he's buried alive with only his mother to <UNK> br br it actually a fairly simple story but the director <UNK> working in soviet georgia in 1984 not too long after leaving a fifteen year jail term doesn't follow any of the film making rules we are used to there are very few close ups very often the action we need to be following is hidden in the bottom left hand corner of a landscape shot extra <UNK> easy to miss there are very few close ups and at times its hard to tell whose doing what to whom and why every now and then the film goes off on <UNK> which have no relevance to the main plot and generally serve to confuse the viewer the music is utterly mad with found sounds on screen <UNK> and church <UNK> dropped in seemingly at random at times when nothing seems to be happening someone will break into a <UNK> almost playing time until the next scene comes along but <UNK> there is an obvious cinematic voice behind it all so you're compelled to try and understand the message whatever it is one of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you can't believe what you're seeing
<START> family guy is the best show on tv ever it has achieved great things that no other animated sitcom or any show has even come close to achieving br br in terms of animated sitcoms this era should be referred to as the era of animated sitcoms because there are so many of them and almost every one of them imaginable is being released on dvd there are some good ones i e south park <UNK> and the simpsons every animated sitcom has its own style technique of creating humor for instance <UNK> is funny because it always comments or acts on what just happened with a touch of humor the simpsons is also a great show because it uses the same comedic technique and style that <UNK> does but the simpsons deserves the credit for it since it was on the air way before <UNK> and still remains on the air using the technique south park in my mind is the funniest show next to family guy because it uses a smart blend of <UNK> and silliness as it's technique of creating humor br br but enough about other animated shows let me tell you what makes family guy so funny family guy uses a comedic style that no other show has ever used before it uses a technique of having flashbacks occur after every joke this not only <UNK> the joke but makes it seem funnier it also moves at a very quick pace these two <UNK> make it the funniest show on tv you have to see the show to believe it but once you see it you will most likely agree <UNK> the two funniest moments on family guy were 1 the 5 minute chicken fight in da boom and 2 the dick van dyke spoof in holy crap also in my mind family guy is a very modest show because while other shows create humor by getting familiar with their routines and characters most of family guy's jokes are based on the silliness of current events and pop culture this also shows that family guy is intelligent in addition to being modest because it reveals that the show has insight and this technique is extremely effective because they relate their pop culture references to the particular plot of the episode they are found in br br family guy can be enjoyed by all ages because while younger children may not understand the pop culture references they will be amused by the hilarious silly antics of the characters especially peter the show is however a little bit more vulgar than the simpsons and <UNK> but it is less vulgar than south park so in terms of <UNK> family guy would rank somewhere in the middle when associated with the above shows but it would rank no 1 in terms humor and intelligence br br sadly it was cancelled last year not because it wasn't popular but because fox kept changing it's time <UNK> so no one ever knew when it was on luckily we've got the dvd box sets which by the way are selling like crazy and reruns on cartoon <UNK> adult swim available to us
<START> though not a complete waste of time really wasn't all sweet as it <UNK> to be nor are the ages of the actors they're portraying  18 my butt <UNK> could have actually shown up in the film telling us he was 30 and ask us to believe it even michael j fox was more believable as a teen in <UNK> to the <UNK> parts ii and iii okay maybe not they're probably equal believability if you can get past the obvious age flaw you'll have either the complete void of acting or simply overacting paul <UNK> so called anguish clarence lifetime moments and even though i do favor brendan <UNK> it's best to just watch him and more in <UNK> vs jason ' incomprehensible scenes a faster than britney spears marriage incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to <UNK> but still has one hand free  i'm guessing this was the writer's fantasy an entire movie of despicable characters anthony might be playing someone that's 18 but acts like he's 12 and some odd john thrown in so <UNK> character <UNK> can save the day  was there really a sex scene in front of a baby and practically every character questioning their own sexuality by strange actions scenes on the positive side i did enjoy ian <UNK> voice over seeing a rarely well portrayed straight gay friendship puppy love from someone who <UNK> stuffed <UNK> that is good score some decent dialogue love the <UNK> of gays and <UNK>  wish more people would realize that and acting from the female leads as well as <UNK> i can't really recommend it as it's really trying to be too many things  gay tolerance gay <UNK> <UNK> wwii epic <UNK> first love flawed judges etc etc etc  on a <UNK> budget
<START> spoiler ahead the mummy <UNK> <UNK> jr is on the loose in a new england college town searching for a college student <UNK> <UNK> who is the reincarnation of his beloved princess <UNK> dull slow even at <UNK> minutes it moves slower than the mummy <UNK> acted but the ending is worth waiting for the mummy gets the girl and she ages rapidly as the both slowly sink in a swamp this is i believe the only time in a universal monster movie that the monster got the girl that aside this is amateur night probably the worst of the mummy sequels and that's saying something
<START> four daughters introduced john garfield to audiences and that is what is remembered most about this film today unlike some actors who appear in several films before their screen image <UNK> garfield established his immediately with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and talk of the <UNK> being against him br br it's actually the story of four girls their widowed musician father claude <UNK> and their various <UNK> one of whom felix is played by handsome jeffrey <UNK> he's the one they all have a crush on but he's in love with buff <UNK> lane then she meets <UNK> do well mickey <UNK> who falls for her as well when buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with felix she leaves him at the <UNK> and marries mickey br br this is a fairly formulaic story given life and sequels by the acting garfield has already been mentioned but <UNK> lane was by far the strongest of the daughters the most interesting and the best actress jeffrey <UNK> was a fresh and good looking leading man and this film got him off on the right foot with <UNK> however true stardom was not to be like many others of the era he went into the service and when he came out he had a <UNK> star but not much of a career he later went into television and real estate claude <UNK> is warm and wonderful as the <UNK> br br so popular was four daughters that it inspired four wives and four mothers as well as <UNK> much of the cast again in daughters courageous where the actors played different characters br br very enjoyable a nice <UNK> of simpler and probably happier times and a chance to see john garfield in his first film
<START> this show is up there with the best <UNK> made in australia as it makes fun of pretty much anything which is what lots of our public want some of the best bits in the show are the ad road test which <UNK> out how an ad would do in real life what is really great about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people the <UNK> who love doing what they do and who would <UNK> this show has loads of bits in it that can crack up anybody like the ad road test which i've already mentioned mr ten questions where he asks 10 questions really fast in front of famous celebrities like hugh jackman and the beach boys temporary ones like the <UNK> <UNK> and ones that have been there from the start like what have we <UNK> from current affairs this week overall i rate thin show 98
<START> because disney more often than not ignores the animation quality and a need for a good plot in their sequels this was actually a nice surprise i don't know why disney does not pay more attention to their sequels the graphics quality is always inferior no backgrounds worthy of the name disney inane plots and worse dialog with little or no attention given to the actual story and the caricature drawings are almost always worse than saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality br br the animation quality is still poor when compared to disney originals and the dialog is quite trite the story line and overall execution was really quite enjoyable br br while it is not as captivating it does not completely fail to capture the charm and or mystery from the first there is some hint of it <UNK> away here and there br br the children will like it at any rate br br it rates a 4 5 10 from br br the fiend
<START> following a 19th century gun <UNK> that goes awry a charming young woman becomes a vampire not only does she become one of the undead she uses her <UNK> <UNK> persona to sustain her talents as a cold blooded assassin this is a low grade b feature that should have went straight to video the violence is vicious and gory but actually quite mild the story line is so weak and dialogue so <UNK> it is hard to work up much interest <UNK> <UNK> is the lead character <UNK> silver also in the cast are mark kevin <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> to say i wasn't expecting much sitting down to watch the couch trip is an understatement i had no idea what it was about i thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when i heard chevy chase played a <UNK> man and the movie's title involves the word couch trip <UNK> <UNK> then i figured out that it had something to do with a mental <UNK> and a patient escaping my expectations dropped even lower br br i was literally expecting a grin movie the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated and in a way this is cheap comedy it doesn't have the greatest gags the plot is ludicrous but you know what i had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time i was watching it br br dan <UNK> plays john burns a patient at a mental hospital who may or may not actually be mental he gives the psychiatrist lawrence david plenty of grief and misery which leads us to believe he is a sane person after all br br following a little bit of a riot in the mental <UNK> <UNK> burns is awaiting a tongue <UNK> from in his office when the phone rings burns picks it up pretends to be and finds out the <UNK> on the other line harvey michaels richard <UNK> wants the real dr to come fill in for a radio shrink named george charles <UNK> who is taking a vacation with his wife vera mary gross michaels wants so bad he has even <UNK> him a ticket on an airplane br br burns escapes the <UNK> with the help of a <UNK> and drives to <UNK> he gets dr ticket gets on the plane and eventually poses on the air as dr his show is a phenomenal success people love him one man says and the other man replies it's because he actually cares about them br br donald <UNK> the late great walter matthau is an ex mental patient who <UNK> <UNK> clothes to be <UNK> <UNK> pants and shirts to keep him quiet burns promises <UNK> a <UNK> of his <UNK> the secret is kept closed br br meanwhile and his wife get in an argument he flies home to end his vacation short and realizes that the man on his talk show is not in fact dr after all but no one believes him he gets the real dr but unfortunately he has lost his id so the police take them as <UNK> and don't listen to their story br br let me name just a few of the plot holes i noticed while watching this film burns poses as dr but is never asked for his id even when claiming his plane ticket he was robbed he says but they would still make sure he is if burns becomes so very famous how come the real dr in chicago never heard people talking about him word travels and finally why would the police ever arrest and the real that is without following up on their stories br br to be frankly honest i couldn't care less i went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me i really liked it it entertained me its ideas are essentially ludicrous and not at all realistic but dan <UNK> gives a truly spirited performance as a half a <UNK> that makes the couch trip a trip worth taking br br 3 5 5 stars br br john <UNK>
<START> i stopped this movie at 48 minutes and change i don't know maybe it's because i'm not swedish or french the cannes <UNK> or any of those other sleepy places from which the previous reviewers held forth born and raised in ny lived near san francisco for a quarter of a century and now holland i love a good independent film as much as the next movie <UNK> but this in a word isn't funny see now that's funny that you're thinking that i made a mistake i said <UNK> a <UNK> but then said <UNK> nope no mistake if this is your type of humor i'd say you haven't really had much of a life consider your appreciation of this film a <UNK> and please don't ever write another review i have a tendency to believe them when they're <UNK> even if there only were about 3 reviews before mine i figured i might actually be able to save someone else the boredom the anticipation of laughter that never <UNK> i did smile once or twice though when i started the movie and when i stopped it that should be 10 lines
<START> having watched this film years ago it never faded from my memory i always thought this was the finest performance by michelle pfeiffer that i've seen but i am <UNK> by the number of negative reviews that this film has received after seeing it once more today i still think it is powerful moving and couldn't care less if it is based loosely on king <UNK> br br i now realize that this is the greatest performance by jessica lange that i've ever seen and she has had <UNK> for much <UNK> efforts br br a thousand <UNK> is complex human vibrant and immensely moving but surely doesn't present either of the primary female leads with any touch of <UNK> or <UNK> i don't think this is well received in these times br br perhaps one reason for this film's <UNK> response lies in the fact that the writer jane <UNK> screenplay laura jones and director are all women i know that in my younger days i wouldn't have read a book written by a woman i didn't focus on this fact until years later br br if you haven't seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past try watching it <UNK> maybe you are ready for it
<START> i just found the entire 3 dvd set at wal mart in the bargain bin for 5 50 so i thought i would take another look total of 13 hours to watch it all 26 episodes i was born in 1948 and saw most of them on tv in the sixties many independent stations repeated them for many years br br better than i expected actually time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of it's creators and to the obvious <UNK> and respect they give to all the allied fighting men and women more abstract and arty than a straight forward documentary but very truthful in it's depiction of the causes and final results of wwii that war was greatly <UNK> on sea <UNK> and the final victory was <UNK> on who achieved the final <UNK> of the world's <UNK> the allies were the ones who were able to do it br br interesting too to see how they try to strike a balance between big events and the individual soldiers and sailors that made them happen the score is impressive if a bit too much by today's standards i read somewhere that robert russell bennett contributed just as much as richard <UNK> to final score i imagine that <UNK> provided all the major themes and it was up to bennett to fit them to the images great job br br should be seen by every <UNK> or potential <UNK> a warning to <UNK> that wars are eventually won by ideals determination and the supplies to back them up <UNK> their quality and delivery will determine the eventual <UNK> the allies and <UNK> the material quality of the <UNK> attacked their very source in the process and <UNK> their eventual defeat br br sorry to see that the producer henry lived a very short life <UNK> facts were rather skimpy i have to find out more about him he did a few more outstanding documentaries before his early death might have more to say at a later time br br trivia i had all 3 <UNK> records made of the background music pretty good overall unfortunately the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one immediately to just novelty status rather than for serious music listening too bad too because it contained some interesting but more minor themes in the series silly stuff like 16 inch guns firing <UNK> being fired <UNK> planes just for kids mainly br br
<START> from the title the tag line the plot summary on the dvd etc i expected something at least slightly epic with the historical fiction and the romance to thrill you that's what they did in last of the <UNK> for example and i think they did a superb job maybe i had standards too high for this movie and didn't give it a fair chance but the scenery was barely ok how could they not come up with something more beautiful when they have such landscapes to work with the two lovers had no chemistry whatsoever and the plot was just so predictable it felt like it had been <UNK> in 5 minutes by a twelve year old and not a very imaginative one <UNK> france is a love story set in an <UNK> historical age but the history of <UNK> france is hardly a side note and the love story is banal and fails dramatically to make the viewer care for the <UNK> fate surprisingly the only good parts about the movie came from something completely unexpected and the relationship between marie the heroine and her children one natural one adopted if only they'd concentrated on her family and forgotten about the love story it would have been a much better movie marie parents should have been given more screen time and character development the politics going on in britain should have been more than a three minute scene with barely any connection to the rest the rotten baddie should have been either more developed or removed from the script completely why hire actors like vincent <UNK> tim roth or jason <UNK> to <UNK> them so badly bad work overall
<START> at the very beginning the look at a control <UNK> that reads 8 miles of the cost of california and no i didn't that they really did not realize the put of the cost instead of off the coast these people must have been morons br br it's good if you're into terrible movies but the sheer fact they couldn't catch a simple spelling issue make me believe they really didn't put any effort into creating the movie whatsoever the navy uniforms are not correct at all in any manner whatsoever br br wow completely ridiculous but good if you are looking for something insanely stupid to watch how these folks made any money off this is beyond me
<START> rated tv 14 for sexual content and language br br i remembered hearing about this show back in 1998 when it used to play on the channel i didn't watch it then but now it plays on the channel <UNK> i have seen about four episodes of this show and i must say it is fairly intelligent and funny br br the show stars jason alexander of seinfeld fame and also tim <UNK> of rocky horror picture show and it fame the show is about a duck who is a police officer he basically does his job as a policeman while <UNK> with personal problems this show is fairly funny at times and fans of animated comedy will like this
<START> the giant claw is in fierce competition with films like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> 9 from outer <UNK> for worst film of all time a phony looking giant attacks in this completely unconscious film the script is so bad that everything the characters say to one another is ridiculous it's no wonder that this film is a prime target in the movie it came from hollywood where this gem is <UNK> for the line 'a bird as big as a with <UNK> endless the line pops up relentlessly through the course of the film so there's no escaping it there are several shots from 'the beast from 20 000 and <UNK> vs the flying <UNK> among other sci fi films from the 50's to <UNK> up the <UNK> attacks at one point the big is responsible for a few deaths so the military puts the entire world under martial law and no one is allowed to go out of their homes of course the huge <UNK> is mainly concerned with pursuing the stars of this classic jeff <UNK> <UNK> wherever they might be yet the director is so lame that he doesn't even provide for a few honey shots of pretty <UNK> in a decent dress and black heels for a little relief from the tedium of this zero star thriller that's the second time this <UNK> has been made in <UNK> <UNK> around in hot dresses for the whole film but is <UNK> to pants throughout 'the giant the budget for this film must have been not more than thirty or forty thousand dollars and i doubt whether <UNK> or got more than three thousand to make it it looks like the whole thing was shot right out of <UNK> garage
<START> michelle was so nice and i really fall in love with her she died a few months ago friends really the best movie of my youth the seasons <UNK> of <UNK> and his <UNK> paul <UNK> sings in my head forever please if you know where i could find a vhs of the film mail me my husband of 26 years i saw this as <UNK> in <UNK> yes he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be i think we both cried our eyes out i think possibly we were drawn to the movie by the <UNK> john music in it but were then swept away by the teenage angst of it all paul and michelle were just about our ages when we saw the movie so very easy to identify with it is wonderful to hear that sean is doing well i am also in the helping <UNK> an <UNK> i thought his performance was good and very believable michelle came across as very sweet fragile and vulnerable i think the main theme is that if they didn't have to deal with the real world then they could be happy and continue to be in love how many times have all of us wanted to just have a moment if we all had no outside <UNK> and could just deal with our basic needs it could be somewhat easier i have a 15 <UNK> old daughter and wouldn't have a problem with her seeing this movie kids see so much worse these days that this is very tame for those of you who are trying to locate the cd my husband a huge <UNK> john fan was able to get a 2 cd set which came out in 1992 it is called <UNK> john rare masters <UNK> studios this has all the friends songs as well as many others as far as we know this is the only cd with the friends music we also had the <UNK> years ago and were thrilled to find the cd good luck i recommend this movie for anyone who loves the young love theme i only wish it was on dvd now
<START> and are two that rob from the rich in order to give to well the rich <UNK> they are the rich but we know they're the good guys because the <UNK> behind the forces of law and order a mr chance is just so evil he rapes women or tries to he beats up his <UNK> he commits murder he has bad breath he doesn't <UNK> properly he has no fashion sense he <UNK> puppy dogs that last one is just an <UNK> of mine we don't actually see him torture puppy dogs but i'm sure he does little of <UNK> <UNK> has much to do with his pursuit of and it's just something he does in his spare time a kind of a <UNK> he takes up to make absolutely certain that we don't like him he <UNK> have tried so hard no one in this film is likeable br br let's take stock appealing characters there aren't any i believe we've covered that <UNK> not a <UNK> instead we have a kind of <UNK> heavy breathing dash <UNK> <UNK> all gone the way of <UNK> i'm afraid realism none of that either i think they were trying for realism since everyone was so filthy but the characters and action had all the <UNK> of errol flynn with no sense of <UNK> to back them up beauty nope fine camera work for a tv crew perhaps humour you might giggle once or twice if you're in a <UNK> mood then again you might not dialogue see <UNK> above music don't even get me started on the music the music in was by comparison <UNK> apt and at least the misguided aesthetic of that score was a consistent one br br ugh i <UNK> to for even thinking about it in this context br br to sum up there's much positive badness here and nothing good unless you count <UNK> tyler which i'm in two minds about doing br br i feel as though i've just written a review of the <UNK> not very good ' the review says it would be much more interesting if i could somehow defend the <UNK> to claim that critics of the <UNK> have got it all wrong but i don't know how i'd go about doing that
<START> i have an affection for these twists on british social <UNK> and it is rare that one loses me but our <UNK> did lose me a bit it's a tale of social <UNK> and their joy at breaking the rules but personally i found it a little dull br br i liked the <UNK> though she <UNK> a little too much and <UNK> bennett <UNK> fills the role of lady a role that bette davis could have played backwards br br but the movie comes the life in the third act when ernest joins the party he is so lively and fun and in truth probably wears more makeup then lady he gets the last line of the film and it's a gas
<START> <UNK> is <UNK> worst film he has ever made it's full of his usual i e snappy dialogue brutal and sudden violence but it all <UNK> <UNK> the directing is typical tarantino and nothing <UNK> new at all it's almost as if he's copied exactly from his only masterpiece pulp fiction br br there is nothing new or exciting about <UNK> to be honest it's just a war drama that isn't funny nor brilliant as pulp fiction was <UNK> supposedly is <UNK> tribute to <UNK> spaghetti <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and out of place especially with the continuing use of big sub titles and the audience of balance
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into br br this is a fantastic film its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently tell everyone you know to go see it now fantastic br br the acting is excellent and <UNK> plays a starring role this film will change the way you view people with <UNK> and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema i can't wait <UNK> it comes out on dvd
<START> there are many familiar hitchcock elements of previous and later films and this time they mix to a jolly but hardly suspenseful piece of entertainment you can tell that dorothy parker had a hand in the script the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of hero <UNK> with the blind man and his encounter with a rather bizarre group of circus people the famous climax on the statue of liberty seems a bit heavy handed judged by standards but also compared to other <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> e g blackmail north by <UNK>
<START> the most self indulgent movie i have every had the misfortune to br br rent unwatchable much of the movie is obviously improvised br br and not well it looks like took the first take of br br everything the movie gets good for a couple of minutes when br br robert downey jr shows up then goes to hell again real br br quickly
<START> robert <UNK> and robert young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers <UNK> in italy during world war i the dialog is highly entertaining and jimmy <UNK> is hilarious as the <UNK> cook walter <UNK> character is inspiring as the captain of the submarine a stellar example of an officer and a gentleman one of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes i was surprised at how similar the technology of world war i was to the technology displayed 25 years later in world war ii basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times and far from the <UNK> i thought existed in the so called innocent past all in all i felt that the cast characters action scenes and view of history depicted in this movie were first rate
<START> i was surprised that <UNK> the did not generate more buzz at this years sundance film festival there were times that the laughter at the screening i saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie the movie has some excellent acting and a story that really makes one examine <UNK> issues you know little issues like religion sex and the truth lots of <UNK> seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations many leave you thinking i know they ripped this off from some sitcom this film takes off on its own unique direction i really think that jay <UNK> did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film
<START> i can't believe i missed this one made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow you to make one indifferent episode of a tv soap this is 90 minutes of <UNK> sharp as a knife film making you will find the outline plot etc elsewhere on this site consider though that the whole thing was shot using a single hand held <UNK> camera all the dialogue is improvised none of the <UNK> had appeared in front of a camera before it sounds like a recipe for disaster instead what we get is hippies v cops running around in the california desert in what <UNK> into a <UNK> not fair i'm on that person's the only problem is the director keeps making you shift your <UNK> and at the end of 90 minutes we're still not sure who has one brilliant quite brilliant
<START> sure this movie may have had its funny moments with the sat question people and i know the movie is not supposed to be totally believable the movie made it too outrageous for example a girl like that would never in a million years go out wit ha guy like that also people in movie had lackluster performances there acting was so bad also the plot bad they could have don e a better job on the scripting at least and focused more on the comedy the comedy was also a little dry and got really boring after the first few jokes it was like was laughter then the old when is this gonna end started to kick in the bottom line if u want a a lackluster of acting mixed in with a stupid plot and a romance go ahead and watch this movie
<START> i watch this film with horror in my heart because my mother also was a crack head like michelle i've been wondering where michelle is now there has been times where i had to find my mother in places i was scared to be but more scared to leave her there to see michelle act like that made me wonder where she was sleeping all that time i watched in hopes the it was never that bad for my mom and what i want to know is where did matt and tracy tear that ass up worst scene for me was watching tracy shoot up in an old navy dressing room u never who try clothes on before you and it looks like all of them except michelle has aids where are they know 2008 can we get an update
<START> holy this movie rocks the duo of chris <UNK> and david spade are great together my favorite parts are fat guy in a little coat oh my gosh room service and more scenes that will be remembered for years to come this movie has a huge cult following i wonder why which proves that even eleven years after chris tragic death and he still is popular he plays tommy which will make you laugh every time you still watch it he is a great comedian and is missed mr spade reminds me of dan while chris <UNK> reminds me of john belushi they done more than 2 movies together this movie is a must buy and should be in every snl <UNK> collection
<START> this film entered production before ww2 began but was not released until it was well under way with significant fascist sympathy in the us and chaplin himself being suspected as a communist <UNK> the great dictator was a very courageous <UNK> such risks in film making <UNK> <UNK> political statements would be almost <UNK> today imagine the <UNK> if someone were to make an equally satirical film today which <UNK> the <UNK> foreign policy br br this film is hilarious poignant and tragic the tragedy is that chaplin makes a <UNK> for the madness to end but it is already to late for him and for us a must see if you have any interest whatsoever in history film making politics or as an art form
<START> believe it or not the <UNK> lisa actually got stolen once and was missing for nearly two years in <UNK> <UNK> da <UNK> better known as the <UNK> lisa was taken from the <UNK> by a petty thief and former <UNK> employee who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native italy his actions after the <UNK> make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit of course he had no hope of finding a <UNK> the <UNK> lisa was quietly returned to the <UNK> on the very last day of <UNK> remaining there ever since except for occasional <UNK> outs when <UNK> was released in 1932 twenty years after the <UNK> most <UNK> would have <UNK> that <UNK> crime and their knowledge would have <UNK> some <UNK> to this movie <UNK> is quite enjoyable with <UNK> usual high production standards and jack usual <UNK> efficient direction this movie does not lack for pleasure what it lacks is <UNK> br br john barrymore is the master criminal of the title he <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> crimes which he makes even more difficult by <UNK> them in advance but of course he always commits the crime and fools the <UNK> marshall has a good scene as one of <UNK> victims <UNK> has a <UNK> for elaborate <UNK> which <UNK> barrymore a u s <UNK> ham to <UNK> his own <UNK> for <UNK> john's older brother lionel barrymore is the <UNK> like detective <UNK> to catch <UNK> br br karen <UNK> was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was filled with <UNK> political activities on screen she was most impressive in working class roles that <UNK> her own political beliefs such as her fine performance in <UNK> daily in <UNK> naturally dark hair is <UNK> a horrid blonde tone and she's all <UNK> up in posh outfits that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexy br br spoilers coming eventually <UNK> decides to steal the <UNK> lisa from the <UNK> he <UNK> the painting from its frame rolls up the <UNK> and then <UNK> it out in a flower basket we see john barrymore casually <UNK> a tightly rolled piece of cloth which is allegedly the greatest work of art in all human history i had to laugh at the <UNK> error in real life but not in this movie da <UNK> painted the <UNK> lisa on a <UNK> of wood so a thief would have difficulty rolling it up br br eventually captures <UNK> and him off to le the scene between john and lionel barrymore in the police car is sheer delight as their genuine affection for each other <UNK> out into their characters' dialogue i would have found this scene implausible with any two other actors as it is i can't imagine anyone but the barrymore brothers playing these roles well maybe dennis and randy quaid but just barely br br don't look for a good plot line here but <UNK> is a delightful example of old style movie making i'll rate this movie 8 points out of 10
<START> previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies this one is from a guy in love with his own writing it isn't <UNK> its disgusting br br i absolutely hated <UNK> <UNK> the entire point of a film is to entertain if u call bashing people's heads and <UNK> their <UNK> entertaining and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit it is extreme boredom or disgust br br the movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages there is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table before thankfully they are all shot i wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes even woody allen knows when to shut the f k up br br this table talk style is a tarantino hallmark but in other films i actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking here i couldn't care less all of <UNK> films display an enormous confidence particularly jackie brown but here there is a <UNK> feeling in every scene tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film br br is it violent sure there's torture and <UNK> but you'd have to remind me thankfully the film was so thin i didn't even remember i had seen it earlier in the day when until i saw a review <UNK> on br br he's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel but do us a favor <UNK> and spare us the movie br br i walked out of this movie halfway through and i would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die hard fan he or she is br br i give it 0 10
<START> this <UNK> french movie deals about a millionaire owner of a <UNK> factory on an african island nearly to <UNK> named louis jean paul <UNK> he's a single man looking wife then he <UNK> a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named julia catherine <UNK> when she <UNK> appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected he marries to julia but she suddenly disappears a french eye private michael <UNK> is hired by <UNK> sister and soon he's on the trail of his previous <UNK> later louis encounters her in a dancing hall under another name in spite of the romantic <UNK> and everything louis goes on <UNK> with his enigmatic wife br br this film is a splendid drama plenty of betrayal deception killing <UNK> and <UNK> suspense good performances by jean paul <UNK> as young of a cigarette company who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful catherine <UNK> as suspect heroine the film gets several references to the american cinema but <UNK> 400 blows was a <UNK> <UNK> such as johnny guitar <UNK> jim bogart and hitchcock the usa version was cut numerous minutes and deserves an <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> loosely based on the novel into by <UNK> <UNK> rear window and screenwriter of alfred hitchcock hour who also was adapted in the bride wore <UNK> colorful cinematography by <UNK> stolen kisses and atmospheric musical score by <UNK> <UNK> usual musician this is one of the best of his suspense movies along with <UNK> and shoot the piano remade by an inferior version by michael 2001 with antonio <UNK> angelina jolie and jack thompson full of erotic and lust scenes
<START> i agree with the guy above it is so funny i understand it all but my friends just don't get it go to japan and you will see a different movie after being there when i met my girlfriends dad at his home in i swear i felt the same as jack scared but by the end of the day it was all good so i give this movie a 10 out 10 br br i have watched it at least 30 times taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to japan next month one thing that is real good is the ball game scenes makes me feel like i am there again this is a must see if you have any interest in japan and baseball too bad they don't make a sequel does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the argument with in the with a roof on it need to know so i can win an with me japanese ex wife thanks
<START> or to the far side of the <UNK> as it is more <UNK> known was written with <UNK> by the late donald james and produced by <UNK> and sylvia anderson best known for their television shows such as <UNK> br br the international space agency discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and <UNK> a <UNK> flight be sent there the <UNK> <UNK> at the cost and the project but when a security <UNK> at the agency is discovered <UNK> that the russians might get there first the project gets the green light br br american astronaut glenn ross roy <UNK> is teamed with british scientist john kane ian <UNK> after weeks of <UNK> training the phoenix <UNK> off heading for the unknown br br three weeks later their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak <UNK> landscape ross survives but kane is badly injured a light is seen moving towards them br br i will leave the synopsis here until this point the film has been gripping with excellent special effects by derek <UNK> and music by <UNK> resident composer barry gray why it has not been <UNK> on c d is a mystery but when ross and kane crash land and we discover the secret of the alien world it is a <UNK> of our own everyone on it is the same the only major difference is that things are <UNK> it becomes less interesting and ends with a shattering anti climax i think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea in fact <UNK> sylvia later did something similar on their <UNK> show ross risks and ultimately loses his life in an effort to return to earth his earth but why the new earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered br br roy <UNK> had recently done 'the television series and gives a competent performance pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he <UNK> with his wife ian <UNK> is good as but <UNK> from the story too soon several actors went on to appear in the f o ' such as ed bishop and george <UNK> blink and you will miss nicholas <UNK> 'the from <UNK> <UNK> in a tiny role but the acting <UNK> go to the late patrick as head of the character is not far removed from john the one he played in a t v 's 'the power <UNK> <UNK> is such a <UNK> character he is marvellous to watch herbert contribution as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye amounts to little more than a cameo br br like i said the special effects are marvellous as are the sets so the film is worth watching but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet with a stronger script this could have been another <UNK> of the <UNK> or dare i say it <UNK> a space br br in <UNK> productions he made the future seem like a great place an adventure <UNK> where science was cool everyone had <UNK> cars whose doors opened <UNK> sexy women and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world we are in the future now and people are still watching <UNK> every other night how disappointing if a mirror earth really exists somewhere one hopes that is a better place than this one if all the women there look like <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> von i will be on the next flight
<START> i think is a great and a very funny movie the story is so funny the daughter nicole brings her father andre in some very embarrassing situations in an effort to impress the boy of her dreams the daughter pretends that her father is her lover you just have to see <UNK> is lovely as nicole perhaps too lovely i'm not sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone gerard depardieu acts very great in this comedy film he is so fun to watch if you like comedy and romantic film you just have to see this i think you can see this film many time and you will still have a good laugh br br in an effort to impress the boy of her dreams the girl pretends that her father is her lover
<START> it occurred to me while watching imaginary heroes that any screenwriter attempting to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing off a kid or two in the opening reel as a way of getting his characters to open up and reveal themselves there must be something to this storyline for it seems as if every other family drama that comes down the <UNK> uses this device in one form or another paradise and <UNK> mile are just two of the more recent examples that spring immediately to mind although one could reach back to a golden <UNK> like who's afraid of virginia <UNK> to make the point as well it's not that the death of a child is an <UNK> subject for serious films to explore far from it it's just that like any topic it can be so <UNK> that it becomes just another movie cliché a convenient bit of narrative <UNK> to get the ball rolling and to give the characters something to <UNK> with for the remainder of the time we get to spend with them br br the latest such work is imaginary heroes a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the earliest and perhaps best known examples of the family <UNK> with the death of a child genre the academy award winning ordinary people like the characters in that earlier film the seem on the surface to be the ideal suburban family until one <UNK> day their oldest son matt who is the golden boy <UNK> and thus the apple of his father's eye kills himself with no explanation one minor difference is that the son in ordinary people dies as a result of an accident not a suicide it is <UNK> younger brother tim who winds up finding the body and who assumes the role of protagonist in the film each of the remaining family members <UNK> with the tragedy in his or her own way matt who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother becomes more and more estranged from the father who has virtually ignored him all his life and begins to turn to drugs for ben the father becomes <UNK> up in feelings of <UNK> and guilt turning away from both his job and his family his wife sandy is the most complex character in the film a free spirited child of the <UNK> who feels oddly <UNK> in the role of mother and wife as she <UNK> a basically <UNK> marriage in <UNK> <UNK> she spends most of her time after the tragedy trying to <UNK> with her pot smoking past br br as written and directed by dan harris imaginary heroes emerges as a wildly uneven film for every scene that feels real and authentic there is another that comes across as <UNK> and <UNK> one sometimes has the sense that harris would like to <UNK> every possible life situation he can think of into his screenplay an admirable goal perhaps but one that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process instead of <UNK> with the characters and being caught up in their plight we often find ourselves thinking oh come next for teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot button topics covered in this film the screenplay also touches on drug and alcohol abuse physical abuse sexual identity conflict life threatening illness even <UNK> gay incest it is this everything but the kitchen sink mentality in the writing that <UNK> the movie of much of the credibility it needs to really make us care br br that is not to say that imaginary heroes is a bad or <UNK> film much of what it has to say about <UNK> relationships and values in the 21st century is insightful original pointed and profound prime credit for its success goes to the actors <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> weaver and jeff daniels who deliver <UNK> sensitive performances in their respective roles it is they who triumph over the narrative <UNK> to <UNK> our brains and touch our hearts moreover harris in his direction achieves an effectively <UNK> tone throughout but one that is frequently <UNK> by some badly needed flashes of daring dark comedy br br imaginary heroes may appear <UNK> and derivative at times but its fine performances and subtle mood shifts make it a film worth watching
<START> this is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of the scarlet <UNK> ever to be <UNK> as a <UNK> fan i was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters but this atrocity is not worth watching even if you aren't familiar with the story br br <UNK> for example would never stab people in the back just to get down a <UNK> would never have a string of women in his bed <UNK> never had an affair with nor <UNK> with <UNK> whoever the heck she is would not randomly shoot tony in the head name is not nor has it ever been paul they have completely <UNK> any reference to the <UNK> replacing them instead with james bond <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br as to the film itself the makeup is horrifying the women look like <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> beauty mark wanders around her face at random the poor <UNK> actors have no script to work with so it's not really their fault that their characters are as thin as wet <UNK> paper the dialogue oh the dialogue the dialogue is unbearable and whoever is responsible for all those little <UNK> at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as <UNK> i counted 13 location <UNK> in the first half hour before i gave up as if we can't figure out that the body of water between england and france is the english channel br br the film if i can bring myself to call it that since it's really just <UNK> with a <UNK> is absolutely without redeeming value do not waste your time and brain cells on this <UNK> drivel instead go watch the 1982 anthony andrews jane seymour version or the 1934 leslie howard film or indeed anything but this one
<START> this completely forgotten slasher flick is one of the best horror movies ever made very dark at times it reminds me a little famous thriller deliverance director jeff creates terrific atmosphere of dread and despair all actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable so if you are searching for something creepy try to find this little treasure my personal rating 10 out of 10 p s this one is even more chilling than halloween
<START> i'm trying to understand what people liked about <UNK> i am an avid film viewer and film maker as i was telling friends during my lunch hour <UNK> may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year just like the short the film missed its marks several times during the movie it made attempts at humor it sets you up for the laugh instead of making you laugh it leaves you feeling empty the jokes reminded one of the recent star wars films they weren't funny unless you were five and the acting felt similarly terrible i've seen actors actually act in front of a blue screen and i've believed it but not in this film not for a second br br this film takes a formula and tries to apply it with pretty and though the script is totally <UNK> and the special effects quite beautiful it has no heart to it and fails miserably i left the film shaking my head and considered leaving the theater i felt and miserable and still haven't gotten the sour taste out of my mouth from it i love independent film i encourage people to view independent films to support them but not this film this film shouldn't have been made at least not like this why did the director miss the marks so clearly they were clearly not just the humor but the emotions the drama even the lines were poorly timed and delivered it was like the film walked on three legs instead of four its steps are awkward and miss timed and it could fall over with the slightest don't see this film i don't care who you are it isn't worth your time
<START> the story itself is routine a boy runs away from home and ends up in a struggling music school for kids he convinces a famous <UNK> to <UNK> the school the film is a <UNK> of shootings over 11 weeks and leaves many amusing holes which the <UNK> viewer may find for him herself br br however long the <UNK> of the plot might have been the movie is justified by its music and acting there is plenty of music featuring classical works played by and by the orchestra one of the leading youth <UNK> of that day and said music is excellent by itself it would make the picture worth viewing the <UNK> and <UNK> duties were put in the best of hands those of alfred <UNK> br br the acting is a study in <UNK> the kids in the orchestra most of whom had little or no acting experience must have driven director <UNK> <UNK> crazy looking into the camera overacting the parts that they had and following directions given to them but the <UNK> that results from their lack of training adds an interesting charm to the picture the veteran actors were marvelous with the material they had to work with walter brennan was perfectly cast in his role one that he <UNK> in real life joel <UNK> and <UNK> were ideal fits for their parts and the supporting acting was a <UNK> who's who of character actors <UNK> main arthur <UNK> paul harvey charles coleman perry and porter hall in his typical role of the heavy all <UNK> cast and the bit players jessie arnold john hamilton <UNK> wood jimmy <UNK> day the <UNK> voiced lee <UNK> in his usual role as a policeman and many many more if you're a fan of character actors this movie will bring back a lot of memories br br overall the picture is very enjoyable and is recommended even if you aren't a fan of classical music br br
<START> it's hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn't produced once but four times most movies require a certain suspension of <UNK> to enjoy but this one takes it just too far the basic scenario is an air force pilot who is shot down over a middle country the us government drags its feet in recovering him leading the <UNK> son doug masters to attempt a rescue mission br br the problem i have with the movie is that it depicts the us air force as one <UNK> joke in the movie you'll find that doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two f all the <UNK> the fuel the <UNK> for the mission and so on security on this base seems to be a joke nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteen year old kid is fully <UNK> to pilot an f 16 br br if that wasn't enough you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the <UNK> right since people like to see things blow <UNK> not so several times in the movie doug fires off aim 9 <UNK> on ground targets aim stands for air <UNK> meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the air he also fires off 15 20 <UNK> where the maximum an f 16 can hold is 6 aim <UNK> the movie also lacks continuity you'll see the aircraft <UNK> with one set of <UNK> and in the next scene it has a totally different <UNK> package also doesn't just completely destroy anything it touches an f 16 will hold 500 rounds of and it's mostly used for self defense br br i could go on forever with plot holes flaws and outright wrong information from the movie but i won't bore you if you're in the mood to see a good air force movie your choices are rather slim most military movies deal either with the army navy or marines until hollywood can come up with an air force movie on the lines of saving private <UNK> or a few good <UNK> we'll be forced to watch movies like the iron <UNK> series br br
<START> there are not many films which i would describe as perfect but <UNK> definitely fits the bill no other heist film has come close to it before or after the plot is simple but <UNK> you it never <UNK> to <UNK> me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it you care for all the characters even though they are bank robbers because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws it's hard to imagine any other actor besides jean in the role of tony le when the members of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to tony his answer and the expression on his face says it all while the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movie and rightfully so the film actually gets better afterward the director jules <UNK> knew what he was doing when he decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout but instead inserted a great climactic score during tony's final ride towards his destiny to think that if <UNK> an american director had not been <UNK> in hollywood and forced to work in france this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it was it certainly wouldn't have been as good if it was made as an american film during that time it was absolutely horrible what <UNK> had to go through but he did achieve his greatest work because of it to the benefit of all of us i'm just cringing at the thought of the upcoming al pacino remake most heist films since <UNK> have already borrowed from it in some way or another there's no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money leave the classics alone
<START> the student <UNK> is an excellent film that deals with four women <UNK> by friendship and career for the first time one is able to see a realistic portrayal of relationships inside the work place outside the work place the risks of those relationships and the consequences this film also offers a rare chance to see veteran stage and television actress <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> miss <UNK> ms <UNK> is best known for her performance as mrs on the television series little house on the <UNK> the direction music and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by <UNK> b grass iii this film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered around the late 1960s and early 1970s which offers a <UNK> side to life while <UNK> the beauty of the female sex
<START> watching this movie all i could think of was maybe it gets better but after 20 minutes i couldn't watch it any second longer i don't want too <UNK> to many lines about this but really its a complete <UNK> of time all the actors say is c <UNK> this that if you are still going too watch it don't say i didn't warned you maybe if you are an <UNK> or something you might think its a tribute to your <UNK> again film is a term that <UNK> individual motion pictures the field of film as an art form and the motion picture industry films are produced by recording images from the world with cameras or by creating images using animation techniques or special effects
<START> i liked this film very much as i liked before the other movies by cedric all the actors coming from all over europe are very good and funny one can really feel the influence of <UNK> like in many other recent movies but it's ok
<START> in short if you want to watch burt reynolds best films than this one must be included if you don't like burt you may still like this if you love burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time being from <UNK> it does hit home but it's also nice to see a cop action drama that takes place somewhere other than ny city chicago miami or la the film is funny at points with good plot good performances from a great supporting cast every character is real the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out a nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half it has some good old fashion <UNK> <UNK> no cgi thank god real action br br if clint eastwood did his best impression of a burt reynolds movie with every which way but loose any which way you can then burt <UNK> with his best clint type flick with this it comes off great
<START> if you haven't seen the war at home let me tell you what you've been missing it's a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could have only been edgy and funny in the 60's where america has grown in it's acceptance of race sexual <UNK> religion etc this show seems to argue with that progress it's a <UNK> step in america's evolution br br for example one of the ongoing jokes of the show is that the white daughter is dating a black kid from school this is obviously hilarious seeing as how you can't see that type of relationship at any mall in america i've lived in both small towns and big cities so don't give me some type of red state blue state excuse not only is this the joke but the father who is supposedly not racist finds this disturbing and asks his daughter repeatedly to break up with her boyfriend which <UNK> his he may sound like a racist but he's just dumb character br br if this isn't enough a second running joke is that one of the sons and soon to be <UNK> sexual is ambiguous in his sexual <UNK> the audience learns over and over that he isn't gay but the father isn't convinced so he constantly avoids his son afraid perhaps that his son will hit on him as all gay men are <UNK> wild men who can't control their will the father always comes to some acceptance of his son once per show but usually goes on avoiding him in the following episode br br the only way this show can cure itself in my eyes is if the continuous exposure to these unnatural <UNK> in life open up the father's eyes a little but that may be too much to ask and besides with jokes like these i'm sure we'll have hilarity in episodes to come like episode 13 father votes against women voters and episode 14 my muslim neighbor is a terrorist br br please drop this show fox we're living in a different world from the one your <UNK> grew up in
<START> this <UNK> surprise screening at <UNK> turned out to be the horror movie the nun la seriously i think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles even though the story's about the character as described in the title who knows soon we'll have <UNK> like the monk the priest and others <UNK> to various religious <UNK> br br the basic premise goes very simply that a <UNK> dressed up in a nun <UNK> so that it can lay claim to the title goes around killing ex convent girls there seemed to be some sort of conspiracy involved as the daughter of one of the victims eva played by an eye candy <UNK> anita goes on to discover with the help of a few good friends like a rip off of i know what you did last summer mentioned also by the way br br so as the body count <UNK> it's a race against time for our emotionally <UNK> aren't they always heroine to <UNK> the truth and save the day <UNK> into the sins of the mothers the movie did the <UNK> that with a dream sequence as the introduction i hate dream sequences as it's a pretty cheap technique if not done correctly and there are a couple of them in the movie br br in part the movie played at times like <UNK> on gone wrong with the plenty of dark water references and they could have <UNK> this <UNK> water for the circumstances and plot points in the movie however there are plot holes abound so don't be looking into the storyline too deeply you'd come to expect the standard <UNK> twists towards the end about the sadistic nun and sets which look like they can rival recent <UNK> horror movie <UNK> br br the <UNK> pretty forgettable with the cast speaking in perfect heavily <UNK> english and since most of them are pleasing to the eye the story must <UNK> in a love scene in the middle of a witch hunt what gives hello got still got mood ah then again the <UNK> is a pretty cheap animated <UNK> which has a built in <UNK> of popping up every now and then in various fashion just to <UNK> screams from <UNK> audiences the characters also break every <UNK> rule in the do <UNK> in horror <UNK> so you know and expect their just <UNK> br br can you possibly enjoy this movie sure you can just ensure that you're watching it in a full house should be easy since local folks are <UNK> for anything remotely horrific and laugh at those who are so <UNK> they scream at every frightening scene it's pretty fun and adds to the atmosphere besides what's going on the screen surround sound doesn't even come close br br think of it as watching an episode of scooby doo without the <UNK> and it's a pity that the gory moments in the movie had to be <UNK> for a pg rating those could possibly have been the best bits now left rotting on the <UNK> floor board
<START> child death and horror movies will always remain a sensitive controversial combination and therefore it is my personal opinion that every movie that shows the courage to <UNK> on this topic should receive some extra attention from horror fans of course like in the case of wicked little things controversial themes don't always guarantee a good film despite the potentially interesting plot the atmospheric setting and the involvement of video nasty director j s <UNK> the <UNK> this is an uninspired and cliché ridden film that couldn't offer a single fright or shock after losing their husband and father the remaining women mother karen and her daughters sarah and emma move to a small and remote mountain town where they inherited an old <UNK> mansion their new home is dangerously close to the old mine ruins where dozens of innocent children <UNK> lost their lives in <UNK> strange things start to happen like young emma <UNK> an imaginary girl who used to live in their house and the eerie locals seem to keep secrets from karen and her daughters quickly turns out that the undead children still leave their mine graves at night to seek vengeance on the <UNK> of the <UNK> owner mr <UNK> who was responsible for their deaths wicked little things is rather tame and extremely predictable the script shamelessly serves one dreadful cliché after the other like car <UNK> stuck in the mud at crucial times <UNK> and <UNK> broken dolls there's very little suspense even less gore and the make up effects are <UNK> weak the <UNK> children don't look menacing at all actually they all look like <UNK> versions of marilyn <UNK> with their black outfits pale faces and dark eyes the excitement free finale is stupid and just as derivative as the rest of this pointless production <UNK> is thoroughly unimpressive in her leading role as the mother but <UNK> taylor <UNK> currently a big star thanks to the halloween remake and young chloe are adequate as the daughters
<START> shame shame shame on <UNK> <UNK> for what you do br br i was appalled br br do not take kids to see this movie the humor is totally inappropriate for children plus they'll be bored and disappointed certainly we all have read <UNK> wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations but this is pure trash dr seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his thumbs up at such a <UNK> attempt to capitalize on a classic br br what a pity br br spend your money on the book if you own a copy then buy the book and <UNK> it to a toys for <UNK> program this movie is not worth a free ticket viewing br br stick with the book the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal save your money seriously save your money it will be on cable by saint <UNK> day br br shame shame shame on what they do
<START> just do a little research on the making of this film something so simple as a <UNK> search it was <UNK> by the us army and promoted just in time for the <UNK> it is a great idea but i'd much rather see a documentary not something edited by the bush administration and told its reality the timing of the movie's release its tone and the fact that ms l promoted it raised questions about the intent of the movie according to ms l managing director joe <UNK> he and his colleagues also deliver key targeted messages about the war in iraq to specific wrote <UNK> was the left <UNK> art house crowd one of those is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to the u s population nobody involved with the film is willing to say who initially put up the money for the film or how they ended up represented by the <UNK> <UNK> firm
<START> the first users comments are very detailed for a very vague movie not saying that i disagree but this summary can be written in a few sentences to get straight to the point this is pretty much like watching the making of a really bad amateur porno flick there are a few funny points in the movie but with the kind of things that happen in todays youth everyday its actually kind of lame the main actor in the movie is a pompous jackass and both guy and girl in the film are way too modest to be in a film like this do not waste your money on this movie the only reason why i gave it a 4 and not a 1 is that they used at least a somewhat attractive girl in the movie and towards the end you got to see almost full frontal nudity from the girl thats it thats the only thing thats worth watching it for the end
<START> <UNK> prize winning 2004 movie head on <UNK> die <UNK> depicted the <UNK> chaotic world of a self destructive but dynamic turkish german rocker named this documentary is an <UNK> of head on and explores the range of music one might find in <UNK> today if one were as energetic and curious as german avant rock musician alexander of the group who arranged the sound track and performed some of the music for head on and had the assistance of a film crew and turkish <UNK> provided by director akin you get everything from rap to the most traditional turkish classical song with rock <UNK> music and turkish pop in between it's as chaotic and open ended a world as one where east is east and west is west but the meet br br like <UNK> itself which sits on the edge between europe and asia and brings the two worlds together while remaining <UNK> <UNK> this is a that includes turkish pop turkish traditional songs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jazz musicians and group of street lively and offbeat shots of <UNK> street life and some talk on camera about <UNK> and some personal and musical history by singers and musicians working out of the grand hotel de in quarter where stayed at the end of head on while looking for his beloved <UNK> around the city with crew and equipment <UNK> people and recording their music br br he begins with some loud rock by the neo psychedelic band <UNK>  these are musicians he <UNK> with while putting together head score and he stands in here for the absent <UNK> and by turkish including brave female <UNK>  thus causing some <UNK> to walk out of the theater early on and miss the <UNK> <UNK> and easy to listen to sounds that makes up the bulk of the film head narrative <UNK> were <UNK> <UNK> by musical <UNK> performed by a traditional turkish orchestra sitting <UNK> on the other side of the gives us the opportunity to meet and hear performances by some of the best known living turkish singers including a lady in her late eighties whose aging elegant musicians remind one of the way the great egyptian <UNK> used to perform gets <UNK> movie star to do a striking solo on the long <UNK> he's written all his songs on and <UNK> the now <UNK> great to do a special performance of one of her most famous songs memory of <UNK> this is a coup and so is the <UNK> by a beautiful <UNK> recorded in a bath whose <UNK> are spectacular if only they could have turned down the heat  singer and <UNK> faces stream with sweat there is also a young canadian woman <UNK> <UNK> in turkish who sings turkish traditional with expression and <UNK> the sound mix is of high quality throughout one would like to see a sequel many great of turkish popular and classical music have necessarily been left out br br film released summer 2005 and shown at festivals in 2005 and 2006 opened at the film center in new york city in june 9 2006
<START> you expect it to be juvenile but you at least expect a complete and coherent movie what a waste i am extremely disappointed not at just having watched a bad movie but at having such a great concept be <UNK> by a common movie that we've all seen before if this <UNK> makes 1 over its budget the studio would be wise to <UNK> victory round up all available copies store them deep within the nuclear waste <UNK> under <UNK> mountain and then never make another movie like it again most of this movie will keep you thinking this is not what i wanted to see this film appeals to the <UNK> and maybe to teenagers it's a true shame because most movies are made for that <UNK> i had much higher hopes for this film
<START> i do love b horror films i however am generally not a huge fan of so stupid it's funny films i had to rate this so highly simply because death bed the bed that eats is so one of a kind and so original there are plenty of question marks plenty of plot holes and the wtf factor is <UNK> up to 11 but i was really not bored for a second i really couldn't call it creepy at any point every minute i was saying to myself what the hell is this bed film going to do next i watched this with a friend that is in no way a fan of horror or b movies and even she was pretty into it the effects were actually very inventive and the colors and atmosphere were quite good it keeps a very consistent and even tone throughout most of the film albeit an incredibly ludicrous <UNK> and the acting wasn't terrible i can see from the point that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of belief damn near impossible but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that that fact didn't really bother me seriously for me this film hit that realm of one i will not only never forget but i guarantee i will find myself thinking back on certain scenes in the future does anyone else know of any other films in the <UNK> objects that eat people genre totally fantastic
<START> this was the first mickey mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound in the cartoon mickey does not yet wear <UNK> he does not yet speak either all he does is <UNK> and play music the song that he plays is turkey in the straw using several farm animals as musical <UNK> for example he plays the teeth of a cow like a <UNK> and pulls <UNK> <UNK> like an <UNK> keyboard i taped this cartoon off of the disney channel and i think it is wonderful it was based on a silent film starring buster keaton entitled <UNK> bill jr
<START> i would rather have someone cut out my <UNK> with a razor blade than have to watch this movie again i watched it from start to end thinking it couldn't get any worse but it did the writers and producers should be slapped for putting this kind of crap on television the actors are all terrible get out of hollywood you fools and go work at <UNK> sweeping the floors and <UNK> the trash anyone that thinks this movie is even remotely decent should be hung they are an embarrassment to humanity to think we have soldiers putting their lives on the line for anyone that produces this kind of inane garbage makes me embarrassed to say i'm an american
<START> this is a family movie that was broadcast on my local <UNK> station at 1 00 am a couple of nights ago this might be a strange decision on the part of the <UNK> but the real howard is a rather strange film strange in the way it doesn't want to upset its audience come on there's nothing kids like more than <UNK> and that's why <UNK> <UNK> was such a popular author for children it also explains why doctor who was such a successful show across the world in this screenplay you're just dying for pulp fiction author to do something nasty to the kids but this doesn't happen i'm not <UNK> child abuse but to see howard lose his <UNK> at the little ones would have made the movie rather better can you imagine how much worse <UNK> cop would have been if the producers had gone all pc i mean if you're making a movie centered around a children's author who hates children shouldn't the story show and not tell br br much of the problem lies with director jean and you do get the feeling he doesn't know how to handle the material which is bad news for the movie as someone previously noted the soundtrack is <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is very wooden i guess he was trying to play it dead pan just like in that show he's famous for but it fails to work here and there's many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles which seem unintentional but which are very distracting but at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the audiences sensibilities
<START> summer of my german soldier was one of the many tv movies that became a <UNK> of the small screen in the 1970s others were <UNK> song <UNK> and someone's watching me it portrays a jewish girl <UNK> <UNK> a german <UNK> bruce <UNK> in wwii era georgia one of the things that the movie shows is that many of the german soldiers weren't really nazis but were just <UNK> watching the movie i got a real sense of how things must have been in the south back then i mean can you imagine being a jewish person accused of supporting the enemy br br so i certainly recommend this movie i believe that it's always important to show the things portrayed here occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a full scale masterpiece but they usually do quite well i hope that the movie eventually comes out on dvd also starring esther <UNK> and michael <UNK> the my big fat greek wedding <UNK>
<START> i love oddball animation i love a lot of asian films but i didn't love this particular product of japan the are supposedly an american family they're all <UNK> who have moved to japan and they're somewhat a 50's sitcom type family with slightly more modern sensibilities at times the dvd features several very short episodes like less than 5 minutes each and i did not find it to be either funny or entertaining not even in a weird way i'm not sure what the appeal is of this i did pick up on some satire here and there gosh who wouldn't but satire is usually somewhat humorous isn't it and nothing i saw or heard rated even a little <UNK> i picked this up used and it certainly sounded appealing but i guess either i'm missing the point or it's just plain lame the box even says it's hilarious right there on the front but i beg to <UNK> 2 out of 10
<START> this is a poorly written and badly directed short film pure and simple what is interesting and keep me watching to some extent was the production values shot on video it appears with a bad script and bad direction one would think it would also have horrible production value that is what the viewer expects when they watch a film that is terrible and shot on video but not in this case they spent some money and it shows it keep me very mildly interested to see what was coming next just to see br br probably the worst short film i have seen that looked big budget hollywood even though it was shot on some sort of video format br br instead of spending the sum of money they must have spent for some rather impressive set design it would have been <UNK> to see a better executed story with some good direction but then again how can we expect new filmmakers to do this when even hollywood won't
<START> i loved this movie to be very fair the movie starts off very slowly with none of the characters being terribly sympathetic it continues in this way for a good half of the film br br but if you're patient you'll be greatly rewarded what the first half of the movie lacks in character development and or sympathy is adequately <UNK> for in the second half it's a bit like riding a roller coaster a slow <UNK> climb to off with and then speed twists and turns and a few surprises br br as usual meryl streep is wonderful she is the finest actress of our time william hurt is good if a bit wooden in spots <UNK> <UNK> does a very good job showing that her performance in jerry <UNK> wasn't a <UNK>
<START> to be entirely frank the popularity of this show <UNK> me <UNK> is certainly not terrible it has a few good moments the occasional flash of clever humour and unlike so many <UNK> dignity however it is utterly lacking in the essential elements of a worthwhile story from the start its premise <UNK> it to be stereotypical the main plot centers around collecting the pieces of a <UNK> jewel before they can be possessed by evil and is as one would suspect a totally generic epic fantasy affair the story follows a familiar pattern of fighting off various enemies for pieces of the jewel and is thus quite predictable lacking in complexity and easy to lose interest in but as so many <UNK> have shown a poor premise can be rescued by deep realistic characters sadly no one <UNK> the story of <UNK> the main character is the stereotypical anime heroine and far too reminiscent of <UNK> the main character of the original comic author's previous work <UNK> 1 2 she is kind to other females but treats many males especially her love interest with unfair <UNK> <UNK> brutality <UNK> is a tough on the outside but sweet on the inside type and is the <UNK> stock character of the <UNK> br br the flaws continue with what happens to this plot and these characters namely nothing despite constant action the story does not progress despite regular romantic moments neither does the main relationship despite ample time the characters never really change and to add a <UNK> to the <UNK> of mediocrity all this <UNK> is stretched into approximately 150 episodes br br my final criticism of this anime is the animation while certainly not ugly it displays almost <UNK> <UNK> on the part of the creators the animators seem to take joy in long scenes of <UNK> jumping through the air with wind <UNK> in which they have little to do but move a background br br in short with all the beautiful animations of the world at one's keyboard <UNK> <UNK> there is absolutely no reason to watch <UNK>
<START> as i looked at this movie once again i think it belongs among hitchcock's greatest films the first time i saw it i was just blown away by the suspense action and imagery it has the gripping ending the deranged murderer the innocent man framed or <UNK> by circumstances some great on location shots e g the <UNK> <UNK> in washington and penn central in new york it also has great supporting actors with <UNK> daughter patricia in the role of the younger sister to ruth roman and the <UNK> leo g <UNK> in another of his hitchcock movies the merry go round episode near the end is one of the most nerve <UNK> in hitchcock's body of work br br robert walker as bruno anthony his last full film gives a great performance as the deranged stranger on the train who worms himself into the life of the unsuspecting <UNK> star guy haines <UNK> granger granger plays the nice guy who is caught up in a messy divorce the movie opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men as they leave their <UNK> to board the train eventually they meet and the story takes over the stranger takes an unusual interest in the <UNK> star and as the movie continues the stranger becomes a stalker the action shifts from place to place including washington the fictional small town of <UNK> the forest hills <UNK> championship and a passenger train taking the two leading men back and forth on separate missions towards the end the pace of a <UNK> game is woven into the plot as they race against time the camera cuts away to the faces of the <UNK> as they <UNK> and serve in a remarkable series of shots when the closely fought contest is over the climactic chase takes place hitchcock has a love for trains and it is great to see penn station long since gone trains are featured in the <UNK> steps the lady <UNK> shadow of a doubt <UNK> north by <UNK> and this movie br br this classic hitchcock thriller took place at the start of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense the 1950's and i am convinced that one day it will be given its due in the hitchcock hall of fame
<START> disappointing film with walter <UNK> as a hunter who goes to germany to <UNK> hitler when he is discovered he is <UNK> into <UNK> a document stating that he acted on orders from england his <UNK> to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film br br <UNK> is pursued back to england by the evil george sanders and his <UNK> john carradine who speaks little but is again as always the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> br br along the way of being pursued <UNK> meets up with joan bennett the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent br br the story gets <UNK> down somewhat as love develops between the two but again as we approach world war 11 realism becomes the object of the day br br the near ending scene in the cave between sanders and <UNK> is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to br br very interesting that while <UNK> is fleeing nazi germany he meets up again with a young <UNK> <UNK> one of many co stars that same year in the memorable how green was my valley how green was man hunt
<START> spoilers below br br a <UNK> <UNK> was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing in charlie <UNK> other movie from <UNK> shoulder the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor his war comedy <UNK> in surreal exaggerated set pieces in which chaplin demonstrates <UNK> creativity and <UNK> of composition when the <UNK> <UNK> gets <UNK> the water level reaches just the right height so that chaplin can <UNK> his gags most successfully in a later scene the soldier dresses up as a tree a disguise that <UNK> <UNK> much <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> naturally when the enemy discovers his <UNK> the soldier <UNK> straight for the forest the ensuing chase is a visual marvel chaplin not only hides the soldier from the germans but he uses the forest to mask the soldier from the audience as well such that the <UNK> soldier stands in the middle of the frame yet somehow remains invisible all the while we thought our little hero was pulling a fast one on the german army to our delight the joke is on us too br br rating 8
<START> this movie is pathetic not because it's poorly directed acted sung <UNK> filmed etc but because it's really difficult to ruin a movie using an <UNK> soundtrack yet unfortunately this is the only thing the movie succeeds in doing the musical <UNK> in the movie <UNK> was much better than in mama <UNK> the director of mama <UNK> is proof that you don't need talent to be a director all you need are <UNK> songs br br just to give a <UNK> of the awfulness an aging meryl streep is shot with close ups in the harsh <UNK> singing and just ruining the song with all the distracting <UNK> on her face why do that to one of the most talented actresses out there
<START> i watched this movie at the first showing available in my area and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie even if you don't it's a good movie with some interesting character development it is a thoroughly human story about some very <UNK> people in a backwoods southern town and really speaks to the root of the blues if you don't know what the black snake <UNK> is by the time you leave the theater you didn't get it and no it's not just a song christina <UNK> does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role as is samuel l jackson i think this is his best performance since his role in pulp fiction and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in <UNK> the rest of the cast is solid with a few shining performances here and there particularly john jr as <UNK> r l i'm a very <UNK> movie watcher and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its <UNK> look at race sex religion and <UNK> in a rural southern town along with its cinematic genius in my opinion
<START> the planet is an astounding piece of film making for a mere production have turned out one of the most original sci fi films for a long time br br starring the physically <UNK> mike mitchell the film is a mix of great special effects strong storytelling and well planned action from the opening space battle to the <UNK> finale everything about this film appears well above it's budget br br to start with the special effects while certainly not revenge of the <UNK> standard they are on level if not above the likes of <UNK> 5 and <UNK> and for a <UNK> of a price as well the detail and the movement is superb and captures the imagination from the off the design of everything ships weapons <UNK> is second to none the imagination and creativity involved is a real surprise for a film of this budget br br another surprise was the strength of the story and the arc it takes there are a few twists and turn most of which are well written into the script surprising and well played out i was surprised that two years in the making and first imagined 15 years ago how relevant some aspects of the story are to today's society with the happenings around the world there may be a certain <UNK> with the <UNK> the <UNK> are forced to go to in order to survive br br even the sounds effects are spot on as is the atmospheric music the use of light and costume add further to the professional look beach in looks a desolate and lonely place br br in all honesty this film looks 10 if not 100 times the budget spent and that's testament to a creative hard working team of people from the director to the cast to the effects via the producer and sound team wonderful effort i recommend you get your hand on a copy <UNK>
<START> i saw the movie in the theater at its release then watched the vhs tape over the years and while <UNK> through target saw this dvd <UNK> with pushing tin for the <UNK> sum of 5 50 br br there is something about this comedy that has really <UNK> with me how <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> on his thing is an <UNK> commander who <UNK> a rusty <UNK> sub and a crew of <UNK> and <UNK> he's up against the <UNK> best a los angeles class nuclear attack sub and his old captain <UNK> macy br br bruce dern plays the bad guy rip torn the <UNK> running the exercise if you don't laugh hysterically during the run silent segment with the cook well you have a different kind of humor from me br br towards the end the <UNK> says d b f with no explanation it is apparently some inside knowledge gotten from an old <UNK> <UNK> thanks to <UNK> i learned that with the <UNK> of the nuclear <UNK> the old <UNK> would wear <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> forever br br a navy friend said that many of the technical aspects aren't correct but who cares it is one of the funniest movies i've seen br br i don't think it takes a <UNK> to know who will win in this exercise
<START> the is one of the worst spoofs i have ever seen for one main reason it isn't funny i laughed a handful of times the acting is bad the script is worse and why those guys had baby in their hair i will never know and you can tell this didn't have much of a budget to work with and it openly hurts the film they had a good idea going in some parts but it never really came to past and what was the point about the lead being older than his dad 3 out of 10
<START> that someone could have conceived this nonsense and then got it produced is incredible that it actually aired on television and <UNK> actually paid to be associated with it is mind <UNK> this stomach wrenching excuse for kid's programming is almost too vile to comment on i've burned yes burned any barney tapes that people have given my son to find this awful programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise and where tell me where do they get those smarmy kid actors have their parents no sense those kids will be on drugs before they're teenagers <UNK> the final insult is that i have to add this extra line to the review to get it on imdb
<START> from the <UNK> i knew this was going to be a terrific movie the pace the cinematography personalities <UNK> to the dallas area the of characters not to mention the director oliver stone and of course eric the film starts out on a friday <UNK> occult in the first place and begins with a radio station in dallas that is <UNK> their number one talk show the barry show based on the talk radio host alan <UNK> barry eric is the <UNK> radio talk show host and his job is such <UNK> it is <UNK> to <UNK> all of the <UNK> nuances of the radio audience feeding into his show he attempts to <UNK> with a bunch of societal <UNK> turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone <UNK> who have the <UNK> <UNK> to be <UNK> <UNK> barry is effective in <UNK> with this <UNK> <UNK> by socially them rather than simply <UNK> them to mere new <UNK> serve a purpose for the dallas radio audience and paramount concepts take a <UNK> to <UNK> talk about baseball scores <UNK> and people's pets br br the whole thing is a <UNK> of drug induced <UNK> and a for <UNK> paranoia this high profile cannon fodder is something that barry <UNK> on the convoluted pathos the deranged <UNK> from and of pornography and the overall pop culture <UNK> serve as <UNK> <UNK> for barry stilted <UNK> br br the setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology in the the center of dallas there is an overbearing sense of <UNK> awareness <UNK> 20 miles away <UNK> a significant chapter of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the play is based in denver that is where the actual story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of <UNK> <UNK> and cleveland dallas is the city where the film takes place i thought it was an excellent choice this movie illustrates how people have a horrid and <UNK> and deadly of the jewish people in america <UNK> they control the banks their agenda is different than everybody else's and their intellectual literature leads to <UNK> these <UNK> notions compound barry overall dilemma barry personal <UNK> is <UNK> he is <UNK> and non <UNK> to his alcoholism and his <UNK> and politically controversial nature is his ultimate <UNK> this is what makes the film so believable br br the characters in the movie were well portrayed dan the <UNK> made for middle management <UNK> man played by alec baldwin who was constantly <UNK> barry every move laura his girlfriend also his producer will constantly feel barry is someone who is always misunderstood ellen his ex wife is a <UNK> of <UNK> anguish and <UNK> but cannot quite <UNK> her feelings for barry regardless of the path of personal destruction he winds up <UNK> to the dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retro bates who are <UNK> amused by their own real shortcomings in part everybody's hang ups including barry own hang ups are what do barry in his audience <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and ultimately becomes barry pet project for <UNK> <UNK> social culture conflicts become barry downfall br br this movie is superb in my opinion oliver <UNK> best picture including platoon and natural born killers that statement in of itself tells you how magnificent a film talk radio is the story <UNK> and acting and co producing of eric <UNK> is simply compelling the camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all top notch the cinematography of the dallas <UNK> at the end of the movie is terrific dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolis so now just like los angeles and new york there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost <UNK> <UNK> from hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next year dallas <UNK> it's status as a major <UNK> area in the <UNK> manner by which human <UNK> <UNK> the city has it's <UNK> radio <UNK> who have given a <UNK> spin to the marvel of <UNK> air wave communication these are the <UNK> in the movie the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who want to meet the big bad wolf and their <UNK> curiosity has morally <UNK> the last neighborhood in america
<START> i really enjoyed this movie it challenged my emotions and beliefs making it a true piece of artwork in my book the acting was <UNK> i would never watch this movie with anyone i could not cry around i don't think i cry harder to any movies maybe because it makes me look at myself i <UNK> it is a must see
<START> in watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind one wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat <UNK> br br i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition no other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for <UNK> banks to do so but as the series goes on and on i've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a women shouldn't watch this teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject br br many women try out for <UNK> to compete for <UNK> next top model they live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless <UNK> shoots with pointless <UNK> people and and get eliminated and almost all of them claim you will see me again heck i'm trying to see what happened to the ones that did win actually br br this is the dream of some girls and good for them in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like <UNK> the other way like to college br br i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the <UNK> of full figured models joining the group that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks the full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the <UNK> group of models they ever chose so of course that would make them look even <UNK> a <UNK> use all the time bad bad <UNK> and crew br br but to be fair <UNK> next top model is not about full figured models it's about <UNK> an imagined image a beauty that can be mass <UNK> and sold as the ultimate in beauty and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix hence the name of the show hence the sorry lot of judges <UNK> <UNK> hence <UNK> and her consistent this was me <UNK> every camera angle you can get but then again that is the one thing i like about this show the ex model giving others who wouldn't have the chance a chance to enter the doors but after that everything else is status <UNK> for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program
<START> seriously sci fi needs to stop making movies they're all horrible and this one had john rhys davies in it and he couldn't help the movie dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> captures the legendary goat eater of mexico the and brings it aboard a cruise ship <UNK> by captain <UNK> john rhys davies the creature then escapes and starts killing crew and passengers captain <UNK> and the crew then go after the creature guns but they can't stop it so they call in the navy they can't stop it either then the thing kills all 5 or however many of them there are then the captain and his daughter along with some other guy figure out how to kill it stay away from this movie the looks incredibly cheesy the navy men shoot at the slightest movement throw <UNK> on the ship and the acting is horrible 3 10
<START> the british noble sir ronald burton richard greene decides to search his two best friends that have disappeared after visiting count karl von bruno stephen an evil and powerful man who lives in the black castle sir burton travels undercover with another identity since he fought against count von bruno in <UNK> with his two missing friends and the count lost one eye in a battle when he arrives in the castle he is invited to hunt in the black forest around the castle with the count while he looks for <UNK> that the count has killed his friends later he and the <UNK> wife <UNK> <UNK> von bruno rita fall in love for each other and with the support of dr boris karloff sir burton and the <UNK> try to escape from the <UNK> of count von bruno the black castle is an excellent movie from a romantic time with action romance mystery and even horror the story is gripping and is a great entertainment for any audience my vote is nine br br title brazil o <UNK> do the castle of the fear
<START> disappointing heist movie indeed i was actually expecting a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff going on through out the movie and it does have few of those cat and mouse stuff going on but it was just pretty stupid and it basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer as a matter of fact if you seen the trailer to this you basically seen the whole film cause it is just that predictable so basically the plot is about a few <UNK> truck company workers that try to steal the <UNK> million dollars they are suppose to transport until one of the members grows a conscience i thought the movie would be better with it's cast of well known actors but i was wrong i mean this isn't necessarily a bad film but it just wasn't that good either or has any depth this is most definitely a rental at best just not really worth seeing it in theaters heist br br 4 8 10
<START> exquisite in simple words both <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> seem to understand each other quite well or maybe they both are just too good this might just be her best performance as an actor and best as a director yeah maybe better than mr and mrs <UNK> <UNK> plays the role of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays the role of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> elder sister <UNK> <UNK> made the best out of character for she had to play a strong responsible arrogant role of an elder sister who had the full responsibility of her family <UNK> has beautifully crafted character a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life her love for her family br br behavior juvenile at all for you can expect this from most of indian directors for this role looks like a lot of research has been done to understand the role of a <UNK> when at times is a normal sweet college going girl she also scares you when she is shown ill both the sides have been beautifully judged and played believe me it at times reminds you of the girl in exorcist not that scary though overall marvellous piece of work by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> after reading the reviews i am so <UNK> to know that i am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie i am a huge nicholas sparks fan have read all of his books most of them more than once of course i loved the <UNK> and a walk to remember i haven't yet seen message in a bottle or nights in so i can't comment on those br br but i did go see dear john this past weekend and i was terribly upset the movie was not good at all when looking at the movie alone and not thinking about the book at all it was still a terrible movie i did not get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that i have got from other movies i enjoyed especially the <UNK> i was not smiling and laughing and crying and worried and scared ever from the very beginning all i could notice was how they changed everything the only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named john who is in the military and a girl named <UNK> who is not the part about his dad being obsessed with <UNK> is about the only other part that went along with the book everything else was totally off first of all in the book allen was <UNK> little brother not his son why they had to change that i don't understand it made a lot more sense how it went in the book when tim was just a little bit older than <UNK> and they grew up together and allen was inspiration for wanting to work with horses and <UNK> children that didn't happen in the movie ugh and in the book they spent a lot more time together than just those initial 2 weeks and then the 1 night why did they leave those times out i could go on and on and on but then i would run out of space so basically if you are a great fan of nicholas sparks don't waste your time or money on this movie just read the book again because it's terrible and nothing like the book
<START> i really loved this movie i thought it was very well done the character interaction was wonderfully done as was the characterization the actors were definitely believable the plot was very deep and intriguing even though parts of it are a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring it's definitely worth watching several times the chemistry between the three main actors was great if you don't want to watch it for that then at least watch it for the drama between the characters i mean the whole thing was just <UNK> it was like i couldn't look away the whole movie grabbed my attention and kept my interest even through the slow parts i loved this movie and almost everything about it i loved the ending because it was so interesting and if you watch the movie a second time makes perfect sense but i'm not spoiling anything
<START> i think it was way back in 1987 that we had our <UNK> and my friend and i saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing <UNK> we decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great but we were in for a pleasant surprise the movie was made in 1965 but even by today's standards the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times the music was wonderful and <UNK> <UNK> as a city <UNK> looked and acted his best i still remember that <UNK> feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over br br whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time no he is not three timing or <UNK> them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons one is <UNK> one is an actress and the third is a <UNK> <UNK> girl who can also help <UNK> in his career as a poet the question is which one is the for him what makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too when things come to an <UNK> a <UNK> takes him in and in his <UNK> state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision br br this dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black n white movie is the <UNK> of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today if you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact in case you watch this movie without this part and get confused don't worry because you just watched an <UNK> movie
<START> i agree in many parts with the fairly <UNK> review already posted on the subject of the miniseries and agree that it does have its pros not only its cons for example the original film manage to much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage including the discovery of <UNK> <UNK> and the love affair of paul <UNK> and which on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio cutting of which the other reviewer writes this was one of the great <UNK> of the original film and the miniseries to its credit does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the <UNK> nature of the herbert novel br br however this in itself is a double edged sword rather than complete a text to celluloid transfer of the novel the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines absent from the original novel similarly although this is surely a fuller account of the storyline of <UNK> it is also a break from the originals heart and soul main vision that of prophecy where are the internal monologues that <UNK> <UNK> writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues gone so much of the original agony of paul's decision to choose the <UNK> or death the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself and one which <UNK> people who are far from science fiction fans is missing br br without prophecy what is the point of <UNK> it is simply a more educated and learned version of <UNK> or <UNK> how sad that this is all we are provided with lynch's film was flawed yes but a flawed film could lead to a <UNK> by another film maker taking on some of the best points of lynch's film making and <UNK> some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst <UNK> the storyline now this story shall probably never be translated to film again and this i find <UNK>
<START> erika <UNK> is a woman with deep sexual problems at the start of the film we see her arriving home late when her older mother <UNK> erika goes into a frenzy attacking the older woman without pity erika as it turns out is a musical teacher of a certain <UNK> in the <UNK> where she teaches when we next see her she is the model of <UNK> but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels he is wasting his time and hers the same goes for the insecure anna a talented girl who erika hates maybe because she sees in the young woman a promise that she is not willing to promote br br at the end of the day we watch erika as she goes into an amusement area and proceeds to one of the <UNK> where pornographic material is shown erika is <UNK> as she watches the things that are being performed on the screen on another occasion erika comes to a drive in where a movie is in progress her attention goes toward a <UNK> car in which two lovers are performing a sex act the camera <UNK> on erika as she is lost in <UNK> watching what the two lovers are doing until she is surprised by the young man inside the car erika <UNK> horrified she's been discovered br br when a wealthy couple invites erika to perform in a <UNK> in their <UNK> home she meets an eager young man walter who is related to the <UNK> walter is immediately taken with <UNK> playing the young man is a talented <UNK> himself his <UNK> to compliment erika is met with <UNK> on her part walter decides to audition for <UNK> master class and is accepted br br thus begins walter pursuit of erika who is taken <UNK> when she realizes what the young man's motives really are in turn erika begins to <UNK> about walter in ways that only her mind could imagining what she would like him do when and if they get together walter gets turned off by the letter erika has written to him <UNK> sexual acts that are <UNK> to the young man br br the film's ending reminded us of the last sequence of mr <UNK> current <UNK> we are taken to a concert hall where erika is going to perform she is seen stalking the <UNK> looking for the arrival of walter who goes on into the hall without <UNK> her <UNK> expression to the camera reveals a lot more of her state of mind in that last minutes of the film as she <UNK> the <UNK> area after <UNK> a wound on herself the camera <UNK> her and concentrates on the <UNK> <UNK> that seems to stay on the screen for a long time br br la <UNK> is a personal triumph for isabelle <UNK> this magnificent actress does one of her best appearances on the screen guided by the sure hand of michael <UNK> one of the most interesting directors working today ms <UNK> works with economic gestures yet she projects so much of her soul as she burns the screen with her erika br br the supporting cast does wonders under the director's <UNK> annie <UNK> always excellent is perfect as <UNK> mother she seems to be the key of whatever went wrong with her daughter there is a hint of incest that is played with <UNK> in the context of the film benoit is perfectly cast as walter this young actor does a wonderful job in the film as the young man so in love with a woman that is possessed by demons that he'll never be able to chase away or get her to love him in a normal manner br br michael <UNK> films are always disturbing to watch yet they offer so many <UNK> because he <UNK> to go where other men don't the magnificent music heard in the film are mainly by <UNK> and two <UNK> that are <UNK> own favorites the movie is helped tremendously by christian cinematography
<START> this movie sucked <UNK> bad i couldn't even watch the ending <UNK> voice was too low and i couldn't understand what he said as well as some of lines also where did he get all these wedding dresses from it was very <UNK> the movie failed to elaborate on <UNK> drowning and how it made people <UNK> dr <UNK> and his practice overall i was disappointed that i was unable to give this movie a rating of zero because by <UNK> this movie as a one i felt i was giving it <UNK> praise
<START> okay to enjoy this silent comedy short you must suspend disbelief concerning the major starting point for the film if you can't then you'll probably be more likely to score this film a lot lower charlie chase has a huge <UNK> and his wife has a nose large enough to have its own area code unknown to each other they have both been saving to have surgery to correct these <UNK> apparently plastic and dental surgery was better back in the 1920s because neither seemed to have any need to <UNK> from these major <UNK> and they looked just dandy right away okay remember i said to ignore this right okay well you also have to then ignore the difficult to believe idea that both could then meet and have no idea the other is their <UNK> okay now that you allowed yourself to accept these two silly premises the film gets really really good br br charlie makes a pass at her and she makes a pass at him both are shocked and thrilled because no one has ever really considered them attractive so because of this new vanity they agree to go on a date but they both sneak back home not wanting their <UNK> to know anyway they meet later and are quite attracted to each other but what about the poor <UNK> supposedly at home well they both learn that the other is married and both <UNK> their <UNK> will result in divorce because they really want to be with each other late in the film charlie figures out that the woman really is his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband by changing his clothes and putting in false teeth when he plays the <UNK> it really is a laugh riot to see him <UNK> in and out of the room as he appears to be fighting with another person you really have to see it to believe it however the wife sees an ad with charlie's before and after photos and knows what's happening in the end they both feel pretty foolish
<START> follows a documentary filmmaker <UNK> as he slowly <UNK> something mysterious and evil that's leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake after <UNK> a woman who claims to hear loud <UNK> cries coming from the house next door where there is no baby <UNK> heads over to talk to the neighbor he's <UNK> with <UNK> by the unhinged <UNK> woman maria who answers the door and promptly <UNK> it in his face and gets a <UNK> at her 6 year old son through a window strangely both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit leaving behind a pile of dead <UNK> on their back <UNK> and the woman who first complained about the noises as well as her daughter are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that this interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what's going on he soon <UNK> that those with psychic abilities and extra <UNK> perception seem to be <UNK> into something sinister <UNK> and possibly even apocalyptic well known 10 year old <UNK> and tv celebrity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seems to think we may all be doomed but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help another female psychic actress <UNK> becomes involved as does mr a mentally unstable <UNK> psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of <UNK> foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to worms clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that's now covered by a lake and the legend of an ancient demon known as br br unlike many other hand held horror flicks this one depends just as much on the plot as it does <UNK> first person scares thankfully there's something of a storyline here a very interesting and intricate one at that so it doesn't rely on glimpses of horrific things through <UNK> camera work every once in awhile to keep your interest the way travels around following leads in search of the truth with well placed <UNK> along the way reminded me somewhat of the omen in its pacing the film also doesn't entirely consist of footage shot by the <UNK> but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we're watching is an already completed documentary that helps to break up some of the <UNK> usually associated with films shot in this particular style the performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the footage either overall it's a well made horror film with lots of plot shifts some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments that's well worth checking out my only real <UNK> is that it could have used a little <UNK> here and there and seems to go on a bit too long otherwise pretty good stuff
<START> brilliant actors and brilliant picture i love the <UNK> scene with the music in the beginning it is just so touching and at the same time real but at the same time <UNK> the vietnam war was far from human and i believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances modern war movies are spending so much money on effects this is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination a movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in and fate how insane the world is and the power of will and friendship love and passion a must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this
<START> for me it just didn't seem like <UNK> joe at all when i watched it as a kid i just didn't care for it in fact the part i liked best about this one was the opening credits they change so many facts around and turn the story around as well <UNK> commander is supposedly part of this stupid race of <UNK> people in <UNK> or somewhere that is frozen though i always thought he was a normal guy considering every time you saw his eyes in the series they were surrounded by normal colored flesh and not the blue his face was here there is just too much crap in this one to try and make this a spectacular movie but for me it just ruins what i watched the series for in the first place
<START> there are few films that deal with things that i would consider myself an expert on this one is br br after some years of fantasy role playing we split me not leaving without a sense of shame of what i had become a <UNK> br br you see these things are really <UNK> it happens to everybody br br first you create a character fairly and it dies after the first attack br br then you help a little with the <UNK> and while you're at it why not help with strength intelligence <UNK> charisma and <UNK> too this in turn <UNK> the game master who doesn't know how to deal with this <UNK> gang and after a while it <UNK> the players too so they start to create ever more exotic race profession <UNK> no matter how ludicrous it is br br i created a warrior monk yeah not that far from the film br br and that's not all to be said about the <UNK> of the inherent dynamic of this <UNK> game think the hunt for experience points but just watch the film it shows it all and of course the stupidity of its most basic br br for this end in turn there is no better profession than the <UNK> i don't exactly understand why the <UNK> became a character in the first place after all the <UNK> is none but once it became one it had to be <UNK> into the game flow that is it had to be made lethal at least <UNK> the <UNK> of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully so br br sure it's not exactly a professional production but i haven't seen a better satire in ages
<START> this film is just really great i don't know why i <UNK> have a weakness for <UNK> it's not scarface but still i really enjoyed my self this is a film i can see more than ten times he really <UNK> to make a good movie but he just can't do it i feel pity for him so maybe it's a bit of a sympathy vote i can't help it but i just can't give it less than 9 stars everyone should have seen this once in his life to see how to make a cheap film work i live in holland and bought this film for only one euro that's 1 50 dollar i would have also bought it for ten euro great great great on a little dutch film site this film gets a 101 votes here only a <UNK> that's not so much more so people all over the world buy this movie
<START> having first read the novel i don't mind for the purposes of filming how differently it is scripted as long as it <UNK> to or at least includes the plot for reasons known only to hollywood important parts of the story are completely ignored and a different story line added the reason this novel passed the test of time is no doubt due to the <UNK> of both the characters and plot as a whole to <UNK> with this structure is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line and therefore the <UNK> of the story <UNK> although a matter of opinion the casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired characters described as very fat should at least be made to look <UNK> to allow for the character to have credibility the days of slavery can't be over or surely actors of this <UNK> would have been in revolt at such a travesty of the story the face of <UNK> is described as being <UNK> in appearance tara <UNK> very feminine appearance doesn't ring true again laura fairly is described as being if not so with dark hair she does not quite fit the impression <UNK> from the novel badly done hollywood br br j hunter
<START> this movie is funny funny funny my favorite quote from the movie i think i saw a half naked indian in my room last night response that was no <UNK> it was a indian in your room and another is what the hell are you talking about just what the hell are you talking about but if i ever be admitted to an hospital like this one i will be prepared to write my will on the spot i would say there were in my opinion three very funny characters in this film most funny but three is the funniest to me even though their lines were few and don't get me started on the crack pot patient <UNK> that one i will keep secret and fast paced too
<START> contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an against the system type of movie and attitude it is an excellent portrayal of the system in question and how ridiculous it truly is the funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life and that is to learn what you enjoy that is what college should be about br br i come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines i think i have given my opinion on the matter so i now write a couple more lines just as filler i hope you have been entertained during this time i encourage you to go see the movie it is well worth your while so long as you follow it and <UNK> yourself in the movie
<START> when all we have anymore is pretty much reality tv shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or can't sing or cook worth a damn than i know hollywood has run out of original ideas i can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on tv in the last 15 years what is our obsession with watching <UNK> make fools of themselves i would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before ok so people in this one need to lose weight most americans need to lose weight i just think we all to some degree enjoy watching people <UNK> maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else looking like a jerk i don't know but i just wish something intelligent would come out that did not insult your intelligence
<START> i know everyone said this movie was utter crap and i agree with them i spent a few years after seeing it telling other people it was crap i recommended they not see it but when it came on tv we saw the ad i turned to family and said i know this is sad but i'm thinking of watching it my sister turned to me and said yeah me too and you know what it was funny br br by no means is this a good movie it's absolutely a waste of time but it's a good waste of time you may still think it's crap and fair enough but i thought it was a really funny slapstick comedy i didn't like a couple of bits like when the fish got hit by the car but apart from that i thought it was good i loved sitting there and picking out all the famous australian faces <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc br br so if you like to waste your time watch this movie otherwise see a drama or something
<START> i love this disney movie its a real cute movie and when it comes on again i will have to make a mental note to tape it i really like how they break into the bank trying to find parents information you should really see this movie its great for the whole family
<START> i knew i was in for a long 90 minutes when the opening voice over <UNK> the word <UNK> it sounded like scare crew and sure enough 90 minutes later after witnessing beyond horrid acting tedious drama <UNK> punches going nowhere near their intended target but hitting it anyway ken <UNK> acting and the most stupid illogical ending i've seen in my life ok no i take that last one back in about a week after making it through all that i openly <UNK> that i couldn't just go to <UNK> a la jim carrey and just <UNK> it completely from my mind any thoughts i might have had that director brian might have made an ok film given the right circumstances that i had after watching slaughter studios are totally and completely gone from my mind now br br my grade f br br eye candy tara <UNK> and lisa robert get topless br br where i saw it <UNK> on demand available until september <UNK> 2005
<START> coach preachy or straight sappy it's bad writing combined w even worse acting you can choose to drink the of this after school special but i didn't not even on it's 20th toby robbins <UNK> philosophy <UNK> moment it's too much <UNK> to be entertaining and not <UNK> enough to be informative i have respect for the coach and the program this movie is inspired by but the move itself is awful as someone who has played <UNK> for nearly 20 years in the states i had hoped for a better <UNK> movie even one that has something loosely to do with <UNK> and i can tell you that the performed by a bunch of and <UNK> is not <UNK> much like when it's performed today by the all blacks seriously boys everyone has seen it it's time to put it away if you want real <UNK> line up across from a bunch of south <UNK> the real eye <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> this is a fake and badly done movie about being a genuine and good person
<START> if you ever plan on renting hopefully not buying this movie think again it was as if gary busey had a gun to his head and was forced to act or die i only wonder if busey was arrested for something and was sentenced to play in this movie because i just don't see the guy that acted so much better with keanu reeves in point break play in this disaster it was a feel good movie but there are thousands of other feel good movies that make you laugh without wanting you to get your money back br br the only reason i would ever tell someone to rent this movie is to watch this movie is to see gary busey jump up and down like a monkey if you want a good funny movie pass up <UNK> and go rent <UNK> or something
<START> gary busey did a splendid job playing the rock n roll legend buddy holly 1936 <UNK> he does have a spitting image to the man being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's having a group of three is usually simple back in those days i bet that buddy holly busey was a much better musician than most of what i heard since he lived in texas it was only a quiet country town back then his parents were christians though his mother was a strong <UNK> of her son's work that's one of the reasons he didn't act like elvis he stuck to his <UNK> ways that really makes him good when he went to <UNK> he saw how bad the producers were they hated rock n roll that turned holly off big time getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge to holly and his friends he got to tour with sam <UNK> went to the famous apollo which the all <UNK> american audience quickly accepted them i liked that and sam <UNK> made sure holly and his band got some service that's what i call tolerance it's sad that he ritchie and j p the big <UNK> richardson had their music careers cut short by a plane crash in 1959 at least their memories will live on in our hearts i don't what inaccuracies were in the movie all i care is that buddy holly <UNK> the obstacles of music and politics in that time and the music is nearly perfect for gary busey he was perfect in the role and making the music as well god bless you gary busey 5 stars
<START> plot synopsis los angeles in the future crime is kept under control by core <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by the united states <UNK> <UNK> system to <UNK> the guilty secret service agent eric phillips <UNK> an attack on his boss senator robert <UNK> the man who set up the by the union for human rights a group of anti machine <UNK> <UNK> attempts to <UNK> phillips into his private circle but the ss agent goes on the run after witnessing <UNK> murder a agent in cold blood <UNK> sends core <UNK> after him phillips joins the group helps them <UNK> a conspiracy involving <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> is the first of a number of sci fi action <UNK> directed by richard <UNK> co <UNK> of <UNK> entertainment a <UNK> of action films during the 1990s other <UNK> films include <UNK> man t force the <UNK> dark breed <UNK> films typically start with a major action sequence which lasts about 10 minutes before allowing the plot to kick in the script for this film has a few plot holes  it is never clear what the conspiracy the heroes are trying to stop actually is as for the acting don the dragon wilson may be tough but cannot act for <UNK> with little charisma his co stars are a lot better the film's best bet are the action scenes which throw up some impressive <UNK> fire a huge <UNK> not one but three moments where a vehicle flies through the air <UNK> hits the ground exploding the visual effects border on the cheap side the musical score is low key shrill
<START> i watched sleeper cell with a bit of <UNK> worrying over whether the terrorists would be <UNK> this mesmerizing series not only handled the subject matter <UNK> it created depth and substance to almost every character just <UNK> up the screen in every scene he's even though his character is the charismatic leader of a <UNK> terrorist cell he still has hypnotic appeal michael held his own well though in some scenes i wondered why he wasn't shot on the spot because of the <UNK> he wore on his face br br the pros of the series are the two leads and the well written characters all of which were believable and tragic and the <UNK> issues addressed in the story having been married to a muslim myself the atmosphere created was quite realistic the cons for me personally were that the female t a was seemed gratuitous as well as some of the sex scenes despite that it is a raw gripping series that will make you think somebody give more <UNK> roles like this one and let him run with it he's got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of <UNK> power <UNK> off him
<START> the magnificent greta garbo is in top form in this her first <UNK> she gets fine support from the rest of the cast which includes charles <UNK> the rugged sailor who captures her heart ms garbo gives a great performance as she usually does as the estranged daughter of a sea captain who returns after fifteen years also in the cast is that great actress marie <UNK> a great movie
<START> i think this movie can be called the movie of <UNK> rage br br the characters of joe and bob were <UNK> of the wwii generation who didn't quite understand their kids <UNK> the war taking drugs and listening to rock and roll but i think their real rage was at the fact that america was beginning her long decline from the heights the war left her at br br joe himself is a low rent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at all the things that have made him angry living his life of quiet desperation until he teams up with <UNK> a guy who wants to avenge himself on the hippies who ruined his daughter br br honestly most of the movie looks silly the characters are worse than one dimensional they're laughable peter boyle was capable of better stuff
<START> the only footage of <UNK> i've seen prior to this dvd is 'the song remains the <UNK> movie from 1976 we used to spend hours round a friends house watching this but i never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences br br so what of this dvd i didn't know it existed until <UNK> for the physical <UNK> cd <UNK> did this come out ' i thought br br for some reason i thought that page wasn't a great live <UNK> but to say that watching this dvd has changed my opinion is a massive understatement br br there's <UNK> from 1970 10 minutes of guitar <UNK> br br there's an <UNK> set from 1975 y <UNK> has a brilliant finger picking <UNK> section br br the <UNK> my time of <UNK> and performances also from <UNK> are breathtaking with page and bonham <UNK> things to pieces like no one else ever has demonic <UNK> of br br the magic continues into the 1979 section the rendition of last considering their various drug <UNK> states just <UNK> belief a song of complex guitar <UNK> page arranged it in a way that lets him just it <UNK> live the effect is totally <UNK> <UNK> the i never liked this on disc but it along here <UNK> <UNK> great piece of sleaze rock the footage from is very interesting cutting between big screen various and <UNK> footage to great effect br br plant is amazing throughout all the performances page despite being painfully thin looks like a six year old kid having the most fun of his life at the concert and makes <UNK> viewing br br one thing that puzzled me the <UNK> <UNK> performance from 1973 sounds very <UNK> robert plant always did love a little and those <UNK> are absolutely ridiculous and would warrant an arrest nowadays all very different from the muscle bound kick a studio version br br i love this dvd it has reminded me how good <UNK> were and remain
<START> i'm not gonna lie to say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really and if you've seen cult director richard kelly's previous films <UNK> <UNK> and tales you know that's gotta mean something when i went to see this movie there were about 50 people in the theater before an hour into the film about half of the audience had already walked out by the end there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see i for one could only comprehend roughly 40 of what i saw on screen and even then it can only be called interpretation so why did i give this movie a generous seven stars because for one we get some spectacular performances <UNK> great and <UNK> returns as a familiar creepy character and most importantly two because it's entirely original and richard kelly undoubtedly one of the <UNK> directors alive uses his creative vision to tell a story that <UNK> to be different quite frankly it's the only way only through kelly's unique style could this story be told the way it's intended br br in the end if you're not willing to spend some serious thought into an intelligent movie and even then it may all amount to nothing stay far away from this one but if you want to watch a deep rich complex and thought provoking piece on <UNK> <UNK> and the predictability of human nature go see this be prepared for lengthy discussions with your partner however br br note if by chance you've read this review taken my recommendation have actually seen the movie and still believe you've wasted 2 hours of your life i'd be happy to share my views on the whole meaning and plot of the film see that's why i liked it so much it <UNK> discussion as hard as it is though i'll try <UNK> it up by <UNK> a rather depressing quote by <UNK> character who explains the significance of the simple box to an employee your house is a box which you live in the car that you drove to work is a box on <UNK> when you return home from work you sit in front of a box with moving images you watch until the mind and soul <UNK> and the box that is your body <UNK> when finally you are placed into the ultimate box to rest under the <UNK> and earth
<START> let me get started with a terrible storyline and an awful control system good animation but not too good graphics that is why i'm giving this game 4 of 10 this game really needs an improvement if you ask me i would remake it and make this control system better so jaws is not so damn hard to control if i made it to improve it i would make those graphics look better than on the movie it will drive anyone crazy when you are getting killed so freaking easy i played this and got killed by a diver when he had one of those flick knives in 2 hits the <UNK> will kill you so much that the shark will be begging to go to the bottom of hell this game sucks some fat ass sorry about all the <UNK> i think i'm done now it just that this game sucks so bad that it should be taken off the <UNK> shelf i dare you to play the garbage and you will probably get so mad by <UNK> so easy so don't play it
<START> aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot this movie wasn't too bad unfortunately that doesn't leave much movie not to suck do not waste your time on this film even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia as i did watch an <UNK> instead
<START> as an earlier reviewer said travolta stole every scene he was in recognize the character it was <UNK> all grown up and still a bit sleazy but still likable oh yes br br disappointing were william hurt and bob <UNK> perhaps because their characters were badly written or they just didn't care i kept seeing one of the <UNK> never can remember which in the hurt role so <UNK> incredible talents weren't wasted br br <UNK> mcdowell is a <UNK> but not very believable partly the writing character development just wasn't a big thing in this film just watch it for travolta sit back and enjoy
<START> i think <UNK> starts out to do a gay gone with the wind if so sorry tag it didn't happen it also didn't happen as a gay <UNK> flick i guess i'm confused what are we trying to do here much as i'd like to i simply can't get to where i care even a little about these characters this movie is effective in capturing a taste of the <UNK> that lives in the south it does nothing to explain <UNK> or advance my understanding of a gay relationship or the conflict the protagonist seems to be <UNK> with
<START> being a high school student i have to take a health class this year the topic is drugs we learn about the harm they can cause a person from what we talk about i still believe and know that drugs can really mess a person up anyway my teacher wanted us to watch this naturally we <UNK> and start to sleep but like the rest of my class i actually did enjoy this movie it was totally real and not sugar <UNK> at all the characters were amazing and believable even the plot was <UNK> realistic and believable what i liked about this movie mainly was how it got the point of the drugs can take on an <UNK> and the consequences the person has to deal with everyone <UNK> themselves that nothing bad will happen to them well lets get serious anything can happen in a small town even to your best friend like sam and chris this movie shows it a person can really learn a lot from watching this it was pretty effective
<START> i have seen 'the sea today and i loved it the actors of the movie are wonderful specially <UNK> <UNK> of course but i thought that <UNK> would have a better role lola clara and specially mabel <UNK> perform excellent interpretations and i cannot forget and joan brother and father of the protagonist br br there are two technical aspects i loved very much photography and the score by <UNK> himself i liked the song <UNK> by <UNK> with music of carlos <UNK> br br in short i think that the spanish academy should choose 'the sea in order to compete in the oscar awards i liked other spanish productions such as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but film is much better than them 'the sea deserves all the awards
<START> women will like this movie better than men of course women like all romantic comedies more than men on average i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit however i considered this a 5 5 for the first 50 of the movie and about a 6 5 for the next 40 and about a 9 for the last 10 so <UNK> i will rate it a 7 i tape and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and none that are a 6 or worse at least that's my objective i have over <UNK> movies so why keep the dogs br br my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me though i'm not sure why i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she is br br the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school undercover to write a story about the high school experience nowadays she was a <UNK> in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around her journey toward as well as her falling in love with a teacher is the story br br what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how <UNK> she looked i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog so much so that i truly don't think i want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning <UNK> naturally she transformed into a rather attractive cute woman by the end and she became very popular br br the ending is about a 9 9 on the very sweet scale so you out there will like that otherwise it isn't very memorable and easily <UNK>
<START> i loved all dogs go to heaven so much that i went to see the sequel in the theater and i can't remember being more disappointed by a movie the story <UNK> worse than an over aged sack of <UNK> i mean come on how could carface possibly imagine being able to get revenge on an animal so much bigger than him no matter how angry he was plus depicting satan as a cat how cliché can you get so much for the story is it any wonder that don <UNK> burt reynolds <UNK> moore and <UNK> <UNK> wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole the animation was absolutely wretched the colors were all washed out and i can't count how many times i was able to see through objects that were supposed to be solid it had to be the worst animation i've ever seen i usually like animated movies but not this bomb
<START> this is my favorite mel brooks movie because it was the first one i ever saw i was in the fourth grade when it came out and i watched it all the time i saw the producers second and then blazing <UNK> this is a sentimental favorite because it was my first mel brooks movie
<START> i tried i really really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two it's not that i don't get it i'm a big fan of asian cinema the truth is the movie is <UNK> in construction long <UNK> and painfully disjointed br br i suppose that if you are of alfred hitchcock's school of thought don't tell them show them then you could try to appreciate this movie but you would still be hard pressed br br first of all the tries stream of consciousness in the style of jean luc godard and fails in this edward <UNK> seems to understand the <UNK> of the technique but he's very <UNK> at it perhaps he gets better with age i don't know as i haven't yet attempted other <UNK> films the point is he uses a <UNK> of show don't tell that really only serves to <UNK> the <UNK> of the story sure he gets in some visually <UNK> images but they don't draw the story together and they don't help to make it any better br br additionally the major concept behind stream of consciousness and show don't tell is that with the right images the right drama <UNK> and tight <UNK> the viewer will be able to make his or her own not to say that these will be the correct but those can be as the story progresses and every director should <UNK> for some of this type of audience interaction in this edward <UNK> sorely disappoints the viewer is constantly on the <UNK> there is no reason to be drawn in no reason to consider the characters or their motives no reason to get emotionally involved and really no reason to stay alert br br finally <UNK> gets lost in the story that he wants to tell not the story that the movie itself is telling his art moves in one direction but like a large dog he can't control he's constantly <UNK> the lead trying to get it back onto the course he wants not the one that it is naturally following the most <UNK> example of this is the ending the ending really should have occurred at the moment of the husband's revelation the ending of the book that the movie is focusing on and by <UNK> a possible ending for the movie has already been told to us if <UNK> had chosen to end at that point he would have had a much more powerful piece leaving the watcher in suspense does the story play out as the book says or does real world play out differently asking the viewer to think about this is the sort of viewer interaction that <UNK> painfully needs instead he continues to tell the story he wants to tell <UNK> the natural conclusion for the sake of what for the sheer sake of lingering on a main character we <UNK> need to know more about her <UNK> and <UNK> wouldn't feel the need to tell us if he hadn't made her into a <UNK> instead of bothering to make her a more engaging and deep character to begin with br br why else does <UNK> <UNK> and torture his movie to get in some more of those visually <UNK> images the movie truly suffers for it it wants to end it has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer <UNK> but instead <UNK> pushes on instead <UNK> <UNK> a complex ending that leads the viewer on causing him or her to constantly ask so what the first ending the one that <UNK> ignored that was good the second ending well my thought was so what who cares because it's not as if it is introducing something that hasn't been put forth in the storyline already but the last ending that really was a waste of time not only did the real ending leave me <UNK> but i also felt it was an <UNK> to what the story could have been <UNK> sacrificed a potentially good story for the <UNK> melancholy noir <UNK> conclusion that he had insisted upon all along br br my last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself but rather its post production the <UNK> if you see it <UNK> is horrible long sentences stay up for a second or two while short ones stay up far too long also as <UNK> quickly changes images the subtitles are removed from the screen this is one of those rare instances that subtitles should be able to stay on the screen even as the image has changed because there's not much dialog going on anyway
<START> have just seen the last episode no <UNK> though the site says only 30 episodes were made and i must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime cop stories supposedly all <UNK> were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences <UNK> on the <UNK> of the crimes this has at times been a gritty well acted believable and dare i say entertaining series the fact that the powers in <UNK> decided to <UNK> the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least never failed to get their man it's a definite 10 10 for me
<START> <UNK> documentary about how a small group of idealistic young men have used music art and dance to <UNK> and <UNK> the community of one of the most violent <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> means neighborhood in portuguese offering to its young people a positive alternative to the lethal gangster world of drug <UNK> br br in their feature film making debut <UNK> and have crafted a movie that is breathtaking because it works on so many different levels as social document it gives the facts we need to know to have a context for understanding the significance of the particular story told here the story itself is well developed with a strong narrative arc and for added measure it is shot through with keen suspense there's an <UNK> charismatic central protagonist anderson <UNK> he's a <UNK> natural leader <UNK> courageous <UNK> evolved a talented performer a <UNK> who walks his talk br br there's also plenty of music and dancing to entertain there are talking heads  mainly <UNK> and his closest associate jose junior but they are presented with imaginative cinematic brilliance the editing nicely mixes footage of <UNK> themes <UNK> only occasionally by a few fact filled still <UNK> the pace is as lively as the music a lot gets accomplished in <UNK> minutes br br <UNK> <UNK> the neighborhood social club that anderson junior and a few others formed in 1993 <UNK> music and dance as the weapons to go up against the drug <UNK> and the <UNK> police they teach <UNK> skills to any kid who wants to join a class along with dance martial arts a community newspaper the only <UNK> for kids to belong is no smoking no drinking no drugs there is a subtle soft sell spiritual fabric running through the movement loosely based on the <UNK> god <UNK> the <UNK> of old <UNK> br br jeff <UNK> who also was the lead cinematographer and the editor is a modern culture and media student at brown university he his chops editing feature documentaries for <UNK> and others and he teaches film at the new york film academy and elsewhere matt like andrew capturing the <UNK> did a few years ago recently came to film from the business world br br <UNK> and together won the award for best new filmmakers at the 2005 film festival and rising was tied for the best film of the year in awards made for 2005 by the international documentary association i could go on for pages about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and this movie a way better idea is simply for you to go see it my grade a 10 10
<START> a very credible and unsettling movie portraying the effects of war on the general public shame gives us a chilling understanding oh <UNK> <UNK> beliefs the absence of color and sound as in a soundtrack helps to give the film a more realistic feeling there is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality at times the storyline was confusing but perhaps in order to give a sense of the characters' frame of mind  how they too do now know what is happening or why the simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring but i could understand how the director is trying not to <UNK> the story and points he depicted the harsh and unsettling events and effects of war in the beginning the characters were introduced and shown as content with the lighter settings and very long drawn out shots when all of a sudden the war struck upon them they were much darker and quiet with less intimate shots bergman did a good job on allowing us to be consumed by the war ourselves and presenting an image of it the so adequately <UNK> to war although the storyline itself was not too impressive the content of the film was
<START> i love the <UNK> format that chris guest and crew have developed over the years i actually like this and waiting for <UNK> better than spinal tap which was the first of the group and made by rob <UNK> but starred guest and several other of his <UNK> <UNK> this humor is not for everyone it's rather subtle and not too physical so some people may not relate however as a dog lover and a dog show fan i loved this movie there are so many funny lines in it my daughter and i quote them to each other often i find it amazing that these people can ad <UNK> so much funny material for each movie what a fun bunch they must be i highly recommend this to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side
<START> <UNK> again from the darkness director <UNK> <UNK> creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one man's struggle to control his destiny the great <UNK> <UNK> is fascinating to watch in his role as <UNK> his eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind the dream and fantasy sequences are not <UNK> so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants rather than force us to answer the <UNK> question the real question <UNK> is what is love at every turn we see people in love looking for love or dying to be loved the script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room the supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with <UNK> decision this is a gem and deserves to be seen
<START> this film is titled junior pilot here on imdb but final approach at netflix go figure the movie is a delight for both the target youth audience and for adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their own youth for the adult the story is quite predictable and perhaps trite and melodramatic whereas the tale may seem new and creative to youngsters who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a story line br br in any case credit must be given to the film's creators particularly the director james and the cinematographer denis <UNK> for making this most entertaining and visually interesting film the cut <UNK> to the young protagonist <UNK> fantasy thoughts are hilarious as well as delightfully filmed br br the young actors give uniformly believable performances seemingly quite invested in their roles silly as many scenes are jordan <UNK> plays the protagonist ricky with quite well having excellent camera presence jeffrey creates a delightfully soft and sensitive <UNK> who of all ridiculous things <UNK> on hot <UNK> <UNK> and adam give solid performances as well br br as is typical of his always fine acting larry miller creates a solid <UNK> figure around which the children's part real part fantasy world revolves compared to his father figure the other major adult roles appear to be shallow and one dimensional intentionally and quite <UNK> so to be sure br br this movie is a simplistic youth targeted story of course yet it is quite entertaining perhaps repeatedly so to the targeted youth crowd but also for at least one viewing by adults who retain the ability to view such a film from their once youthful perspective
<START> <UNK> in jews are separated from the good christians a young but poor <UNK> loves the fair who is a wealthy <UNK> so he approaches his friend a <UNK> called antonio for three thousand to travel to <UNK> and <UNK> all of <UNK> ships and <UNK> are busy at sea so he turns to the <UNK> the one of jewish faith <UNK> does not like antonio for he <UNK> on his face he offers antonio a three month <UNK> at no interest but if he will not pay the money in that time he will own a pound of his flesh also daughter jessica <UNK> with the christian <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> is based on william shakespeare's play that's believed to have written between and i read the play last summer and now i've seen the movie made in 2004 by michael <UNK> i liked the play and i don't quite agree with the <UNK> of it being anti <UNK> the jewish character does not appear as an <UNK> monster even though he's ready to cut a piece of <UNK> flesh there's a lot of depth in his character which all comes out in his speech where he asks if you <UNK> us do we not bleed and so forth there is much more human in character than in one of <UNK> who <UNK> on the good jew al pacino is <UNK> as <UNK> he gives such a strong performance jeremy <UNK> is also terrific as antonio <UNK> collins is most beautiful and brilliant in the role of robinson does great job as jessica and charlie cox as <UNK> is also very good kris marshall plays and he does a good job in the role of we see heather <UNK> <UNK> crook plays as in shakespeare plays usually also this one contains most brilliant dialogue the movie paints a fantastic portray of the era it deals with some great issues in a <UNK> way
<START> surprising witty funny and totally engaging the film grabs a little known reality that of the student that goes studying in an <UNK> program the beginning is great as the story kicks off of course it has a few <UNK> on the <UNK> and the story <UNK> sometimes away from the main character but the viewer won't bother the movie is young fresh and light hearted even though i don't agree with the notion that when you do <UNK> and you come back you no longer make part of that universe but that's just me the movie is deep and at the same time very light cool and <UNK>
<START> i am a fan of ed <UNK> work and i really had high expectations about this film having so good actors as harris and von <UNK> is always a big advantage for a director but if the script is bad what can you do i really think that <UNK> things is the worst movie of <UNK> filmography and that getting involved with it was a huge mistake anyway i've seen much worse movies in my life but <UNK> things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent the story as an overall seems too unbelievable and fake i don't know if that is because of the book 'cause i haven't read it but if the script was so bad i can't see the reason for filming it maybe it was the commercial success of king's books or the need for low quality movies for the vhs era of the 90's whatever the reason was though this movie was a very bad choice for anyone involved
<START> why was this movie made are producers so easily fooled by <UNK> that they'll give them money to create torture methods such as this so called film i love a bad movie as much as the next <UNK> but cave <UNK> is pushing it it's seriously physically painful to watch the plot is something about a dude name <UNK> a <UNK> up whom i will refer to as private <UNK> for the rest of this review who has to fight invisible warriors and rescue a princess in order to beat the bad guy who needs to find a better hair <UNK> i might have gotten the plot wrong since it's been a while since i watched this <UNK> but really do you care that much oh yeah private <UNK> also has a mute asian sidekick who hasn't who's not funny br br anyway private <UNK> fights invisible people visits some <UNK> all in the name of a good king so personality free he makes al gore look like jim carrey then private <UNK> builds a hang <UNK> yes i'm serious and gets the girl <UNK> <UNK> it's cheap unintentionally silly and mind numbingly dull why am i not surprised that the director ended up making porn br br bottom line avoid <UNK> will steal a part of your life and you will have no funny so bad they're good <UNK> to take with you from the experience bad <UNK> bad gags
<START> this movie was obviously made with a very low budget but did they have to make it so obvious it looked like they made no effort to make the future look in the least futuristic for example the first scene takes place in an 80's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70's i assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than 500 additionally its pretty obvious that don the dragon is driving his personal car during the movie after all he did partially <UNK> the film finally they point out at the beginning of the film that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new <UNK> society not only does this never become important in the film but later when don needs surgery without <UNK> why doesn't he just go out and get some legal heroin or <UNK> the whole movie is sloppy like this and completely <UNK> since don easily blows up an <UNK> about 25 minutes into the movie however if you find this movie cheap or free i'd watch it the last scene is almost worth putting up with this whole film
<START> this isn't quite the best canadian film ever imo i won't get off track and name 3 or 4 better just a couple of nights before i'd seen the <UNK> thief the highly rated italian classic and there are some parallels both filmmakers shot their film in a specific time and specific place with minimal resources in terms of sets and cast and the result in both cases is fascinating and a joy to watch for the realistic setting and characters alone the lingering shots over faces and landscape almost make this worth watching on its own that being said this one isn't quite in the same league as the italian classic the movie is shot in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mining town that is <UNK> with the warmth of the people and the eye of the filmmaker claude <UNK> basically what you get is a series of vignettes that are likely nostalgic <UNK> of <UNK> not ha ha funny but poignant and probably sometimes difficult at the time but now <UNK> over with the of nostalgia the movie <UNK> there is little tension somewhere around half to two thirds way through the story begins everyone you've met to this point is involved and you've gotten to know these characters rather well so have a little patience at the outset the story is a good one it will leave you thinking and it involves sex love and death all the basic elements if you like bergman godard <UNK> all that kind of stuff you won't be disappointed by this
<START> it's one of the best movies that i have seen this year i don't agree with the person who said it's boring of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all but personally i spent a very good moment this movie very well sex scenes with frightening scenes there is also a nice touch of humor for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father and then her husband says how can someone abuse someone like you and then he attempts to <UNK> her on the bed for sexual games d very funny i recommend this movie to everyone and by the way sorry for my poor english i'm from france
<START> i am so happy not to live in an american small town because whenever i'm shown some small town in the states it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless in this movie a former doctor who's just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash directs his steps to the nearest small town he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns which happens to be the <UNK> <UNK> and of course as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose he meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain <UNK> and at once falls in love with her but there is a tiny <UNK> she is already married to a very small time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot <UNK> not dead to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself i'll just tell you that it's slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but is a way down in all artistic <UNK>
<START> i'd heard a lot of bad things about this film before seeing it but thought all the negative comments were probably down to the film's low budget and poor acting both of which i can deal with when it comes to zombie films however what i didn't count on is this film being really really boring if there's one thing you can count on from low budget zombies its gore and entertainment but unfortunately this film has neither i'm quite surprised because the previous two horror films i've seen from director bob clark and black christmas were both highly inventive and entertaining films but children shouldn't play with dead things just doesn't cut it the plot line follows a group of young adults that travel to a burial island in order to mess about with <UNK> to bring the dead back to life however they soon learn that playing with things they don't understand is a really stupid idea when their <UNK> actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their blood br br the plots sounds like it could lead to a decent flick but what i didn't mention is that the interesting parts don't start until the final twenty minutes and as this is a ninety minute movie i'm sure you can guess that this isn't a good thing the opening hour and ten minutes are padded out with poor acting and even worse characters i can understand setting up a situation so that the horror is more potent once it comes along but please if you're going to spend so long on it you've really got to make it interesting all of the characters in the film are over the top and annoying and personally i just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them the film is not without its merits however as the atmosphere is a standout lucio fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and flesh eating zombies can blend well but bob clark already did it with this film the direction isn't bad either but it's brought down by poor make up effects and a distinct lack of blood which isn't likely to please fans of zombie movies overall i really can't recommend this film but if you're a hardcore zombie fanatic you may get a kick out of it
<START> there is a lot of repetitive dialogue in this movie about cold spots <UNK> the presence of a ghost and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves to recreate the feeling of the movie i shall repeatedly make references to cold spots throughout this review seen worse movies than the st experiment but this may be the most forgettable one of all it's getting cold basically some 20 somethings spend the night at a haunted house this is filmed as a supposedly true documentary it's obviously not real but the house does contain some cold spots spoilers as if you won't be able to predict most of the plot not much happens in this film we have the time <UNK> horror cliche of a cat jumping out of hiding near the beginning as a practice scare to warm up the audience the people wander around with <UNK> occasionally taking a moment to remind the house that they come in peace that they mean no harm to the spirits or cold spots within now and then a door will swing shut and <UNK> somebody of course the board makes an appearance they chat with a ghost named charles a girl eats a <UNK> with a <UNK> in it more cold spots another door <UNK> shut and some guy goes off about the sound of the door he says oh my god somebody says surround yourself with white light i admit there is a good scene in the attic where a chair is knocked over by a ghost that really caught me off guard but aside from some funny bad dialogue the chair scene the actual split second when it is knocked over nothing immediately before or after that moment is the only good thing in this movie however there are still some cold spots in here eventually the movie ends nobody dies no more details necessary i wasn't a big fan of blair witch project but it looks like a masterpiece next to the st experiment you may find yourself not <UNK> whether or not this is a real documentary but whether or not it was intended to be funny i still don't know but whatever it was intended to be it failed
<START> i didn't buy this i didn't rent this it was on <UNK> and someone burned a copy of it and <UNK> it to me so at least i wasted no money on it for someone that did darkness the <UNK> devil's <UNK> this is a pretty lame film seems to have something to do with a bunch of girls that were at a convent back in the day and now they're all grown up and they're being pursued and killed one by one by a nun that comes out of the kitchen sink the toilet and even manages to <UNK> the revolving doors in a hotel and what makes this nun so mean and nasty and wet i <UNK> this was so boring that at some point about halfway through i just stopped it put it away and watched something else wasn't even interested in finding out really oh sure there's some lovely young ladies to look at but hey are two of them lesbians i guess there's a picture on the <UNK> table of one young <UNK> bedroom and what self <UNK> horror movie wouldn't be complete these days without a lesbian couple yeah whatever 2 out of 10 if you want to see a worthwhile nun horror movie try <UNK> dead waters or the convent and that's the one with <UNK> <UNK> by the way not the one with john <UNK>
<START> someone said that <UNK> is a lot like an episode of <UNK> and i have to agree spoilers i never liked the actors on <UNK> and rarely have seen it except when nothing better was on <UNK> is the kind of movie to see if you have no other choices read a book <UNK> has those kind of tv has been actors that look like they are there as part of their <UNK> or work release program some low budget tv movies have actors that at least look enthusiastic the actors in <UNK> look like they were getting paid minimum <UNK> and were working on a time clock they have that desperate the paycheck better not <UNK> look the queen spider looks great except it is rarely seen and there are no other <UNK> and no <UNK> the queen spider bites people and they become spider zombies which means that they try to keep their eyes wide open when they are attacking the humans the humans are all fighting among themselves over a number of different reasons and they are not sympathetic after meeting all the humans i would have recommended charm school for the characters all that <UNK> made me feel was <UNK> i was <UNK> to the characters and hoped for some interesting gore and special effects the gore was minimal and the special effects were reserved for the ugly spider queen who looked good if <UNK> had a bunch of spider creatures eating humans it would have been more entertaining apparently they could only budget spider zombies <UNK> is a sad entry into the field of spider oriented movies it may qualify as the worst spider movie ever because eight <UNK> freaks had great special effects
<START> warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment br br if you plan on watching this movie don't i warn you this movie is terribly boring and basically horrifying not in the horror movie kind of way to watch i <UNK> this <UNK> movie for another <UNK> movie and when i had noticed i made a mistake i decided to watch this one anyway i wish i wouldn't have this movie is so horrendous and so <UNK> in every piece of material that i couldn't bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent for one thing this movie should be called a boring talk about wilderness instead of <UNK> they only show <UNK> once at the same time the way this film sounds so poorly heard i got sleepy only 20 minutes into the thing at the end my mouth was hung wide open and i <UNK> <UNK> at the blank tv screen it is a very poorly directed and badly filmed piece of junk that i was afraid i brain <UNK> after watching it
<START> i didn't expect too much from this movie but i was still disappointed it's supposed to be a comedy but there are only four or five scenes where i actually laughed and i think that's rather poor there is no real plot either i always had the feeling that most of the scenes could have been put anywhere in the movie because there's no connection between them but the worst thing was the acting of kim <UNK> he has one facial expression during the whole movie as if he was supposed to play some retarded guy but i believe that's not the case all in all i rate it four out of ten i've seen worse movies than this but i wouldn't spend money on this one again
<START> filmed in arizona by a mostly foreign crew is one of the crime dramas i have ever seen robert mitchum in a cowboy hat <UNK> recently widowed <UNK> smith around hoping to figure out if she had a hand in her husband's death wardrobe is of the <UNK> evans variety and her dog is named cowboy seems as if somebody sure bought into the american myth that all <UNK> talk and dress like <UNK> of john wayne screenplay by joan andre and john case may have worked better if approached as parody this mystery thriller just plays tame with director ted post asleep at the controls don't be drawn in by the video box art of <UNK> screaming while taking a shower she does indeed take a shower in this film but it is not revealing nor does it further the murky plot one <UNK> no stars from
<START> although this film never <UNK> commercial <UNK> my experience has led me to conclude that many well done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal the story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and <UNK> on a surreal dream like adventure with very little basis in our of time and space therefore anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its <UNK> to reality will likely be disappointed it is not intended to be realistic it is however intended to be <UNK> with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail in addition the symbolic <UNK> are left open for interpretation which can be said of much great artwork don't be fooled by the cover if you happen to rent or buy this film the movie is not what it might seem to be on the surface
<START> regardless of what anyone says its a b movie and the effects are poorly done if you're a vampire fanatic i suppose it would be ok not 10 out of 10 you others here cant sincerely mean that we are to view this as a movie not read it as a book so the effects and characters are important as well as the story the story are good but it doesn't carry the film no wonder it has a low rating over all i write this because i chose to see this movie when i saw some good reviews here on imdb but got severely disappointed don't get me wrong i thought the blade movies was awesome and loved the underworld movies but this characters aren't close the make up on the vampires is poorly done and the effects are worse this sucks i might not have gotten so disappointed if i had not read reviews here that told me how great it was the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something seriously if you think this is awesome you don't care about acting or make up this is better as a book 3 out of 10 for an ok story
<START> although this movie and i use the term loosely was made in 1997 we just watched it tonight for the first time my husband commented that a tommy lee jones movie that we'd never heard of made him a little <UNK> i <UNK> watched anyway certain that if jones was in the movie it must at least be worth two hours of my time after all he has been one of our go to actors for years although <UNK> isn't one of my favorite actresses i was additionally <UNK> by seeing another well known face the list of accomplished actors actresses continued to grow so i endured more and more of this film certain that if i pushed through enough clichés and trite social statements i would arrive <UNK> on the other side of the plot alas there was no plot it appeared to be burned by the ever <UNK> <UNK> of doom br br the characters were paper thin the plot was so chock full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and acting in the movie was the <UNK> for a brief <UNK> with an <UNK> science teacher too much for this film's budget no acid rain no toxic <UNK> like <UNK> or no deadly ash no skin <UNK> heat just a few feet from the <UNK> wow it's the world's <UNK> <UNK> ever br br the events were no better than the characters each incident was so contrived and far fetched it's like the writers said okay we need to get rid of the little girl now and <UNK> she's <UNK> by a <UNK> bomb which burns her enough that she has to be carried to safety not from the <UNK> but from her own helpless <UNK> but just moments later in the car she is in no apparent pain and soon after is running effortlessly through the <UNK> building that oh no is about to be blown up after enduring all of this your reward is the line from the little boy at the end about all the people looking the same which has got to be one of the worst movie lines i have ever heard even if it wasn't so painfully scripted it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved kid and cop aside as if the mother would still be in the area and just needs to be pointed out because she just isn't speaking up what she's hoping to <UNK> off into the shadows and get away from the little brat once and for all i don't think so obviously the child's mother would be missing or dead or yelling her head off to find her <UNK> br br the token black <UNK> tough <UNK> with a secret soft spot versus the chip on his shoulder narrow minded cracker cop with a secret soft spot scene made my eyes bleed even if such pat characters existed they wouldn't behave as the movie portrays them given the circumstances something about <UNK> fiery death and massive destruction tends to catch people off guard ya know br br there are too many <UNK> movie moments like these to mention really it's just an embarrassing movie to watch those poor writers where are they now
<START> we all know that special effects cost money but it seems as if they could have used the money they saved writing the script to get some better shots the train is obviously a model in most moving shots the helicopter is obviously computer generated the alien looks like the one from the end of <UNK> except it's a decade later and <UNK> had an excuse br br the only smart thing they did was <UNK> all of the special effects to make them harder to see br br not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and it's pretty obvious they didn't really try either br br please don't waste your time please
<START> this brief review contains no spoilers since the movie <UNK> itself it is wooden and <UNK> it has no saving grace whatsoever if someone invites you to his house to watch mr don't go even the title of the movie is dreadful and <UNK> what garbage lies within the whole plot is so bad that it could drive mother <UNK> to despair it wasn't a stroke that led to the early demise of poor it was having to act in this <UNK> that did him in it must have haunted him the rest of his days perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge upon the americans for his <UNK> he found a perfect vehicle for his wrath in this travesty
<START> here's another of the 1940's westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or <UNK> because although it may be flawed historically it is extremely entertaining and well acted plus it's got randolph scott my favorite actor second only to gary cooper well ok fourth behind coop charlton heston and gregory peck but the film itself to me anyway is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before well acted and flows very well i bet i've seen it 50 or 60 times and enjoy each viewing more than the one before i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd see it if you haven't i guarantee you'll like it
<START> i liked this movie i saw it to a packed house at the toronto international film festival the day after the <UNK> opener which must have gone over well the director <UNK> hood was supposed to be present for today's screening but alas his twins were born just hours before so he had to jet on a flight back in 24 was how he <UNK> about it br br rendition refers to a term <UNK> suspected terrorists in the us can be sent without the legal <UNK> of their parents nations to <UNK> abroad to be <UNK> and <UNK> br br it's fairly predictable innocent egyptian american man wrongly accused of being a terrorist while en route from south africa to <UNK> he is sent abroad while wife at home reese <UNK> fights to find him and free him but what makes this movie special are some nice choices in story telling 1 a human touch story of what is going on in the locale where a suicide bomb <UNK> 2 the humanity of a cia agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on and 3 the <UNK> of story telling which makes it a tight taut tale that moves and <UNK> at the right moments ah relief and a mix of emotions that <UNK> around as the story fights for an ending br br all around strong acting with meryl streep as a standout <UNK>
<START> this movie was so incredibly boring michael j fox could've done so much better sorry but it's true for all you people who liked the movie
<START> yes 1939 robert <UNK> <UNK> version was the best perfection won the oscar in a very tough year gable in <UNK> james stewart as mr smith were 2 of his <UNK> wow was that a rough year most critics in ny hated this version so didnt see in theatre finally saw this a m on tcm enjoyed peter o'toole was excellent glad he was oscar nominated for this <UNK> pleased oscar finally gave him a special award this past year clark was good as mrs <UNK> but her character i feel was poorly written some good songs <UNK> you i sung by ms clark later recorded by many others including t bennett s <UNK> carmen <UNK> the b w version was more authentic but this is a good film beautifully photographed in color <UNK> enjoyable worth seeing bravo again mr o'toole
<START> i only bought this dvd because it was dirt cheap and it seemed interesting in its own special way special meaning retarded the movie turned out to be quite uninteresting boring camera work nothing really driving the story and of course the acting is horrible it wasn't even bad in a campy way it was just plain bad there are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its awkward and weak all i could think about while watching this was that this could actually be a good movie if the script was given a major <UNK> if it were written by someone who actually understood drug culture and if some decent actors were cast i wouldn't recommend weekend with the babysitter unless if you plan on a career in film and want to learn what not to do in a movie
<START> this movie had a very unique effect on me it <UNK> my realization that this movie really sucks it is disguised as a film in the likes of <UNK> and other <UNK> like that but at the end and even after a few minutes you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious <UNK> probably written by some <UNK> student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks the whole idea is  i don't even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind a very weak one btw with stupid <UNK> the kind you learn on <UNK> school <UNK> you suddenly come to the one truth about everything then you have to kill someone and what how what why why is just like saying that to make a cake just throw a bunch of ingredients and add forgot about cooking it i guess these guys forgot to not explain but present the <UNK> of why was this happening you have to do that when you present a story which normal everyday acts lie solving <UNK> <UNK> start to have an <UNK> effect on people acting was horrible with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera and the guy from <UNK> the series acting up like the though heavy metal record store yeah they're all real though s o <UNK> the menacing atmosphere with the oh so clever <UNK> enter the 60's series of batman and robin with guest appearance of the <UNK> and the <UNK> who claim to have the knowledge behind that <UNK> on their just horrible horrible br br i'm usually very partial about low budget movies and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve in <UNK> of their <UNK> you know but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half and at the end you will just <UNK> that you fell for it
<START> this movie was filmed in my hometown and i was <UNK> with many of the actors in minor rolls most of them were students at the local karate school and even at the time it was filmed we all knew what a stinker it was it was interesting however to see it being made most of the places it was filmed at no longer exist such as the nightclub the pizza shop etc the world premiere was held at the <UNK> theatre and we all laughed hysterically at how inane it was i personally believe it's the worst movie ever made but it brings back many fond memories for me watch this movie with a word of advice enjoy it for what it is a very low budget poorly made karate flick
<START> this movie is absurd absolutely terrible michael keaton and andy garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie the plot is totally not believable michael keaton agrees to <UNK> bone <UNK> to the dying son of a detective but then escapes he manages to <UNK> the police throughout the hospital not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital he takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital blowing up the power <UNK> and a bridge why and to top that andy garcia father of the dying boy and a doctor help the criminal so as to get the bone <UNK> the plot is such <UNK> maybe the worse movie i have ever see
<START> i saw the <UNK> the first killings and i thought it was absolutely one of the best <UNK> i have seen ever it was one of those <UNK> that you think that oh no i cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it jamie was an absolutely amazing actor in it to be able to switch between two totally totally different characters one of which is the evil nasty person that did it and the other person who is <UNK> <UNK> the cop to be able to do that well i certainly wouldn't be able to do it well not without cracking anyway i really do love and care for jamie with all of my heart and i always will until the end of time i think that jamie is the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> guy in the world i absolutely love jamie in ultimate force also because he looks god damn sexy in the blacks that he wore i love jamie love paula br br x
<START> and she really was beautiful <UNK> day that is herself her part and her performance an engaging story of selfish vs <UNK> love for the same man wealthy <UNK> and robert <UNK> one of his <UNK> of <UNK> leads to an incident that <UNK> the local community and <UNK> the <UNK> of the two sisters jean <UNK> and <UNK> day that are close to him and to each other their comfortable and somewhat superficial <UNK> is up ended as the two girls confront the ensuing crisis and respond to its <UNK> demands of <UNK> integrity loyalty and love with consequences that are profoundly different for each of them with the old <UNK> and abandoned their real characters are revealed in enthralling contrast br br a wonderful find on tcm
<START> i was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre release last night and though i wasn't expecting to actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part the <UNK> and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living the weaker parts of the movie <UNK> largely around using stereotypical set scenes i'm not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of an officer and a gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy <UNK> br br like i said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clichés
<START> this movie was extremely boring i only laughed a few times i decided to rent it when i noticed william <UNK> name on the cover it's all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist he meets a prostitute she takes him to a club called the <UNK> where he befriends several <UNK> when mayor tony gold shatner decides to take over the <UNK> business <UNK> <UNK> must lay down for his <UNK> br br the animation isn't very good in this it looks like it was made with <UNK> which i'm sure it was it doesn't suck it's just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years the humor in this is not very good i didn't think any of it was funny
<START> i'm just filling this comment out because i couldn't stand the fact that a positive comment was featured on the complete information page i really think this to be the worst movie ever made in my country this is not only because of the terrible plot the crappy english and a tension <UNK> that is as flat as our country no it is because this was a serious attempt to make a good action movie <UNK> the hollywood standard it had to be the european action movie of the year for this purpose they even hired van <UNK> actor in the academy award winning picture to do the job i don't mind bad films i can even enjoy them if they are b movies but i can't stand movies that are terrible but supposed to be a type movies
<START> or that's what the filmmakers would like you to believe anyway br br this movie tries <UNK> hard to be cool it's ridiculous everything from the look of the film the cinematography the editing the dialogue and the acting is <UNK> in super cool mode from the get go just to make sure that no one misses how cool this film is there's a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a <UNK> western surf <UNK> guitar playing constantly throughout the film as a final reminder of how <UNK> cool this movie is all the actors have been <UNK> to speak in a <UNK> voice because as we all know that's <UNK> br br the plot if there indeed is one seems pretty straightforward but as someone else already pointed out the director and star of the film seems <UNK> determined not to tell that story instead focusing on a <UNK> of naked babes and dialogue that's supposed to be <UNK> but grows tired surprisingly quick did they have an contest to see how many times they could <UNK> the words <UNK> and f <UNK> and its <UNK> in an 80 minute film br br this movie was absolutely horrible
<START> what we're given in this trying to be trendy film is a frat pack of college friends now approaching age 30 which we all know of course their generation thinks of as the new 20 <UNK> of four guys and a gal we have thrust at us the following types seemingly and frequent drug users along with one individual who is job successful and one who is trying to be they are all in their own way <UNK> while trying to find both a future and emotional happiness with one possibly two exceptions these are people this reviewer would definitely never care to come close to <UNK> myself after there is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives except in the instance of one individual who appears on the way to finding it none appears headed toward emotional satisfaction in his her life and so about the only sincere moment in this film is when a knock at the door brings to the person answering it an unexpected and heartfelt i love you br br with only the exceptions mentioned these people are the kind hardly deserving or worthy of several hundred thousands of dollars being thrown away in presenting their stories br br ps writer director johnson definitely appears to have a problem with showing gay sexual scenes with no such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing <UNK> ones why might that be br br
<START> i've seen the 1973 movie lost <UNK> and read many of the reviews for this movie i agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting i was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me i watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope a little cheer a bit of a release from my everyday life and this is what i got you can be critical of the acting the singing and dialog but not what i look for when i go to a movie i look for a little release from my daily life a little time where i can sit back and imagine a better life where people love another and help another it's a shame we can't we enjoy a movie for what it tells us and quit picking it apart like an english teacher reading a fifth grade <UNK> this may be very simplistic but really wouldn't it be nice
<START> far more <UNK> and less stage and set bound than gene <UNK> previous efforts <UNK> in the park <UNK> and the odd couple <UNK> <UNK> flower is not a work of art but compared to most of the tired <UNK> from the 60's like the apartment how to murder your wife goodbye charlie a guide for the man divorce american style any <UNK> kiss me stupid boys night out it's a masterpiece director <UNK> and writer i a l diamond have effectively opened up <UNK> <UNK> broadway hit and the film benefits greatly from new york city location shooting and excellent performances from ingrid bergman and goldie hawn bergman is charming looks great and demonstrates a flair for comedy hawn in her oscar winning role has never been better or more appealing matthau is ok though it's hard to believe that <UNK> character would be so <UNK> of him and in retrospect <UNK> attempted suicide at the start of the film is out of character and unbelievable nonetheless the film has a plausible <UNK> set up and once it gets going it <UNK> laugh rick <UNK> jack <UNK> eve bruce and <UNK> provide good support the film is likable and fun and hawn and bergman make you care
<START> <UNK> as our local theater decided to display its title on their <UNK> minus the second word it is terrific cinema br br i don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over <UNK> let them never know what they're missing br br i did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of <UNK> previous films in every case save <UNK> dogs they have improved with additional watching br br so although i gave it ten stars i did so reluctantly it leaves me no up to go to br br yes <UNK> <UNK> is the nazi we've all imagined the worst to be he is <UNK> sophisticated suave and most sadistic the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a <UNK> <UNK> it into the whipped cream as if he were <UNK> his <UNK> into a victim br br to understand <UNK> films you need only have a sense of dialogue color and pacing the colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary <UNK> yet in the french <UNK> of the opening scene they are muted and dark but <UNK> so outside a brilliant sun is shining but in the one room of the house everything is <UNK> in shadows and black br br it is a brilliant setting for an <UNK> by <UNK> as the jew hunter of the ss who <UNK> his host french farmer over the <UNK> of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times then pulls him back with <UNK> lines of friendship and understanding br br a second sadistic german well played by august <UNK> later functions as important actor in the final plot twist <UNK> nazi major who has an ear for german accents is almost as good as <UNK> almost br br film classes will study much from this movie they should look lovingly at the superb pacing tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene building suspense in the manner of hitchcock then at just the breaking point suddenly coming to a resolution br br for color look for a final shot at a french theater where its secretly jewish <UNK> is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of nazi <UNK> br br we see her played by <UNK> <UNK> awaiting the hated german who will arrive for a film preview of the latest <UNK> film masterpiece a propaganda piece about a german hero and his dubious <UNK> br br <UNK> is framed on a balcony reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater her red lips and low cut dress <UNK> everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests it is a single shot that would be worth an entire film br br there are thankfully many more such images many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense br br in short see it i'm sure you'll see it again and again
<START> i know a lot of people would claim certain films as 'the worst of all <UNK> but i think redneck stakes a claim for this prize a combination of quite dreadful acting from both mark lester and telly <UNK> and plot progression that defies belief br br on telly was he drunk when he acted in this he seems to play a <UNK> laughing lunatic with no sense of conviction maybe he mixed his <UNK> with his <UNK> i don't know br br on mark lester a performance more wooden than a carpenter's <UNK> his <UNK> british tones don't belong in this film and his transformation from <UNK> teenager to <UNK> apprentice in 24 hours is mad and the strip scene with <UNK> does not have any relevance to the plot at all perhaps the director likes this sort of thing br br plot logic when <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the car at the beginning why doesn't mark <UNK> mother do or say anything to get her son out of the car before the <UNK> drive it off she just lets them all go without saying a word on the other hand redneck has to be seen you won't believe how bad it is otherwise
<START> great artists always suffered while they were young i could mention <UNK> and <UNK> but that is not the point br br this movie was made by h g <UNK> whose family wanted him to succeed in the law <UNK> br br its main star is louis <UNK> who studied and <UNK> as as <UNK> before becoming the greatest actor and also director of <UNK> theater before and after wwii br br they both had health problems <UNK> had <UNK> while young <UNK> had <UNK> problems and died on a theater br br such events shape the character of men and women of course one might even say that today's artists are so poor because they had never suffered and fought for their lives br br to me this is the greatest of <UNK> movies <UNK> of fear is greater in suspense <UNK> also has more suspense and a better plot and is more about female evil br br <UNK> des is more human <UNK> was <UNK> accused by de <UNK> mostly <UNK> and jews of collaboration with the nazis and banned from making films until until de left <UNK> government in early 1946 de came back in 1958 as president br br the main characters are all good souls jenny <UNK> may perform as a <UNK> on stage but she is not a whore make <UNK> of those words but they are not the same loves her husband and refuses the slight advances from her presumably lesbian friend <UNK> the photographer br br maurice the husband is jealous and <UNK> but runs away from the scene of the crime he is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and <UNK> an eventually more <UNK> career for love br br <UNK> the detective interpreted by the great louis <UNK> basically a stage actor performs in this french gray not noir as well as e g robinson in double <UNK> shows flair for pseudo criminals <UNK> for a <UNK> son and compassion for the true author of the crime because he remembers that is father <UNK> the <UNK> at some <UNK> br br <UNK> was capable of <UNK> an actor's face in order to put him in the right frame of mind but deep inside he was very human br br i have his <UNK> in front of me he had <UNK> in which means open <UNK> devotion charity and <UNK> for those who do not believe in my most sincere apologies
<START> i attended the <UNK> last night the movie started out with a bang perhaps due to pre <UNK> excitement the audience laughed for about 15 minutes then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting off sleep this movie can not be compared to spinal tap or any of <UNK> work unless you want to say sons of <UNK> is a wanna be gone awfully wrong it just fell flat it died it was painful the story went nowhere the jokes were bland even if you were a mormon and could get all of the inside jokes it felt like a waste of time there were two redeeming qualities acting was spot on and the songs were very clever for an lds audience only so my <UNK> avoid the movie and if you are mormon buy the music cd
<START> i caught this movie late one night and never knew what hit me this was one of the most disturbing movies i have ever seen yet had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next alan <UNK> is an excellent bad guy but this character beats all others i've never been so affected by a movie it's been 6 years and i still can't forget closet land
<START> again we're getting a <UNK> of themes well covered by so many previous films the good and the bad son story courtesy east of <UNK> the american marine hero story who doesn't consider himself to be one due to what he knows and the <UNK> wife potentially falling in love with another man story br br the mere fact of those stories being that <UNK> isn't so much of a problem though because <UNK> they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around no luck this time though as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the same br br as the bad son never really gets to talk to his father so that conflict is never resolved properly apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter <UNK> the kitchen of the <UNK> wife now how satisfying is that br br next the surprisingly <UNK> marine <UNK> his wife of <UNK> conflict never gets resolved because he never really talks to the man under suspicion namely his own brother so once more we're handed a loose end here br br and finally the american military <UNK> <UNK> theme where the marine is <UNK> considered a hero when due to the <UNK> of war he went through he shouldn't really be called one as to his own standards that third theme falls flat just the same because the movie ends right when for the first time he's just able to talk to his wife about what he went through where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely his process of <UNK> how that would look like and how he would finally face the family he'd have some major guilt to admit to all that all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignored br br so while story wise this film is a serious and i mean serious disappointment i'd still give it points for the impressive cast although no film should use maguire for a voice over because that belongs to <UNK> especially a grown up <UNK> seems to fulfill all the expectations he <UNK> as a young and aspiring actor so much that i'd in fact love to see him <UNK> with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile br br so while the cast really seems to do what they can i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise a shallow and ultimately pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear indeed message du <UNK> to the writers we know the wounds already see the host of vietnam films you want to earn some credit show us a believable healing
<START> i thought that the interplay between crystal and <UNK> was great the movie is rather off the wall but there are some unforgettable lines <UNK> as <UNK> is vulgar and over the top but also very funny and effective the character has to be pretty awful for why else would someone entertain thoughts of killing his mother now <UNK> wife she is a slut whom everyone would like to receive her <UNK> thus her role though minor is also effective because it has to justify <UNK> ridiculous case of writer's block while there are certainly dark moments the movie is not depressing and despite the murderous <UNK> that the protagonists feel they have redeeming qualities too br br overall this is one of the funniest movies i can remember one that i don't mind watching over several times
<START> i was really excited about seeing cold mountain alas like most movies i'm really excited about seeing it was a letdown were it not for that <UNK> invention called a dvd i think i would've put my head through the <UNK> i was so bored br br i closely watched kidman and law when they meet because their characters are supposedly destined for each other yet <UNK> face showed anything but dumb struck love while kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer character is pure <UNK> <UNK> as if we don't get it <UNK> <UNK> mark her every entrance and so over the top it was all i could do not to laugh ironically her performance serves to highlight just how stiff as a board the leads are br br <UNK> nearly because she freed her slaves we never learn why more <UNK> is why didn't any of them stay on as <UNK> and her father were unusually <UNK> and as shown in one scene it was a very dangerous time for <UNK> as they're <UNK> called here why didn't the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop heck why didn't she just sell the farm and go home and for all of <UNK> <UNK> when she <UNK> <UNK> evil <UNK> that kind of puts the <UNK> on them having any more <UNK> br br by the time her beloved finally returns <UNK> doesn't need him or anyone else which is the big joke indeed she may be physically intimate with but her real <UNK> is with ruby who has turned <UNK> into an babe version of herself did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill holding hands happy as two <UNK> in a <UNK> as they left behind br br i doubt that recognized this as he was too busy making an anti bush movie tells us he is like every fool sent out to fight with a flag and a lie and <UNK> father says i imagine god is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument these observations are historically inaccurate and insulting while slavery was the basis of the economy the reasons for the war were more complex it was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was a lie in fact most in the rank and file were indifferent to it for filmmakers to <UNK> their views onto a period where such views were foreign to those who lived in that time is beyond obnoxious br br <UNK> the film is choppy and episodic law and kidman are miscast and have zero chemistry the script is little more than half baked dialog and an <UNK> bunch of clichés and <UNK> small moments like a bag of <UNK> ugh
<START> this is a very strange series with dean <UNK> i really didn't understand the guests i knew they weren't serious but whether they were really them was unclear because i guess i'm just that stupid i don't know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren't real like in ali g or anything they're played by one man or so i believe i love the serious look that he's got going on its like that programme that was on on a sunday morning that i forget the name of lol i also really like the suit and <UNK> thing he has got going on its quite hot he's <UNK> which is one of the funniest qualities i also like the way he has of the programme it makes it seem more authentic
<START> the girls might be <UNK> if you're their or a faced <UNK> what i'm <UNK> is that it'll take special circumstances for a non reaction to this effort the delivery of many lines appears to be <UNK> unnatural for some actors lighting seems to be a problem too although failing <UNK> may have <UNK> for my frequent <UNK> and if you view this film be open minded enough to accept elements that no <UNK> or circus would reject they are the above and below ground creatures who <UNK> on dozens of <UNK> near an empty <UNK> mansion that's the discovery of a trio who is <UNK> from their <UNK> media to investigate the deaths then two of them disappear and the survivor is part of another <UNK> who take up the hunt <UNK> i just realized what one of those aforementioned special circumstances would be <UNK>
<START> i saw this when it first came out and found it to be a work of some genius but i must confess i was clearly in the minority at the time br br for me the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> of guest house <UNK> just gets better and better throughout the film with one of the most hilarious <UNK> to a film ever br br but i wouldn't recommend it to mother br br lovers of gross out comic book style humour will appreciate this movie there are subtle jokes hidden away but they are usually quickly <UNK> by a comedy <UNK> pan and are superb and the deadpan unsuspecting guests are also excellent
<START> this movie was beyond disappointment well acted story that means nothing the plot is ridiculous and even what story there is goes absolutely nowhere it truly isn't worth a <UNK> buffalo or otherwise pun intended
<START> <UNK> from one scene to another from one story to another just like when walking from a shadowy path to an open place like the wind in the leaves from a tree to another how many different sounds just like when traveling people meet and tell their stories and then part forever who knows and just like when walking through these places full of the lost expectations from another time the human of the world takes the breath away br br i saw this movie with friends of mine not all of them liked it maybe were they too used to scenario based and ready made stories i don't know so this movie is for the silly ones who love looking at the sun <UNK> on the sea walking without any hurry in the hills or through the little <UNK> listening to the growing grass which tells the stories of those underneath six feet under in the warm wind of summer
<START> this movie had an excellent premise and could have been a fascinating look at racism attitudes to women at work and male female relations in england early last century however it simply turned into a <UNK> love story but what was worse is that the love story was totally unbelievable the acting was for the most part poor the direction confusing but most of all the screenplay and the story were non existent the only thing i liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting i really got a sense of just how little light one candle puts out
<START> what can i say about this movie that has not been said by all the other comments here they pretty much sum up everything the people who love it <UNK> it the people who hate it well they <UNK> it this is the movie equivalent of <UNK> br br i personally have committed every second of it to memory it is <UNK> claustrophobic <UNK> magical and stands as being one of the most unique films ever made despite what many have stated i believe this truly is a cult movie it is a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered once <UNK> it's <UNK> psychedelic visuals and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable which is an achievement in itself one of my friends who watched it <UNK> it more to a musical and in many respects to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made would probably get more out of it to view head as such br br i was always fond of the <UNK> especially the t v show back when it was repeated during the 80's my mum had recorded head for me when it was shown on t v late night as she knew i liked them i watched it a day later and it <UNK> in my memory until i was able to find a copy on dvd about 2 decades later what i would love now is a special edition it would be fascinating to get a greater insight into the making of this masterpiece we can only hope
<START> chris <UNK> <UNK> her way through most of this but then quickly takes on an air of boredom and disdain much as i did when watching it without her this would be no more than a cheap kids' movie but at least she does add an air of quality there are few if any more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in the business br br there's not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it is a cheap disney re make aimed at very <UNK> children i could watch <UNK> all day so i'm probably oblivious to many of the movie's shortcomings but unless you too are a <UNK> fan a cat lover or very small child i doubt you will find this very entertaining
<START> the subject is world war ii and robert ryan is a rejected soldier whom <UNK> hires as <UNK> she is a war widow br br the set is limited but the acting makes up for this robert ryan is conflicted one moment he seems nice then confused about where he lives at first <UNK> tries to help him he seems troubled but nothing more dangerous but how do we know the suspense builds i truly enjoy films like this which rely on the human element for suspense what is this man capable of there are some scenes with o z <UNK> and dee <UNK> as an annoying <UNK> boy who sees something is wrong we keep thinking she will be helped then <UNK> personality turns again he becomes like a <UNK> hyde character and eventually chases <UNK> with a knife br br worth watching for these two superb actors 9 10
<START> let's see there's a civil war a lost city a talking gorilla some regular <UNK> a previously unknown species of killer <UNK> gorilla the most powerful laser ever known to man a lot of <UNK> lying <UNK> and loose in the sand attack <UNK> an active <UNK> and a hot air balloon packed in a <UNK> in a <UNK> plane that's not too much is it i've had more coherent fever dreams and then the romanian guy picked up a bunch of <UNK> because this was a lost city that he had been looking for or something but then the mean <UNK> that we had seen before came out of nowhere and ate him now somehow the talking gorilla was back from visiting the regular <UNK> and as a kind of <UNK> or <UNK> started the woman <UNK> doctor built a gun using a laser and this big diamond she had just found in her dead <UNK> hand it's a blast if you're looking for more <UNK> against the <UNK> influence of michael <UNK> in american entertainment and hence world entertainment and if you keep firmly in mind the extent to which this cynical and half hearted attempt fell on its face at the but sadly the men responsible <UNK> john patrick <UNK> director frank marshall probably never lost a dime shame on them and i mean that 1 10
<START> i was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters and i saw it in japan the film's plot wasn't my cup of tea as a high school <UNK> but i went to see it for the 3 d process it had been <UNK> in the press so that even service <UNK> overseas had heard of it though it never screened at the post theater br br the film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience which was taken to absurd levels with later 3 d films br br i don't know whether this qualifies as a spoiler but you've been warned if it is in many films of the time actors would often work in front of a rear projection screen where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage this works well on regular films but when seen in 3 d they look like a flat scene behind the actors there were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used and it didn't work well in the theaters if seen in 3 d it will <UNK> another disappointment br br the film's only importance is historical since it was the first of its kind
<START> three words what a pile two words don't bother one word sucked there are zero reasons to see this movie even those seagal <UNK> should shy away from this movie the martial arts the typical <UNK> are horrible the martial arts moves themselves are fine but the cinematography is pathetic the movie actually goes into slow motion whenever seagal give his kill move to his victims worse yet is shows the same move three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles how stupid <UNK> acting was plain stupid but i still give this movie a 6 for acting because of the supporting cast whose villain roles were actually quite entertaining br br the plot is just dumb seagal plays a federal express agent with a license to kill his character also has that dedicated work <UNK> which means all of his <UNK> get delivered to the correct people on time at no extra charge and nothing stands in his way not <UNK> political leaders explosions or even death br br i expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrible acts of violence that lend itself in no way to the <UNK> of the movie or its story there is a reason this movie went directly to video and there are tons of reasons to avoid it no one should bother with this tripe br br
<START> many have <UNK> never say never again because it is not an official bond movie nevertheless it is <UNK> that the producers <UNK> to the <UNK> bond formula although the film does not have a pre credit sequence it is clear that the training exercise at the <UNK> of the film is meant to be the <UNK> scene it would have been impossible for <UNK> to stop the producers from including a pre credit and title sequence albeit without the gun barrel introduction br br sean connery is on fine form as the immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than dr no <UNK> you only live twice and <UNK> are forever although is meant to be a remake of <UNK> it is a vast improvement <UNK> spends more time on <UNK> and a more diverse range of exotic locations are included in the film br br there is some <UNK> acting in this movie barbara <UNK> is impeccable as the bizarre <UNK> one of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between bond and in nice which is <UNK> by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city <UNK> maria <UNK> plays the psychotic <UNK> and max von <UNK> is free of the melodrama that other actors portraying have <UNK> in br br tends to centre on connery rather than the character of bond at the <UNK> it is stated that bond is <UNK> and has been out of action this seems to refer to the 12 year <UNK> in <UNK> portrayal of bond bond promises never again to work in the secret service an <UNK> to <UNK> portrayal of bond it appears that the producers were trying to hurt the official bond franchise br br nevertheless this film is definitely worth watching this is the last time that sean connery played james bond but his performance convinced me that perhaps he should have never have said never again
<START> if i could give this movie a negative rating i would the humor is the <UNK> i have ever seen in a film horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own there are 2 plots neither of which supports half of a film where is the depth others see in this movie that no good deed goes <UNK> that only the heartless can succeed the film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done the acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying if you think that the 3 stooges are too nice to each other if watching the <UNK> of a kidnap victim with a <UNK> knife is a real <UNK> <UNK> if you thought <UNK> list was hilarious then this movie is for you
<START> this was a great show i don't remember much about about it but remember watching it and loving it i remember the mother and the father i really like the grandmother she was like a grandmother you really couldn't appreciate until you became an adult she was very <UNK> and no nonsense my favorite song on the show was in the morning that might not be the title i remember after seeing that show and hearing that song that i went to cleveland <UNK> to visit my cousins and me and my sister sang that song so much that by the time we left all of my little cousins were singing it too i too would love to find this on dvd
<START> if you haven't watched the movie yet but you do like comedy go out and buy or at least rent it the fact it won the animation oscar is not a coincidence i haven't watched many other wallace <UNK> movies in fact i think i only watched one other but the humor is very distinctive and some would also say very british in a good way of course br br the story will only be an excuse for all the jokes to come but although it's not the most elaborate one it still works by the way my niece did guess see one of the big surprises coming i didn't kudos to her o i do think that after you watch this one you'll go out and seek the other w g movies that are out there have fun
<START> it's just a bad film not as bad as r i c c o but bad it got me hooked at the then totally lost me after that the acting was way off then on then going way way way off do not see this movie at all costs trust me with all my heart the directors who are brothers are not the next hughes brothers who made really great films like dead <UNK> from hell american <UNK> and menace ii society the only person who made me watch this was the acting of paris campbell who will be a great actor one day if he makes better films than this christina also did a nice job for what she got i hope the <UNK> is 10 times better than this piece of crap
<START> monster of mexico i do agree is the weakest of the modern scooby doo movies mainly because of the weak plot and how predictable it all was <UNK> <UNK> monster however is a considerable improvement with gorgeous animation honestly scotland looked beautiful the music is good and the plot is well thought out plus there is some great dialogue and the voice acting was fabulous with <UNK> <UNK> a consistent delight as shaggy and the beautiful scottish singer <UNK> a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role in fact my only complaints were some strange accents in one or two members of the voice cast with the exception of whose accent did sound genuine and somehow the <UNK> <UNK> monster wasn't as well designed as it had potential to be overall a solid and enjoyable scooby doo film 8 10 <UNK> cox
<START> this is one of the best <UNK> of the 60's put on film arthur penn director of bonnie and clyde and little big man saw that steve outstanding script <UNK> with truth and from these two talents comes solid cinema <UNK> georgia miles gives male viewers a hit of <UNK> nostalgia for the <UNK> beauty who is almost within our <UNK> but always just out of reach just see it or you cinematic education will be <UNK>
<START> this movies is really special it's about a young french who go in <UNK> spain in order to study and in he meets other <UNK> like him this film he's the european movies of the year so go watch it
