<START> too bad they showed palm trees that could not be more inaccurate for <UNK> in october this was filmed in new zealand this martha case had been for 20 25 years her family worked hard to keep it alive and when mark decided he did not want to be remembered only for his involvement in the nicole simpson case which could have been to his reputation if it already hadn't anyway he followed along as the police tried to get enough information to write a book with the use of flashbacks we can see the relationships martha formed <UNK> boys coming of age without a mother around to help and a dad who was always <UNK> br br plus the fact that they portray the real martha as if she were a movie star she was a cute sweet girl next door type other than that the other characters were really great especially jon foster and toby moore who played as michael and tommy respectively they were good as well the <UNK> had to keep it all in the 70s look and back up to the 90s br br it kept my interest even when i caught on about the guy
<START> you may be interested to know that <UNK> was viewed as a failure by the studio and <UNK> for a year before alice <UNK> popularity reached such a high that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never fully completed it <UNK> <UNK> ok at the box office br br faye refers to a murder during her nightclub <UNK> in new york city and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the film was to start instead it is entirely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence including a complete song number by faye was never filmed however the rest of the story is pretty much intact and made release of the film possible at a running time of <UNK> minutes br br a tired looking warner <UNK> is too old to be believable as <UNK> romantic interest and is merely <UNK> as the broken down reporter audiences today would be offended by the depiction of chinese using <UNK> english phrases like me make <UNK> key luke is one of the chinese <UNK> but plays his role in a low key straightforward way arthur <UNK> is all but invisible and yet gets fourth billing on screen due to editing changes in the story originally joseph <UNK> had a role in the film but his part was eventually edited out br br a <UNK> of a film that will serve as entertainment only for the most die hard alice faye fans who will get a chance to see her in a dramatic role albeit a weak one charles <UNK> is totally wasted as a kindly man running the american <UNK> br br despite all the weaknesses there are a couple of scenes involving narrow escapes that are effectively played and karl <UNK> b w photography is top notch
<START> i loved complete <UNK> why did they <UNK> it anyway they should have made a second season and so on god they always <UNK> the good shows and leave all the boring stuff nothing interesting at tv since complete <UNK> is gone this show was a great idea a single <UNK> father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog each and every one of them has his own madness in that house <UNK> is always the kid always the smaller one kyle rocks he breaks everything he touches he's always on <UNK> he's always doing the wrong stuff but still he's so funny by all the things that he does sam is the smart one he's always shy and stupid when it comes to girls finally he ends up by dating angela chris is the sports guy who doesn't have much to do with school studying and stuff like that he's always funny and finally jack the rock of the show the oldest of all the macho guy the rock star but still as crazy as everybody else nick is helpless with these guys oh and i almost forgot uncle jimmy he's the man he's like a 30 year old kid he's like doing the same stupid things that the boys are doing i always wondered how did he end up by being a <UNK> and the dog is the image of all the savage family the thing is this show had everything to become something really big it had everything man but of course they canceled it
<START> this movie turned out to be better than i had expected it to be some parts were pretty funny it was nice to have a movie with a new plot
<START> my my my peter cushing and donald <UNK> must have been desperate for work to have <UNK> their talents to this turkey a horribly muddled story about <UNK> in modern day <UNK> land of the <UNK> aka the devil's men is a misfire on more or less every level imaginable it has precious few scares always a slight flaw for a horror movie don't you think weak performances countless scenes where characters <UNK> wander off alone or turn down the opportunity to remain in the safety of a group and some rather irritating editing techniques which add nothing whatsoever to the proceedings i got <UNK> excited at the <UNK> of cushing and <UNK> working together 17 years after the flesh and the <UNK> but this film isn't worth getting remotely excited about it's a huge let down and rather an embarrassment for its much leads br br in a remote region of <UNK> <UNK> such as tourists and <UNK> keep going missing and local priest father donald <UNK> suspects that something sinister is <UNK> he writes to his friend new york private eye milo <UNK> <UNK> asking him to fly out to <UNK> to help him get to the bottom of the mystery in the meantime three more <UNK> beth ian <UNK> and tom robert who are all personal friends of father go missing while <UNK> around nearby greek ruins milo eventually arrives in <UNK> but is initially dubious about father beliefs that the missing people have been <UNK> for satanic sacrifices milo and father are also joined by laurie peters the girlfriend of missing man tom together they <UNK> the activities of a <UNK> devil <UNK> cult headed by creepy <UNK> <UNK> baron peter cushing these crazed <UNK> have been <UNK> their victims to a statue of the <UNK> furthermore they seemingly cannot be killed by normal means so father has to use a variety of religious <UNK> in his fight against them br br land of the <UNK> should have been much better than it actually is the plot is so wacky and improbable that it has all the <UNK> of an <UNK> goofy cult camp favourite but the handling is just awful director <UNK> has no idea how to link the narrative together <UNK> so the whole thing progresses like it was being made up on a day to day basis he also has no idea how to <UNK> convincing performances from his cast so they are left to embarrass themselves in either dreadfully hammy <UNK> cushing or dreadfully amateurish peters performances what's worse is that the narrative makes no sense why would father seek help from a private eye who is utterly <UNK> about his beliefs how does know that the sacrifices only occur during a full moon how can the <UNK> statue speak why is one one of the <UNK> victims <UNK> during a vision to stab father only to herself be stabbed a few scenes later before getting a chance to carry it out and most <UNK> of all why does father drag milo halfway around the world to help him when all he needs is a <UNK> and and some holy water to <UNK> of the bad guys these questions and more will pop into your mind during land of the <UNK> but alas there are no answers to be had frustrating dumb and disappointing
<START> i never comment on a film but i have to say that this was one of the worst films that i have ever seen i feel it was made by a <UNK> film student and not to put down talented film students but this was horrible i did not buy the lead actress and felt i was in acting class with her while she was on film her decisions were very safe and i feel she was <UNK> other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions the direction was very confusing and the sound was <UNK> than the actors themselves the end may have made a little more sense if there was someone <UNK> the events and not a song i love <UNK> <UNK> but she her songs appear quite frequently in films maybe the song selection could have been a little more original the song crazy was such a clich√© as i said before i never comment on films and have seen my share of good and bad but this was the worst sorry
<START> <UNK> can there be anything more boring sitting in front of a computer all day <UNK> away at some keys all day every day tap tap <UNK> that's much of the problem with this movie the heroine sits in front of a computer <UNK> the keys and no matter how many looks of <UNK> she gives or how much suspenseful notes the composer strikes or how many extreme close ups the director uses there's not much excitement down to the fact that there's few things less exciting than watching somebody on a computer br br there's a few other problems too much of them factual errors regarding how computers work is it possible to hack into a computer that is both turned off and not connected to the internet i guess that when the net was made 10 years ago very few people would understand how computers worked so the screenwriters would have been able to <UNK> at length but since we now live in a global village where nearly every household in the western world has their own computer the audience are certainly very <UNK> up on the factual errors of this movie and of course there's too many instances where someone acts stupid or out of character at crucial times in order to progress the plot which makes the net a very mediocre movie
<START> this movie starts out great and sucks you in most acting is good until patrick <UNK> with his texas <UNK> everyone else sounds british like even the muslim shows up and proves that he can't act you can live with that until the first fight scene where all they all fall to pieces why does patrick <UNK> fight baddies with an <UNK> when he just stuck his sword into the ground 5 minutes ago br br there's further of swords a few minutes later and people knowing about other people they shouldn't know about other reviewers mentioned troubled production and it shows br br at the end i just didn't even care about the fight scenes sure the cgi dragon was weak but the storyline was the biggest letdown
<START> chapter one once upon a <UNK> at a table 1941 br br in which a german nazi and a french <UNK> farmer talk at a table for 20 minutes first in french then in english br br chapter two three years of <UNK> <UNK> in sixteen minutes without tables mostly br br in which an american lieutenant talks to his newly formed 8 man jewish american <UNK> unit there are no tables present cut to <UNK> hitler three years later he is angry at his men's inability to deal with the <UNK> hitler does have a table we return to the <UNK> in a flashback again distinct lack of table based content br br chapter three german night in paris at a table talking br br in which a jewish woman who escaped from under the table in chapter one has somehow managed to become the <UNK> of a cinema the jewish woman talks to an actor at a table in a bar later the jewish woman the actor joseph <UNK> and a <UNK> talk at a table in a restaurant the actor and <UNK> talk in german the <UNK> <UNK> the german into french the jewish woman replies in french the <UNK> <UNK> the french into german <UNK> decides to hold a film premiere at the jewish woman's cinema the actor and <UNK> leave the nazi who talked with the <UNK> farmer at a table for twenty minutes back in chapter one arrives he talks with the jewish woman at the table he leaves the jewish woman breaks down overcome with emotion at having spent so long talking at a table br br chapter four operation table talking br br in which austin powers sends a british officer to join the <UNK> and an actress on a mission to talk in german at a table in a <UNK> after 21 minutes of talking at a table they all shoot each other the actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying on a table talking br br chapter five revenge of the giant table br br in which the <UNK> decide to continue the operation by talking in italian and suicide bombing the cinema the nazi takes the actress into a small room where they sit next to a table a <UNK> that he found under the table in the <UNK> fits her so he kills her then he takes two of the <UNK> to a big room where they sit and talk at a table meanwhile the cinema burns down hitler is <UNK> with bullets and the two <UNK> blow themselves up for no good reason at all br br the end
<START> if you get the slight enjoyment out of pink <UNK> music you will love this movie the score is completely pink <UNK> and of course the drug element plays a major part in this movie giving you the doubts about life within the weakest moments this movie also touches the heart with the story about love and the people around you there is also a huge connection with the world around you with the environment of a personal island this thing tell me i need ten lines to sum up a movie but i am done that is all you get that is why this movie is a 6 1 which is a major upset to any movie with a score like this take a look at <UNK> for a dream and the <UNK> equally good scores for our generation but <UNK>
<START> this movie probably began with a good idea but that's as far as it went when i read the cover at blockbuster i thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie the movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other <UNK> there was no explanation of how that would happen but that's okay i thought it would be developed that in the movie it wasn't in the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with <UNK> taped to their heads beside each one are two attractive women the men begin asking do you hear that or do you see them we conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are <UNK> the women do not see these creatures this was fine for the first five minutes but this scene goes on for a full hour it is briefly <UNK> by flashbacks that have no <UNK> to the so called plot of the film we are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be middle eastern terrorists what is this about we never find out the flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why at the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do ¬ñ they blow up the lab but why what is the point we have no idea this film contains so many <UNK> thoughts and ideas that there are too many to but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab <UNK> and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not <UNK> down the makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by <UNK> on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline sorry but this movie was a waste of 4 and the time i spent driving to the rental store and then watching it take my advice don't rent it
<START> the true life story of perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known led the game of football out of the stone age with <UNK> such as the forward pass and offensive <UNK> shifts but he is probably best known for his <UNK> locker room speeches along the way he brought fame and glory to a tiny little unknown catholic school in indiana pat o'brien is <UNK> in his role as terrific cast that includes ronald reagan who gives a great performance as <UNK> first true superstar george br br for football <UNK> this is the greatest football movie ever made do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version some versions have deleted scenes for some reason if you got the good version look for a brief cameo by the immortal jim as he sticks his head in the locker room telling and the team they only have a few minutes left before the 2nd half begins
<START> the focus of the key relationship in a young man's life that of his relationship with his father was excellently portrayed in this movie the greatest game ever played the movie captured the essence of how important it is for a father to <UNK> his son and let him know that he has what it takes to follow his dream br br it didn't matter that economic and social class <UNK> presented obstacles to be overcome by both father and son it also didn't matter that others were the son in <UNK> celebration what <UNK> the most was that he saw his father's hand and then his face of <UNK> the real life challenge for both father and son had been met br br considering that in real life the hero of the story kept his amateur status and became a businessman pretty much <UNK> that all that went before the match was the training ground for a valid father and son relationship
<START> thomas de <UNK> is yet another road movie without the most important element of a film a good story the characters are not very original and not particularly interesting especially thomas bo <UNK> is a pain in the neck playing the same role he has played in the past few years and which he repeated in it seems as if he thinks acting being angry and screaming at other people the film doesn't make much too sense and isn't very funny either although it tries hard to be <UNK> and weird if you're going to make a road movie why not add something original to the genre
<START> sammi <UNK> andy <UNK> are coupled yet again in their 3rd film yesterday once more directed by <UNK> <UNK> to fans of <UNK> action films will be disappointed to find not a single gun was used in the filming furthermore fans of <UNK> <UNK> previous films needing you love on a <UNK> will also be disappointed to find that yesterday is no where near as funny or endearing br br mr mrs to <UNK> <UNK> are a divorced couple both <UNK> hk citizens both incredibly mischievous both just happened to be professional thieves <UNK> birds of the same a couple years earlier they divorced over an inability to find middle ground on splitting the <UNK> now she's <UNK> to the son of a rich <UNK> a total <UNK> boy carl <UNK> through through the soon to be mother in law jenny woo is suspicious of mrs <UNK> past thinks she's only marrying her son for the family <UNK> the <UNK> priceless ruby <UNK> br br the <UNK> is stolen is it mrs <UNK> <UNK> eye that gets the best of her or is it her ex husband mr <UNK> way of <UNK> the marriage to steal the <UNK> for himself br br this is not a movie about two falling in love or <UNK> a love its about two who have always been in love but have somehow been to foolish to realize it they let pride greed <UNK> them br br overall yesterday is one part caper heist film one part homage to classic hollywood <UNK> from its golden years i e cary grant grace kelly's to catch a thief <UNK> to is riding too heavily on <UNK> <UNK> chemistry from their previous films hoping <UNK> <UNK> immense popularity fan base will be enough justification for this third film i think sammi <UNK> is one of the most likable charming <UNK> working <UNK> is definitely the tom cruise of asian cinema br br i really enjoyed their first two films consider the <UNK> <UNK> pairing comparable to those classic hollywood couples of the 40's 50's but yesterday falls very short of expectations terrible writing ridiculous situations product <UNK> <UNK> all the subplots supporting characters were unnecessary come to think of it this film was unnecessary unless you just love celebrity watching
<START> as joe bob <UNK> would say this movie relies a lot on the <UNK> talents rather than their talent this early 1990's show the babes in <UNK> fest has very little to redeem it other than showing beautiful women nearly naked joe <UNK> martin <UNK> little brother proves once again that his movie career will be nowhere near what his brother's career is br br avoid this one unless you like watching beautiful women in skimpy clothing it's about the only thing that <UNK> it
<START> this french film is supposedly about a creepy dim witted cop who <UNK> the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town however the film is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing if it takes a character ten minutes to walk from point a to point b the film spends ten minutes showing this walk and these are the action scenes there are also static shots that last for minutes making the viewer wonder if he accidentally hit the pause button on the remote the script has enough material for a 20 minute movie the movie lasts seven hours or so you do the <UNK> the actors were apparently amateurs and it shows note to self never see a <UNK> movie again
<START> i saw this movie many years ago and it has never left my list of all time best films ever made when i first watched it i was just beginning what has become a life long passion for justice it gave an interesting perspective of the death penalty and also gave me a few things to think about br br when you have a cast like this one you are right to assume it is going to be nothing short of fabulous this is by far the best role i have ever seen sean penn play along with i am sam he nails the role doesn't his actions while doing so he manages to maintain a level of <UNK> throughout the movie that i think was very important up until the very end he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is he is a sick man who regrets his past but still makes excuses for it he ends up able to redeem his sense of self worth as much as a convicted and guilty murderer can through the aid of susan <UNK> character sister helen her character taught me about good will towards others without making me forget how horrible a person's actions can be and without making excuses for them br br the supporting cast was also top notch i was surprised to see a small cameo of jack black in this film given the funny man he has become today i loved this movie for both personal reasons and just because it was a work of cinematic art and in my opinion this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie far out did the book
<START> feels like an <UNK> film if there is such a thing br br the story is well told very poetic the characters well developed and well acted by the <UNK> or interpreted by the actors br br the film <UNK> in its own <UNK> emotions at times and works well unless you hate such emotion in movies not so in my case br br it's a very <UNK> film br br the landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the <UNK> cook are very poetic in their own right br br well done br br a good classic for any good film collection
<START> in the tradition of neo film noir flicks like <UNK> this film focuses on a crime mystery in a bleak realm with a bit of character insight <UNK> in the typical noir characters <UNK> including the cop out to prove himself a damsel in distress and a bad bad guy <UNK> machine gets a 9 out of 10 for its cinematography first plus its direction story strong character acting and superb jazz score available on dvd though the soundtrack itself is out of print but available used on some <UNK> sites filmed on location in beautiful downtown <UNK> novelist <UNK> hometown and the <UNK> circa 1979 look of the city would make an old time <UNK> citizen or visitor long for the old days before 12 lane the city a <UNK> dream at that time this was rachel <UNK> first usa feature film
<START> sweet young nurse charlotte <UNK> a charming performance by ravishing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by dr <UNK> s masters the excellent <UNK> among the <UNK> assortment of <UNK> crazed patients are <UNK> aggressive <UNK> <UNK> king the <UNK> betty chandler <UNK> judge oliver w cameron a <UNK> hammy gene ross paranoid vietnam veteran sergeant nicely played by hugh gentle giant sam the <UNK> william bill and nutty old <UNK> mrs the <UNK> irritating <UNK> <UNK> said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by dr masters which of course results in a <UNK> of brutal killings director s f working from a clever and suitably overwrought script by tim <UNK> does an expert job of creating and <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and brooding atmosphere of <UNK> madness and oppressive <UNK> robert spooky score the <UNK> set design a few wild grisly murders bruce b <UNK> no <UNK> cinematography plenty of deliciously <UNK> scenery <UNK> <UNK> from a game no name cast ross in particular is a total eye rolling hoot and the genuinely shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further add to the overall <UNK> seedy fun of this choice trashy <UNK> of 70's low budget <UNK> horror exploitation cinema
<START> if you're looking for a typical war movie this is not it so a note to all the <UNK> <UNK> carnage <UNK> war buffs out there don't bother although the film is about russian characters in wwii don't expect to see any nazis <UNK> blood gore etc it's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war it's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it br br acting cinematography writing all perfect <UNK> here you'll certainly appreciate it if you're russian like me but even if not you'll probably love it if you speak no russian look for the <UNK> russian cinema <UNK> dvd version it's got subtitles in about 14 different languages but the english dubbing on this one i'd say is just as good it's of course not as good as the original russian track some stuff is lost in translation but just as good as the english subtitles so go check it out especially if you're studying film in any aspect
<START> shaky hand held cameras this piece was shot for television mind you not film not only keep you utterly conscious of how horrible the cinematography is in this film but make you absolutely unable to become immersed in the story poor miss austen must be rolling in her grave all i can say is if you enjoyed the novel stop there until the bbc creates one of their smart sensible period masterpieces like pride prejudice with colin <UNK> which speaking for what i imagine in my opinion austen would have <UNK> the bbc would never dare <UNK> cheesy <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> girl over a shot of an historic castle and a loving embrace foster seemed to be often confused that they were editing the music to the <UNK> if you want austen as you love her look for the bbc <UNK>
<START> as a writer and a <UNK> <UNK> jewish woman i was let down tremendously by this movie the dialogue is hackneyed and <UNK> the characters too engaged with lines ranging from the <UNK> <UNK> to the stunningly melodramatic aren't allowed to expand into genuinely <UNK> individuals the one trick musical score tries to make up for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into the silence to jar the viewer and the script out of <UNK> <UNK> br br like an adolescent revolutionary on a self righteous <UNK> this film is blown away by the wisdom of its revelation <UNK> is wrong and thoroughly <UNK> its <UNK> <UNK> on this point the <UNK> artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development the moral crime is the <UNK> of human beings to caricatures <UNK> and <UNK>

<START> james stewart plays johnny mason lawyer carole lombard is jane mason wife <UNK> watson the mother in law harriet mason johnny sees jane and quickly marries her mother is disappointed mother lives with them many troubles are ahead jane can't cook can't set the table can't do many things according to mother the interaction between daughter in law and mother are the highlights of this film stewart and lombard are married but just don't have any real magic on screen stewart is stewart he is good as a <UNK> husband and son but this doesn't carry the film can baby mason build bridges between jane and harriet a believable film for those that are married
<START> this movie was like a gathering of people that had been in other movies and they decided to make a really bad movie it had a dude from detroit rock city a girl from the <UNK> show that <UNK> that <UNK> the chick and bought that <UNK> was in <UNK> boys and there was more ok that doesn't make a bad movie in itself that was just something i noticed the whole thing with the hooker and the french girl having the same name was dumb and the thing with <UNK> people writing these notes and if you think they are going to get mixed up shocking enough you called it and the purse thing that was just plain stupid it was so bad that i watched the movie in two parts and still only made it to the 50 minute mark if you are watching this and expect van wilder or a movie like that don't
<START> <UNK> visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation but adam low the director of this thing allows the stronger voice to be <UNK> how can it be what a missed opportunity we come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the master great and more about the things one shouldn't care at all the beautiful images belong to <UNK> world the embarrassing interviews to the likes of <UNK> and <UNK> to adam tiny little world a must to avoid
<START> this is an astonishing film a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and <UNK> <UNK> plot brilliantly by the use of recurring visual <UNK> everything in it is beautifully filmed the women the apartments but more amazing is the devastating <UNK> of images almost every scene has echoes of another this is a story told in light in colour in many almost parallels every time i watch it it fills me with delight br br the acting is great too is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown everything about her changes with her mood vincent <UNK> plays a very different role to his part in la <UNK> but no less excellently <UNK> and sympathetic at the same time and monica <UNK> ah monica <UNK> well put simply she plays is the world's most perfect woman there's one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile yet in that instant says more than hours of hollywood junk br br one cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb <UNK> climax sad shocking ironic and subtle in turn but if one moment captures the brilliance of this work it's the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement the <UNK> of which has been <UNK> laid before us throughout the entire story yet when the moment comes it is handled so <UNK> so briefly so <UNK> that on reflection it makes you gasp only a director of <UNK> confidence would dare to this vital point but the confidence is justified cinema doesn't come much better than this
<START> savage steve holland wrote and directed his second film one crazy summer with john cusack and curtis armstrong again in a supporting role cusack and <UNK> <UNK> are recent <UNK> headed to cape <UNK> in order to stay at <UNK> <UNK> for the summer along the way they <UNK> into <UNK> moore being pursued by john and a motorcycle gang soon the three are united in trying to save a house from being turned into another <UNK> restaurant by a conniving spoiled family that considers work a dirty word the film contains several funny vignettes like the millionaire dollar radio contest gags and the godzilla skit br br like <UNK> first film better off dead john cusack adds <UNK> to the film otherwise this is a dud of a film filled with contrived situations and idiotic characters as opposed to quirky moore even sings a few bars in a nightclub with some horrible <UNK> <UNK> gags wear thin after awhile and armstrong never was an actor of any caliber to appear in anything except grade z stuff the <UNK> truck twins are extremely annoying and obnoxious instead of the endearing <UNK> they're obviously meant to be this is more of a hit or miss kitchen sink comedy which could have used a better script and direction 1 2 of 4 stars
<START> i think this movie was made backwards first they shoot a whole lot of scenes and action and explosions and then the story writers got to work trying to find a story to tie all scenes up together this movie is without any doubt the worst movie i have ever seen your average porn movie comes with a much better written and much more coherent script the movie makes no sense seriously even if you are a segal fan there's no reason you should ever want to see this movie except if you're one of those folks that like to stare at <UNK> because this is a horrible accident and should never have been released upon this world br br <UNK>
<START> overall i found this film good exceptional acting with disturbing scenes some essential some useless and weak second half contains spoilers the film is divided in 2 parts i thought the first half of the <UNK> was terrific we meet erika <UNK> wonderful isabelle <UNK> a piano teacher and get introduced to her world she is single struggling to find her space against an over protective and borderline mother we understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physical emotional chemistry she <UNK> herself by being sharp and offensive to people releases her sexual tensions in sex <UNK> as a <UNK> or in sadistic self <UNK> this first half is very <UNK> and builds an incredible tension in the film almost unbearable br br then comes walter a young handsome and <UNK> man played superbly by benoit though he gets to feel <UNK> <UNK> in the beginning he <UNK> her and slowly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he loves her deeply but she needs him to <UNK> her sadistic desires then when she is about to fall for him he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that erika is unable to love or feel at all especially since walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love this is the second half of the film very touching as we see <UNK> inability <UNK> to love lead her to self destruction this second half seemed less <UNK> by <UNK> and sometimes had non credible ie too shocking scenes which <UNK> <UNK> the drama br br of course this is a crude film at least in the french version you see porn sequences from the sex shop daring <UNK> and sex scenes the much talked about <UNK> scene between and <UNK> was quite good i thought and is central to understand <UNK> sick relation to love as to the actors <UNK> is marvelous all through the film gets better and better up to perfection and <UNK> the mother is excellent br br
<START> another stinker from the <UNK> entertainment group and thankfully one of their last br br is effectively a very low budgeted remake of 'the <UNK> i don't mind low budget b movies as long as some effort is put into them there is no effort whatsoever in is stars who is an absolutely terrible actor seriously he has all the acting abilities of a porn star but he turns out to be the best actor here and that's saying something the rest are just a bunch of no <UNK> given the boot from various daytime <UNK> the special fx are just rubbish shots showing the burning building from the ground are among the worst i've ever seen the fire looks like someone <UNK> an orange pen at the front of the camera on top of that there is not one character you actually root for you hate everyone and hope they all die well before the 90 minutes are up br br the script is embarrassing the red are <UNK> well in advance someone else has mentioned this but 'the scene where the janitor fights off a blazing fire the building with his <UNK> hilarious or same janitor going into a room marked <UNK> were these scenes supposed to be tongue in cheek somehow i doubt it br br the one good point and only one good point was there was a fair bit of action in amongst the daytime soap <UNK> which kept my attention but so little care was given to everything in the film i can't recommend it watch 'the <UNK> instead br br 3 10
<START> this movie was so frustrating to watch the split screens don't allow you to get very involved in the emotions of the actors i was constantly going back and forth watching all these tiny images that i found myself with by the end this is basically a rip off of the talented mr <UNK> and <UNK> i was very let down with this film makers attempt to be cool i wish i had walked out like so many other people did
<START> little gus is a ten year old <UNK> he runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road trip reaching the <UNK> is somewhat tough for him so he creates a device to help him his goal is to win a <UNK> <UNK> type card game called he has to find all eight letters in order to spell m o t o r a m a dark laughter follows as it turns into the road trip from hell he runs into some deranged lynch like characters most memorable is the gas station attendant who puts his picture on a <UNK> in hopes that god will see it later gus gets a <UNK> and an eye <UNK> for his injured eye he becomes one of the most rebellious bad ass 10 year olds you may ever witness on screen this is no kid's flick look for cameos by jack <UNK> flea and drew <UNK> be warned although drew is on the front cover she only appears in the film in a dream sequence for a couple seconds also the film gets confusing towards the end reaching david lynch territory you may want to watch it a couple times was written by joseph <UNK> most well known for his screenplays for after hours and <UNK> kiss so enjoy this <UNK> surreal road trip of fun
<START> first let me start by saying that i am a laurel and hardy buff i have read every book <UNK> about them and have seen all of their available films more than once i even took a chance once and called stan on the <UNK> he was very kind and spoke with me for over ten minutes i followed with a letter and he wrote me a letter back i still have that letter br br this film has some fine comedy moments but stan and ollie are not up to their usual form stan was <UNK> ill during the production and looked worse than he did ten years later in my opinion any laurel and hardy film is worth seeing br br but the ultimate opinion of this film comes from the great stan laurel himself to quote him this film should never have been made
<START> when the movie the cure starts we find out about a young man named <UNK> brad <UNK> is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother and living next door to him is a young boy named <UNK> joseph one day <UNK> and <UNK> connect and head up to the supermarket where <UNK> gets his first taste of when <UNK> learns out that <UNK> has aids he tries leaves and water tea to make it better but when the front cover of the national <UNK> says a new orleans doctor has found the cure for aids the two boys will stop at nothing to get to new orleans for the cure br br in my opinion the cure is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made it shows <UNK> love between a boy his new best friend and his best friend's mom everything is so well done nothing needs to be changed not only do i give this a 10 10 for being a fantastic friendship movie but it also is a sad but humorous and fun aids movie and the tragic finale with <UNK> of aids is enough to make me shed a tear very well done
<START> i found this to be a tremendously disappointing version of a charming story i thought the acting was on the whole quite good <UNK> owen did chew the scenery as mentioned by others but i found him moderately amusing in his brief scenes tcm has made an ann <UNK> fan of me and i thought she was fine as usual here jessie ralph had a field day as the old <UNK> everybody around and frank morgan as always played frank morgan with a <UNK> br br for me the problem was the script and or the editing transitions were awkward motivations were murky the movie was just too <UNK> short to convey the story properly i felt completely let down particularly since i had such fond memories of the later version
<START> only in the hollywood <UNK> fiction world could anybody including fbi agents be so unbelievably stupid the good guys are stupid enough to pick up everything they're interested in answer phones go up all in search for a <UNK> expert who's out to get everybody oh yes and then we get the hollywood <UNK> he can be shot even if he's got a <UNK> on and then fall down a long flight of steps and then still have the upper hand over his stupid <UNK> every clich√© you can think of in suspense movies were used i only watched it because <UNK> is so hot oh but yes it's great to see how morally superior this fbi agent is when she's pretty certain that there's a bomb in an opera house and she doesn't sound the alarm who writes these scripts
<START> possible spoiler madonna plays an ex con that needs to recover some valuable information that might clear her from the murder that she was put in prison for four years ago <UNK> dunne is a tax attorney who's marrying his <UNK> daughter together the two of them are supposed to come together in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus br br when you get down to it this is a stupid movie without trying to give away the plot possible spoiler the bad guys in the movie are trying to protect their boss by <UNK> the information that would <UNK> them for the murder that madonna was sent up for what kind of bad guys don't commit murder by trying to hide the original murder br br then there's the cops who are <UNK> madonna who follow the bad guys in a <UNK> where they have the brides <UNK> all tied up and let's not forget those same brides <UNK> who fought from the front gate to the front door still all tied together and i hate to say this but that <UNK> sure looks like a <UNK> there might be only four of them in the new york city area so they might be <UNK> there but i know there's plenty of them in the rocky mountains see charlie the <UNK> <UNK> if you really want to see a large cat in the movie and let's look at the old man who falls asleep on his feet <UNK> br br the plot is there but that's all there is to this movie i was barely out of my teens when this movie originally came out and i was some what of a fan of madonna but that was the only reason i liked the movie but since then she's fell out of popularity with me and i've faced the fact that she is just a terrible actress good thing she's got that singing career to fall back on it rated maybe a 5 back then but it's fallen to barely making a 2 over the years
<START> four friends was first billed on hbo in <UNK> as a sleeper hit having heard the term <UNK> when 14 back then i was anxious to see one boy was i surprised that film i hadn't really fallen in love with a non special effects film outside of treasure of the <UNK> <UNK> much less a <UNK> <UNK> but having had grown up with a couple of hippies i understood the power behind mr <UNK> film four friends is definitely one of a kind the script is so <UNK> and that cast craig <UNK> <UNK> so well he just <UNK> the <UNK> to a <UNK> both smart and clumsy the scene at the window and strong yet so very vulnerable for me he captures what it's like to be so taken with that it lasts over a decade and i have always found <UNK> in the character and in the film throughout the 80's four friends was a partner in crime to me and i caught the movie whenever i could on hbo even if i had to stay up until and still always at the end there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters part from the viewers on the beach <UNK> <UNK> that girl to the <UNK> it is so hard not to be <UNK> by her this movie really stands the test of time every once and a while i check out my video of it or show a friend and it still gets a solid reaction i've known women who absolutely fall in love with georgia so many levels just an incredible little 60's piece of humanity very special very magical i recently found the <UNK> of four friends by robert and it's even more detailed that the movie actual dates of events etc a real find and what's more haha i found the novel while <UNK> around in a used book store in <UNK> <UNK> of all places guess you have to have an eye for her when i was in l a in <UNK> working as an extra i went into a <UNK> shop and there were a ton of stills from the film unfortunately i was broke and couldn't <UNK> but boy those photos of georgia and the guys all together just went right through me i met director joe on the set of in <UNK> in summer of <UNK> and we spoke about four friends very cool also working at a video store in <UNK> in 98 waited on a female who was a relative of jim <UNK> told her to pass the word on that there was some kid in <UNK> who was just <UNK> about the film and had gotten the <UNK> out of it once again the movie captures everything that's in character's heart great great work one of and <UNK> finest efforts steve is sorely missed an incredible writer <UNK> br br c
<START> live action version of <UNK> via <UNK> br br evil lord comes to earth to get the seven magic dragon balls er <UNK> which when brought together will cause a dragon to appear and grant your wish lots of action and bad comedy ensue br br what can i say that the best way to watch this film is with lots of drunk but witty friends doesn't i don't know this is a really bad but funny in the way that really bad movies can be come on this is one of the few martial arts films i've ever seen where you actually see the <UNK> its a live action cartoon and not so far removed from what i've seen of the show that it makes me <UNK> for the big budget american version now filming br br if you have some drunk friends and feel like picking on a movie see this film if you're going to see it sober like me avoid it
<START> big fat <UNK> <UNK> played by john eats a lot of candy visits the sane members of his family for a week in order to baby sit two cute kids <UNK> hoffman and culkin and a pretty but <UNK> teenager jean <UNK> kelly the <UNK> begin when buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed two <UNK> too small for his <UNK> of a body br br mostly dull but <UNK> with two or three funny scenes including buck trying to get a word in edge wise on the <UNK> with his angry girlfriend amy <UNK> and his meeting with a very disgusting clown br br candy looks like he <UNK> <UNK> pounds
<START> this film with only two characters takes you closer to these two people the <UNK> and the prisoner than most films take you to any character however well crafted br br the sheer confusion terror and pain which madeleine <UNK> character <UNK> is deeply disturbing as is alan sadistic yet charming <UNK> br br this film is all too possible and builds to a shocking climax the effect of the film as a whole leaving you sitting in silence at the end it'll haunt you for a long time
<START> is it just me or are most of the actors in this adaptation miscast age wise br br redgrave although a superior actress seems as if she should be joining her children instead of <UNK> off on the couch i would have loved to see brenda in the part her connection to the latest pride and prejudice notwithstanding br br blake and <UNK> kinnear were the only two whom i felt lived up to their characters in spirit and performance every else looked confused or out of place br br luckily i'm not very familiar with dr who i've only seen a few episodes so far or it would have definitely <UNK> this further br br too bad <UNK> park has not yet seen its due on screen either large or small this novel requires the talent of a robert altman to balance all the <UNK> of the characters successfully
<START> words cannot express how poor this film is br br there is no plot the acting is appalling basically the whole film is a joke br br with a running time of <UNK> minutes it's about <UNK> minutes too long br br it might have been ok as a short sketch on a comedy show but the premise is way too flimsy to work for that amount of time without boredom kicking in br br avoid this one go rent a good movie instead
<START> if it wasn't meant to be a comedy the filmmakers sure <UNK> if they intended for it to be a comedy they hit the mark our critic says <UNK> is a wonderful film filled with family values and community spirit <UNK> it for all audiences and says that he really liked jamie lee <UNK> performance it deserves a theatrical re release
<START> the <UNK> was one of the few early eastwood films i hadn't seen until i gave the dvd a spin today and from it's opening <UNK> <UNK> shot to the macabre climax i was utterly enthralled too many film makers these days substitute special effects fast editing and <UNK> camera work in place of character driven stories but director don <UNK> knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot and the characters are believable and compelling br br the story concerns a ladies finishing school which happens to be <UNK> on the edge of various <UNK> during the american civil war the south supporting ladies find a badly wounded union soldier clint eastwood <UNK> him back to health he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own ends br br <UNK> page is excellent in the role of the <UNK> with a secret and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed for a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest there's even a chance that the normal status <UNK> long abandoned when eastwood's <UNK> are <UNK> could return but the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> upon a darker road br br this is a totally different style of film from the same director's dirty harry made in the same year and yet they are both equally superb eastwood is great playing against his usual stoic anti hero image yet there's also some mysterious quality attached to his character we never really learn much about him prior to his <UNK> and the viewer is free to decide upon his well <UNK> persona villain or victim whatever you think all i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> i am a big fan of works i believe that he was amid the greatest 20th century <UNK> the film itself does a great justice to the <UNK> of <UNK> wonderfully portrayed by all the players in their roles <UNK> does do a service to the sexually repressed <UNK> he avoids an impression and <UNK> from becoming a caricature the use of his poetry was the highlight of the piece itself rather than acting out the massive intensity with which <UNK> felt the use of his words themselves give a better insight into plot and add a much more <UNK> but altogether more fascinating atmosphere most enjoyable
<START> if you've been looking for a film where a out of control <UNK> gets <UNK> to a <UNK> by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than paramount latest release <UNK> snake not exactly looking for what i just described you say well then you best get ya wits <UNK> and on down to your local theater and still see it as samuel l jackson's character <UNK> would say as long as you're open minded and don't take everything seriously there's no reason you won't leave the theater glad you saw it br br in the third offering from director craig <UNK> we are taken into the deep south where as the <UNK> to the film claims everything is <UNK> while there we're introduced to the <UNK> as previously said played by jackson and the almost always half naked <UNK> a role <UNK> taken on by christina <UNK> in the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what we are all human no one is perfect and if everyone would realize that then we'd be a lot better off the question of if this will be understood or be accepted by all who see the film is another story br br one thing not up for debate is how great jackson and <UNK> both are here you'd think with the role of a sex crazed woman overacting would be a given but no not here <UNK> breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also <UNK> as her best to date then we have jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is sadly the third star of the film justin timberlake who plays military bound boyfriend isn't all that great at the start he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard later on he steps it up some still he's far from the level he reached in <UNK> <UNK> br br the other thing <UNK> snake boasts is a splendid soundtrack containing tracks from the black keys john <UNK> pieces from the score done by scott of course four count 'em four tracks from jackson himself it's actually one of his songs the main performance of the film that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection it alone is worth the ticket price other notable musical <UNK> from the soundtrack are 'the <UNK> the lights go <UNK> from the black keys the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where <UNK> sings to <UNK> on a <UNK> night br br the efforts of craig <UNK> can't go without mention though his last film which ended up <UNK> low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map what he has done with <UNK> snake will be what sets him apart from other <UNK> to the industry he not only directed but also wrote its screenplay the end result is a story that is surprising and clever as you watch you feel like you know exactly where it's headed despite its <UNK> <UNK> just as you think you've predicted the next move <UNK> shifts <UNK> and takes an entirely different route there are however some within the screenplay the background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing it left me <UNK> for something more exciting after so many <UNK> i guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the film br br i imagine the majority of people who see <UNK> snake won't enjoy it due to the fact they won't be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are the depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received it's the issues of race religious motives sexuality the film <UNK> that will have more effect on opinion than anything the idea of a black man <UNK> a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it simply put it's not for everyone like i said to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind or else you're just wasting your money for those of you who can do that i highly recommend it
<START> i guess this is the first time i have seen a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> movie i really liked him in his title role as a butcher boy the way he moves is very funny in my opinion for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette i think he is a good actor his facial expressions really suit the role he plays for example how he <UNK> at the audience in the end but one might add that that was probably not too difficult anyway i think he would have deserved a longer career as you probably know it was ruined by greedy <UNK> who made money by <UNK> false <UNK> that said he was involved in a scandal br br the plot is not very important in the first half <UNK> and <UNK> are employees at a store and rivals for affection after a heavy food fight is sent to a girls' school by her father the store owner this is the beginning of the second half both <UNK> and <UNK> enter the school in drag and the fight for continues some of the characters' names are different in the version that i have seen it seems that for some reason they replaced the original title cards with new ones br br there are a lot of corny gags like food fights and <UNK> but they are done well in my opinion and there are some gags i really liked for example how they make the dog run the pepper mill or is it a coffee mill or the scene when <UNK> <UNK> a coat although it is obviously not necessary or when miss the head of the girls' school <UNK> and he her back br br buster keaton is also funny in this his first movie a good addition to the cast in the first half he is a <UNK> at the store in the second half he supports <UNK> in his fight for i liked his <UNK> for example when <UNK> pushes him from one room of the school to another he doesn't show a simple <UNK> but lands on his hands and his head and does a little <UNK> watch out for one scene in the food fight <UNK> throws a <UNK> bag at him but it misses and hits the store owner instead that makes buster laugh which must be a <UNK> since he normally always shows a neutral expression which as you probably also know already got him the <UNK> 'the great stone <UNK> one more note al st john who plays <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> nephew and later became famous for the role of that he played in lots of westerns br br i don't like this one as much as i like for example <UNK> <UNK> and 'the films that buster made later without <UNK> and it didn't make me laugh out loud often but it made me smile a lot so i have given it eight points
<START> this is a decent movie although little bit short in time for me it packs a lot of action <UNK> <UNK> and emotions in that time frame matt dillon and the other main character does a great job in this movie the emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie it is not typical fancy expensive hollywood cgi action movie but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price my evening was great because of this movie this movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting story and directing i would recommend this movie the character development of the characters were good and makes you believe that were are actually seeing a real event taking place because this movie i believe was made with cheaper budget the acting and quality were much higher
<START> this formulaic film hero's girlfriend marries the villain just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story scott seems too old in this one and too many times his character turns away from <UNK> action the scenes he responds to the deaths of some of his hands <UNK> he escapes from gang by hiding in a full rain barrel his escape to the high country and pursuit by john russell seem superfluous as does much of the film the plot could have been <UNK> br br high points of the film seeing <UNK> ernie ford without a mustache singing man in the <UNK> <UNK> too brief scenes as a cook the color photography of the high country and the fight scene there with john russell
<START> i had high hopes for this one until they changed the name to 'the shepherd border <UNK> the <UNK> movie name ever what was wrong with just 'the this is a by the numbers action flick that <UNK> its hat at many classic van damme films there is a nice bit of action in a bar which reminded me of hard target and universal soldier but directed with no intensity or flair which is a shame there is one great line about <UNK> p ss drunk and carrying a <UNK> and some ok action scenes let down by the <UNK> of it all a lot of the times the dialogue doesn't match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot the end fight is one of the better van damme fights except the director tries to go a bit too john woo and fails also introducing flashbacks which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van damme film br br not good not bad just average generic action
<START> i've described this film as surprising this is true in many respects the subject material black man wrongly accused the characters people you expect to be stereotypes often show <UNK> attitudes during the film the production br br all of these factors make for a <UNK> unusual film especially for its time 1949 the only possible spoilers being the sometimes cheesy dialogue and occasional high moral stance br br but if you happen across it when you weren't planning to watch a film you might find yourself like me staying up into the middle of the night just to see what happens br br
<START> a truly scary film happening across <UNK> james <UNK> led me to recently formed web <UNK> like life after the oil crash energy <UNK> and the oil drum and the data behind the theory of peak like this film and paint a grim picture of die off or die back i hope they're <UNK> but in mid 2005 rising <UNK> <UNK> rising oil <UNK> will you join us campaign <UNK> becoming beyond <UNK> and even t <UNK> <UNK> lend <UNK> to the idea that we are at or near a peak of oil production br br after <UNK> research of limited data oil investment <UNK> matt simmons has suggested that the may no longer be able to increase production in their immense but aging fields in the face of <UNK> demand primarily from the us and china the have not <UNK> with higher production despite previous <UNK> stated world production from 2000 and 2004 <UNK> that light sweet crude has indeed <UNK> which means that will become more <UNK> br br the film seems aimed at baby <UNK> but younger people our children also need to understand the <UNK> of an energy <UNK> future
<START> this series takes a classic story and makes rubbish of it robin is somehow <UNK> by an <UNK> man in the forest and is <UNK> in all sorts of and outright satanic episodes the story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor this is barely watchable and to top all the <UNK> they kill robin at the end of series 2 and replace him with another actor some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is not a robin hood show if you want robin fighting in king richards name against prince john and the sheriff and if you want robin feeding the poor and <UNK> watch the classic series or the <UNK> from the bbc

<START> of course really experienced reviewers who like stuff like star wars and professional crap will definitely drag this movie and say really bad comments about it but really it is enjoyable teen comedy with an awesome story and good acting br br <UNK> <UNK> played well by drew barrymore is part of a news <UNK> team and she has been offered a <UNK> job she has to go back to school and find out what teens are like these days well this goes alright until <UNK> remembers her horrible time at high school and gets freaked out but she's never been hip never been cool never been popular until now br br sit back relax and enjoy with never been <UNK> br br
<START> most critics seem to have <UNK> this film like so many other charles bronson vehicles as just another <UNK> of mindless violence and while there is a fair amount of mayhem death wish 3 is not that awful of an effort particularly for fans of the series and its star br br this time out aging charlie's paul is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of new york city the trigger happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory where he once again becomes a one man army in an urban war of good versus evil bronson at least the older version is truly at his best br br i'm not saying death wish 3 is a classic indeed to the <UNK> eye it has a <UNK> of <UNK> the characters are generally made of cardboard the violence is over the top a man well into his 60s <UNK> and dozens of young <UNK> but in the tradition of the original death wish and later films such as falling down with michael douglas it has a definite crowd pleasing charm who doesn't want to see <UNK> get their due there are also some great cheesy moments and one liners so common in 1980s films when a tenant of his apartment building sees setting up a <UNK> trap for instance the vigilante <UNK> says he's <UNK> the herd a line only bronson can truly make work br br so you see the key to enjoying death wish 3 is to accept it for what it is it ain't spielberg and it ain't art so throw the popcorn in the <UNK> and have fun with it
<START> many times the description full of sound and fury <UNK> nothing is used and is right on target unfortunately code <UNK> lacks both sound and fury a bit of fury would have been greatly appreciated tim robbins character william is so lacking in passion that the idea of his falling instantly in love with maria samantha <UNK> seems almost absurd these folks are so <UNK> that one begins to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world has been <UNK> with <UNK> there is a brave new world sort of atmosphere to the film that is helped along by every scene being shot about 2 3 stops <UNK> unfortunately this technique gets tedious and rather hard on the eyes the <UNK> <UNK> of languages also grows tedious when there seems to be no apparent reason for its existence many futuristic scifi films are criticized for being all flash and no substance this film has neither flash nor substance its a code 6 all the way
<START> the title pretty much lets you know what you're getting it's a grade c <UNK> but not as blatantly funny as i was hoping directed by exploitation film <UNK> eddie romero from a story that originally came from jonathan <UNK> long before directing silence of the <UNK> and philadelphia this low budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the <UNK> but set in some anonymous third world country playing hooker and small time drug dealer lee daniels <UNK> superstar pam <UNK> plays the first half of the title role while long forgotten margaret <UNK> is the other half karen brent an unlikely patty <UNK> like political revolutionary looking to partner with her <UNK> to <UNK> the oppressive local government naturally <UNK> toward each other they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini <UNK> as uniforms run by a <UNK> warden and <UNK> <UNK> the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half hearted cat fighting as lee and karen are <UNK> against each other of course they escape but <UNK> together a la the <UNK> ones and continue the cat fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their <UNK> br br meanwhile various groups of <UNK> men are in pursuit the <UNK> drug lord looking for lee who stole from him the rather passive <UNK> looking for karen and the incompetent police who suffer the <UNK> of exposing their <UNK> to the drug lord needless to say everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of <UNK> women a dog wears <UNK> <UNK> and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion one beer <UNK> revolutionary wears a leather <UNK> top with a straight face there is a rather sad ending but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise sadly <UNK> is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the <UNK> while <UNK> is an <UNK> blonde whom i am convinced is trying desperately to be credible since no one displays any talent for acting the rest of the cast is not worth noting except <UNK> bug eyed sid <UNK> who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord the 2003 dvd contains only the original trailer as an extra
<START> strikes me as routine as far as tv movies go i can believe that it's based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with storytelling skills br br for instance good old john ritter now a rather <UNK> and <UNK> villain <UNK> his wife enough to make her ill then <UNK> her of being <UNK> and leaves to marry another young woman immediately <UNK> years pass before the story picks up again why <UNK> years i would guess that though the narrative doesn't demand it history does br br some of the particular scenes however are so <UNK> apt that they were almost certainly <UNK> up by a writer <UNK> through her attic <UNK> first wife stumbles across an old <UNK> <UNK> and has one of those black and white flashbacks with <UNK> on the score suddenly she recalls when <UNK> years ago she discovered ritter <UNK> from a <UNK> carefully collecting them and putting them in her <UNK> and her liner or whatever it's called later it develops that he was putting it into her coffee as well br br frankly i don't believe it i don't believe either that she had that particular <UNK> in the attic or that ritter put into her <UNK> or <UNK> is referred to in the movie as a toxic metal and i suppose it is in sufficient <UNK> but it's also an anti that's sold over the counter in drug stores and <UNK> someone will have to demonstrate as no one does in this movie that it is a <UNK> poison many people have tried the <UNK> <UNK> and failed so how come some in her <UNK> gives immediate and <UNK> <UNK> and her eyes become as painful as <UNK> when she applies makeup i think the <UNK> e b called this simple minded idea sympathetic magic but i'm not sure br br <UNK> je anyway ritter evidently tries the same stunt with his second wife <UNK> years later although no evidence of <UNK> is ever produced when she becomes ill with the same <UNK> wife number two is taken to mexico and apparently <UNK> but suddenly drops dead shortly after her return <UNK> evidence <UNK> up against ritter who plays the villain with all the stops out when his first trial is <UNK> he <UNK> at who has <UNK> the investigation br br you see was good friends with <UNK> second wife and was terribly disturbed at her demise and its manner i'll bet and she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems <UNK> up for third place in <UNK> marital schedule sure the best performance is given by the guy who plays detective lawrence <UNK> everyone else acts by the numbers they project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a <UNK> crossing but <UNK> does little things that are original i'm told you want to report a murder long pause while he sits down and waits then abruptly <UNK> his face towards and <UNK> in a reasonable and curious voice so who was murdered i suppose except for the bare bones of the historical events nothing prevented characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life i mean what the heck ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and character is dead so who is to object i wish the <UNK> stuff had been made <UNK> ritter seems to have used so many <UNK> and toxic <UNK> let me see <UNK> a massive dose of and maybe something else that i was confused by it all not that i was rooting for ritter here's a <UNK> with a <UNK> d who insists people call him doctor he even <UNK> people who address him merely as professor most <UNK> d s get that <UNK> problem behind them very quickly call me <UNK> even though i know how to get a standard <UNK> and you don't average tv fare
<START> i'm sorry but i cannot even partly agree with some comments on this awful piece of sh br br english is not my native language because i'm a german citizen so please do not blame me for inappropriate <UNK> <UNK> or something <UNK> i cannot understand why this movie got such a high rating 6 3 are you kidding me this movie has completely no sense not even a seem of good acting br br when i looked at the comments on the da <UNK> code which has i think nearly the same rating i had to bang my head on the table because i watched 00 schneider directly after and oh my god there are worlds between them br br the majority of the posters in this board tears every hyped movie to pieces while rating this crime of movie making with a 6 3 and <UNK> as a genius of course he knows how to make money but i think the main aspect of your opinions is the fact that german isn't your native language and you just ignore or rather don't notice the bunch of crap which is said in the sentences ok i must confess that some scenes are funny but all in all a 6 3 is just too much for my
<START> this is one odd film it seems to be aimed at a younger audience but is filled with sexual <UNK> the whole premise is rather absurd not just the idea of some <UNK> heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far fetched but then again the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line br br the cast are good though meg foster plays a very butch mafia like leader with the handsome a j as the leader of the bullies <UNK> and rebecca are well cast as the young lovers though for a comic actress of her talent leigh <UNK> baker is <UNK> wasted in this film br br overall the film is unusual but i don't think that is enough to make up for the poor quality and bumbling execution the scenery is all rather dull and the special effects quite dismal sit this one out unless your in the mood
<START> lucille ball was a mighty power in television throughout the 1950s and 1960s but she still made an occasional film most notably the long long trailer and the facts of life although her television career remained strong as the 1970s began her movie career seemed to be <UNK> down but ball was determined to have one last big screen <UNK> and the project she selected was the 1966 musical <UNK> br br in many respects the role seemed <UNK> made based on the popular novel which gave rise to two different broadway plays <UNK> dennis is a wacky wildly <UNK> woman who <UNK> her <UNK> nephew patrick and leads him on a wild tour of life's possibilities <UNK> from one comic spree to another the music which featured such songs as open a new window and if he walked into my life today was among jerry <UNK> best work the supporting cast which included robert preston and <UNK> arthur was the best of the best expectations were high opening night <UNK> was tremendous the film was a disaster critics were <UNK> and audiences sat slack <UNK> br br no matter what hardcore lucy fans may say <UNK> is a fiasco so much so that it is hard to know where to start it is badly directed badly filmed badly performed and there lucille ball is at the center of it all unable to dance unable to sing and <UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> while incredibly bad choreography <UNK> around her but the disaster is hardly of her making alone the supporting cast <UNK> no better <UNK> arthur and jane recreate their stage roles of vera charles and <UNK> the former is <UNK> the latter is dismal robert preston manages to sing with a smile but he's pretty much on his own and clearly none too happy about it br br the dvd brings the film from the vhs pan and <UNK> release to widescreen but that only means there's more awfulness to see everybody loves lucy but only the least critical fan could love <UNK> <UNK> while i wouldn't say it's bad enough to make you want to <UNK> your eyes out you may wish you had not recommended br br <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> chuck <UNK> so called despite the fact that the road runner clearly says is the second of the exceptionally popular road runner series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor the historically important but <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> while it features several predictable gags also <UNK> on that initial cartoon with more ambitious longer sequences chief among these is a fantastic extended chase through an old mine in which we see the <UNK> and the road runner represented by two small lights there's also a very funny longer gag involving some rocket powered roller <UNK> also sees a great improvement in the representation of <UNK> e <UNK> not only does he look more handsome than his <UNK> prototype in <UNK> and <UNK> but he also draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of <UNK> pain although it's a little slow to get going too many lingering shots of <UNK> <UNK> the pace in some of the early gags once arrives at the mine <UNK> sequence it's clear that jones was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them there are better road runner cartoons than but there's a real feeling of triumph about this cartoon as if it were the <UNK> that there was a series to be <UNK> out of this scenario
<START> everything i can say is that it's one of the best documentary movies of the ocean ever seen it <UNK> immensely by professional filming scenery and idea what i've seen during those 50 minutes cannot be compared to any other visions of the blue planet
<START> i play final fantasy 7 and this movie is excellent like the game all fans of final fantasy will love this movie br br the music are fantastic and the history is good but the best of this movie is the visual effects are amazing the characters are equal to the game and that detail are good for the fans br br you don't need play the game to like this movie all the people can enjoy the film because the history is some different and is easy to understand i buy the dvd because is excellent is 100 <UNK> if you don't see this film what you waiting for believe me you will <UNK> like me
<START> i don't care if some people voted this movie to be bad if you want the truth this is a very good movie it has every thing a movie should have you really should get this one
<START> i won't lie i rented this film because it was an arty film with some possible explicit sex i got that scene and catherine <UNK> briefly shown breasts but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious european art films with lines like did i have a mother or father i don't know <UNK> usually delivered in long <UNK> br br if you are curious about the transition of art to porn might be an interesting look with use of the fast forward button i was still too slow
<START> a european musician and composer sets out to capture the musical diversity of <UNK> a lover of <UNK> with sound alexander of the german <UNK> band <UNK> the streets of <UNK> with his mobile recording studio and magic mike to <UNK> an inspired portrait of turkish music his voyage leads to the discovery of a broad spectrum ranging from modern electronic rock and hip hop to classical as he wanders through this seductive world alex <UNK> impressions and tracks by artists such as neo psychedelic band <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> expressions rock groups and maverick rocker answer to public enemy <UNK> performers <UNK> style <UNK> digital <UNK> renowned canadian folk singer <UNK> street performers <UNK> singer the elvis of and legendary <UNK> and
<START> this movie doesn't have any <UNK> at being great art which is good but it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting i think if i wrote it i could do without the drama surrounding the wife but it wasn't distracting enough to detract from the main story concerning <UNK> <UNK> character i think that all too often hollywood <UNK> an attempt at real quality writing to try and <UNK> more visual drama when with an adult themed movie such as this the emotional type of drama is all that's really needed and probably more believable too overall it's a very well done offering and well worth seeing
<START> not since bette <UNK> 1933 vehicle ex lady have i seen a film that was so much better than its star said it was most of the bum rap <UNK> k a k a <UNK> a k a robinson a k a <UNK> has got over the years has come from the horror stories stan laurel told of its production given that he suffered a stroke during filming looked like death <UNK> over through much of it from the opening two shot of them together you'd never guess that laurel survived hardy by eight years and was subsequently <UNK> with <UNK> once he <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> he restored himself to health one can understand why laurel didn't think this film was the most pleasant experience of his life yes it's flawed the <UNK> of the production shows through the dubbing is awful and laurel and hardy were too old to do the energetic slapstick of their greatest films but it's still genuinely funny and <UNK> story introduces elements of political satire sometimes <UNK> sometimes one would expect to see from more socially conscious comedians like chaplin or the marx brothers but never from laurel and hardy the film deserves credit for being different though its debt to the ealing <UNK> classic <UNK> to <UNK> made just a year earlier is pretty obvious and for <UNK> the laurel and hardy comedy into a rather edgy context completely different from anything they'd used before this isn't a great movie but it's certainly better than the eight dreary ones for fox and mgm they'd made in the early 1940's i suspect only the film's technical <UNK> kept it from <UNK> the cult following among anti establishment baby <UNK> youth the marx <UNK> duck soup acquired in the late 1960's early 1970's
<START> tracy and matt michelle and sebastian these are the two couples whose lives of addiction crime and <UNK> are brilliantly captured in this raw and honest hbo documentary they're in turns <UNK> charming repulsive astonishingly stupid and dedicated to the drugs and to each other they're also each very different matt is a working class boy who clearly <UNK> in his <UNK> whilst <UNK> school <UNK> tracy supports the couple with western union money from her father who makes a surprisingly sympathetic cameo towards the end of the film meanwhile widow michelle whose <UNK> died of an <UNK> earns her daily bread by posing as an <UNK> vice cop willing to cut her would be <UNK> a deal to avoid prison time and sad sack companion sebastian lives off the proceeds you'll be pulled into their stories and will wish the film went on for twice as long unlike most documentaries of this kind there's no <UNK> providing us with an update about their progress can matt and tracy really keep that brooklyn apartment will michelle go back to <UNK> for more <UNK> and can sebastian become any more pathetic as a result the film seems <UNK> but that may have been the point essential viewing as long as you aren't completely <UNK> to scenes of people shooting up
<START> like a great many twilight zone episodes one of my favorite parts of this one was the overt social commentary that <UNK> is making with the story as was the case with a recent episode the howling man i was reminded of my long standing suspicion that for example if jesus were to come to earth to bring his followers to heaven he would be immediately judged insane and probably thrown into an asylum our main character in this episode meets a similar problem when trying to convince the <UNK> americans that he is from the future and the president lincoln is about to be <UNK> the episode wrongly <UNK> that this means that some parts of the past can be changed while others can't but it's a fun time travelling romp nonetheless br br granted we don't know for a fact whether history could be changed by time travel because time travel has never been accomplished and sadly never will be but it seems logical to me that if you could physically place yourself in a time of the past you could physically prevent something from happening as long as you didn't <UNK> around like a lunatic yelling about <UNK> br br one of the consistently interesting things about time travel films and tv shows in my opinion is the method by which the time travel takes place there is really no method at all here our main character is having a conversation about time travel at a posh <UNK> club and then walks outside and into a <UNK> from the early 1960s to the mid <UNK> but no matter the twilight zone has thus far not struck me for its complex sets or high production values br br russell johnson plays the part of peter <UNK> the time <UNK> and upon discovering that he has been somehow transported back to the exact day of <UNK> assassination he manages to get himself thrown in prison but luckily for him john <UNK> booth for some reason just happened to be hanging out at the police station and <UNK> the frantic <UNK> desperately trying to describe the very assassination that booth was planning for that night br br booth <UNK> custody of <UNK> for some psychiatric <UNK> and the police officer sees nothing wrong with <UNK> custody to this guy he had a business card after all how bad could he be br br the show seems to suggest that you can change people's lives by slightly <UNK> events in the past through time travel and while i'm not willing to accept that time travel would include such limitations it's still a fun episode that really makes you think which is one of my favorite qualities of the good twilight zone shows
<START> what are the movies i mean what are movies made for shootings killings no they are made for life stories and this is what this movie does it presents how the life has changed between two ages the father and a son the father being in a need of a job and asking the son for help br br although there is another generation there are some characteristics which remain including the <UNK> for the family br br the main subject is in my opinion the love of the son to the father and vice versa br br the movie is consisted of only one dialog but that dialog is more than i could ever wanted this movie is a pure art once again after <UNK> delivers us another beautiful movie well done
<START> this film was strongly recommended by a friend and being a great fan of brando i ordered this film from <UNK> and eagerly waited for it to arrive i have seldom been so disappointed by a film brando was good as a german officer but the rest of the film was simply unbearable you never get to like or care for any of the characters except brando maybe the acting was ok story what story maybe that's the point it's war after all but i've seen far better war films lawrence of <UNK> apocalypse now even star wars it was so boring i kept checking my watch br br overall this is one of the worst films i have seen please don't waste your time and money on this may i also add that this is the first user comment i have written i just had to let my feelings about this film known br br by the way my all time favourites are casablanca the godfather 1 2 one flew over the <UNK> nest pulp fiction and <UNK> if you haven't seen them yet please spare the time to do so and <UNK> must be in widescreen 2 35 1
<START> where to begin i like the scary snow monster named jack frost the whole concept works well for me we thought he'd be back and he was changing the local to a <UNK> resort works seeing old friends and meeting new characters scott macdonald does a great job as jack frost you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance <UNK> jack frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first i do have one complaint the little <UNK> or the as i call them they looked like hand puppets i think they could have done a better job with the the mouth could have opened wider but the cgi was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again if you liked jack frost then you will like this sequel no questions or debate 9 big stars
<START> i saw this last week during bruce <UNK> book tour i thought it was amazing almost everything i would expect from a bruce campbell sci fi movie its campy and very funny ted <UNK> was also hilarious and extremely goofy the plot is wacky an american business man goes to <UNK> and is killed <UNK> <UNK> plays a mad scientist who saves brings bruce campbell back to life by <UNK> half of the brain of an ex <UNK> turned <UNK> bruce campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the <UNK> agent the movie has all the great bruce campbell slap stick and humor the movie is somewhat predictable i knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer however i didn't go to see this movie because i thought it would have an oscar winning script i went to see it because it was a bruce campbell sci fi movie and i was not disappointed in the least i highly recommend that you go see him on his book tour or wait and watch it on the sci fi channel next month although before the movie he said the sci fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it tv friendly if you are a fan of bruce i highly recommend it
<START> <UNK> june 9 6 broadway performance hall saturday june 11 1 broadway performance hall br br bless the independent filmmaker without them we'd see nothing but spielberg the <UNK> brothers and films based on old sitcoms they are the risk <UNK> they <UNK> the <UNK> of success and suffer the failures max and grace is most definitely a failure credit is deserved by michael for getting out there and making his first feature which he claims drove him to <UNK> he might be better off sticking to the stage if this film is any indication of what to expect in the future even though everyone warned me i went to see max and grace anyway hoping i might discover something they did not it starts off well enough a party for max in his <UNK> house shot in warm subdued light the camera floating into interesting angles as soon as we see max has hung himself an obvious rip off of harold and <UNK> the whole thing goes right in the tank how could he do this <UNK> in the middle of a birthday party for that matter how could two mentally ill and committed psychiatric patients decide to get married and do it with the <UNK> of all parties concerned in the q a after the film david suggested the entire story was the <UNK> dream of his character max this story is so badly written the comment sounded more like an excuse the film doesn't look as though it was made on a <UNK> all the more reason to be so disappointed with the results what's intended as funny isn't but instead is <UNK> bad the continuity is sloppy the lighting is dreadful and the effects look cheap and forced seats under three hundred and was surprisingly full but i saw at least thirty or forty within the first half hour at one point grace played by natasha <UNK> her inability to die i found myself thinking the same thing since i never walk out before the credits if really thinks this is one of the best scripts he has ever read it sounds like he needs to catch up on his reading a terrible waste of talent and resources this is the worst independent i've seen since <UNK> ho <UNK>
<START> the original australian kim is brilliant why do american producers need to remake ruin yet another classic show remember the original version of the office with ricky <UNK> it was an absolute masterpiece and there was no need to remake it the producers said that the british humour from the office and the australian humour from kim would not translate to an american audience what so basically they are saying that americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes so they need to remake the shows with over the top childish gags so that the americans can understand the humour the original australian version of kim is fantastic and very funny avoid the american version like the plague
<START> in 1982 two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens steven spielberg's et and john carpenter's the thing of the two of them et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over even though the thing <UNK> first because people were so <UNK> with spielberg's warm fuzzy <UNK> alien fable they stayed away from the thing in <UNK> br br its not hard to see why the two are <UNK> opposed one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the <UNK> of the still beating heart the other is a harsh <UNK> film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us i guess audiences felt et was a much <UNK> <UNK> than the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br it's taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience as it should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake it takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic and <UNK> them in startling and imaginative ways indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the <UNK> alien and that's even <UNK> br br carpenter's film follows its source material more <UNK> than the thing from another world did it keeps the <UNK> wastes of <UNK> as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a <UNK> sense of isolation but although a bit thin on characterisation the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors and <UNK> the <UNK> and fear that slowly <UNK> them br br frequent carpenter <UNK> kurt russell returns hot off the success of escape from new york cast once again as one of carpenter's <UNK> anti heroes he plays <UNK> the helicopter pilot at an <UNK> research station what they're <UNK> is anyone's guess the trouble begins when a norwegian <UNK> from a nearby station flies over <UNK> trying to gun down a <UNK> <UNK> from the air br br they end up dying for their troubles and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened they take in the <UNK> and add it to their own except that this <UNK> is not a <UNK> at all but a shape changing alien the <UNK> discovered it frozen in the ice and when they it out it <UNK> their crew capable of absorbing its victims at will it can <UNK> a living being right down to the smallest detail soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12 man crew until no one is certain who is human and who is not br br the thing is one of john carpenter's finest films in fact i'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made even <UNK> classics like halloween and dark star the reason why i place the thing at the top of carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was <UNK> it films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and <UNK> intensity so prevalent in his earlier works br br but the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree not even in the <UNK> assault on <UNK> 13 from the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter <UNK> up the tension level relentlessly and when he delivers his punches they come with an <UNK> <UNK> br br the film is a blend of pure <UNK> and visceral horror an approach that can often seem at odds with one another but in carpenter's hands <UNK> together beautifully bringing in rob <UNK> of the howling fame he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film <UNK> <UNK> half formed human features <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> jaws spider legs and fully <UNK> <UNK> indeed the film's effects are so amazing and <UNK> inducing the thing came under fire for being too realistic br br that type of thinking misses the point entirely it only <UNK> the film's values and there are many carpenter only stages an effects <UNK> when he needs to its in the film's <UNK> moments where he seems especially <UNK> to the story the thing is an often <UNK> tale of shadows <UNK> and <UNK> characterisation has never been one of john carpenter's strong suits but it works to his advantage in the thing because we hardly know anything about the cast it only makes the present situation that much more confusing we're never certain from one moment to the next who is who and because of this the thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings br br a special mention should go to the excellent film score from <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> every two seconds it creates an eerie spooky feeling that is very hard to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they blood test each other to see who's human is wound up with such <UNK> by carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even <UNK> br br the thing is a pure <UNK> classic even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well worth the it received and so much better than et
<START> i also made the mistake of thinking that i was going to see the 2003 swimming <UNK> with rush this was worse then a lot of student films that i have seen the script was forced the acting was <UNK> and the editing annoying it was so slow that i just managed to force myself into staying but i always give a movie a chance so i suffered until the very end apparently there was a <UNK> out about this movie because my friend and i were the only ones in the theater why didn't somebody send me this <UNK> that is why i'm <UNK> as a warning to others thinking of <UNK> out good money to see this i just hope that you actually got to this page and didn't get trapped like i did by looking at the wrong swimming <UNK> p s sorry to the cast and crew if you are reading this i know that you worked hard to make this i know what goes into making a movie keep trying
<START> i saw this film when it premiered in la i think i laughed 2 or three times the rest of the time i was in shock at how ridiculous poorly shot and poorly written it was <UNK> is in fact the only saving grace in the film i was disappointed at the performance of larry whom i usually find entertaining if you enjoy watching your friend's crappy <UNK> short films that they shot on their mom's <UNK> video camera then there's a slight chance you might enjoy this film then again part of what makes those movies enjoyable is that it's your buddies playing all the parts you don't know these people so you'll probably find it as dull and stupid as i did dear mr nelson go back to film school <UNK> for a while as a <UNK> or a grip or some low level job so you can see how things are properly done in film then look for as long as you must to find a director of photography who knows what f stop means make sure he has <UNK> <UNK> on hand then try again repeat as many times as needed
<START> <UNK> drama starring pat o'brien as a washed up reporter who turns up at his ex <UNK> house to ask for money to <UNK> his son's operation only to find him dead on the floor since o'brien knows the identity of the <UNK> he offers to take the rap in return for the money he needs a decent premise is wasted on a film that pretends it has surprises twists and turns even though it really doesn't performances are rotten across the board the movie dresses itself up as a hard boiled american noir but the mix of dodgy accents doesn't work and the story is hardly gripping and it contains possibly the least attractive screen kiss of all time
<START> finally i can connect the <UNK> between return of the jedi and phantom menace we see here where lucas lost touch with what made the original star wars films great and began to <UNK> into the plot less tripe that ruined episodes 1 3 this film is more like one of those cheesy low budget 80s swords and <UNK> films than anything worthy of being associated with the star wars saga as with the jar jar character this seems targeted at children and the toy market the battle scenes are particularly bad it was depressing to see <UNK> incredible talent go to such a waste after her classic performance in i <UNK>
<START> i remember this movie getting a lot of <UNK> from reviewers when it was new <UNK> and leno themselves had <UNK> <UNK> called it <UNK> the biggest waste of film he'd ever seen and leno <UNK> to the <UNK> portrayal of himself but <UNK> had john michael <UNK> as a guest on his show so it seems he didn't take anything too personally a dvd re release with opinions and such from those involved could be interesting though i suspect the days when late night <UNK> wars captivated the nation are gone and not returning soon br br i preferred the <UNK> <UNK> to the leno but could never buy in to either they never rose above caricature and i never simply accepted them as actors for comparison paul sorvino as <UNK> in oliver <UNK> <UNK> comes to mind as an <UNK> which may have seemed laughable in the first few moments but which seemed at least plausible after the first moments of amusement wore off br br the highlight of the show for me was treat williams as michael <UNK> speech to <UNK> was not as great as but reminiscent of alec <UNK> entrance and quick exit as blake in <UNK> ross br br they could have done more with <UNK> role in all this i know he was mostly <UNK> in the events portrayed in this movie and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation such that johnny carson needs no introduction but more context about why dave and jay and all comedians <UNK> johnny would have given this flick the substance it lacks in being a <UNK> film br br guess i should read the book br br rich little imitating johnny carson unfortunately came across as nothing more than rich little imitating johnny carson br br i tell you what after watching this movie then watching either the <UNK> or leno show all i want to do is crack open my johnny carson dvds and see the real thing
<START> my local <UNK> station philadelphia recently showed the elegant universe after three hours of watching it besides having my brain hurt i learned all about <UNK> quantum <UNK> and parallel realities and alternate <UNK> br br the last hour of the show was about string theory physics a semi new branch of physics which makes many of the the ideas of science fiction not only possible but <UNK> with the string theory it sounds like <UNK> alternate realities and alternate <UNK> are possible and it could just be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them br br although it may not have given new information to someone familiar with the topic i found the show very interesting and informative it was very understandable to anyone who is just being introduced to this subject
<START> wow in my opinion the net is an excellent nail biting edge of your seat <UNK> thriller that will leave you feeling good all over when i first saw it i was feeling good all over for days when angela sandra <UNK> went to mexico i thought to myself that is a really nice place to vacation from the moment jack northam and ruth wendy <UNK> began chasing her i thought to myself don't let anything bad happen to her please i also took quite a few deep <UNK> to prevent myself from screaming any more than i already had on the bright side if you ask me the house was very <UNK> and <UNK> in conclusion i give this excellent nail biting edge of your seat <UNK> thriller four stars
<START> i've never been a huge fan of <UNK> but generally i've always found something to enjoy in his films unfortunately i had more trouble finding something to enjoy in broken <UNK> then i would normally think i would br br i find the biggest failure in broken <UNK> to be the characters and the lack of depth they display the film is essentially a love story one that is tragic and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories i found this <UNK> from the beginning br br in the opening scene our <UNK> the director screenwriter <UNK> is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met his agent comes in as the woman <UNK> leaves br br in the opening scene our <UNK> the director screenwriter <UNK> is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met his agent comes in and rolls her eyes as the woman <UNK> leaves <UNK> <UNK> something about needing to enjoy life as the only thing he has left having been <UNK> in a tragic car accident that also killed his <UNK> love lena played by penelope <UNK> the viewer might buy into to this notion except the rest of the film really never illustrates why lena was the love of his life or any depth to his character or any other br br <UNK> plays lena the mistress to an <UNK> named <UNK> <UNK> from the outset their union is rather a pathetic one as <UNK> <UNK> jealousy to lena and lena avoids <UNK> of being on her own by staying with the much older <UNK> to skip ahead <UNK> <UNK> a film for <UNK> so he can keep <UNK> on the star of the film lena naturally without any back story lena and <UNK> fall in love and in <UNK> world it really is that simple <UNK> in the opening scene has sex with a sexy young woman now <UNK> falls in love with lena later it's revealed he had a son with his agent after their love affair her son responds to this information with a laugh and an oh well again no depth no understanding for any of these characters it all just happens from the beginning of the film to the end i got no depth of emotion from <UNK> he is flat and doesn't act much different from one scene to the next br br the one scene i did enjoy was when film producer <UNK> is watching video footage his son recorded under the <UNK> of doing a documentary of <UNK> there are nice a moment of <UNK> watching <UNK> as a lip reading <UNK> his worst fears later lena confronts <UNK> as he's watching the footage and speaks her part out loud matching the video footage of her lips as she talks some quite brilliant moments rather contrived but still really fascinating br br unfortunately for me the rest of the film left me rather bored i couldn't care about these characters or their situations so no amount of <UNK> on <UNK> part can make up for this lack of depth i think if you're a fan of his work you'll enjoy this movie but if you're like me in between then you'll find it lacking
<START> this movie just arrived to mexico and since i read very good reviews here about it i decided to go watch it with my friends and girlfriend but i was greatly disappointed i don't understand how people can rate it 10 10 i mean screenplay and directing were beautiful but a great overall movie need a good story which this flick lacked altogether br br i've enjoyed several dramatic asian and european films but they had a good story watch this movie at your own risk unless you are eastern european or <UNK> i don't think you will like it br br half the people on the theater left including my 4 friends who waited outside since they were really bored so was i but i always wait till the end of the movie br br regarding the movie it was extremely slow paced with a lot of time wasting scenes the full length of the story could have been shown in no more than 40 minutes but they made it longer by having scenes of the monk getting coal that is like 15 minutes of the whole movie plus <UNK> views and so on until they made it a full length movie a really boring one br br i recommend you listen to me if you still watch it come back and rate this comment as useful after <UNK> to help people avoid this waste of money
<START> words can hardly describe what blue planet brought to life in all of its hours of runtime matching up with walking with dinosaurs this documentary stands as one of the best we can only pray that the bbc and discovery channel come up with even more outstanding ideas that could possibly even level with this one
<START> this movie was a poor movie the plot was poor and the comedy they tried to deliver came out poorly the <UNK> seem contrived and predictable i thought the actors tried to some extent but with this movie it was so lame it can only go so far one of the worst films i have seen and don't recommend it to anyone the only accident to mr accident was it's release
<START> if western union isn't exactly the real story of the construction of the <UNK> it certainly does capture the spirit and dedication of the people involved with the project br br dean jagger is the man in charge and one fine day he's thrown from a horse and <UNK> some <UNK> <UNK> an outlaw on the run randolph scott finds jagger and is ready to steal his horse but changes his mind and brings jagger to help later on he's hired by western union and works for jagger br br jagger also hires a young played by robert young who's an engineer young is doing one of his few <UNK> out films away from mgm for 20th century fox both young and scott become friends but rivals for <UNK> sister virginia <UNK> br br western union has plenty of action enough to satisfy any western fans the <UNK> crew has to deal with <UNK> indians and your garden variety labor troubles br br slim <UNK> as the <UNK> cook and victor <UNK> as the frontier character assigned to guard him have some of the funniest scenes they both provide some good comic relief br br fritz lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving <UNK> along western union is solid western entertainment
<START> this is an excellent film no it's not mel gibson in braveheart but then it's not trying to be actually the emperor and the assassin probably has thankfully more in common with a shakespearean production than a hollywood blockbuster br br in the third century <UNK> the king of is attempting to <UNK> in other words <UNK> the seven <UNK> of china he has already <UNK> the kingdom of han now he needs an excuse to <UNK> the kingdom of <UNK> br br this is where the lady <UNK> comes in she and the king have been friends since childhood they are obviously very much in love but cannot marry for political reasons together they <UNK> a plot she will pretend to have fallen into with the king and escape to <UNK> once there she will convince the prince of <UNK> to send an assassin back to kill the king when the assassination fails the king will have his excuse to <UNK> <UNK> br br once in <UNK> however lady <UNK> begins to <UNK> hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friend's <UNK> she begins to wonder if the king may need to be <UNK> for real br br one sure sign that you're not watching a hollywood production is the final encounter between the king and the assassin unlike a hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already <UNK> this is a fight that could truly go either way br br this is a well crafted and well acted story of a <UNK> time in chinese history there is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible <UNK> most beautiful of all however is <UNK> li as the lady <UNK> i grow more and more convinced every time i see her that <UNK> li is the most beautiful woman in the world br br i must say however that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film early on <UNK> li asks one of her servants do i have a beautiful face br br duh
<START> this zany film rivals the ghost and mr chicken as one of don <UNK> finest film performances <UNK> is an <UNK> for a <UNK> city hall that is good for the citizens they fire the three competent and keep the dumb one <UNK> of course is the dumb one when his garbage collecting <UNK> accidentally <UNK> the wrong trash can <UNK> finds himself wrapped up in a bizarre trap set by the city <UNK> for him funny moments in the movie include the <UNK> alley <UNK> scene and the cemetery scene is absolutely hilarious typical <UNK> the nervous act is well used and as usual he is surrounded by lots of crazy character actors from the sixties such actors as frank <UNK> and pitt herbert add to the mayhem as one may expect armed with a big car a pretty girl and no real clue of what he's doing fun for anyone especially nostalgia buffs but just about anyone will love it
<START> <UNK> 2004 tells the story of <UNK> <UNK> a depressed and extremely cynical young man who is estranged from his dysfunctional upper middle class family and living on the streets of <UNK> on his 18th birthday he receives a <UNK> tape and player from his recently deceased grandfather relating his <UNK> of his own 18th birthday spent serving with the british army in france trying to help a <UNK> wounded <UNK> avoid capture by the <UNK> germans as <UNK> <UNK> to the tape ian <UNK> provided the voice of his grandfather we see the scenes he is describing as flashbacks <UNK> with daily scenes of life as well as more recent flashbacks filling in the dark secret why <UNK> left home and finds it impossible to trust anyone who is nice to him br br an ambitious second film from writer director richard bell two brothers with a polished look excellent photography well developed non stereotypical characters with gay and straight treated equally and commendable efforts in emotionally and physically demanding roles from some talented new actors especially paul anthony as <UNK> and brendan <UNK> as his grandfather at 18 there is also a noteworthy turn by alan <UNK> as a priest who tried to help <UNK> and a small supporting role played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as folk the complex story in the director's own words in his dvd commentary is meant to drive a <UNK> of emotion pushing <UNK> to his breaking point and it certainly <UNK> that my only criticisms are that the overall effect is too <UNK> or artificial for an audience to truly identify with much of the supporting dialog and the ending too contrived and predictable and the direction needed to be <UNK> to <UNK> sloppy overacting in some scenes i do recommend it 7 stars out of 10 including extra points for a noteworthy effort
<START> the movie takes place during the year 1940 and the french are about to loose the war br br the movie includes all genres comedy romantic murder and history it is <UNK> the historical part may be not as <UNK> as the rest br br it is not however a big laugh movie but the occasional large smile
<START> as a semi film buff i had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago i had heard that it was basically a 15 million dollar film about the <UNK> rule of the roman emperor <UNK> complete with hard core pornography what struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great <UNK> like peter o'toole john malcolm mcdowell and <UNK> in it a week ago i saw a documentary about <UNK> on the history channel and this film came back into my head and finally my <UNK> got the best of me i <UNK> rented the dvd and even more <UNK> watched it br br within the first 30 minutes i was seeing acts of sex and especially violence that would earn an <UNK> 17 even by todays standards was it really necessary to have a scene of a man having his <UNK> track closed and then have <UNK> of wine <UNK> into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword all in very graphic detail and a scene where a guy gets his d cut off and fed to dogs again in very graphic detail and this just <UNK> the surface the argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays <UNK> rome and it's <UNK> when in fact what this movie really is is sheer exploitation from beginning to end you see nothing but endless torture and <UNK> and every kind of violence and crude behavior imaginable <UNK> rape it just never stopped there is no insight into <UNK> himself what might have <UNK> him to go mad the horrible childhood he had that <UNK> him into a <UNK> as an adult this is not a historic film it is sleaze even the porn in this movie stinks and through much of this when i wasn't <UNK> i was just incredibly bored by the time it was over i was depressed didn't feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible it actually can turn you off of sex br br what were these great actors thinking when they got into this i did read that the porn segments were filmed after the principal shooting was completed which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor but still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into right at the opening credits it says <UNK> magazine and bob presents and the scenes that the famous actors actually take part in are completely repulsive in and of themselves apparently director <UNK> wanted his name removed from the completed film entirely as did the screenwriter gore <UNK> of all people even john and peter o'toole were begging people not to see this when it opened at the cannes film festival br br for the amount of money the producers spent on this the movie's quality is terrible everything is <UNK> and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed and that's when you're lucky enough to view a scene that's actually in focus the sound is poorly dubbed much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awful br br anyway i brought this movie on myself my advice don't watch this don't watch this don't watch this as for myself tomorrow night i am going to watch something lighter like dawn of the dead
<START> in the early 1990's step by step came as a tedious combination of the ultra cheesy full house and the long <UNK> <UNK> classic hit the brady bunch the differences between step by step and the two aforementioned shows was of course better writing excellent comedic timing from almost all of it's actors and a great deal funnier situations that weren't quite as sugar <UNK> as it's extremely popular predecessors admittedly though even with the big <UNK> in the show's basic dynamics and all it still wasn't exactly spectacular nor was it really even that memorable in the long line of corny family programming it was just a much better time <UNK> you might say in comparison to the <UNK> <UNK> inducing full house which <UNK> ran neck and neck with step by step during that time period in terms of overall popularity the show now in <UNK> obviously is certainly suitable family fare but be sure to not expect much beyond that when watching it

<START> the trailer goes nowhere near and only <UNK> the surface of the film and rightly so too not because it has that <UNK> to keep its real narrative under <UNK> but because what actually <UNK> will <UNK> entirely different lines of questioning some of which are <UNK> not answered in the film leaving you to your own devices to interpret the series of events which of course means plenty of material for an after show discussion br br <UNK> the box refers to how us humans tend to <UNK> hole ourselves into situations or things in everyday life and how our <UNK> thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective seldom out of the box there's a speech made near the end by one of the characters that will leave you <UNK> over this fact which <UNK> the basis of the entire film and even <UNK> on <UNK> where our bodies are mere <UNK> for the soul and from cradle to the grave we put ourselves in more boxes in a way of life fashion br br what i disliked about the film is how it tried to sound intelligent through the frequent name dropping of <UNK> government <UNK> like the cia and <UNK> as though there's something overtly <UNK> about these <UNK> that we should be aware of they serve little purpose other than to put every action and every person under <UNK> that nobody can be trusted <UNK> havoc in a sense to both the characters and the audience as we try to keep up with trust issues to aid in the interpretation of the narrative having it set in 1976 against a <UNK> backdrop of <UNK> space missions and in <UNK> virginia also provided that <UNK> sense of <UNK> that will <UNK> your <UNK> as you sit through it <UNK> br br based upon the short story button button written by richard <UNK> and made into an episode of the twilight zone the story follows the lewis family where husband arthur james <UNK> works at <UNK> and develops a <UNK> foot for his teacher wife norma cameron diaz and you'd think it's all happy family with their son walter sam oz stone until one day a mysterious man called <UNK> <UNK> frank <UNK> in a two face inspired facial effect whom we are <UNK> of in the opening comes knocking and giving them a deal or no deal button in a box <UNK> the button and they'll get a million bucks we're talking in dollar terms of the 70s here although a stranger out there will die if they don't well the got an date br br the story would <UNK> a deal be made which of course sparks off a mysterious sequence of events that unfold with even more shady characters who <UNK> appearing some whom are inexplicably zombie like apparently all under the influence or <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> whether or not <UNK> is death a <UNK> government employee a <UNK> from god or a representative of aliens after an <UNK> <UNK> remains unanswered so <UNK> way you look at it it's as if he's delivering something expected just begging that mankind will shake off its <UNK> greed so that his work can be cut short and to return to wherever he came from br br if you need a little distraction from the <UNK> scenes which make up the narrative the production sets and art direction are gorgeous in <UNK> the 70s look as you try to figure out the mystery of the consequences that <UNK> from a result of not fully understanding the fine print it's full circle this examination of human nature of our greed for immediate <UNK> <UNK> its result in longer term pain confusion and further choices that we'll make based on real sacrifices nifty special effects come into play as well though it just leaves more room open as to the genre of the film br br so is it horror science fiction or a mystery thriller it's everything rolled into one actually together with a <UNK> of the philosophical just don't go expecting a straight narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end ¬ñ this is like an x files episode on <UNK>
<START> this film is about a deadly poison that is contained in small glass <UNK> that is used to kill this is apparently done to hide an espionage ring intent on stealing plans for a new american <UNK> now much of this plot was repeated in other chan films the <UNK> mask and the <UNK> of new orleans additionally it was first used in mr wong detective all had the exploding glass <UNK> a plot element that obviously has been <UNK> it was interesting in murder over new york but by these later films it was rather <UNK> br br fortunately the rest of the film was fresh and the plot worked out very well with a nifty conclusion where of course the <UNK> reveals himself however no plane could fly the way this one did especially in 1940 such extreme <UNK> and rapid <UNK> were pretty silly out of this already <UNK> plane br br by the way in a small role as a porter you'll see frank <UNK> jr the same actor who played billy in the captain marvel serial according to imdb mr is <UNK> years old and retired from the film industry
<START> a boring movie about a miserable loser that's <UNK> in a nutshell matt dillon plays henry alter ego of author charles <UNK> upon whose novel the film is based as we meet he may be a writer but he's certainly not a successful one he <UNK> through life getting fired from one <UNK> job after another and not caring a bit the fact that he's always drunk may have something to do with his not caring he meets a woman jan played by <UNK> taylor and a relationship ensues moves into <UNK> apartment and now instead of getting drunk by himself he can get drunk with somebody else good times eventually he's had enough of this relationship so strikes out on his own unfortunately he still can't hold down a job so soon enough he's broke at this point marisa tomei shows up and for some reason her character laura decides to rescue this miserable drunken loser whom she doesn't even know we soon meet some of <UNK> <UNK> and the film <UNK> off into a sort of <UNK> world with this rather <UNK> bunch soon enough tomei and friends are out of the picture and once again we're left with and his drinking and his miserable little life there's some more time spent with jan but mostly there's just time spent being a drunk loser and then the movie's over and not a moment too soon <UNK> minutes of absolute <UNK> and it seems infinitely longer as the movie drags on nothing happens nothing ever happens if you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching matt dillon drink then this is the movie for you if you're looking for a compelling story well developed characters or any entertainment value whatsoever then you've come to the wrong place <UNK> performance actually isn't bad at all too bad the movie which <UNK> him is in fact rather bad
<START> i like this movie cause it has a good approach of <UNK> for example the way <UNK> use to care all kind of living things combining some fancy and real situations in some parts the photography is very good and a lot of messages about freedom as the <UNK> episode staying always focused in every moment even in tough situations it has also funny situations as <UNK> birthday and talking this two times academy awards her acting show us how the people who use to live in this kind of culture is trying to have a resistance behavior when <UNK> is taking her to a <UNK> temple and how she slowly is changing her mind and of course pat <UNK> has been always great
<START> another end of the world film that begs comparison to the abysmal day after tomorrow following the same sort of structure as <UNK> but with a distinctly japanese style how does it fare that depends on your taste for japanese melodrama br br i found that the small human touches to be what makes this film compelling for most of it's 2 hours also the frequent title cards explaining some of the science the effects are probably the best i've seen in a japanese film and they compare very well to anything out of hollywood many of the disaster scenes are truly horrifying even though the human carnage is usually off screen and that is one of the <UNK> while the terror of thousands of on screen deaths like in the recent war of the worlds might have too overwhelming we also don't really get a sense of the chaos of an entire nation <UNK> into the ocean a few scenes touch on the chaos but for the most part this part of the story is barely touched on regardless this film works on a lot of levels and is way more realistic then <UNK> that is until the end br br unfortunately the story <UNK> itself on one clich√©d plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the 1960's japanese earth in peril film after the reasonably good science and mostly realistic take on the disaster this makes for a bit of disappointment the sudden stopping of the film for a pop love song doesn't help either unless you like the song this made the exciting ending a bit of a drag for me br br the overall direction is good and the art design is excellent acting is all good as well recommended
<START> murder by numbers stars ryan <UNK> and michael pitt as two rebellious high <UNK> who are content on the perfect murder for the sake of <UNK> their <UNK> self <UNK> sandra <UNK> plays the heroic thorn in the way of their plans as <UNK> cassie <UNK> this is nowhere near the traditional finger pointing murder mystery as the film <UNK> reveals the killers to us <UNK> and pitt what the film does instead is concentrate on the purposes of their killings and if they have what it takes to commit the perfect murder br br the title itself is a rightfully chosen one for various reasons mainly being that the numbers in the title is the most vocal the angle focusing on the reasons behind the <UNK> killings although will haunt you with its chilling dialogue especially from the <UNK> boys it doesn't fully live up exploring the origins of what lead them to their killing frenzy the characters are riveting you have the good looking rich kid richard ryan <UNK> and the intelligent but socially awkward justin michael pitt in school they pretend that they despise one another and even share a liking towards the a <UNK> name lisa <UNK> <UNK> but off school they are allies and <UNK> in a ritual in which murder is an escape to free the mind br br sure the story involving the boys seems exciting but it's pushed in the background to a more mundane subplot involving <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who assumes their murders was because of <UNK> hence the arrogant looks of <UNK> and unexplained characteristics but manages to get it right at first the audience may despise <UNK> character due to the fact she's very <UNK> and not very supportive she displays <UNK> and control over her junior partner sam kennedy ben chaplin even as he tries to reason with her he knows it's a battle he surely won't likely win br br the reason behind her <UNK> behavior <UNK> back in which cassie was the sad victim of a crime that has left a permanent mental <UNK> on her this side story does not have much of a place in this movie partially because it doesn't offer anything riveting with the main plot the <UNK> murder spree it also offers some development to <UNK> character in the movie but it's only a half <UNK> job and not very fulfilling i would've liked it if they the diabolical students had a side story the resources were right there in front of them for the perfect crime foil the creative schemes for the boys to manipulate the cops with their phony evidence and lies just to get out of a potential life sentence in jail br br despite the sub plots and the pointless real killer ending murder by numbers sports a strong performance by a great cast sandra <UNK> was convincing as the tough <UNK> <UNK> cop who tries to shift her inner pain to a more positive light ben chaplin shows his strength as the young detective who tries every way to understand his partner and is able to <UNK> off her occasional <UNK> put downs but the scene are the <UNK> duo of michael pitt and ryan <UNK> as they keep you glued to their seat waiting for what they're going to do next the chemistry of the boys is reminiscent to matt damon jude law in the talented mr <UNK>
<START> if we could have separate tables why not separate lies br br this becomes somewhat involved a <UNK> husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a <UNK> the <UNK> turns out to be the woman she <UNK> for the latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred to <UNK> matters further the <UNK> once worked for the guy's parents and he had her <UNK> for stealing therefore people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident sounds like she wants revenge br br this all becomes convoluted when our <UNK> discovers that her boss was driving the car she <UNK> her <UNK> much to the <UNK> of the officer who is working on the case br br as if this isn't enough several months later our lover rupert everett becomes <UNK> ill and our lady emily watson leaves her husband tom <UNK> to care for him br br the acting is quite good here despite the never ending <UNK> place like theme tom <UNK> is a <UNK> who tries to protect his wife br br the film is a good one but we could have done without the <UNK> illness o well the marriage ended anyway
<START> wow i just witnessed one of the greatest poker <UNK> and i'm not talking about the <UNK> death of the great <UNK> <UNK> this film i'm sorry to say was terrible absolutely terrible a true tragedy in <UNK> history well maybe i'm being a little harsh but unless you have some interest in the life of <UNK> <UNK> then don't even consider coming near this one and those that do have an interest in his life will find that most parts were and made out to be great novelty scenes i watched it because of <UNK> <UNK> but nearly wanted to end myself like he did while watching this movie 4 stars for effort but <UNK> painful
<START> an amazing film i've only just seen it and i already want to see it again i'd never heard of derek <UNK> before i saw this film but now i am i can't wait to see his others the film takes a whole new perspective of shakespeare's the <UNK> i'm sure he'd have appreciated it for use of the the <UNK> themes of love magic darkness and atmospheric tension ok ok there may have been a bit of nudity in the film which i hadn't really anticipated but it didn't offend me it just surprised me and made the film more unpredictable one spoiler for those of a nervous <UNK> fast forward the flashback scene with and ariel as their slave its pretty graphic overall if you are starting to find kenneth branagh's shakespeare performances <UNK> and monotonous then you need to see this film fantastic and surreal it'll blow you away but only if you let it have an open mind and then let this film work it's magic on you
<START> i'm shocked that all the hated it ratings are <UNK> and <UNK> still above average to me this seems a case of the emperor has no clothes i understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's regardless it became a struggle to sit through and watch the dvd i saw did have some subtitles but about 75 of the speech is not subtitled some of it is hard to understand the <UNK> <UNK> was cool to hear but you struggle not to <UNK> after awhile some of the shots were nice and the realism was there even if some of the performances were not great jimmy cliff did a good job the plot is not bad but quite predictable in the 1 <UNK> film the highlights are jimmy cliff <UNK> singing for a scene and a couple of shoot outs and a fight probably 15 minutes or so the rest is pretty boring btw near the beginning of the film there are some weird cuts with the <UNK> character that seem like a editing mistake which made me laugh for a bit one reviewer said this film has been cut so many times that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there the ending was kind of interesting showing how the media from a young age influences people it could also be a general comment on the white man's influence on other main themes are poverty corruption church ambition in closing the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile the film much less
<START> i suppose i'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt these laboratory movies and yes they spend a lot of time in the laboratory always fail in one dimension there is an understanding that single people <UNK> around have <UNK> secrets beyond the <UNK> of anyone to this time of course they pay a price because their <UNK> has the same shortcomings that dr <UNK> did there is always something they didn't <UNK> there are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here the young woman is certainly <UNK> and the doctor can't help himself but he could have been a little bit <UNK> or even made an effort to shelter what he was doing things go wrong and because of this intellect she <UNK> tremendous power including an understanding of how she came to be rock hudson looks pretty fit here he never quite makes it in this role however it wanders all over with lots of clich√©s and silliness which <UNK> the basic issue once she has her revenge a more suitable thing would be for her to wander off and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some grand way
<START> explores the <UNK> of extreme boredom life in a small canadian town in winter as an experiment in extreme <UNK> <UNK> absolutely nothing happens as viewed through the eyes of a blank deadpan totally uninteresting protagonist viewers of this film should be prepared to in the style of altered states br br in a groundbreaking study david found that he could predict <UNK> thirty years in advance by comparing the <UNK> <UNK> of nuns as they entered the convent those who eventually suffered the disease wrote in simple direct <UNK> the <UNK> were quiet and <UNK> with little optimism or episodes of joy br br now why did i mention that perhaps my mind begins to slowly unravel watching this interminable <UNK> <UNK> film which shows in simple direct style the bleak and stoic life of a small community living next to giant <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> br br this film became popular at the height of the <UNK> movement because of its presentation of this community as <UNK> wounded victims <UNK> its writer director was soon <UNK> with <UNK> disease in the early 1980s and apparently committed suicide
<START> this movie is actually so poor in its desperate attempts at being feel good and casual it really made me embarrassed watching it i can't imagine how the inner circle of norwegian <UNK> and press must have felt trying to pretend to like it at the star packed premiere its great media reviews is a sickening example of how ridiculously small and <UNK> the norwegian media scene is had a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen it would have gotten the rain of rotten tomatoes it truly deserves br br the combination of literally amateur actors home made style visual effects awkward dialogue painfully <UNK> attempts at working class humour and the overly <UNK> and meaningless plot really makes this a movie of rock bottom quality stay away
<START> the worst movie i've ever seen i still don't understand what dennis hopper and michael madsen intend to do in maybe they had bills to pay the best and cult part happens during a flashback which brings us during wwii when a nazi officer hide his jewish wife that's the beginning of a typical serial killer life it seems to be directed during the beginning of the 80's but then appears a new amazing this movie was directed in 2001 i'm quite sure that it took less than two weeks to do that movie i heard that dennis <UNK> wife asked for divorce after she saw that picture and michael <UNK> mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to be the man under the yellow baseball hat pathetic
<START> murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made for tv but isn't considering the only actor of any note is <UNK> although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isn't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things like remembering to lock your front door when you go out or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower br br <UNK> plays cassie <UNK> a cop with personal issues don't they all together with her new partner a wet looking ben chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman nothing unusual there except that the <UNK> are a couple of teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder as the investigation continues a battle of <UNK> emerges between cassie and the main suspect <UNK> <UNK> ryan <UNK> br br the <UNK> issue here is that the two leads are hopeless <UNK> though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney <UNK> actually he'd be better chaplin for his sins is a complete non <UNK> and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his <UNK> in his attempt to break into hollywood at least <UNK> and pitt as the conniving <UNK> suspects <UNK> themselves adequately as if dodgy leads weren't bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run br br murder by numbers has absolutely nothing going for it even a pointless nude scene by <UNK> wouldn't redeem it well just a little but still not enough to save it forgettable predictable and redundant this is one film that isn't going to move the cop genre forward as cassie probably says on her next case there's nothing to see here people move along keep moving
<START> i'm not a huge fan of lucio <UNK> films most of his 80s gore films had their moments but often came across as second rate <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the exception of the entertaining zombi which was a george romero imitation i didn't really enjoy them i know italian horror often <UNK> the plot but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards this is why don't torture a <UNK> surprised me its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery its possibly the best giallo ever made only seriously <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> entries into the genre and unlike <UNK> previous giallo a lizard in a woman's skin this never drags br br <UNK> direction here is quite good he keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewer's interest throughout also the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience plus he adds some clever touches such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence overall the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story the acting is good for the most part also full of familiar faces from 70s italian exploitation cinema both thomas and barbara <UNK> are super cool throughout the only weak link is <UNK> <UNK> whose performance is just far too over the top its the only laughable aspect of the film don't torture a <UNK> definitely comes with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo <UNK> as a whole 8 10
<START> if you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made this movie would be on a short list along with <UNK> named desire i imagine i'll discover some others that qualify but kramer vs kramer is an outstanding exercise in <UNK> so its a very satisfying experience on that level just watching the marvelous <UNK> performances of dustin hoffman meryl streep and the child justin henry in particular one of the best child performances ever br br but i also find it very satisfying to watch because its such a thoroughly involving story it always makes me forget my own problems it has such excellent narrative drive once you stick kramer vs kramer on and alice kramer leaves ted to <UNK> work and their young son telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them and even once you know how things do turn out each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again br br make no mistake kramer vs kramer is not light entertainment its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved br br 10 10 br br for one of the best scripts born out of conversations between <UNK> and hoffman who was going through a divorce at the time ever written executed and performed beautifully and not to mention what a great involving story it is put simply a perfect film
<START> there is only way to describe this movie br br so bad its hilarious br br the acting is so bad i laughed my ass off throughout the male lead in this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous you would think he was trying to copy a toy action figure i know this sounds ridiculous but when you see it for yourself you can't help but agree br br the monster looks like a cgi guy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in old <UNK> movies br br in short this movie is good for only one thing a really large laugh at how bad movies can get br br if you want to see bad acting bad script and special effects gone wrong br br this is the movie for you
<START> i am a film directors nightmare especially of the mega buck <UNK> variety while not a student of the art i still have a high <UNK> for disbelief suspension and buying into the film <UNK> vision if i can find it that's why a gem such as <UNK> are <UNK> is such an <UNK> find the <UNK> and pacing drew me in and never let me go jessica and richard <UNK> give thoughtful nuanced performances and director displays a <UNK> hand in presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people br br spoiler below br br i bought the dvd version and have shared it with several people the reactions have been varied from disbelief in the ability of daphne to complete the assignment for which buddy has paid her to an inability to watch the whole film because it was just too real and emotionally devastating as a <UNK> skeptical <UNK> i have to be either grabbed by the <UNK> and <UNK> for the ride or up to and <UNK> by the filmmaker this film took the later route for me and by the end i was so involved that i felt <UNK> horror and pain at her role in <UNK> demise my reaction to this film reminded me of watching 'the cook the thief his wife and her by peter <UNK> many many years ago by the end i was fascinated and <UNK> and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too i've watched this film several times now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director has demonstrated i am familiar with other works he has been done including a couple of <UNK> movies and <UNK> of the killer <UNK> and a mixed bag 'the which i recently learned was killed in the cradle by the producer and doesn't really represent the directors vision too bad because i loved the prior two films and even found 'the interesting but wish 'the was available in a director's cut with all of the original vision and music in <UNK> i look forward to future work by this interesting director and the leads jessica and richard <UNK>
<START> roy <UNK> and joan <UNK> are superb in this 1970 melodrama the lush settings the haunting music and plot twists make it a truly interesting film i had seen it when it first came out on tv once more it aired when i had a vcr but i did not have a chance to tape it would love it on vhs if someone has a copy apart from the suspense which is worked in beautifully i feel the story is unique and is pretty much true to the book mrs affair by margaret <UNK> i would say that it was one of the greatly overlooked best films of the 1970's out of movies made for tv i have given the film a number 10 rating because it is done with so much originality there is a true pathos and air of romance which has the viewer <UNK> with the <UNK>
<START> this is one of those movies that has everything in it i don't think i would get tired of seeing it hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future the casting was perfect in all respects in a sense the song sung by <UNK> <UNK> i never got to say goodbye is the song come to life you will most definitely laugh and cry throughout the entire scenario for sure i'm just surprised that i had never seen it before this past weekend i think that it's positively worth seeing and your heart will be glowing it would be nice to <UNK> up with your honey <UNK> a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in the presence of each other there is so much heart and emotion at times you honestly don't know where to turn you will know exactly how the character feels true family expression is available all the way through in fact at times you'll even think you are part of that family or they a part of yours see it
<START> monkey is surely one of the best shows to have ever been shown on tv i remember when i was a kid i'd go to my <UNK> house every saturday morning and i'd turn on the tv so i could watch monkey i loved it it had <UNK> action scenes cool special effects a great story a fantastic theme song that was guaranteed to never leave your head and hilarious dubbing but it is kind of weird that it's set in china and the actors are japanese and filmed in japan but that is no stop towards making this tv show lovable br br monkey is about the adventures of three people <UNK> sandy and of course the unforgettable and most lovable character monkey who travel from china to india to get a bunch of holy <UNK> in order to save the world br br monkey is great fun and it's magic
<START> this has got to be the most god awful piece of cinematic crap i have ever watched it makes mel brooks movies oscar worthy by comparison jim needs to be <UNK> slapped for trying to pass this off as any form of entertainment br br while some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as the texas chainsaw massacre or night of the living dead the production value is not in question it is ability to cast and present a plausible story line the casting is <UNK> for the role of charlie he must have picked the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair never mind that this actor's hair came halfway down his back <UNK> never went much past his shoulders this actor spoke in a dreadful <UNK> without so much as a <UNK> of the personality that steve <UNK> or even jeremy davies <UNK> to their portrayals of <UNK> the actor chosen to play <UNK> watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair a fact that anyone who has shown even the most remote interest in the <UNK> case knows he looks like a <UNK> farmer on little house on the <UNK> the actress playing susan <UNK> has a butt wider than <UNK> while those familiar with the family members know that was considered somewhat retarded the actor portraying him did so in such a campy <UNK> way it was like watching an old act instead of sharon <UNK> looking like a beautiful pregnant woman the actress looked like <UNK> alcoholic trailer trash <UNK> up the filming in some places for artistic effect yet this technique hasn't proved remotely useful since the <UNK> the end credits list every known family member yet we are never introduced to the majority of them and those we are introduced to we aren't sure who they are sometimes br br facts are destroyed in this movie as well did not die in real life steven parent was shot four times not twice did not have her throat <UNK> where were mary and bruce davis during the murder patricia never <UNK> a dorothy <UNK> hair style br br the most <UNK> aspect of this movie is what the modern day freaks had to do with this movie why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a <UNK> attached what was their problem with the journalist what was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation why were they included period the viewer never knows br br holy <UNK> i could go on and on but space <UNK> it don't try to eat popcorn during this garbage because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeatedly say what the f
<START> know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie but this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason furthermore many changes have made the story illogical a few examples 1 in the movie paul really meets before he dies in the book <UNK> only gets a letter telling him he is afraid to be killed this is completely stupid because if plan would have succeeded <UNK> would have known that the dead man would not have been <UNK> was in the <UNK> when mrs identified the victim 2 the movie has combined two persons into one cinderella has been removed by the movie the girl <UNK> falls in love with and the ex girlfriend of jack are one person in the movie why for god's sake 3 <UNK> finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player totally unfunny and stupid 4 the movie tells secrets much too early for example at the very beginning so you know things you shouldn't know 5 the murderer gets shot at the end by a person who doesn't exists in the book perhaps because the person cinderella who stops the murderer does not exists in the movie 6 the book is very complex the movie takes only about 90 minutes sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details but it is impossible if you include stupid things which were not in the book and have no meaning e g <UNK> race
<START> thank goodness for the <UNK> brothers their success has brought them bigger budgets but hasn't rid them of their creativity i had planned on seeing another movie but it was sold out so i went to this one instead by the time it began i had forgotten what movie i was there to see i was surprised in more ways than one this movie is hilarious but they don't make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs the writing is brilliant and delivered with great skill by george clooney after this nobody can say he's just a pretty face and the rest of the cast it can be appreciated on many levels whether you remember the odyssey or not i can't remember the last time i saw a movie that was this clever i've seen others i would describe as beautiful intriguing funny and charming all of which also describe oh brother but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end you can feel that their journey is building up to something but you can't tell what and the <UNK> brothers do not fail us the end is certainly not disappointing it's surprising and ties up all the loose ends neatly without wearing the story out
<START> this is the very la <UNK> vague one of the best films of the new wave and i dare say one of the first ten ever made why the atmosphere the story the actors actress are all brilliant this is the theater a fairy tale the life the film paris thank you mr <UNK>
<START> this is a <UNK> crafted piece of cinema that deals with a teenage boys confused sexuality the cut scenes within can be lengthy but the cinematography is beautiful this film would not appeal to many people especially those who are <UNK> about gay teenage relationships but the more open minded can sympathize with the puzzled protagonist
<START> this movie almost has everything the action is cool it's funny 2 great leading men and a truly nasty villain that i really hated not a lot of films have bad bad guys just mainly comic book villains he really does deserve a might ass kicking br br jake scott really does have his fathers talent for knowing how to make great visuals the direction is <UNK> and has an irresistible lighthearted feel i don't usually like films set in the old days but this i liked a lot because it makes a point of boring like so many other period films are sense and sensibility age of innocence and the absolute worst lady and the duke this will <UNK> your faith <UNK> mostly to craig <UNK> amazing score the music is both atmospheric and <UNK> and in scenes of action it is very exciting br br the dvd is in <UNK> 5 1 and has a very grainy and <UNK> looking 2 35 1 <UNK> picture
<START> into a happy household comes the gypsy girl played by myrna loy with her amazingly wild hair and voice that sounds very high pitched and weird it's hard to believe this is loy she bears no similarity whatsoever to the <UNK> and funny character nora charles who she played in the thin man movies instead she overacts so badly that you'd almost expect her to be in an ed wood movie what a huge difference a few years made in the quality films she got as well as her acting ability on top of the <UNK> silly character the film also fails because it just isn't interesting or exciting just very very <UNK> and stupid the only thing good about it is the <UNK> sound system making the sound quality of this turkey about the best i have heard from <UNK> heck it was even better than most 1930 films so the sound <UNK> at least has something to be proud of all others forget it br br this is a movie that even the host of turner classic movies referred to as a guilty pleasure because the movie is so bad and after having seen it i disagree slightly the movie is simply bad
<START> <UNK> <UNK> dave morgan war crimes <UNK> tv series was like a father to <UNK> <UNK> jennifer <UNK> a kiss before lying <UNK> who experience a very bad situation in her life and it caused jennifer to be <UNK> with people and young men dave morgan tries desperately to get her out of the house and manages to introduce jennifer to chris <UNK> who falls <UNK> in love with her at their very first meeting in almost one or two dates later chris asks jennifer if she will marry him and she agrees it is not very long after the wedding that things start to happen chris is in the navy and does not like working in <UNK> and things start happening to young <UNK> in the neighborhood this is a very excellent tv film and it sometimes makes you wonder if the guy or gal i want as a soul mate is the perfect person
<START> there must have been some interesting conversations on the set of <UNK> wing with martin sheen straight off apocalypse now co starred with the actor he replaced on <UNK> film harvey keitel a real <UNK> child of a movie dating back to the last major <UNK> of westerns in 1979 80 it was much <UNK> at the time for being made by a british studio and director conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic american westerns were directed by european <UNK> which seems a bit of an over reaction br br the plot is simplicity itself as martin <UNK> inexperienced <UNK> finds himself fighting with sam <UNK> warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse the <UNK> wing across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time before the legends began aside from caroline captive irish <UNK> the supporting cast have little to do <UNK> never even gets to open her mouth and it is a little slow but anthony <UNK> film does <UNK> terrific scope photography from billy williams and a good score from marc <UNK>
<START> this is a quiet movie it's a simple story about a writer who cannot write his story coming back to his home town to get started but instead he gets involved in a friendship with a weird older man whose life <UNK> represents perhaps the internal state of the writer it's a museum of unfinished ideas outdated equipment and useless people br br there are no extraordinary circumstances or any big movements in the plot it's a movie about internal changes being stuck in their lives which are not developing much the principal <UNK> get to help each other to <UNK> stop leaving in dreams and achieve something or at least get a change and give their lives the desired and long <UNK> new direction br br on the film making side i can think of only one weakness which could also be considered as a feature we do not get much of characters description or inner world insights it's very narrative on the side of thoughts and events and we have to guess about their true feelings which are rather hidden but still you can see them and this is what makes your own mind work trying to figure them out to understand the impressions made by those people and it's not empty underneath the actors definitely hold well some inner states proper to their characters it's close to the real life where you mostly never know someone well enough to understand them completely and this turns us around and puts in front of our own feelings and choices br br what's most important for me is that this simple almost flat story leaves you <UNK> afterwards about your own life about your own dreams and achievements are there any or are we caught up in the routine and pleasures leaving at 100 or only dreaming about it could we do more and move somewhere we'd rather like to be than just leaving feed ourselves and others the tales like i'll do this one day not moving one finger to make this actually happen or i'm fine where i am because it's easier to go by the <UNK> than to actually make a change at least that's the impression it left me with and it was very <UNK> for me which adds to my appreciation of this far from famous movie i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the movies meant for the heart but those who need events and actions should stay away
<START> i saw this on sale new at my local store for 6 and said hey an action film with that guy from <UNK> and enter the dragon directed by the guy who did enter the dragon and it's cheap so i bought it <UNK> this is possibly the worst film i've ever seen and i've seen some <UNK> br br you know how movies which are intentionally campy like evil dead ii and dead alive are awesome you know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again like <UNK> an old van damme film or john carpenter's vampires are pretty cool this film manages to be neither of those i don't know what the filmmakers were thinking but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot no budget for anything and no script to speak of while i'm on the script note i should point out that <UNK> <UNK> has no lines in this movie the only reason he gets first billing on the box is the fact that he's the only actor in the film that you'll ever recognize unless you're a jackie chan fan in which case you'll recognize the bad guy and you'll want to call him <UNK> br br what's also sad is that this film is from <UNK> by that time <UNK> judgment day had come out so you know that the era of 80s <UNK> was over but not quite after this you'll think 80s chuck norris films high school comedies and jason freddy sequels were works of sheer genius br br things to know br br 1 nobody in this film can act for <UNK> the closest you get is richard norton looking appropriately rich and cocky and <UNK> <UNK> looking appropriately mean and cocky everything else is dreadful br br 2 the martial arts scenes are forgettable just many instances of white guys with lots of <UNK> taking off their shirts yelling running at <UNK> lee getting kicked by <UNK> lee getting <UNK> by <UNK> lee then falling down even the final showdown against <UNK> is <UNK> short and about as creative as the design of my running <UNK> and equally <UNK> br br 3 the rest of the action is pathetic too the guns look like they came from the toy department at k mart and indeed they fire with the sound of a when someone gets shot they <UNK> around a little bit then lie still with of <UNK> red <UNK> on their clothes <UNK> lee apparently gets shot in the side but you don't see it at all then later that day you see the wound i've had paper cuts that were worse than that br br 4 of course then the girl dresses the wound then they kiss then next thing you know they're lying in bed talking after sex huh what believable development of the love interest as well as any kind of character development at all are overlooked completely in this film remember how bruce lee's characters didn't need to have sex with anybody to be cool br br 5 the car chase is by far the worst i've ever seen it looks like the director was sitting on the <UNK> with a hand held camera as the two cars <UNK> down the road doing oh i don't know about 30 miles an hour don't try this at home kids these people are professionals <UNK> br br 6 really bad writing here's a scene for you lee is being followed so the girl follows the followers to warn lee but her car is too slow so by the time she catches up lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there's a <UNK> in progress lee has killed two bad guys but the third is shooting at lee when the girl almost runs lee over so the bad guy runs away huh then the girl's car <UNK> and she can't start it she tells lee she's involved now and she's coming with him he points out to her that they can't leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her she somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car and remember later that same night they have sex huh br br 7 if you look closely in more than half of the nightclub shots the dancers are very much out of sync with the music the dancers are also all way too co with each other apparently in the '80s all people at dance <UNK> took dancing lessons there is a girl in the dj booth with a <UNK> but she never does anything except dance the <UNK> tell people who are fighting to take it outside without moving their lips in one scene the only <UNK> lee and <UNK> pass by are just inside the entrance but with their backs to it also apparently if you're a major character in the film you can go straight to the head of the line br br 8 lee notices the first time he is being followed but he doesn't notice the second time even though it's the same guy in the same car the girl however notices bad guys get followed twice but they never notice br br 9 lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girl's car back to her even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice the girl proceeds to leave her child at work in the care of a friend while she is off having sex with lee do not learn <UNK> from this film br br can't think of more <UNK> right now you get the idea is so bad it ain't even funny it's sad
<START> i was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in dear john but it was very slow moving and i felt that both the screenplay and the direction <UNK> the <UNK> of the principle performers i usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels ironically i did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action br br the cinematography was very good at <UNK> through love letters focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter i felt that <UNK> <UNK> became <UNK> down in what became a very hang dog series of expressions in response to loss
<START> rose and the good doctor find themselves in a space station that is on a planet that's quite <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> right below a black hole the crew of the station is just as <UNK> at that as the two new inhabitants are suitably spooky in it's atmosphere and gets better as the doctor and rose find themselves stranded due to circumstances out of their control and speaking through the <UNK> alien race of the <UNK> something quite dark is coming from below the <UNK> of the planet not <UNK> seen the second part of this two <UNK> i can't <UNK> that the end is as strong yet but it does make for one hell of a beginning br br my grade a
<START> this film is a good start for <UNK> that have never watched a <UNK> <UNK> and for those who believe that quality cinema started with their generations efforts they are doing a <UNK> to themselves by not <UNK> their <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is a art form of acting in <UNK> that is different from the sound film and the stage it can stands on it's own merits br br the beloved rogue <UNK> united artists is a <UNK> history of the relationship of french poet and <UNK> louis through <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> will defeat his nemesis of <UNK> the <UNK> system and establish the king as head of the state and the <UNK> of modern france br br the cast is exceptional lead by john barrymore yes <UNK> grandfather for those who only remember him for the <UNK> actor in dinner at eight 1933 or the ham in the women 1940 this will be a revelation fit <UNK> with the <UNK> still in evidence he <UNK> the screen co starring in his first american film is conrad <UNK> with his <UNK> interpretation of this is a duel of acting <UNK> each not giving the other a inch on a trivia note is character actor and dwarf <UNK> <UNK> in his first film his last mad max beyond <UNK> 1985 there are other character actors who would continue in sound that are easily picked up on br br united artists <UNK> no expense in this handsome production <UNK> by william cameron <UNK> costumes props and sets are well done and not exaggerated like in a douglas fairbanks productions there is a touch of reality here the copy on dvd that we watched from <UNK> <UNK> came from a good master though not its musical soundtrack was clear and the print only suffered from <UNK> black spots dirt and drop outs the only major damage at the end of the last reel from water also has a edition which may be of a better quality since they do major on their <UNK> best check with them in our opinion this is a <UNK> <UNK> particularly if you have no in your collection this is a good place to start
<START> man i never laugh so much this year and it's pretty hard to make me laugh while i expected some hostel style movie the smile came to my face even from the beginning this film inside film shows a female stabbed victim messing the whole set until she finally die her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us the viewers that mute witness is not a typically horror movie br br the main character the mute american make up artist billy hughes is played by the beautiful yet talented russian actress <UNK> her performance is top notch her character can't speak so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate and oh boy she did a wonderful job her sister fay <UNK> is the girlfriend or the fianc√©e or the wife of the in film director <UNK> richards they were both very funny most of the time i won't spoil more but the scenes following the <UNK> moment with them two the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy br br the plot get twisted near the end possibly misleading at one particular moment but don't worry such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy girl friend
<START> i read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous karate kid <UNK> although my favorite is still karate kid ii i felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share unlike the previous versions the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path rather than a male teenager <UNK> finds this a little more challenging but rises to the occasion the plot twists are believable and predictable i found that the bad guys are a little one dimensional but this weakness is present in all the <UNK> in varying degrees the camera work is impressive and pans across some beautiful scenery from time to time the <UNK> monastery is both <UNK> and charming the <UNK> monks add some humor and <UNK> to the narrative flow i liked the <UNK> <UNK> scenes which are a humorous <UNK> to the more serious <UNK> <UNK> scene earlier on the quality level of the movie is like a good tv series the music chosen for the background is very good especially with the little river band playing listen to your heart the lessons in the movie are valuable and worthwhile to learn they feel faithful to the spirit of karate and take care not to over <UNK> the fighting part all in all i enjoyed it
<START> as i post this comment imdb currently rates alfred hitchcock's <UNK> <UNK> a 7 3 10 personally i rated it less than half that honestly i can't tell how a movie this bad could've come from what is probably the most consistently good director i know of i've seen about 10 other <UNK> movies from the 30's 60's vertigo is thus far my hands down favorite while <UNK> is easily the worst it's hard to believe that 7 years earlier <UNK> used the very same formula in the <UNK> steps far more competently my recommendation would be to see that instead and avoid this like the plague it's the only hitchcock movie that i turned off before before the end and have no desire to go back and see the rest if you must watch it then rent or borrow don't make the mistake i did and buy the dvd on good faith earned through notorious rebecca vertigo rear window etc even a master <UNK> up sometimes i guess br br edit maybe i was a bit harder on this film than i should've been it's certainly nowhere near ed wood or <UNK> or anything like that but there's three reasons i feel i must rate it so low br br 1 the name hitchcock brings with it certain expectations of quality this film delivers on a few of them but they're way overshadowed by the darn near non <UNK> plotting br br 2 i want to compensate a bit for all the 8 ratings this film is getting hitchcock is like the john <UNK> of directors true fans will find reasons to consider anything by him a work of art but the high rating on imdb gives more casual movie <UNK> like myself the impression that this movie is far better than it actually is br br 3 i spent 18 on this maybe if it'd cost me 5 or even 10 i'd probably be a bit less bitter
<START> shame is rather unique as a war film or rather quite the anti war film in that it not only doesn't focus on the soldiers or politics involved there is politics but not how you'd think it'd be shown it deals with its two main subjects as the only two beings that can possibly be cared about at all in this brutal <UNK> society they inhabit <UNK> bergman in the midst of his prime and following two other heavily psychological films persona and hour of the wolf is far more interested in seeing what the effect of war has on usually <UNK> beings that it brings out the worst in them and also in a <UNK> way is a reminder of what is truly crucial in living his two key actors are frequent <UNK> and friends max von <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the oddly enough who are musicians living on a farm on an island not too <UNK> from when one thinks about it br br they see the tanks roll by and a couple of old friends already getting worn down but they try not to put it too much to heart there's a sweet scene where the couple just talk rather frankly but with heart all one shot as is repeated through the film is to perhaps create a sense of being <UNK> then comes the trouble including a fake film of propaganda made at <UNK> with the the psychological turmoil in being prisoners of war and the terror involved with a <UNK> in the military one of <UNK> most subtle works with bergman needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of <UNK> filmography however for some it may be one of his more accessible works his religious themes this time is kept very low key even as the idea of keeping a sort of faith <UNK> the film's atmosphere when there is war action it's shot in unconventional quick ways via great <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br and the <UNK> of the relationship between jan and eva is <UNK> successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of war ground where the lines are never too surely drawn in a way this film shot right at the height of the worst times in vietnam is even more relevant for today i couldn't help but see chilling <UNK> <UNK> between iraq and elsewhere with some of jan and <UNK> scenes with the fighters or those <UNK> <UNK> the very last scene by the way is one of <UNK> very best all around acting directing lighting it's not the kind of war picture or again anti war i find little of the john wayne spirit in this production that i would recommend right off the bat to my friends all into saving private ryan it has a little more in <UNK> with paths of glory looking at the effects of the <UNK> of war but in reality like any of <UNK> genre films it stands alone however one that packs a <UNK> for the art house crowd
<START> many american <UNK> brains who worship and support the political half truths of <UNK> like michael moore would do well to sit through this movie more than once and see how hypnotic can scare <UNK> and lie to an public and get the people they fear or <UNK> killed and <UNK> <UNK> in this fine epic kills the opposition by remote control all in a fit of self righteous devotion to his principles we get the impression that <UNK> felt it quite <UNK> to <UNK> off his heads even as he sent his <UNK> out to <UNK> up false and misleading charges against the state today the <UNK> of our rotting media <UNK> are much more sensitive that <UNK> they merely murder your character with innuendo and false charges laid down without foundation or sources witness dan attempts to <UNK> <UNK> character on the eve of the 2004 election or the constant <UNK> that the 2000 election was stolen although <UNK> <UNK> continue to <UNK> at such irresponsible drivel
<START> this show is just another bad comedy which will probably be cancelled after two seasons it's not just that the jokes are sexist racist <UNK> they're also not funny and clich√©d in the first episode the father said something along the lines of ' i wish women didn't go out and get jobs and have the same rights as men blah blah that really helps attitudes huh then he was making fun of his son saying he was weird what parent says their kid is weird so overall this show is boring unoriginal <UNK> clich√©d and most of all not funny yeah american <UNK> <UNK> but it does also make you laugh and is obviously taking the <UNK> thats the difference
<START> i just watch this move recently on <UNK> channel what a great film a great cast as well is very suspenseful and unpredictable the movie has a great opening scene by the ocean then to a series of scene establishing the questions about life after death which provide a very strong <UNK> story involvement therefore nelson played by <UNK> sutherland was the first to go through the test to die and come back to life then it's gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong doing from the past to life then all of the above mentioned characters went through the same experience except for randy played by <UNK> then the story unfold into a resolution and basic understanding about life and the presence and meaning of god david played by kevin bacon an <UNK> end up questioning his own belief about god it's amazing to watch julia roberts along with kevin bacon oliver <UNK> william baldwin and <UNK> sutherland at such a prime time of their careers one can ask how come we don't have such great movie produced anymore this is one of the best productions from joel <UNK> i really enjoy this movie
<START> i first saw death in <UNK> 1971 about 15 years ago found it profoundly moving and often thought about it watching it again few days ago i realized that it is close to the top of the great works of cinema with hardly any dialog it <UNK> a viewer with the beautiful cinematography the fine acting and above all the music without which the movie simply could not exist br br death in <UNK> is a stunning <UNK> <UNK> adaptation of the thomas mann <UNK> about a famous composer in the <UNK> he was a writer but making him a composer in a movie was a great idea that works admirably <UNK> von loosely based on <UNK> who travels to <UNK> in the summer of <UNK> to recover from personal <UNK> and professional failures his search for beauty and perfection seems to be completed when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty <UNK> <UNK> follows the boy everywhere never trying to approach him the boy <UNK> to very rare creatures that own an enigmatic and <UNK> power which <UNK> you <UNK> you <UNK> you and makes you its prisoner became one of the prisoners of <UNK> charms he became addicted to him he fell in love with him was it bless or curse for him i think both he died from <UNK> impossible yet beautiful love which object was perfection itself the last image eyes captured was that of the boy's <UNK> surrounded by the sea and golden sun light nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and to take it with you to the grave is the death one can only dream about if he could probably would've said i was able to witness one of the faces of perfection i could not bear it but i was chosen to learn that it exists here in this world and i can die in peace now because it did happen to me br br unforgettable music <UNK> haunting of his fifth <UNK> found perfect use in a perfect movie it reflects every emotion of a main character it <UNK> it <UNK> it begs for hope and it <UNK> the idea that once you are blessed to encounter beauty you are condemned to die i may come up with hundreds movies that use classical music to perfection but nothing will ever compare to death in <UNK> i dare say that music is its main character it would change and sound differently depending on what was happening on the screen it sounded <UNK> when returned back to <UNK> to what he thought would be his happiness but turned to be his death it sounded gloomy when he first entered <UNK> from the sea you can hear so many different feelings in it <UNK> and <UNK> confusion and self loathing worship and melancholy but always love that gives the <UNK> happiness and breaks the hearts literally the movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was for the aging composer writer artist we are enchanted and captivated by its power and beauty as much as was by the boy's mysterious charm
<START> why you ask does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the almighty well its <UNK> logic my friends you see i know god exists because satan does how else would my poor eyes have been <UNK> on such a horrendous film yes there is no doubt about it on a cold friday in the year 2006 satan possessed me and forced me to watch this film he what you wonder the devil makes little girls spit up vomit and climb <UNK> why would he waste his time in making you watch this film my only conclusion to that <UNK> is that satan believes watching camp fear is the worst form of mortal punishment not <UNK> out your eyes or making you speak in <UNK> instead making you sit <UNK> through one and half hours of the most awful film making ever can this film be as terrible as he says yes my friend watching this film is the equivalent of getting kicked in the sack about fifty million times maybe more but maybe i am being too harsh this film does have a few moments in it the beginning for example starts in a <UNK> house with a lot of topless girls now never being in a <UNK> i am unsure if girls really do this but hey one can always pray now after the five minutes of boobs and butt <UNK> has ended we are presented with a scene on campus at an all girls college the girls themselves about eight in all are in an <UNK> class where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient <UNK> flash forward the professor of the class who happens to be the only male at this girls college apparently takes a handful of his <UNK> students plus girlfriend to a remote lake in the mountains their <UNK> to find ancient indian <UNK> yeah right professor we know what angle your <UNK> now this is where the movie gets going the group of five four girls one guy stops at a gas station to get some directions but lo and behold a biker gang pulls up and <UNK> the girls only to eventually leave them alone and go their separate ways moving on they get to a <UNK> <UNK> of four <UNK> and some trees and then things start to go horribly wrong first the <UNK> and his girlfriend go wandering away to have some alone time when one of the girls takes it upon herself to find them only to be captured by some unknown force continuing on the other two girls begin searching for the missing girl when the <UNK> plus one drunk guy come looking for them their plan to rape the girls and do horrible things to them the movie goes on with something about a <UNK> needing four <UNK> for a sacrifice to save the world from some kind of water monster before the year two thousand but their is a <UNK> to this plan mr <UNK> one of the girls is right before us so away goes that plan now since i said there would be spoilers i'll go ahead and ruin the end of the movie for you the four girls get taken drugged with some green goo and then are ready to be sacrificed after one of them is killed the two remaining <UNK> and the <UNK> come to save them they stand upon a <UNK> where the not lead biker says i think i can make it down there only to leap down and break his leg the <UNK> runs at the guy and gets subdued only leaving the once rape minded now heroic biker left to <UNK> off the giant <UNK> first he makes a pathetic attempt with a stick then pulls a knife the knife reflects some <UNK> <UNK> within a gold snakes mouth and lights the <UNK> on fire <UNK> <UNK> they carry the wounded away via <UNK> stick and <UNK> if everything is really over only to have the lake bubble showing the monster within it still lives in a nutshell that is the film and this is my review which unfortunately will go <UNK> by most eyes since this is only the fifth posted review for a film that has been out for fifteen years thankfully satan can only get to some of us and not all the judge would like to make one heartfelt <UNK> to the poor girl at circuit city i am going to let borrow this movie i'm sorry sheila please don't hate me for letting you watch this
<START> the <UNK> was by far a very pitiful film i do not use this word loosely as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie i finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind ¬Ö why honestly you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit there were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development both in the story and in the characters which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation scenes would occur with no <UNK> understanding or drive to a complete ending it was as if i was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved this was my biggest issue with this film the complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all <UNK> of foundation <UNK> down with a genuine <UNK> effect being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result br br let me explain myself further on this lack of <UNK> throughout the film i would <UNK> this film to a bowl of <UNK> <UNK> that had a <UNK> in it it made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all <UNK> driver was the worst <UNK> of this deed her character's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent she would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time she has her first moment of passion in this film and there is no pain or excitement it <UNK> happens and this just didn't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with <UNK> and her sister she is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention that was confusing and completely random is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non existent anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn't teaching daughter anything the sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between driver and jonathan rhys meyers nearly had me laughing out loud i thought maybe i had discovered some magic in this film as rhys meyers literally <UNK> into the scene and suddenly caused some <UNK> drama it felt that the director or writer was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit or confuse the lesser film <UNK> well it didn't fool me i saw that he was nearly a cut and <UNK> character used to <UNK> an already <UNK> story don't get me started on the ending which had no <UNK> to the rest of the story again using the cut and <UNK> method the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story and this was the only solution they could arrive to it is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character ¬Ö but i guess that is the name of the game in hollywood fix until completely broken or at least <UNK> br br the remainder of the story was <UNK> <UNK> there were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one <UNK> of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent period piece music but nothing to write to grandma about more family structure with some stronger <UNK> could have <UNK> this film a bit more but as i stated before by leaving open ended scenes just lying around the entire film you will experience a crack in your foundation what may seem like a <UNK> story will eventually wear down over time and by the end of this film i felt that the house was <UNK> down on top of me <UNK> plays his normal self in this film while driver apparently did not want to get naked but everyone else had too i will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes ¬Ö also she wore the same dress everyday that was disgusting and i could smell her through the television sex and dirty <UNK> now there is a great film for you there just seemed to be some potential floating around here but instead it was just rubbish nothing was answered questions seemed to fall like snow in <UNK> and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme br br overall this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together but instead it was just pitiful i cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre explanation i don't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child but something should have been done to build a foundation just remember the <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> that i used if you were as confused about that as i was then you will completely understand the film the <UNK> while if you prefer <UNK> in your <UNK> ¬Ö then maybe this film is for you br br grade out of
<START> two hours ago i was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its <UNK> photography it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes 2000 close ups it close ups of walls humans and of many other things the warm colored lighting which is also usually by the director gave the movie a warm atmosphere only two persons are <UNK> to be seen in most of it an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie silence and slow movements <UNK> the movie some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close ups not only tony <UNK> deserves a prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant i wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the 1960s this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end in short i would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema
<START> obviously inspired by <UNK> and sometimes even more gruesome more bloodshed and very graphic details a bit too much for my taste great script and acting i was especially impressed by ken and there were no weak points in <UNK> cast good cinematography and very realistic <UNK> sound one of the best thrillers i've seen since years although it was <UNK> on bbc in three parts i watched <UNK> on video in one take one point of critic the motivation of the villain was not very convincing
<START> <UNK> work sick watched this in bed and it was so awful i would have went back to work if i could have gotten out of bed the dog ran off with the remote so i was stuck br br i'm positive hammer was <UNK> the <UNK> daughter to become his br br horrendous to watch made me vomit more than what i was doing anyway so there you have it this would be the film that they play in the waiting room of hell before you go in or maybe your stuck in the film for all eternity with the hart kids just remember to take a gun with you
<START> this movie is so unreal french movies like these are just waste of time why watch this movie even i did not know why what the well known sex scene of half siblings although the sex scene is so real and explicit but the story it is based upon is so unreal what is the use of it then can you find easily in life half sibling doing such things br br did i learn something from this movie yeah some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movies such stories such non sense but for those who like <UNK> <UNK> in life or simply a life without hope then there you are you've got to see this movie br br only one worth <UNK> though catherine <UNK> she's such a strikingly beautiful woman
<START> <UNK> to power in 1933 hitler and his national <UNK> german workers party which of course we all know as the nazis <UNK> their grip on the country more and more as the time went by early in their rough <UNK> <UNK> of the german people they called any and all artists newspaper men and film makers into their nazi <UNK> in order that the may be informed of just what the newly <UNK> third <UNK> aka expected of them br br when the master director from the german <UNK> silent <UNK> and <UNK> era mr fritz lang was called in to meet with <UNK> <UNK> he listened <UNK> and said nothing immediately after leaving the minister of office <UNK> lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to paris not even going back to his <UNK> fritz lang did not return to germany at least not until many years later he remained in france eventually <UNK> to the united states of america br br mr lang went right to work in america creating a variety of most enjoyable solid and <UNK> <UNK> upper <UNK> movies for many a year included in this <UNK> of titles is today's lucky subject western union 20th century fox 1941 br br typically a film about the old west and <UNK> days needed both quality as well as <UNK> of cast western union <UNK> on both <UNK> we are treated to a fine array of starring talent as well as a supporting cast which makes just about every minute and each scene a delight to our senses br br heading up the are robert young randolph scott dean jagger and virginia <UNK> others <UNK> displayed are folks like john carradine playing not a vampire or other scary guy but a <UNK> george slim <UNK> veteran character actor silent film veteran and graduate of mack <UNK> <UNK> comedies chill <UNK> always <UNK> supporting player and former singer in the <UNK> boys and <UNK> bad guy barton added to this mix we have names like russell <UNK> victor <UNK> minor watson george chandler <UNK> richards irving bacon james <UNK> francis ford frank <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ken <UNK> br br prominent in those american indians featured are chief big tree chief <UNK> and mr jay also featured is that one great representative of the <UNK> peoples of north america is that great <UNK> impressive and memorable example of the red man the <UNK> native iron eyes cody born of <UNK> immigrant parents br br the filming of the fine <UNK> scenes was done on location in arizona and <UNK> and rendered in the highest grade of available there is no <UNK> valley but then that's the <UNK> of mr john ford in some respects this film is a far more amazing accomplishment than we might think for it took a sort of pulp magazine story adapted it to the tastes and <UNK> of the pre war america of the late thirties and early forties all of this being done by a german born director who was only had been in hollywood and america for the <UNK> length of time br br in its final analysis western union while it may not be the most historically accurate example of the western genre we just don't care it scores in all of the necessary categories needed for a great night at the movies so who really cares about little details such as accuracy br br we give mr lang and 20th century fox a rating of br br note we just saw a special on <UNK> station here in chicago that was all about all of the film actors directors and other <UNK> whom the nazi rise to power caused to take <UNK> in america and hollywood it seems that movie folks and scientists were the biggest <UNK> for germany at this particular time being that the scientists who built the atomic bomb as well as the future <UNK> people came from europe at this time br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i watched this basically for the sole reason that it was supposed to have third <UNK> references in it it turned out a pretty brainless and predictable slasher film that appeared to be made to appeal to <UNK> or something br br let me tell you something if you wait an entire movie to see the attractive female <UNK> breasts the last thing you want is a <UNK> done sex scene with annoying camera angles that don't show anything her <UNK> friend didn't get hers out either but we saw plenty of men's <UNK> and <UNK> hair and guys with their shirts off and at the end you have our heroine magically <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of the villain who turns out to be the hunk <UNK> enough and she easily out fights him uh huh while her male love interest is tied down and waiting to be rescued the funniest part was when she picks up a chair and <UNK> it at the guy and it breaks over him now it'd be about as much as she could manage to lift the chair let alone smash it against a person with enough force to break it it looks ridiculous she basically <UNK> it against him and it falls apart if you are going to do this sort of role <UNK> rubbish which has already been done to death then you have to at least make it semi plausible br br there was one good bit though the bad guy did get the better of her <UNK> friend teaching her a lesson for being such a tramp and sleeping around that's not exactly something <UNK> would like br br pretty stupid really not that american slasher flicks are generally much better but you have to wonder why they bothered it brought nothing new to the genre at all br br 5 10
<START> you've seen the same tired worn out clich√©d sit com stories characters stories <UNK> of times this excels at sucking more than others first and foremost there isn't a single character in this show that's even remotely likable in particular michael dave gold is by far one of the biggest <UNK> ever to grace a television screen ever <UNK> comes to mind if in real life a father was this unlikable cruel and just generally <UNK> to parent would be your only option to call the remaining characters stereotypes would be too <UNK> if these characters ended up on life support the line to pull the plug would be light years long how this show finished one complete season much less 2 is a mystery fox <UNK> arrested development and keeps this on the air you tell me the terrorists aren't winning
<START> how to qualify this film simply horrible it is badly done with poor dialogues reeves played as bad as ever and cameron diaz <UNK> with him do not waste your time watching such a film although a big waste of money has already occurred to make the film
<START> too much added with too much taken away from a great western that was written by about the texas rangers vs the indian this screenplay takes that away only to fill this mini series with a lot of warm fuzzy relationships that in truth were secondary to the main storyline it ends with a totally unbelievable and detached ending not written in the book that makes you question how we are to be transported to <UNK> <UNK> br br the series main characters were in truth cast very well the filming locations were excellent but this mini series should have stayed true to what is a great book
<START> this is the worst movie i've ever seen and it takes the price of the rotten movie of 2007 which is made by me anyway this movie misses every single ingredients of a good movie i mean come on the actors had a bad performance the story is just crap i'm really really disappointed they could have done better stuff than this piece of junk i've just wasted my time and my money on this movie i wish that the production company could give back my money anyhow i'd high expectations on this movie and i've got disappointed i don't recommend anybody to watch this so if u wanna waste <UNK> money on something do it on some thing else than this piece of junk
<START> no <UNK> is decidedly not a romantic comedy about <UNK> and former <UNK> <UNK> turned <UNK> <UNK> christopher <UNK> though it sure would've made for a funnier movie a <UNK> little <UNK> teeth <UNK> black from <UNK> and guinness <UNK> out advice and <UNK> political commentary to <UNK> men look into her eyes when you speak to her you <UNK> and remember calling someone a <UNK> makes you a de <UNK> anti <UNK> can't you get anything straight you liberal br br oh well instead we get will smith whose continuing success remains a mystery to me at least i am apparently alone in this regard smith is the most powerful man in hollywood as of this writing americans just can't help throwing their money at him i on the other hand find his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by a scene here spoiled by the trailer where he suffers a <UNK> <UNK> reaction to <UNK> we know smith will <UNK> back to his bland over <UNK> good looks because there's a fat sit com actor kevin james on hand making a fool of himself we're supposed to laugh hysterically whenever the <UNK> starts dancing like a jackass cue everybody dance now by <UNK> music factory but why would a straight arrow <UNK> behave in such a way i've worked with several straight arrow <UNK> for years and i can tell you that if in norman memorable phrase tough guys don't dance neither do straight arrow <UNK> am i taking all this too seriously or and here's a daring thought perhaps the writers couldn't <UNK> a <UNK> drawn character to save their lives br br speaking of the writers they come up with a lousy idea for smith's love interest a writer for a <UNK> eva <UNK> since when do <UNK> creeps deserve love what universe am i in anyway everyone here at imdb is actually <UNK> over this tripe either you all need to raise the bar in terms of entertainment value for your buck or i'm just a <UNK> at the garden party me and about 150 million other long suffering boyfriends and husbands in any case if i may imitate smith's <UNK> and offer my male readers some smooth advice when you're dragged to see <UNK> say to your better half hey that was pretty good after the movie is over don't be <UNK> don't rave about it she'll know you're lying to her praise it in a lightly surprised way as if the movie was better than you expected and wasn't the <UNK> time <UNK> that it actually was but what am i saying eh <UNK> we <UNK> know all the moves br br 1 star out of 10
<START> worth the entertainment value of a rental especially if you like action movies this one features the usual car chases fights with the great van damme kick style shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun and even terrorist style bombs all of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you've seen your share before br br the plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit which is clever but hardly profound many of the characters are heavily stereotyped the angry veterans the terrified illegal aliens the crooked cops the indifferent <UNK> the bitchy tough lady station head the crooked politician the fat <UNK> who looks like he was <UNK> as the mexican in a hollywood movie from the 1940s all <UNK> acted but again nothing special br br i thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted by the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't there was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just <UNK> very simplistic but then you weren't expecting hamlet right the only thing i found really annoying was the constant cuts to daughter during the last fight scene br br not bad not good passable 4
<START> quite liked flesh and looking forward to heat but couldn't help but feel <UNK> grossly exploited most of the performers featured here stumbling around naked in a <UNK> <UNK> seems to be all was capable of in this feature a huge and heartbreaking contrast from flesh his semi <UNK> in a few scenes is the only indication that he might be acting mostly it looks like something he did to buy drugs is a revelation all right she is the <UNK> of the lower east side but hers is a one woman show she rarely <UNK> the other performers though it has to be said her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> when it comes to cinematic displays of raw passion when she on a young would be lover it is with the <UNK> of a vampire two of the female performers <UNK> and jane have such annoying voices you'll have to mute the sound to get through their scenes the fact that several of these performers committed suicide or were murdered a few years after only adds to the air of exploitation but they were probably desperate to get in front of <UNK> camera anyway there probably isn't a worse way to spend a saturday night but at least it brings a specific time and place vividly to life
<START> okay first to anne rice book fans br br sure eyes are not blue sure he isn't blond in this movie but even though <UNK> is not maker even though they completely altered the story br br how can u say its not a good movie br br this movie is the best vampire movie i ever saw and <UNK> is <UNK> perfectly in it maybe not his features but i don't think one can find a better <UNK> the way he speaks and the way he looks at mere <UNK> his arrogance and sheer love for fame is <UNK> <UNK> br br if u for once consider it just a movie and not try and relate every scene to the book u will love the movie as much as i do br br now to the non readers br br be prepared to fall absolutely in love with this movie it has every thing and the <UNK> music is like an added treat the dialogues are beautiful and catching and even though its a vampire movie u will find yourself smiling at the wit of the characters and u will find yourself <UNK> with the vampires br br overall one of my <UNK> movies 10 10
<START> a surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as batman <UNK> and its <UNK> i enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again great voice acting from tim <UNK> richard <UNK> tony jay and maurice <UNK> in various roles the only <UNK> i had was rob voice seemed a little too old for the title character but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending some people say it was a cop out but i found it refreshing compared to many series that just leave things hanging hopefully one day they put this series out on dvd unfortunately it came out at a time when dvd's weren't yet prevalent and the cartoon probably only served to sell a particular type of toy which i never found appealing despite the entertaining cartoon
<START> may have a good story but the director is utterly devoid of talent he does not know when to stop when the story calls for people to act confused there are ten minute scenes of people <UNK> the act of confusion when the story calls for a little background history there are ten minute scenes of <UNK> when the story calls for a kid throwing <UNK> you get the idea br br not to mention the extreme closeups so that you can count people's nose hair there are movies that should be seen on a big screen this movie should be seen on a 13 tv also who plays is the worst actress i've seen in quite a long time a normal human being would need to <UNK> overacting for years to achieve what she does so effortlessly br br i give it 4 10 solely because the subject matter is different and the story is not bad the fact that a movie like gets to be <UNK> entry to the oscars tells volumes not about the state of indian cinema but the state of indian judging <UNK> a movie is not good just because its subject matter is arty
<START> this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it <UNK> you incredibly the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film a truly truly bad film
<START> let me start by saying overall i enjoyed the long kiss <UNK> i would give it a 7 10 the good 1 acting samuel l jackson is entertaining in almost any role in this movie he doesn't play his usual character the type that is in control instead <UNK> davis is in control and sam is along for the ride his timing on his lines are great and he is the high point of the movie <UNK> davis also gives a great <UNK> as samantha caine charlie <UNK> she is a believable action hero and i don't think too many other actresses could pull off the <UNK> <UNK> does 2 the action this is a very action packed movie things are pretty much always crashing or blowing up or someone is chasing someone else the special effects are pretty good especially for being almost 8 years old i can see some green screen stuff but it doesn't detract too much from the acting br br the bad 1 why did it take half of the movie to set up the plot this film needed to be edited in the script stage so that it didn't run as long as it did maybe a drama or something can run this long but people really need to be into the movie the entire time to sustain it i think that if you can stick out the first half you will be the second half 2 <UNK> davis is cold weather and a tank top but she never seems cold 3 some things are unrealistic sam jackson flies through a giant sign after he is <UNK> out of a room and then he lands in a tree and just gets up when you see this part you will think it's a gag overall fun movie 7 10
<START> obviously raw feed video is smarter than all of us who wasted our money renting this flick they will make millions from video <UNK> and their low budget investment is going to pay off big which will <UNK> rest stop ii unfortunately i figure they spent a maximum of a few hundred thousand dollars american to hire the actors rent the rest stop locale and burn a truck and drag a motorcycle along behind the truck for a bit plus pay for the technical stuff that's it we should all be as smart as these guys i won't knock them for having the genius to promote a stinker into good <UNK> returns premise of the movie was good and it could have been a really adequate horror movie but it failed by not delivering a clear story line i am always looking for a gem from the <UNK> film companies but i didn't find it here and neither will you i'm only sorry i wasted 3 99 plus tax to find out
<START> in s o s <UNK> goes from picking garbage <UNK> to being a <UNK> on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain <UNK> bird and <UNK> his owner uh oh once again <UNK> and <UNK> provide many obstacles to the <UNK> attempts to get the bird <UNK> also gets <UNK> quite a few times too and the second time the red <UNK> <UNK> goes to the place on the ship that has something that <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it with so now <UNK> can blow fire i'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by <UNK> starring the popular cat and bird duo s o s is most highly recommended
<START> kill the scream queen may sound like a good slasher flick but it is terribly boring and very dumb br br kill the scream queen is about a crazy filmmaker who <UNK> girls to be in his snuff film he rapes and <UNK> them this is trash that is not amusing suspenseful or entertaining the killer has no motive okay maybe hes just sick and very dull maybe they could of gave a victim a story of their own anything could be an improvement it needed a lot more br br they could of put just a little more into it i love horror slasher films but this is ridiculously bad
<START> i saw this film at the <UNK> film festival and would not recommend it it is two and a half hours long during which nothing much happens at a <UNK> through <UNK> pace br br the main characters are <UNK> and totally lacking in charisma or personality no one smiles at all during the film neither would i if i had their lives and although domino seems to have a healthy sexual <UNK> she doesn't seem to enjoy sex at all br br the whole experience is depressing and <UNK> the director lingering over each scene in a way that drove me crazy rather than striking me with the beauty of his technique br br too many questions were left in my mind why does he <UNK> the <UNK> man's head why does he <UNK> what is he looking at over the fence why does he kiss joseph why did we go and see this rubbish rather than <UNK> another bottle of wine in <UNK>
<START> i was part of the cast of space odyssey playing fido in mission control i just want to say that none of us actors specially those in mission control who had to react to a green screen most of the time had any idea how amazing it would turn out to be i knew it was going to be good if only for the sheer <UNK> and <UNK> that the production team at impossible pictures provided for everyone involved but when we all saw it for the first time at the screening at the <UNK> well i for one felt very proud i was so glad that none of us looked like we were in star trek joe the screenwriter and director is the most amazing man to work for he pretty much gets a good team together and then just <UNK> them <UNK> to <UNK> do what they do best i'm really lucky to have been part of this show who knew something this epic and complicated to understand would turn out to be so <UNK> to watch and my god it's a beautiful universe out there
<START> i am a fan of the <UNK> and i love ghost hunters so when this show first came out i decided to give it a try i could barely sit through one episode the show is so obviously staged i mean come on every single episode involves someone being possessed or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family another huge flaw is that these guys never <UNK> anything when i watch ghost hunters they find evidence and try to <UNK> it and if they can't then it is evidence on this show they find a voice or a piece of video evidence and they are very quick to call it a ghost this completely ruins their credibility unlike <UNK> and ghost hunters who actually know what they're doing honestly if you're interested in the <UNK> and want to watch a show about it watch ghost hunters
<START> <UNK> not much you can really say about this film except that it was crap and probably the worst film i have ever been to see take my advice don't watch this film it just wastes your money and time br br i gave this film a 1 10 which is doesn't deserve
<START> visually beautiful with some fine music this film otherwise has a fairly trite made for tv quality the romance between two characters which <UNK> a cultural and educational <UNK> is simply not plausible of course from early on we knew our heroine would <UNK> up win over the locals and find true love but that doesn't make it any less <UNK> that the movie had to take such completely expected turns this film had lots of promise which makes it more of a shame that the promise was <UNK> perhaps a nice under the <UNK> on a cold night <UNK> on cable but i certainly wouldn't recommend paid rental or purchase i'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful though
<START> the movie is a riot hilariously funny yet <UNK> violent just when you think you can't take any more it gives you more great the cast is excellent and the plot is very convincing the past does indeed catch up with our hero but right <UNK>
<START> a dreamy stunningly atmospheric film takes place in a small town of <UNK> montana in 1955 the government officials arrive to <UNK> the town about to be <UNK> by a new <UNK> there are the other <UNK> in the town the angels from another time but they only seen by a dying boy <UNK> a local priest nick nolte in a quiet heartbreaking performance takes care of the boy <UNK> <UNK> with the angels to leave the place with them br br there is some <UNK> quality in the film some <UNK> mourning and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable <UNK> of everything humans and their relationships cities countries <UNK> the whole world as we know it death and birth have something in common we go through them in the ultimate loneliness br br i cannot recall the film that affected me in the same way and as deeply as <UNK> did the film so beautiful and so tender so quiet and so powerful so heartbreaking and so moving even now after several weeks since i saw it tears come to my eyes when i only think of it br br after i saw it i had to talk to somebody about it i sent a <UNK> to one of my friends and i asked please tell me what i just saw and my friend <UNK> with the words you just saw one of the greatest films of modern times one of these days others will see the light
<START> i watched this film last night i though i would rent a horror scary film from blockbusters and i got this one out the opening scenes were so long <UNK> the conversations between characters seemed not to lead anywhere br br the story line seemed so poor to me she gave him hiv and then she goes to meet someone else but she is killed by the man she infected i think she may have been doing it for a long time to different people then when he <UNK> the body it just happened to be the man she was going to meet was in the forest and saw him <UNK> the body then he chased them did he ever finish <UNK> the body and they got into a car and he somehow found them from a different direction they came from and killed the bloke br br i think the severed head was the only good thing in the film as it was quite realistic and then when the woman ran she happened to fall over in front of him so he could stab her with a spade and then it finished br br what a relief it was the most pointless film i have ever watched please steer well clear of it it is just so poorly made i counted only 5 different people in it and the scene where he kills her is so unrealistic and they only swear in it and thats it thats it from me br br steer well clear
<START> the movie is about a girl who's not going to a <UNK> only because she's baby sitting that night nothing weird about that right until the phone rings until the phone rings again and again and again those are not some stupid prank calls this is for real if you wanna see how the girl <UNK> just watch the movie br br great atmosphere filled with scary sounds very well performed by young <UNK> belle who got the lead role i see in her some great potential to become a good actress this is more than only a decent thriller i have no idea why it's so underrated anyway on my opinion this movie deserves more than only 4 10 24 of all voters rated the movie with 1 get serious people you couldn't get a better thriller for a title like this
<START> horses on mars is a wonderful journey taken by very small creatures it doesn't have to work hard to hold your attention and the characters are truly memorable most of the credit must go to eric anderson for his choice of visual style and for writing an interesting story but credit is also deserved by for the narration and the wonderful music score these choices were obviously not an accident if you can see it in <UNK> scope for the most impact it is quite a beautiful film
<START> although casper van <UNK> and michael <UNK> are generally <UNK> to b movies even they are above this movie it fails to convey even the slightest sense of excitement fear or dread unless you count the dread of sitting through the rest of this garbage the direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movement that hides the fact that the killer is no where near the victims when he attacks and what a killer he is a cheap skull mask and a black hood i liked him better when he was fighting he man this is one of the <UNK> jobs of character design i've ever seen i mean it's <UNK> and he's on a horse this is supposed to be some scary supernatural creature how are we supposed to take this seriously all we get is scenes of this dude riding around the woods on his horse which he can barely stay on interspersed with scenes of soldiers shooting randomly into the woods thinking they can shoot a ghost occasionally <UNK> will shoot someone with an arrow or ride by and stab someone revealing how corny the effects really are i generally enjoy sci fi channel fare on a basic cheese level but this film is too inept for any level of enjoyment where's dolph lundgren when you need him
<START> while house of wax will never be mistaken for texas chainsaw massacre or halloween it does try and ultimately succeed in being a worthy addition to quality horror film making there is enough tension and enough implied gore in here to please the young audience of today and there is also enough explicit gore to please some of the <UNK> of yesterday overall it is quite a well done film that should do okay on dvd br br six kids on the way to a football game get stranded in a deliverance like setting and what ensues actually looks like it may have been taken out a <UNK> sequel and the backwoods <UNK> seem to <UNK> the group eventually the group has to break up and half of them head into the desolate town to get some car parts the other half of the group stays behind at camp and this sets up the second half of the film br br house of wax has many strengths the first is that it is blessed with a very likable cast paris hilton is fine in her role but she is far from the <UNK> point <UNK> michael murray <UNK> <UNK> and brian van holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds some <UNK> some credibility and some flair i had never really heard of <UNK> michael murray only that he was a pin up type teen <UNK> but he has a presence to him he <UNK> an <UNK> to him that seems to translate into his performance he is instantly likable and he possesses a strong character <UNK> i enjoyed his performance much more than i figured i would and when he was on screen the film <UNK> br br the question now becomes is this film a worthy horror film and the answer to that is a <UNK> yes as i mentioned off the top it is not in the same class a nightmare on elm street or last house on the left or even the ring but it is relatively tense quite graphic and there are some very inventive death scenes this is not the house of wax that your parents told you about vincent price is nowhere to be seen and when you start seeing fingers being cut off and hot wax covering <UNK> bodies you realize this film is a little on the edge br br i'd like to see an uncut director's x rated version i bet there is one out there somewhere that would be much more violent than this one be that as it may this is a very good entry into the horror genre and it is heads and shoulders above weak films like i know what you did last summer and dark water and a few others it is definitely worth a look br br 8 10
<START> a bunch of teen dirt <UNK> are out in the forest riding around in circles they're having fun little do they know nature is about to be unleashed by an <UNK> <UNK> from a deliverance or hills have eyes movie he's armed with matches and fire and he's got an eye that's bleeding or something why torch a park i <UNK> maybe he doesn't like <UNK> the bear or something but he wears army navy store <UNK> if that helps br br the rangers send one single helicopter to battle the resulting <UNK> that's all you ever see except a bunch of people in a base somewhere talking a lot about the fire but doing nothing some cop or ranger or <UNK> or whatever he is drops from the helicopter on a <UNK> <UNK> br br everybody now rides their dirt <UNK> like they're <UNK> for <UNK> they forever pop <UNK> do <UNK> <UNK> jumps spin around etc they argue <UNK> shots of the fire are as phony as a 3 dollar bill it's the same footage from a dozen different angles and the <UNK> never grows or moves and you still never once see any fire fighting equipment br br <UNK> channel movie which has about 0 science fiction attached to it what you can expect from this bad acting cheap effects and a story that goes nowhere like the <UNK> and fire go nowhere laughable <UNK> cure
<START> interesting tale of giant <UNK> elephants running amok in modern india features transparent special effects elephants dressed in shaggy <UNK> sporting <UNK> <UNK> all this said we do have a good story and a fine cast at work and an exciting climax it's been said that the running time on this one was <UNK> when it showed in india courtesy of robert a master at ' given a choice <UNK> for the shorter version
<START> i'm not from usa i'm from central europe and i think the show is amazingly good it can be easily compared with married with children my title says that it isn't show for conservative public i mean i'm not so liberal but it may be slight difference between european <UNK> and us cons anyway show is starting to be very popular in our area and it's very bad that it contains only two seasons last episode opens many continuous and funny moments anyway i and many peoples would be glad if that would continue playing the last thing i'm thrilled about this is some moral education very nice packed into humorous scenes i mean i have seen many comedies that has over two and even more minutes of very sad in tragic scenes that absolutely don't fit into comedy war doesn't contain something like that and is made for laughing it's like the simpsons and married whose also don't have any sad or even unfunny moments i'm <UNK> for my awful knowledge of english but i still hope that you will understand what i meant
<START> this is one of the best thrillers i've seen it's intelligently made and brilliantly filmed and is one of the few thrillers that creates complex interesting characters and makes the movie about them not the action i would recommend it to just about anyone especially people who like movies with both style and substance
<START> most definitely the saddest movie i have ever seen a must see just so you can walk away and realise just how precious your life and loves are the acting is superb the story line potentially <UNK> br br remains a firm favourite of mine even after all this time
<START> not a bad <UNK> i was expecting another film based on <UNK> issues but was pleasantly surprised at the element of suspense sure parts of the plot were pretty hokey but for the most part the movie kept me guessing was the nut bar connected with the ex husband somebody in the <UNK> or was it the guy person that she cut off daniel was excellent i've seen him in mom's on strike and in guilt by association both and he is very <UNK> especially the way he challenges his mother the way a <UNK> would typically act br br laura <UNK> also played the typical mother ex wife that both men and women can relate to she was frustrated enough to seem real br br see it if you missed it it's worthwhile
<START> okay so this <UNK> what i was expecting i rented this film just to see how it would be since i want to see the first one anyway but this film had b movie all over it but when i watched it i realized that it was very funny for the first 30 minutes it was just how the snowman was people and one man losing his sanity but those first few minutes had some funny one liners in it when he throws up the first of his little <UNK> i knew this would be very very funny they all act like the <UNK> in the <UNK> four hit <UNK> that it made it look like it was <UNK> it and made me forget it was a b movie so if you like to laugh rent this one
<START> the plot in <UNK> certainly left this viewer <UNK> br br spoiler br br in the space of <UNK> or so character has an affair with a teenager loses his wife's affections attempts to seduce scott thomas is rejected by her goes on to <UNK> yet another female character in the back of a car and then is finally shot for his trouble br br end of spoiler br br <UNK> br br the only saving grace in this flick is <UNK> scott thomas similar to charlotte <UNK> she seems a natural to star in french cinema my hope is that one day <UNK> <UNK> may cast her in a part where she can show her true talent br br there are some fine french films such as the remarkable le colonel <UNK> begging for a dvd release yet this is the tripe that gets chosen br br avoid this one br br <UNK>
<START> a film about an interesting and sensitive period of history filmed in beautiful surroundings managed to present an <UNK> trivial and clich√©d production grossly clumsy script poor continuity <UNK> <UNK> music <UNK> casting and <UNK> acting br br it was a toss up between the script and the acting as to which was worse the script probably won the historical background <UNK> and character <UNK> were <UNK> out in painful detail in the dialogue actually words can't describe quite how bad this film is br br in a pre release screening there was a massive <UNK> from about thirty minutes in at about an hour many of those who remained were laughing <UNK> i should add i am a <UNK> i am fascinated by canada and love historical film this really was a one off
<START> this is a great show despite many negative user reviews the aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number simple the fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal br br some appear to hate the show for various reasons but i think they misunderstood this as an educational show on how to pick up chicks well it is not it is a comedy show and the whole point of it is to make you laugh not teach you anything if you didn't like the show because it doesn't teach you anything don't watch it if you don't like the whole <UNK> thing don't watch it if you don't like <UNK> don't watch it this show is a comical show if you down by watching others pick up girls well its not making you laugh so don't watch it if you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you don't have the ability to pick up girls there is no reason to hate the show simply don't watch it
<START> i just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it the synopsis was listed in our program as an old shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party i wasn't sure if i was going to see it because when i read about it i liked the idea of a suicide party it sounded very interesting to me but old shakespearean actor had me worried that the film would be kind of dry and boring but i decided to give it a try i am glad that i did it was not dry and boring in the least that dialogue was great funny in a clever way but not pretentious and difficult to understand peter falk was terrific in this role he stole the show i also was pleasantly surprised by laura san performance usually she bugs me but i enjoyed watching her in this film very much i think judge part could have been done better by another actor at times he seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting not like you were just watching this character but the movie was so good i was able to forgive one actor's <UNK> i would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public who knew suicide could be so hilarious
<START> the 1998 version of psycho needed to be set back in the 60's rather than present day the <UNK> would have done a good job with the setting there were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb the first one was at the beginning of the movie when <UNK> <UNK> anne <UNK> was sitting at her desk her boss took his client into his office because it was air <UNK> i imagine that the majority of arizona <UNK> have air <UNK> the other was the meeting of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moore sam <UNK> viggo <UNK> <UNK> sporting the <UNK> seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie the movie did <UNK> a number of the viewers in the theater
<START> tries so hard tries to be light hearted tries to be a comedy tries to be a love affair let's see it tries to be a <UNK> girl by way of 'the by way of <UNK> happened one <UNK> by way of a dozen sports movies alas trying isn't doing and the movie is as <UNK> as the last <UNK> field br br a fan of movies would watch the big fight scene in the <UNK> between the and some soldiers and realize that the fights that john ford staged with such style and <UNK> and humor in movies like 'the quiet man' or or 'the may have seemed easy to do but obviously aren't i would bet george clooney thought <UNK> john ford would be easy as well how hard could it be <UNK> run amok punches <UNK> broken over heads an <UNK> piano player just put it up there on the screen with some happening music sorry it takes a master to make fight scenes flow br br movies aren't wished into existence humor is hard romance is hard slapstick a lost art br br i once read that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet performance something about not wanting to <UNK> the fantastic bubble of the performance by hearing the <UNK> of the <UNK> feet or the <UNK> of the lifts this movie is like that all strain and good intentions handsome actors nice sets but it <UNK> through its <UNK> rather than <UNK> like the original <UNK> ghost red <UNK> who the movie is loosely based on
<START> imagination must of slipped jim <UNK> mind when he wrote the script to this one i don't mind when the animals scenes are almost identical but when the actors repeat lines from other movies is going a little too far i did enjoy seeing jay richardson and ann gilbert get eaten gloria brings nothing to a movie but her tits my husbands sentiments <UNK> should of stayed on survival island her acting is stiff unbelievable and she just a plain <UNK> liked the scene where the <UNK> comes out of the ocean eats the guy then for added flavor destroys the <UNK> at least we know the next plot giant snake man <UNK> <UNK> before becoming daddy to a nest of eggs <UNK> would be great as the mother <UNK> sit back with a 6 <UNK> or a couple of <UNK> it will ease the pain
<START> when i saw the first preview for this i nearly passed out from excitement i have long been a fan of <UNK> night it turned me on to shakespeare so to have a modern adaption is a dream come true my anticipation was not disappointed br br the plot basically follows the original storyline and that means complicated i don't want to even try to relate it the plot <UNK> will probably cover the <UNK> just imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a <UNK> school and think of all the possible situations that would create i will not even pause to question the <UNK> of such a plot reality is not the point of the film br br what it is though is absolutely hilarious nearly every scene nails the comedic set up kudos to the writers director and actors on that count br br amanda <UNK> is the star of this film and she carries it wonderfully she's super cute not a <UNK> and can do <UNK> comedy i admire her so much for not going full on tramp in her films or public life like so many <UNK> today do i'm glad there is at least one decent young actress left in hollywood ok i'm off my soap box br br <UNK> <UNK> yeah he's hot and built like a <UNK> gorilla but he really makes me laugh my favourite scenes in the whole movie are when he's trying to <UNK> with olivia first by talking about cheese and then later about his <UNK> <UNK> br br the rest of the cast did not fail to perform either with marvelous <UNK> to the characters in the forms of the inane <UNK> mother and <UNK> the classic evil girlfriend br br overall lots of fun of laughs and a highly attractive cast maybe not on par with the original but it beats out modern versions of other plays including the much <UNK> 10 things i hate about you
<START> the people of my generation and those who are older know about the <UNK> ii or as it is called in russia √¢¬Ä¬ì the great patriotic war not only from the school <UNK> but from the witnesses and participants of the event my <UNK> was a soldier at <UNK> and when i was a small girl i used to listen to his stories of how he defeated the germans he also told me some <UNK> not all he told me was gloomy but it was long ago and no when i have a conscious interest for what happened there in the battle of <UNK> i have to turn to books and movies for information somehow most films i saw were made in the soviet union only a few in present day russia and is an exception in the movie the war is described from the opposite side and the fact in itself is interesting all that is shown in the film is quite different from what <UNK> used to br br the film reminds me a great deal of zu <UNK> <UNK> zu because the war is shown through an ordinary german soldier perception and this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist the movie heroes right from neat and enthusiastic europe from the italian coast arrive in the snow covered hungry soviet union they are doomed to die it is clear from the very beginning br br after the elite <UNK> had taken part in their first fight at <UNK> one of the soldiers said the phrase which reflected the whole idea for me he said you start thinking you will go and to my mind it is true for <UNK> as well from the one hand one may think ok just watch this movie and it <UNK> me i feel sorry for the people on the screen as it were they who attacked my country and not vice versa however sooner or later but inevitably one starts <UNK> with the characters probably when the lieutenant <UNK> back his tears at seeing execution br br is hard to watch all these <UNK> legs dirt <UNK> snow <UNK> destroyed <UNK> br br as far as i know lt hans von is one of the few films where thomas <UNK> played his star roles i watched quite many hollywood movies where he was given <UNK> parts of small <UNK> such as or why did he do it and after i had watched i cannot make out the european actors desire to appear in american movies even second rated at any cost the fact <UNK> me deeply i believe thomas <UNK> deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he is given in hollywood and out of what i saw with him is the best beyond the doubt br br in my opinion the worst <UNK> is the way they speak russian in the movie i mean of course those who are supposed to be russian say the boy who spent some time with the germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape was it really so difficult to find actors able to <UNK> a couple of phrases without that horrible accent initially i set down to watch just to listen to native german <UNK> because <UNK> studying the language i did not expect anything extraordinary of the film but it impressed me made me cry when i <UNK> going to at all i know <UNK> 15 years late to watch it but is not a run of the mill movie and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking
<START> this story of the troubles caused by an over <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mother laura hope <UNK> for her two grown sons and their girls is a strong vehicle for stellar performances by irene <UNK> the new daughter in law joel <UNK> the number one son eric <UNK> the number two son and frances dee <UNK> of number two son here's the show of the pure <UNK> of mother's jealousy and <UNK> run amok as four good people find their owns lives damaged their plans changed and their own identities in <UNK> irene <UNK> is stellar in her role joel performance is open and clear and laura hope <UNK> is masterful as the mother br br yet this reviewer finds frances <UNK> performance the best of all hers is the first character in the story to show the strength of her inner feelings her portrayal in her <UNK> broken engagement scene is gut wrenching and even raw dee <UNK> the viewer around and drives you into her pain without even showing her face br br frances dee like laura hope <UNK> has been too long overlooked and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress that she was no actress who started in film after wwii has had anything to speak of on frances dee br br if you're lucky enough to see the silver <UNK> which was never released for tv you'll find this old fashioned drawing room drama to be an outstanding film that shows very well <UNK> years after its 1933 release because it is filled with superb performances
<START> i saw this as a kid before it had been <UNK> from the <UNK> and even then it left a bad taste in my mouth there were some competently worked out gags but making slapstick villains out of american citizens who'd been <UNK> in camps strictly due to their race was amazingly tasteless br br moe himself might have wanted this one buried he was a liberal guy in his autobiography he told of visiting a town in the <UNK> south where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close moe stepped into the street to show it wasn't a problem and the man then got back on the <UNK> then off again finally the man told moe <UNK> that if moe didn't stop trying to share the sidewalk with him he might get them both <UNK> br br another thing there are exploding <UNK> eggs but no in the film so the title should actually be if anyone cares the on me
<START> this is a top car flick its a work of art <UNK> a work of art all classic cars no plastic fantastic i have watched it over over again i have worn out two video tapes and will wear out lots more lots more car lovers young or old will love this film watch it more than 1 time so hire it or buy it just see it i wish they would make more car movies like this power not <UNK> up little <UNK> br br <UNK> a right <UNK> magic the heap the <UNK> br br you've got to learn to feel the power
<START> i own this movie and it is terribly hard to find it is a unique low budget little gore flick about a doctor seeking the perfect companion it has the really <UNK> low budget feel to it and the gore is <UNK> good for what appears to be a 500 budget the director is claimed to be the master of gore i wouldn't go that far but maybe in his time he was overall 6 10 on the gore <UNK>
<START> in the century an architect by the name of <UNK> bruce <UNK> a space station which he personally designed as can be predicted a special force is sent to <UNK> the expensive station and put <UNK> into custody upon arrival they find him <UNK> in a weird ritual with the use of a mysterious during <UNK> he reveals that they must let him finish what he has started or else the hell he has released will <UNK> in blood in order to convince the officers holding him captive he <UNK> about his <UNK> about the <UNK> who built the box and about the reasons as to why he is here in space br br the movie that is essentially the same to <UNK> that the was to <UNK> something to be ignored and forgotten as so it won't influence the <UNK> of <UNK> to much by far the most trashy of the franchise with a much more low grade feel to it than its predecessors who let's face it were b or c class films br br acting at times seems to be influenced by a mid budget porn flick with wooden unbelievable performances that actually have you thinking so when are they going to <UNK> and start with the <UNK> surprisingly not much sex in the movie albeit the introduction of the <UNK> demon <UNK> a totally superfluous character that unnecessarily <UNK> with what we know of the world of <UNK> offers ample opportunities for the love making br br basically the movie consists of three abruptly <UNK> together separate short stories one in the future one in the present and one in the past which lack focus and are rushed along in amateurish fashion the end result is extremely poor basically <UNK> by the fact you have no interest into what happens to any of the characters in the film br br some decent gore in the flick but apart from that an utter failure
<START> snow queen is based of course on the fairy tale of the same name <UNK> in at least <UNK> fairy tales and unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales this one <UNK> the spirit of <UNK> an accomplishment not easy and not well understood by many especially among americans talking animals <UNK> <UNK> appearances of <UNK> dragons and demons are not to be <UNK> in a fairy tale they are as natural an element of <UNK> as say gravity is in the scientific world and the reason or explanation for them is completely beside the point of the story nor is the story bound by modern hollywood rules of composition direct often to the point of being <UNK> linear in lesser works and obvious in retrospect at least br br with this <UNK> against the common criticisms of those who do not understand fairy tales snow queen is a delightful movie with wonderful visual effects <UNK> acting and great sentiment the only flaw in the movie was i think not that it was too <UNK> but that certain parts of the dialogue were too <UNK> modern in <UNK> and expression a <UNK> on its otherwise timeless nature
<START> roy <UNK> film <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> a series of fifty odd sketches <UNK> and vignettes set in a swedish city some characters are on screen for just a few second whilst others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen <UNK> in the background while another story unfolds many scenes are drawn from the dreams nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters <UNK> this world it is a fascinating approach each of the scenes could be enjoyed in isolation but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human br br for the first half hour or so <UNK> the <UNK> is <UNK> funny much of the humour <UNK> on the members of a <UNK> band whose music practice <UNK> the <UNK> in their apartment block the comic highlight however is provided by a dinner party track gone horribly awry after this hilarious introduction however the mood of the film <UNK> considerably the dinner party dream turns grim when the hapless protagonist is put on trial for his life setting a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film br br in the subsequent scenes the <UNK> of the cast of characters becomes increasingly apparent theirs is a world where people are unable to connect with one another where talk of dreams nightmares and fantasies is <UNK> but where no person can be <UNK> even when others reach out to help them the <UNK> woman with the <UNK> loves <UNK> <UNK> and the young girl with <UNK> love for the rock <UNK> are <UNK> characters br br the world of <UNK> the <UNK> is also <UNK> by <UNK> an elderly professor is called away the warmth of a vast <UNK> to answer a phone call from his <UNK> money <UNK> son a thief steals the <UNK> of a ruthless executive an arrogant and <UNK> businessman insults a muslim <UNK> and receives his <UNK> in the film's <UNK> moment a woman in church <UNK> the long list of human sins as her fellow <UNK> <UNK> out at closing time br br and yet for all dark moments in this film the shared <UNK> of is another <UNK> points to the ability of people to go on living in spite of many <UNK> the soundtrack provided by benny anderson of <UNK> fame seems <UNK> <UNK> at first but makes more and more sense as the film realises this human capacity to <UNK> br br <UNK> the <UNK> has an extraordinary visual style the same washed out pale green colours <UNK> throughout and there is <UNK> a shadow in sight this makes the characters appear exceptionally <UNK> and creates the sensation that human life is being laid bare for examination almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame as if these are photographs being brought to life the few occasions where the camera does move are all the more extraordinary the contrast between the life and movement of the great <UNK> form a startling contrast with the <UNK> of the scene in the most intense moments of longing and despair the characters the viewer by directly facing the camera ¬ñ they know that they are being examined and have a few moments to pour out their hearts to us the viewers br br this is a wonderful human film
<START> i was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out commercials for it made it look quirky and i generally like morgan freeman and chris rock and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea sadly i was terribly disappointed with nurse betty br br personally i've usually found that graphic violence and comedy don't go all that well together and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully in my opinion are tarantino and the there isn't that much violence in nurse betty but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when i was supposed to laugh of course for me part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where i was being asked to br br the film doesn't much work as a drama either <UNK> betty the story's protagonist is <UNK> insane and impossible to relate to in any real way i will say <UNK> acts the role quite well and freeman rock and greg kinnear all do good jobs too the problem is in the writing freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character it's really too bad 3 10
<START> this film tells the stories of several couples <UNK> with post wwii life through many moving accounts the audience learns how the war has changed people while their human spirit went on to triumph br br my favorite scene is where a young service man who returned home as a double <UNK> after losing both arms up to the <UNK> is sure that he would be no good to his sweetheart who still wants to marry him his girl simply said that she would help him with the things he wouldn't be able to do but that they would be fine together moved by this true <UNK> of love the man <UNK> his fianc√©e in tears br br the scene where a service man asked for a bank <UNK> is also a highlight when he is initially refused as a high risk a higher <UNK> bank official takes over saying you fought for our country and kept us safe that's good enough for me your <UNK> is <UNK> the best years of our lives won 6 oscars including a special <UNK> for the disabled actor who showed us all that life goes on and will continue to be worth living even with a severe <UNK> this film is a joy to watch over and over again a true classic highly recommended
<START> br br there is something about seeing a movie in a good old fashioned movie house that adds enormous appeal to every picture i fortunately enough was able to see at film forum in new york city a pair of <UNK> lubitsch comedies during their three week tribute to the legendary director the double feature i attended was a screening of <UNK> 1938 comedy <UNK> wife and the pre code classic design for living neither of which i had seen before everything i read of design for living praised the film but i could not find a good review anywhere for <UNK> wife leonard <UNK> disliked it too gave the comedy a low rating its imdb score was not <UNK> and pauline <UNK> not a great surprise <UNK> the film in her <UNK> review so when i went into the city that day i was expecting to enjoy <UNK> wife only slightly and love design for living completely <UNK> wife which was showing first began as the <UNK> who <UNK> the cinema took their seats and the thirties music <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> presents <UNK> <UNK> and gary cooper in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wife ' the title card read then the picture opened with a hilarious scene cooper wants to buy a pair of tops but he doesn't want any part of the <UNK> he gets into a <UNK> with the clerk who seeks the help of his higher bosses and their seems to be no end to the argument enter <UNK> <UNK> one of thirties <UNK> most beautiful charming and talented personalities i'll take the bottom ' she kindly <UNK> and there you have perhaps screwball comedies finest meet <UNK> ever the film kept my interest wonderfully i found myself laughing almost constantly when <UNK> discovers just before a family portrait is taken that her <UNK> to be has been married seven times the entire theatre broke into when she <UNK> for money immediately after she gets over her shock the laughs which still haven't <UNK> <UNK> and edward everett <UNK> <UNK> some hilarious reactions out of the script as well when cooper takes inspiration from shakespeare's the <UNK> of the <UNK> in <UNK> his wife by <UNK> her in the face i could not control my laughter when she slapped him back and the drunk scene with the is one of <UNK> <UNK> funniest comic scenes the greatest comic moment of the film came when <UNK> a boxer to teach her husband a lesson ' in pure screwball fashion he knocks out the wrong man instead putting her friend david niven into a cold sleep he <UNK> as cooper is arriving in order to cover up the situation <UNK> herself in a moment of strong <UNK> puts her fist up to niven asks where did that man hit you here right here right here ' and then <UNK> knocks him out again the film was wonderful from beginning to end it was a perfect delight i loved design for living too though i dare say i think for sheer laughs and entertainment <UNK> wife was the better and more enjoyable film there is some charm of seeing a vintage film on the large screen and in the presence of others laughing one feels more comfortable doing so himself that is perhaps why i felt the way i did about <UNK> wife
<START> as most other reviewers seem to agree this adaptation of <UNK> the is very good indeed always one of my favourite <UNK> stories i was worried that it might be about <UNK> well it was a little bit but only a little bit and the end the result was thoroughly entertaining david <UNK> continues to be well <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> and as others have pointed out the other star of this show is monica <UNK> who surely could not be <UNK> as miss <UNK> i also really enjoyed <UNK> who was spot on as the cutting <UNK> <UNK> but really the casting was quite impeccable throughout br br one point is knocked off for the not being able to resist <UNK> too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes the business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although i didn't mind how they <UNK> up the structure of the family in the book the family tree is really quite complicated the final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and i found the very end when they all leave quite touching this is really one of the very best of the <UNK> series so far
<START> after i've seen this movie i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie i'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times but in it's genre it is a great movie i know not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like <UNK> is turned into a comedy many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with they are wrong br br mel brooks has done an excellent job with robin hood men in <UNK> i have seen the original robin hood movies as well but i never had such a good time when watching them as i had with this one it's just one <UNK> of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies winston the godfather br br i recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie to those who think robin hood shouldn't be messed with you're wrong but you better don't watch it because you'll probably be offended by it i give this movie an 8 10
<START> this film just doesn't work no two ways about it i saw it for the first time back in <UNK> when it was released and i didn't like it i just bought it on sale a couple of days ago 'cause i thought hell i'll give it a try i don't regret for the money i put out for hamilton but the fact remained the same this movie is pointless dull and uninteresting br br <UNK> is usually a delight but that's when he's making films in the us back home he doesn't do the trick sure the movie is well made if you forget the odd stock footage but in the end the only thing that really lifts hamilton above one star garbage is <UNK> turn as the bad guy <UNK> he seriously has fun with the character and is also responsible for the only two good moments in the movie swedish intelligence huh now there's a <UNK> in terms and when he allows hamilton to have a word or two with his wife over the phone towards the end of the flick and that's really pretty much it br br
<START> spoilers ahead this same exact plot from this movie has been done before it has been done in <UNK> <UNK> day off bat man <UNK> plays sick his <UNK> parents believe him his sister knows that he's <UNK> but she still must go to school she is mad he has a party with his friends while his parents are away by the time his parents get home he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party i like immature better when they were in house party 3 and still immature
<START> i can't imagine why it hasn't been <UNK> released yet it's got a great ensemble cast with sutherland lane and especially chris evans doing spectacular work wake up studio <UNK> br br the story is based upon the experiences of the author screenwriter growing up as the poor kid in an extremely <UNK> community where class is everything and makes a difference in every aspect of life from clothing to justice br br during the film's q a the author was asked about his experiences and particularly what we don't know about the ultra rich he said they aren't stupid they're very smart as opposed to how they may portray themselves they've got plans and they are a threat br br in many ways this film is extremely <UNK>
<START> the film version of came out two years after the television series ended like many fans i <UNK> went along to the cinema when it opened i came away <UNK> disappointed eric could not have spent very much time writing the script most of it is <UNK> ideas from old episodes at the time of the film's release the series was still being repeated regularly on i t v so the public was being asked to pay to see something they'd seen already at least the <UNK> the movies <UNK> original screenplays br br secondly richard beckinsale had died the year before so they eliminated the character of as a mark of respect <UNK> art student <UNK> played by christopher of <UNK> when i fame it simply wasn't the same br br as another poster has pointed out <UNK> house looked nothing like the one used in the series being bigger and altogether <UNK> br br director joe <UNK> was one of the directors who worked on the original <UNK> <UNK> a film <UNK> in surreal humour also has its share of <UNK> style fantasy sequences such as the <UNK> night parody personally i found them horribly out of place a case of <UNK> <UNK> the br br on the plus side leonard is as magnificent as ever as the seedy as are frances de la tour as and don as its just a shame the film isn't worthy of their talents br br when died in 1984 it was shown by i t v as a tribute with its final scene showing laying <UNK> at the foot of the stairs removed in the interests of good taste
<START> i am a big fan of the 1995 version which i have seen many times and consider a subtle excellent film this 1971 version i bought yesterday a bit <UNK> but now that i have seen it i am glad i did because it is <UNK> to the book and to <UNK> insights the 1995 version has more dramatic power largely because it <UNK> many of the characters in the 1995 version lady russell is more manipulative less truly looking out for anne sir walter is even more vain and vapid elizabeth is <UNK> mary is more <UNK> mr elliot is more smarmy lady <UNK> is much more stupid but i think the characterizations in this 1971 version are closer to the book to <UNK> vision and to the real people of the time the 1971 version also includes more of the key lines and scenes from the book including especially the key scene in the field where anne <UNK> <UNK> talking to <UNK> or is it <UNK> about the importance of strength of character i found the acting more subtle and <UNK> than do many of the critics here but the acting in the 1995 version is more powerful i agree with the critics here that the actress who plays anne is too old for the part i looked up her entry on imdb and she was <UNK> at the time of the filming when her character is supposed to be 28 i thought her acting was subtle and effective however <UNK> is of the correct age and i found him very convincing in particular this 1971 version of <UNK> has much more of his sense of humor and <UNK> the 1995 one much more of the sense of power a sea captain would have and more passion the <UNK> in the 1971 version lacks the gruff presence and human warmth of the one in the 1995 version and lacks any feeling of the power an <UNK> certainly would convey i found him the one truly weak element in the production i agree with others that the staging of the falling scene was too wooden and it seemed unconvincing that she would have been so injured by such a little fall however it could be that she <UNK> the back of her head on the edge of the stone step which if so really would produce a very dangerous injury and would make the scene more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version where she falls <UNK> but is clear of any sharp edge that could <UNK> cause a major head injury as to the <UNK> that some have criticized i am no expert and can't respond but i will note that none of the navy characters <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the 1971 version wear their uniforms while in the 1995 version all of them consistently wear their fancy uniforms i suspect that the 1971 version is the accurate one and it always bothered me a bit in the 1995 version the officers being always in uniform when clearly the nation is at peace and the officers are detached from active duty my father and grandfather were career us navy <UNK> who <UNK> aircraft <UNK> and <UNK> and they did not spend every day while on leave or at <UNK> in their dress blues i doubt it was any different <UNK> years ago the uniforms give the 1995 version a lot of <UNK> and i prefer it but i doubt it is accurate historically that these officers wore their uniforms so frequently lastly it is true the production values of the 1971 version are a lot less than the 1995 version but given the year 1971 the tv format and the budget we can't blame the artists for it contemporary viewers who can make a mental <UNK> for the lower production values can find this version well worth their time
<START> despite the fact that this was a made for tv movie and an obvious one at that ie cheap looking class <UNK> left me wishing i could get my money back and considering this lame production was partially <UNK> through canadian dollars i might just be entitled br br what made me sit through it in the first place was seeing actress lindsey who i've watched for the last couple years in her role as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lewis on the soap opera <UNK> light taking a turn at playing the bad girl for a change br br surprisingly she does quite well as <UNK> a spoiled rich b <UNK> who suddenly finds herself dirt poor but with a conniving streak and a twist of fate that will possibly change her <UNK> back around the twist of fate is provided in the character of richard robin dunne a socially radical <UNK> who discovers that he has just gone from having nothing to winning 23 million on a <UNK> ticket now put richard <UNK> her jock boyfriend jason <UNK> carpenter and their camcorder obsessed mutual buddy graham dave together for the weekend in a remote cabin cut off from the world by <UNK> and just guess what unfolds br br the film suffers from both the story and and motives too much everyone is pretty one dimensional and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that some things and some people are going to go very bad very quickly i don't think this is that original a plot and it doesn't go out of it's way to make itself anything more the acting is ok is spot on as the manipulative female lead and dunne is very good perhaps a little too good at times but no one else is worth writing home about the only other real credit i can give the film is the one twist i didn't see coming towards the end not the very end though that one is so obvious it hurts regardless i sat through all of it and lived to tell the tale so i can't say it was a complete write off br br 4 10 a something to watch when nothing else is on type movie
<START> this was recommended to me by a friend that said it was cute and <UNK> for a lesbian sexuality flick boy was he wrong i guess he just didn't get it growing up not understanding and then discovering yourself thru trial and <UNK> is more like it br br the characters are full and vibrant and the story has enough fun thrown in thru the theater performances to keep anyone interested br br <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> goes thru so many tries at finding the love she desires only to find it was the one person she was scared to reveal all too and ran out on may as <UNK> was remarkable spent a couple hours trying to recall where i've seen her before only to discover she was the quiet sister alice in last of the <UNK> luckily i was raised in a liberal family and had no issues with trying a movie like this so many people are missing out on flicks like this i'm glad i took my friend's advise and tried it but i'm sure i enjoyed it more the he
<START> i remember seeing this movie <UNK> years ago and it was full of suspense and twists it grabs you at the beginning and keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie i have thought about this movie for the past several years and have checked in video stores to see if it's available but was never able to find it or anyone who had even heard of it i think this type of movie is timeless and i know it would be enjoyed by a whole new generation of movie <UNK> i hope this gets on video soon as it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as it did back in the early 70's br br it's very rare that a tv movie can make that much of an impression but this was did and still does after so many years
<START> the opening was a steal from eight <UNK> freaks a film that is everything this one isn't stilted and pedestrian are the words that apply along with others that can't be repeated drifter type returns to his home town meets up with old friends etc the usual annoying kid single mother local <UNK> and so on bad special effects alien ship atmospheric <UNK> hey didn't the director see close encounters good acting good story good camera angles good cutting not here do not rent unless you are sharing the cost and have a lot of beer handy do not watch on tv go and drink a lot of beer instead you'll enjoy it more
<START> i know i know it's difficult if not <UNK> for there to be such a thing as believable fantasy but to me there is also such a condition <UNK> too much <UNK> with or <UNK> from my overall opinion of the movie the latter was the case for me with regard to <UNK> <UNK> not only did i have too many unanswered questions concerning the storyline but some of the acting too i thought was a bit over the top maybe though it was the writing asking them to <UNK> too many trite predictable cliched over reactions others have said enough about the plot i just wish that it was done and i think that it could have been more convincingly p s this is a fresh comment about this film i just finished watching it a couple of minutes ago not a <UNK> from years ago
<START> my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardian at first i didn't want to watch it but i loved the movie it was definitely the best movie i have seen in sometime they portrayed the very well it really showed me what they do and i think they should really be appreciated more not only did it teach but it was a really good movie the movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is i think being a would be challenging and very scary it was a great movie all around i would suggest this movie for anyone to see the ending broke my heart but i know why he did it the storyline was great i give it 2 thumbs up i cried it was very emotional i would give it a 20 if i could
<START> as a recent <UNK> to <UNK> your enthusiasm which <UNK> my viewing of all <UNK> episodes i expected more much more from <UNK> efforts br br when i view a film offering a slice of an average life i need reasons to be interested to care to feel and believe and with jeff at the <UNK> i also expected a <UNK> of shining comedic moments this film failed me time and again br br jeff plays a living with mom <UNK> sad sack who is a social disaster he has not had a relationships real or even casual for many years he appears to be mostly unemployed and as noted <UNK> with his <UNK> <UNK> can things get worse sure in short order he gets <UNK> by everyone around him including silverman second city his comedy <UNK> and his agent all <UNK> his <UNK> status <UNK> <UNK> experiment was as cruel as it was absurd his obsession with the role of marty as the means of his <UNK> salvation also hits a big dead end br br while the film's final moments offer a glimpse of better things to come the cinematic ' albeit with occasional golden <UNK> was sadly lacking
<START> h o t s is a fun film for a trip back to when skin flicks had a more positive fun filled agenda they were made simply to <UNK> and have a few laughs everything seems less cynical and jaded the girls all have natural figures and some are playboy <UNK> the simple plot deals with a group of young women who open a non <UNK> <UNK> house to get back at the <UNK> <UNK> girls who <UNK> and insulted them instead of the mean spirited tricks of today most of the <UNK> are simply innocent fun the women are decent actresses for this genre and are mostly very attractive to keep our attention between the topless scenes we have mafia henchmen a stolen bear a hot air balloon a funky house mother and the <UNK> robot ever seen there's even danny of the <UNK> family if you have a sense of humor then let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment
<START> i had heard about this movie through a friend it was supposed to be a thriller but what i watched wasn't a thriller it was more like a weak attempt at one <UNK> smith was a bright spot that may be giving her too much credit the scenes were she was in bed with actress erika were also lame the two actresses did not seem to click with each other at all <UNK> smith was way out of this <UNK> league and it definitely showed on camera she did not seem into those scenes at all i was disappointed because a friend of mine guy of course had <UNK> this movie up to be something great but it was actually more like watching dime store porn
<START> maybe i was to young when i saw it perhaps i have not grown up with grease and elvis movies br br i failed to get it i get black comedy black <UNK> etc i get irony and spoofs i don't get this one though br br i made it a quest to find out the name of this movie <UNK> the help of people on <UNK> and the most excellent imdb message boards so it could be my first 1 <UNK> awful
<START> total crap br br i was kind of excited to see this as it is the only film version i have seen of <UNK> park i suffered through the first four episodes but when it came to the <UNK> scene between henry and <UNK> i <UNK> and had to turn it off whoever employs this le lady has got to be both blind and deaf cause the woman is the worst actress i've ever seen in my life the whole thing is just bad bad bad i don't know i just don't know why people who write jane austen screenplays seem to be incapable of giving her work the respect it deserves
<START> i'm <UNK> the later reviews have turned sour reading all the positive <UNK> i was starting to worry that my understanding of movies and life was completely different than everyone else's in the world everything in this movie <UNK> false to me the characters the dialogue the manipulative soundtrack the corny narration all of it as each scene <UNK> i kept thinking people don't act like this it's relentlessly heavy handed and <UNK> in a way i think the movie bullies you into liking it or pretending to like it because it's serious and about real people and confronts issues but man it really did not work for me
<START> as a young <UNK> beautiful joan <UNK> as rita adams was <UNK> after her <UNK> <UNK> father was shot to death as a young woman ms <UNK> finds herself struggling to keep a job as her murdered father's ex convict status makes <UNK> a bad business risk <UNK> rooms with understanding linda <UNK> as donna andrews who <UNK> <UNK> to get in touch with old <UNK> friends john archer as bob elliott and jack la <UNK> as mickey roman but none of her friends can help when <UNK> is the victim of a <UNK> which lands her in prison upon release <UNK> decides to give the male <UNK> a run for their <UNK> br br re titled gangs inc this is an obviously weak cheap mobster melodrama still it's a lot of fun to watch <UNK> work wonders with inferior material she plays the innocent growing more sophisticated rita quite convincingly and she <UNK> in a great bit as a blonde hooker <UNK> must be added to the list of unfortunately <UNK> hollywood actresses of the past paper bullets also features an early alan <UNK> as jimmy kelly aka bill <UNK> ms <UNK> who sang the hit an apple for the teacher with bing crosby sings a couple of fair <UNK> numbers nicely but mainly it's show br br paper bullets 1941 phil <UNK> joan <UNK> linda <UNK> alan <UNK>
<START> ok you people need to settle down this movie is not that bad i saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it i do have to admit that i have never been a fan of <UNK> <UNK> but she grew on me in this movie i do think josh <UNK> is good looking but c'mon chris <UNK> is the most gorgeous man i think i have ever seen he made that movie better for me c'mon girls when he has no shirt on and goes to get water i know your mouth dropped yes i know in the beginning he is a jerk but in the end he realizes how he acted and learns to be a great guy if he wouldn't have come at the end then i would have been mad i do think a couple of lines did not need to be said but all in all it was a great movie i definitely recommend it
<START> the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry his on screen presence <UNK> thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him i think that it is a must see older john wayne film
<START> i like the shepherd sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice van damme throws some nice kicks and so does <UNK> the story was average a texas cop battles <UNK> this movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action van damme was never a good actor i think this movie is better than van last 2 if you're looking for an oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you scott <UNK> is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art <UNK> but his movies in this movie are great van damme delivers strong kicks and it's good to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies this movie is definitely worth watching if you're a van damme fan
<START> an rko short subject br br a group of <UNK> little bullies are given a lesson in tolerance by <UNK> frank sinatra who <UNK> america to the house i live in br br this little film delivers a <UNK> message about the <UNK> of prejudice bias sinatra is an absolute natural in front of the camera intense sincere he is the perfect <UNK> for the values <UNK> here br br sinatra sings <UNK> house i live in ' by lewis allan earl robinson this fine tune with a solid pro american message is being given something of a comeback since the horrendous events of september 11 2001 br br after pearl harbor hollywood went to war totally against the <UNK> not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service but the <UNK> of the studios was largely turned to the war effort the <UNK> of course brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week the features <UNK> battle stories or war related themes even the short subjects cartoons were used as a quick means of <UNK> allied propaganda the <UNK> of <UNK> or information <UNK> together uncle sam the american people hollywood proved to be an <UNK> combination
<START> visually this film is interesting light is literally thrown in a way together with cinematography and an <UNK> introduction before the titles that had my hopes up at the start but then a b movie is a b movie is a b movie no matter how much spectacle is seen this film <UNK> the life of albert fish one of the most well known serial killers in the world active around the start of the 20th century life is <UNK> and <UNK> dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age this film is based upon two tracks life and that of william f king lead investigator of the case what saves this film from becoming a hallmark spectacle and <UNK> of the usual sort whenever films about serial killers are concerned is the direction which is a double edged sword director scott l flynn <UNK> focus enough upon the b actors not to let their flaws shine through too much but at the same times created a truly dull and stereotypical view of the american police through the king angle sure enough he dealt quite thoroughly with meet with grace <UNK> the 10 year old girl that he killed even though i'm not really sure if her mother was the media crazed person that flynn really tries to <UNK> that she was i miss more psychological diving into fish not to mention the very little time which was spent on post capture all in all interesting for those who are into serial killers but mostly a let down however if the director will make another film about another serial killer i'd definitely see it in hopes that holes were <UNK> up
<START> possibly the best john travolta role ever saturday night fever was a great movie role but a long time ago i can't think of many of his movies or roles i've even liked and it's easy to think of rotten ones he can do <UNK> like in pulp fiction but he makes the perfect funky angel and it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better equally <UNK> job with it plot <UNK> are available everywhere but the plot isn't the point just go for the ride and enjoy the <UNK> of the little along the way there is nothing to dislike about this movie unless one is searching for something profound i wish there were more movies like this we need a break from deep or awesome or grisly or complex or hysterical
<START> when i was young i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes i remember that i really liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his best now that i'm a little older i can say that although it's thoroughly average i still consider it one of his better films in an acting stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie serial killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention in contrast it's good to see where the current <UNK> has <UNK> from most obviously action movies as well as stalk <UNK> slashers of 70s and 80s while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham <UNK> and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film <UNK> for genre legend billy <UNK> as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but it's better than anything norris did in the 90s
<START> ok so i'm not usually one that runs out and <UNK> foreign movies especially foreign dark comedies i think i can count on one hand the number of films that i found genuinely hilarious from beginning to end this movie will be added to the short list even dark comedies right out of hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor but this one had my eyes <UNK> up with tears my sides hurt i haven't laughed that hard in a long time this movie was recommended by my mother and i don't think i would have even <UNK> of watching it had she not <UNK> about it don't be afraid of having to read during your movie you'll miss out on a hilariously well acted flick
<START> the prior comments are way to generous this movie is a waste of electricity and plastic on the other hand i have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as beyond belief no words can express how i feel about this this movie will move you as expected the friends took these <UNK> comments as enthusiastic <UNK> they were wrong the sadistic pleasure i had <UNK> this on people was well worth the 5 i paid for the movie on the other hand one former friend says i owe him 90 minutes of his life back i particularly enjoyed the <UNK> eye view of parts of the movie truly awesome in it's absurdity
<START> i must have seen this on the television when it was first broadcast some decades ago i thought it was brilliant then and as i remember so much of it now i may have been right while i have lived in and around london i cannot call myself a <UNK> and do not know it at all well who does other than taxi drivers once the viewer understands the premise that here is a group of men trying to learn the seemingly <UNK> able and rise to the status of <UNK> then the rest is sheer joy the characters are well <UNK> their family relationships are equally diverse and so differently affected by the events of the film don't think this is a documentary it is pure drama and the knowledge is one of the characters i have never seen anything like this film before or since watch it
<START> more and more french cinema demonstrates that's the only one able to confront hollywood's and to spend high amounts on money in their movies if bon voyage had been made in the usa no one would be surprised perfectly set in france in the 40's when the nazi invasion technically <UNK> and with some of the most international french actors depardieu <UNK> <UNK> bon voyage <UNK> on two parallel stories an scientific and his <UNK> <UNK> who tries to hide one of his <UNK> a kind of water that may work as an atomic bomb from the nazis and a poor guy in love with a well known actress <UNK> which ends up in prison accused of a crime he's not committed in order to protect her br br bon voyage seems to have been made in the old style without unnecessary camera movements and effects without big turns in the plot as i said before regarding to the production itself they've made a great job but the main problem with this movie is about the script is it a spy movie a romantic comedy a spy comedy a comedy of intrigue it's not clear that makes bon voyage a little <UNK> when you think you're watching a comedy suddenly changes to another story line a more dramatic one more slow i think they should've focused in one of the lines of argument the one about the spy plot and left the romantic parts in the background br br my rate 6 5 10
<START> ok i would give this a 1 but i'm gonna give it a two because i laughed while watching this film first of all i can make a much better movie than this one in a week the special effects made this film look like a joke one shouldn't make such films with horrible special effects because then people won't take it seriously the acting and direction was also horrible the screenplay had many plot holes and the whole film wasn't believable at all this has to be the worst indian film ever the songs were also bad the acting was bad and artificial need i say more don't watch this movie unless you are curious to see how bad it is that's why i watched it i am going into film and i wanted to see how bad a bad film can get trust me i watched one of the worst films in history if not the worst film
<START> this little flick is reminiscent of several other movies but manages to keep its own style mood <UNK> don't be afraid of the dark come to mind the suspense <UNK> were good just cross the line from g to pg i especially liked the non cliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog <UNK> but the writing in this movie made better <UNK> if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice
<START> this movie has been done before it is basically a unoriginal <UNK> of <UNK> dynamite and <UNK> lives there are some funny bits but otherwise it is a clich√© bore it is a good first film attempt and the director who also stars in and wrote the feature shows a lot of promise but the writing was kind of choppy and the story was not very original i swear i had heard some of the lines in other films however the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way it is also refreshing to see gay themed movies not be so <UNK> down with political correctness and tired stories of angst the main character seemed fairly well <UNK> for a gay teen in rural texas so no <UNK> coming out drama here
<START> this horror tale takes place in the desert of africa a canadian systems <UNK> <UNK> scott is sent on an assignment for a diamond mining company although he hates field work he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and <UNK> blowing sand four diamond <UNK> are found well whats left of their scattered bones are discovered during a long cold desert night a shape shifting monster makes its appearance <UNK> and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit are dying horribly one by one there is no character development let alone dialogue to speak of the desert set in its own way is beautiful and without giving anything away the creature is as old as the desert <UNK> also in the cast are rachel shelley <UNK> <UNK> and patrick
<START> what <UNK> a man to military service what <UNK> a man to survive brutal torture as a prisoner of war what desperation leads to the planning and execution of an escape into the <UNK> of <UNK> asia how does he cope with the ghosts and memories he returns home with <UNK> tries to answer these questions in his documentary of <UNK> german and u s navy pilot shot down over in 1966 who was taken prisoner tortured and <UNK> but ultimately escaped to be haunted by the experience for the rest of his life a powerful and personal first hand account of the man his life and experience <UNK> through the <UNK> of interviews <UNK> footage and new footage you will never forget this story or this man
<START> i didn't have very high expectations about just before dawn i don't know why i keep buying these slasher movies when i know it's all the same every time maybe i'm a bit <UNK> anyway i'm glad i bought this one yes it's all the same no it has nothing original yes it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp drink and have sex yes they get killed one by one by a maniac and you know what it's just magic it's one of the best experiences i had watching a slasher movie the places where it's shot are so wonderful you see mountains <UNK> <UNK> it's just amazing it takes a very long time except for the opening scene before the killer starts killing but i didn't care it was enjoyable to watch enough not to care what i mean is you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself the ending is a bit weird but i won't tell you anything more about it you'll know what i mean another thing i enjoyed you care about the characters they're not just a bunch of <UNK> who spend their time <UNK> each other sure they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but there's something special about them anyway it's a great horror movie and i hope you have a pretty good time watching it because i really did
<START> with what they had john and <UNK> were very private so the writers had to put together what they could i really liked de <UNK> as <UNK> but <UNK> voice <UNK> on my nerves she should have used her regular voice i would have preferred that the whole movie focus on john and <UNK> instead of <UNK> stuff we already know about john
<START> if you have not seen this late 80s film about the the washington <UNK> of a network news station than i highly recommend it it is a sad commentary on the direction of news <UNK> in this country but tells the story with wit the characters are well developed and albert brooks performance is fabulous he delivers all his lines with entertaining understated comedy i am not an albert brooks fan at all so this was a welcome surprise i have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and he advised that this is close to reality so kudos to the films writer and director for doing their research br br fun movie with a lot of insight into the world of network news it is not nearly as dark as another movie i also recommend in the same genre
<START> first of all no one with any law <UNK> experience not er or but real law <UNK> takes this show seriously walker would be <UNK> out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally <UNK> tactics on top of that he is a comic book character no acting ability incredibly trite lines no character development the fact that alex <UNK> loves him shows just how dumb <UNK> really are and is the ultimate clown in black face come on if you think walker is a heartfelt show without bias then explain why <UNK> is treated as a <UNK> always is the subject of <UNK> jokes never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime and never <UNK> walker who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does while it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them and believe me most cops are dumber than dirt the smart ones walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once walker is captured the jerk needs to be put of his misery but then again norris produced the show as well as starred in it so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are as if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time what a terrible series it is more <UNK> than any of the hokey westerns like the lone ranger roy rogers the <UNK> kid and wild bill <UNK> though i would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows but like those shows in the same way as those shows walker <UNK> is just as insulting and just plain silly
<START> i'd never heard of this film before i caught it on the telly last night i do hope it was never given a cinema release as this would be an insult to the silver screen and movie goers alike br br was it supposed to be serious was it supposed to be funny why the outrageously basic plot does anyone actually care br br awful film br br 2 10
<START> very enjoyable 50's western i have it in my collection and recommend it to western fans br br mostly victor <UNK> movie and quite well done in my <UNK> br br he's a <UNK> who joins a frontier post as a <UNK> red cloud caught three of them on their land and took their <UNK> they all joined as <UNK> after their loss br br victor has set his <UNK> on the <UNK> wife and lives life on the post without much regards to <UNK> br br action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters br br 50's westerns are my favorites and this <UNK> easily to a satisfaction a western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again one to enjoy gave it a 7 rating likely 6 8 worthy but films like these become more precious over time br br for film noir fans the big steal they live by night side street are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed bought and viewed noir seems to resemble westerns in a way some long ago and never forever
<START> <UNK> <UNK> absolutely shines as nurse betty easily one of the most charming off beat and lighthearted comedies of the year br br when soap opera obsessed waitress betty <UNK> witnesses her <UNK> husband's murder by two morgan freeman and chris rock she <UNK> and thinks the cast members on a reason to love are real she decides to travel to los angeles to find famed heart <UNK> dr david a character on the show br br as the two oddly paired the <UNK> rock and the <UNK> freeman generate some very fun chemistry and greg kinnear also has fun with his smarmy <UNK> actor persona <UNK> <UNK> turns in an innocent candy <UNK> and sometimes terribly sweet performance as nurse betty she exudes goodness warmth and is irresistible while the script sometimes feels like a sit com is filled with sometimes unbelievable characters and contrived situations <UNK> is so likeable and so utterly <UNK> that it all comes together br br with just a few <UNK> of black comedy to keep things interesting a winning performance from <UNK> a great supporting cast and a competent script nurse betty is utterly delightful br br 7 out of 10
<START> normally for movie reviews i try to be <UNK> and objective but there is only one word for this uh film sucks the dialogue acting special effects plot set and characters all seem as if they were made up by well my <UNK> plants don't see this for the sake of all that is good and right in this world
<START> walter matthau can always improve a mediocre film and this movie proves it he turns in a very realistic performance as a small time horse <UNK> and single father not sugar <UNK> either role br br he can be by turns soft hearted and <UNK> then iron handed to his boys and we can see the same <UNK> in his approach to horse training we see that he doesn't want his young <UNK> racing horse <UNK> and hurt in small time races but he seems to be willing to risk the <UNK> life when he gets into the big time br br this is just one of <UNK> wonderful performances and one that i highly recommend
<START> i just watched <UNK> k laurel and <UNK> last movie together and known here in the states as <UNK> on internet archive expecting to see some extra footage since the <UNK> version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes turns out that it's basically the same version i previously watched on the bargain basement vhs tape from <UNK> home video that ran an hour and 23 minutes with the exception of no product placement of the <UNK> <UNK> juice label being inserted when a bottle was shown with the rest of the running time devoted to dark blank space while stan does look like he might be dying anytime soon he still performs fine physical comedy with ollie during much of the first 45 minutes or so then the plot of taking a <UNK> with a <UNK> and a man with no country aboard not to mention a charming female french singer also coming to inhabit an <UNK> island they all end up on takes over with eventual complications that pretty much <UNK> the comedy down and never really <UNK> despite the familiar ending of ollie saying for the last time to stan here's another nice mess you've gotten me into before stan cries <UNK> before the fade out in other words if you're a die hard laurel and hardy fan this movie is recommended for you to see at least once anyone else wanting to get familiar with this classic comedy team should seek their earlier work they did for hal roach from the <UNK> up through 1940 when they completed their final roach film <UNK> at sea come to think of it even some of the l h fox flicks have yet to see the two they made for m g m from the <UNK> are better than this one update 8 <UNK> <UNK> just watched some missing scenes that appeared in the italian version on youtube <UNK> sings in one and has a conversation with the captain in another that <UNK> wife pulls a gun on <UNK> in one more <UNK> explains why he left his country with a flashback scene stan is dubbed in high pitch here
<START> this movie's script is <UNK> from others most notably the core another bad movie it's pretty clear why luke perry doesn't get much work but to see the beloved lt commander <UNK> michael <UNK> <UNK> to something like this is just sad br br i really can't think of one plot twist that isn't seen coming a mile away that's not an exaggeration br br special effects are very poor even by tv standards the <UNK> flow at the beginning of the movie <UNK> the coming global disaster starts things off at a very amateurish level and it gets no better from that point on
<START> this film has been compared to the hilarious british comedy a fish called <UNK> although i can't see why the only connection i can find is the monty python one eric <UNK> in nuns john <UNK> and michael <UNK> in <UNK> otherwise the two are <UNK> br br <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are two gangsters who want to get out of the business before they end up dead so they decide to rip off their boss and make for <UNK> when the <UNK> goes wrong the two are forced to take <UNK> in a convent as nuns br br what at first promises to be a riot soon becomes a predictable average movie with the usual tasteless sex jokes and bland humour once again there are the occasional high spots but neither cast nor crew manage to inspire proceedings an attempt at a <UNK> type manic finish fails too along with the effort at men in drag humour which is hardly surprising when you think about it men trying to be women is funny men trying to be nuns is ridiculous br br friday april 22 1994 video
<START> this movie was made 20 years before my time its introduction of john garfield in the supporting role of mickey <UNK> makes it a classic he <UNK> onto the screen and your eyes are glued garfield was an original and his portrayal of <UNK> boy is a must see
<START> superb story of a dedicated young teacher who sets out teaching minority children in an area off south <UNK> br br jon voight is just tremendous as the <UNK> dedicated idealistic teacher who faces this challenge despite a principal who believes in stern discipline and has little regard for modern educational techniques as well as a <UNK> old school <UNK> played with <UNK> by the late <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the principal who loves her babies br br as i'm a retired teacher i could in some ways relate to this excellent film the ignorance shown here as well as the lack of <UNK> with officials is also quite apparent in urban areas br br voight realizes that these children need far more than the traditional <UNK> of a <UNK> he has them go out and experience life by themselves by learning <UNK> br br the end is a definite <UNK> but so true to life br br amazing that such <UNK> students had a <UNK> for learning and were well <UNK> i guess that answers my question the behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment br br the ending will just <UNK> at your heart it was memorable and so well poignant
<START> <UNK> by the same monty <UNK> dennis <UNK> <UNK> which produced the <UNK> and randall <UNK> deceased the latter <UNK> my partner the ghost for the us market department s remains a classic example of the action adventure series which the uk produced in bulk during the late 1960s like those two shows its internal dynamic of two guys and a girl might seem to indicate a <UNK> attitude towards <UNK> <UNK> s also has a black superior but it's mostly <UNK> the launch episode six days is barely halfway through before <UNK> <UNK> is called upon to parade around in <UNK> <UNK> and one yes one <UNK> in order to <UNK> herself from a dodgy situation still it's an interesting time capsule even if the appalling fashion sense of peter character which amazingly <UNK> even further in the spin off series jason king should definitely have remained buried
<START> <UNK> i know it has the name sinatra in the title so how bad can it be well it's bad trust me i rented this thinking it was some movie i missed in the theaters it's not it's some garbage movie made by the folks at showtime cable station <UNK> these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make whatever garbage movies they want it's not good i am as big a sinatra fan as any sane man but this movie was just dumb boring dull unfunny uninteresting the only redeeming quality is that assuming they did stick to the facts you do learn about what happened to the <UNK> of frank jr otherwise it's just a stupid film
<START> okay so i don't understand why people are getting so <UNK> over this movie so i thought it was going to be the usual amanda <UNK> movie but it wasn't it was great br br okay okay so the acting wasn't the best but i thought the performances were still overall great also you could tell that the actors were having fun while doing this movie in other movies that have surprisingly won awards where the actors didn't like working on the film you could tell all of the actors had chemistry and that also showed br br a ton of people are ripping on the soccer skills that the actors have <UNK> so they're not perfect get over it they are actors not soccer players i have been playing soccer for my whole life and trust me it is hard to learn so stop ripping on the level of skills they have br br i thought this movie was going to be stupid but it was really funny the way amanda <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> can make a situation funny without even saying anything is funny i found myself laughing a lot in this movie br br overall i love it
<START> having seen the original when i was 13 and yes i was stupid enough to watch it while <UNK> i was excited to see this remake br br <UNK> bell did a great job as jill johnson and the fact that a teen horror flick could be made in the year 2006 without tremendous <UNK> and gore made it even that much stronger of a film i had a great time trying not to chew my <UNK> off br br this film won't win anyone an oscar but it is entertaining and worth the <UNK> price ticket i bought to see it i think girls around the world should watch the original and the remake and then determine to never <UNK> again br br all i can say is i'm glad i'm too old to <UNK> there's just something about being in a dark creepy house with sleeping kids that makes this movie classic no blood no gore just good psychological fun winner
<START> the <UNK> state that a comment must contain a minimum of four lines that is the only reason i am saying anything more about because after all my one line summary really says everything there is to say there is absolutely nothing remotely entertaining in this film
<START> i found the film don't look in the basement to be very good with some great characters in it it is about a young psychiatric nurse called nurse charlotte <UNK> <UNK> who is going to start work at a isolated mental asylum whilst there she meets various sorts of different characters including dr <UNK> masters who becomes in charge of the asylum after the the owner of the hospital dr <UNK> gets killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an axe br br my favourite characters in the film are mrs <UNK> <UNK> a very funny little old lady allison who is a <UNK> and sam bill a young black guy who goes around all day seeming to be in a world of his own all of the time the film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film i know that it was on the <UNK> <UNK> list back in the 80's but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it it did have some disturbing senses in it great film recommended
<START> an astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territory on board of a living spaceship accompanied by a group of alien <UNK> this incredible plotted and enjoyable tv installment comes along as a positive birth fantasy the individual characters in conflict at the beginning of the series have to learn to get along with each other and <UNK> into a powerful group at last most of the action takes place inside the <UNK> of the living space ship who even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship while science fiction stories are usually interested in negative birth fantasies watch the <UNK> movies for example especially the fourth part <UNK> this comes as a surprise also enjoyable is the absence of military <UNK> on board of the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human and alien body one of the female characters who is actually a plant experiences while being exposed to <UNK> the crew even has to go to the toilet wouldn't that be impossible in <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the story was well plotted and interesting by itself however it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you to avoid that i am not going to talking the story here br br i regard this film as a good adaption of sarah <UNK> book as compared with the previous one <UNK> the <UNK> i read the book first and then watched the dvd later the film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book of course due to the time <UNK> the film in the last 30 min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part iii of the book therefore it couldn't illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of mr place and those after that even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene despite that the film actually did a good job in representing the story it really worth watching it's still unclear when bbc america can broadcast this film that's pity br br ps noticed that the ages of <UNK> and sue were set to be 20 21 instead of 17 18 in the book the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses
<START> nothing really unpredictable in this movie but a solid flick in all respects everything from acting to cinematography was solid not a perfectly linear plot line but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming perhaps a tad melodramatic at points but again a fairly decent movie none the less definitely worth checking out if in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend give this a go though you may not feel like running out and buying it i found it to be quite worth while
<START> this is the australian tv series it is a classic the stories and actors are excellent who can forget <UNK> and his <UNK> or <UNK> being <UNK> this is cult tv the australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have <UNK> in the <UNK> what can i say timeless adventure the music and song just fantastic the closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel then <UNK> sleeping n being <UNK> around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that all 13 episodes are equally solid in the portrayal of the australian myth and i think this is what this series has it does not matter that the two main characters were from overseas i think that is the key to the series and why it is so good
<START> anthony wong stars in both this and the original far superior <UNK> story but the similarities stop there wong doesn't <UNK> his role obviously and instead plays a bumbling policeman who gets involved with a rather suspicious female <UNK> <UNK> miss <UNK> sun who's a repressed nut job sure but her tame jealous wanna be with a guy who's with a girl killer is no where near as compelling as what wong played in the first one the movie itself seems tired and by the numbers <UNK> fan as the love <UNK> girl tries to keep one from total boredom by <UNK> down whenever possible and sun does have a nice ass but even that can't save this dud br br my grade d br br <UNK> ah dvd extras sub titled interviews with cheung <UNK> <UNK> sun anthony wong filmography a very brief synopsis theatrical trailer for the film trailers for chinese erotic ghost story and twenty something
<START> i remember when i first heard about jack frost i was in video at miranda with my family on a <UNK> video hiring tradition it was at this time that i worked up the courage to venture over towards the horror section of the store <UNK> the various titles i finally came across jack frost the cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my viewing pleasures years later the film disappeared only to be replaced with the inevitable yet unnecessary sequel i once again <UNK> to the horror section and picked up the case only to come to one conclusion the film would be but not intentionally br br jack frost 2 revenge of the killer mutant snowman quite a title follows off where it's predecessor left it sheriff sam is seeking <UNK> after his <UNK> and jack is now in the form of anti freeze to escape his past sam and his wife head to an island hotel where he is in the company of a wide variety of slasher film stereotypes including <UNK> female models thick headed sports <UNK> and <UNK> staff however jack is released from his <UNK> grave and is back to his icy methods he heads over to the island and proceeds to kill anyone that would prove to have an awesome death only sam can stop him br br let me just say that this is a straight to video film so it's bound to be bad but this is terrible even in the eyes of other over the top films the camera work is poor using a camera that would make a soap opera look <UNK> half the actors look like they've come out of a porn shoot and the other half look like they've come out of a retirement home but in actual fact they've actually come out of an asylum there is an extensive use of special effects used in the film which tends to alternate between bland <UNK> and cgi that can be <UNK> by an <UNK> and the death scenes are mostly off screen showing us little of what has happened to the hapless yet deserving victims but the film is most memorable for it's killer one liners such as there's something that needs a little christmas <UNK> and i know <UNK> you officially f ing dead ultimately the whole purpose behind a film like this is to make a popcorn flick for those friday nights of boredom and even it fails at that to make a sequel to a film that was a poor slasher with a concept that a child would find unbelievable must've taken some nerves of or a total frontal <UNK> to director michael thanks for wasting my time to everyone <UNK> avoid like <UNK>
<START> not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative but i loved this movie i am a student of asian art with a particular love of korean art culture and history i thought this movie <UNK> a very controversial and interesting character to life <UNK> <UNK> up is one of the maybe the most famous korean artist and continues to be <UNK> as a master given the <UNK> of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature it is amazing that he produced so much work in so many styles and with such skill this movie <UNK> his talent while taking a direct look at his <UNK> and somewhat self destructive personality the cinematography in my opinion was beautiful many of the <UNK> <UNK> shots looked like korean landscape paintings which i found a lovely <UNK> rather than overly arty and i think that <UNK> min portrayed <UNK> up with a necessary intensity and <UNK> i would highly recommend this film to art lovers and movie lovers alike
<START> while not quite as good as a murder is announced which was not only delightful but almost <UNK> the book this is an excellent adaptation and you know what it is a huge improvement on the <UNK> <UNK> version now i don't take pride in bad <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> adaptations two or three of them were surprisingly good but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script a confusing final solution or both the <UNK> <UNK> version suffered from a plodding pace and both of the above problems and i would consider second worst of the <UNK> adaptations worst being mystery which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing this adaptation of the book nemesis is a huge improvement it not only respects the book despite a few liberties but it pretty much the problems the <UNK> version had despite the added character of lionel coming across as rather irritating more to do with how he was written than how he was acted and one or two moments of <UNK> pacing this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book it is beautifully filmed with nice photography and period detail and the music as always is excellent the performances are wonderful this time around and make the most of an in general well done script with joan brilliant as always as miss <UNK> and solid turns from liz <UNK> helen <UNK> joanna hole and anna <UNK> margaret is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as overall well worth watching better than the recent version in pretty much all <UNK> 9 10 <UNK> cox
<START> an awful b movie at best with video quality similar to dead alive i challenge anyone who is a aliens james cameron 1986 movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage br br cast members such as r lee <UNK> and ray wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead jack <UNK> was really absolutely horrible i think they cast him for his massive <UNK> i was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set john <UNK> who must look at this movie and just wonder look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies br br but on this movie the script as i said earlier was a rip off of aliens <UNK> and turned into a submarine thriller it included such lines as i got a bad feeling about this and kill me as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the alien hop just before it pops out of his stomach there is also a rip off of the classic get some via bill paxton we also have a bunch of navy <UNK> running through <UNK> with creepy popping out of walls even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie aliens and the <UNK> is that some of the mutants spit acid as opposed to having acid for blood there are many more major examples so if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics alien and aliens with <UNK> weaver you'll have a more enjoyable time br br the plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a <UNK> or check email many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not the whole command structure between crew and capt was poorly done i'm not even sure if there are <UNK> in the military that have full control over nuclear <UNK> in general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples like dive depth etc br br if you like horrible movies or are a big fan of alien and aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you as for me this one is going back on the shelf <UNK>
<START> for a brief moment the opening scene with <UNK> <UNK> and the br br <UNK> bar is incredible i'd probably follow her to my ultimate death too best vampire movie of all time but with a twist the fight scenes are awesome wesley snipes displays an <UNK> you dont get to see every day and stephen <UNK> is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new <UNK> moving himself up the <UNK> by any means necessary great flick 9 10 where's blade ii
<START> this is definitely one of the most scary and spell <UNK> films ever made you are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end even though there are some plot holes it keeps being exciting to the final showdown besides 8 <UNK> and <UNK> tom this is one of the best films about snuff movies a taboo theme of our culture if you like the scream trilogy you will probably love that one
<START> what an absolutely charming movie the cast is wonderful and the story is witty and fun an all around pleasant movie experience although the plot is somewhat predictable it doesn't make the story any less enjoyable in fact i didn't want it to end i've always been a ingrid bergman fan and i was interested to see her in a comedic role she didn't let me down ingrid <UNK> performance as ms dickinson is fun to watch i loved her interaction with toni at the music store as well as her dancing and doing the dentist it only further proved what i already knew that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time goldie hawn is also delightful to watch her fun gentle hearted and lovable toni is the driving force of the movie you don't even question why she would be so concerned about her wife you just accept that she's just that type of person who wouldn't be happy unless she knew everyone else was also and walter matthau is great as julian his actions never create a feeling <UNK> for the viewer in fact they almost make him more enduring there wasn't an unlikable character in the bunch this movie has definitely with stood the test of time i watched it just last night and i think it's one of the best romantic comedies i've ever seen if you're looking for a fun lighthearted romantic comedy look no further
<START> the old dark house sub genre that dominated the early <UNK> rarely fails to disappoint when we re view the <UNK> to day here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time br br the crooked circle is a gang of and thieves who have decided to take revenge on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who has sent one of their ranks to prison they decide he must die that very night meanwhile the <UNK> own group the <UNK> club is determined to protect him at all costs this does not sit well with thelma irene <UNK> fianc√©e of club member brand <UNK> ben <UNK> late of the mega budgeted <UNK> angels 1930 who wants him to quit the club and stop <UNK> his own life brand promises to <UNK> after saving the <UNK> life everyone heads off to <UNK> newly purchased mansion on long island to <UNK> the assassin br br the colonel might be the new owner of melody <UNK> but it's an old dark house complete with eccentric <UNK> like raymond <UNK> as a local <UNK> and maybe even a ghost top billed <UNK> <UNK> is nora the <UNK> who expects to see a spirit around every corner throw in a cop james <UNK> who is certain brand is a criminal and we have a picture which is packed with action and surprises br br you will notice right away that the script writer was at a loss to come up with too much dialog because a lot of characters repeat the same lines over and over c henry gordon a <UNK> <UNK> which movies of that time were loaded with says evil is on the way many times and i lost count of how often ms <UNK> says something always happens to somebody there are many suspects and two characters mr <UNK> as the stereotype dumb cop and <UNK> <UNK> as mr pal who serve as comedy relief the house itself is appropriately spooky looking in fact i think the same set was used in the phantom 1931 with lots of secret <UNK> and <UNK> music coming out of empty rooms but somehow you never really get a feeling of danger maybe it's because no one in the movie and i do mean no one is entirely what they seem to be it all comes out right in the end though but to go into any more detail would spoil it for you br br watch carefully for robert <UNK> from white zombie and frank <UNK> best remembered as capt from king kong to pop up among the suspects br br the crooked circle is a fun film some aspects of the plot are predictable and then again several others are not i suspect you will enjoy it
<START> this was the second movie i ever saw and still holds a place in my heart as one of the most hilariously awful film experiences you are ever going to have br br miles <UNK> <UNK> is in this using his <UNK> <UNK> to score another <UNK> on the <UNK> on his <UNK> he's stiff wooden and unconvincing but he still comes across as a cool likable guy and at least he's <UNK> that's the only decent i can find to say about the movie so i thought i would get it out of the way right up front the fact that he is in the movie adds another point to the score and saves it from being a 1 out of 10 br br in no particular order examples of how badly put together this film is br br 1 ok the <UNK> roberts clone <UNK> <UNK> to 'the ends of the <UNK> to find <UNK> which takes 3 minutes of screen time including the time she spends stumbling around dying from a <UNK> arrow in her shoulder which i assume would have <UNK> her down quite a bit so <UNK> <UNK> her up and takes his <UNK> aid <UNK> and sets out to go back to the her castle and proceeds to take the next 50 minutes of the movie recovering the ground that <UNK> <UNK> in 3 minutes how does that work i know that the <UNK> crew is being <UNK> by magical forces and enemies etc on the way back but still br br 2 apparently the writer director felt the need to add <UNK> to the film by adding a running debate dialog game of 20 questions between the mean john <UNK> wannabe and the wise man the richard harris wannabe but joe apparently got his philosophical training from hallmark cards t shirts and <UNK> <UNK> and he doesn't understand <UNK> pacing or timing and neither do the actors remark during one of these <UNK> is the tag line for my entry the scenes with these two drag on and on bringing the movie to a <UNK> halt and killing any momentum or excitement generated by the sword fighting and <UNK> of the heroic trio br br 3 once <UNK> arrives at the castle and is captured things go even <UNK> downhill decides to feed a bunch of women victims along with <UNK> and <UNK> to the <UNK> god he keeps in his basement this scene had some potential for excitement so the director immediately kills this potential by <UNK> the scene with all the drama of people waiting in line at the <UNK> to pay their traffic <UNK> <UNK> proceeds to have a big battle with the <UNK> that is barely more convincing than bela <UNK> battle with the rubber <UNK> puppet in bride of the monster br br 4 the climactic scene in which <UNK> <UNK> the hang <UNK> out of <UNK> and animal <UNK> is so <UNK> silly that it completely blows the viewer out of the movie and makes you roll on the floor laughing until your sides hurt br br 5 oh yes and the filmmakers decided to include stock footage of an atomic explosion at the end with the moral that <UNK> decided to destroy the <UNK> that drives the movie because mankind was <UNK> <UNK> message coming in just like bride of the monster again come to think of it all it needed was a <UNK> to observe they <UNK> in god's <UNK> br br 6 for some reason the version of the movie i saw features <UNK> and closing <UNK> erotic credit sequences that have absolutely nothing to do with anyone or anything else in the movie i have no idea where this footage came from but it is actually worse than the actual movie it <UNK> br br watch this only if you are a big fan of miles or if you enjoy the way mst3k <UNK> material like this
<START> every review i have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point shakespeare wrote for the accent and the <UNK> just as he did for <UNK> in other plays the scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken so listen again and note the difference the play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received polite well <UNK> english i am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in <UNK> <UNK> asked me age 14 to read a piece of walter scott which was written in the tone of the border i come from the border and when i read it as it should be read it made all the difference
<START> one of the scariest movies i have ever seen was carrie the first one now as with other movies they have totally ruined the carrie franchise with the rage carrie 2 from the the movie <UNK> along like in a beat up van there are hardly any scares and this movie is chock full of all the various high school <UNK> i e the football jock the bitchy cheer leader the followers and of course the black wearing <UNK> another sad thing about this show is that you know what's going to happen the moment you see the opening credits sure sure girl gets and then turns into crazed psychic murderer yawn br br been there done that br br even the actors look like they were forced into doing this movie emily is as frightening as a <UNK> <UNK> doll while jack london let's just say i didn't pay to see wood act apart from the actors the serve more to <UNK> than to link up with the first movie br br bottom line if you can <UNK> objects around like carrie then for the love of god <UNK> yourself out of that theatre
<START> a lot of people in the cinema enjoyed this film but it only made me feel <UNK> if smug <UNK> <UNK> about their irritating sex lives sounds ok to you watch it i felt bored but glad i did know people like that the premise of the film was that as with all societies or great <UNK> they are eventually doomed to fail according to the female <UNK> character who <UNK> us with this fact america is showing signs of it's decline admittedly she goes into greater detail than me the next part of the film is concerned with the vacuous <UNK> and <UNK> behaviour of her friends and colleagues and the various <UNK> caused by their <UNK> behaviour with a vague attempt at humor a lot of people liked this movie where i watched it i could not relate to it
<START> <UNK> is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value even on the so bad its entertaining front a friend of mine took the tape from an <UNK> st vincent clothes bin okay that may be a little bit dodgy but it was meant to be a clothes bin not a crappy old vhs bin something the less fortunate members of our society don't really need to make their lives better it could be considered a mercy watching a movie like <UNK> would really only add to their problems anyway the basic premise of a woman with a super powerful motorcycle that it armed to the teeth with rockets and <UNK> isn't even properly exploited the two <UNK> <UNK> chase sequences involve vehicles travelling at less than hair raising <UNK> of around 40 and a super fast motorcycle that is in danger of being <UNK> by a crappy old station <UNK> is not that awe inspiring when you get down to it there is only one scene where the <UNK> goofy <UNK> is used at the film's climax and it is laughably <UNK> or just laughable when it is this includes laser <UNK> that look like they should be coming out of the hands of an evil wizard in a cheesy eighties sword and <UNK> that produced large bursts of flame which seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly the rest of the movie is just tedious hard to watch filler lots of bad actors yes even combs and <UNK> suck in this most of whom seem like they have been lifted from the set of a porno movie stand around <UNK> really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to <UNK> forward the barely coherent plot there are a few badly staged fight sequences and some excruciatingly unfunny comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of the <UNK> cycle <UNK> shop comedy of the sub benny hill horny old man can't stop staring at the female leads chest variety basically the scenes involving the bike actually doing stuff are few and lame and the rest is clunky filler material skip it
<START> <UNK> films are always this is just another case in point out of the five naked women shamelessly <UNK> here maybe one has real breasts and that's a strong maybe no humor no gore just <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and some tepid <UNK> <UNK> action but know what for fifty cents less than this video rental i could have rented legitimate porn do i feel cheated with <UNK> always so i prepared myself for a letdown as one must always do
<START> give director stanley <UNK> of jackie chan's super cop and <UNK> in the <UNK> and what do you get you receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of <UNK> like madness br br the limited plot has <UNK> leslie <UNK> put into an international plot where he steals a world renowned gem of course he has no idea what he is doing in fact he has no idea that he had the gem br br within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this there are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken you will wish that you were as as <UNK> its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster you have to love leslie <UNK> because he was made some very funny movies this isn't his best but he does a good job playing <UNK> i thought it was a funny film and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny
<START> this is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while it's not funny at all it simply portrays a lower class northern british setting i find it a very sad film at parts at others cuts are where they shouldn't be one thing that really annoyed me was the close ups of pointless objects it really <UNK> down the pace of the movie i only made it through the movie because i fast <UNK> certain sequences towards the end br br this movie completely loses the attention of the audience it's main problem is that it makes multiple reasons for one action which in turn tends to <UNK> that action however if there is one reason for one action it makes it more passionate all in all this movie is all over the place i didn't learn enough about the characters to care about them because of the shifting plot lines and stories where as i would have maybe enjoyed exploring the life of one character br br for example at the beginning when the guy meets god in the bar god seems like a cool guy the movie could've <UNK> on that moment and i think it would've been a lot funnier br br anyway enough <UNK> watch it if you want but i'm warning you this film is crap i respect the makers for trying to pull it off with such a low budget but they could've done a much better job i guess it all lies in the camera movement and editing the acting was decent but then again that's just my opinion
<START> for me the best most memorable movies are often those which on first viewing i know nothing about american movie is a perfect example of just such a gem watching tv late one evening i spotted the one only good review among the <UNK> thankfully i settled in for a real treat american movie is a documentary following the unforgettable mark <UNK> <UNK> i believe a highly <UNK> charismatic <UNK> as he struggles to write direct and produce <UNK> a gritty low budget horror movie on which he has been working for years in mark we discover a young man filled with contrast his appearance is of the classic trailer trash stereotype skinny bum fluff mustache '80s heavy metal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc to camera however mark reveals startling wit insight as he <UNK> upon life love movies the american way as the movie unfolds it sadly becomes clear that <UNK> lack of discipline heavy drinking are relentlessly <UNK> his creative efforts american movie is a charming watch filled with hilarious moments vivid characters chief among these is <UNK> lovable buddy mike a soft spoken <UNK> <UNK> who having <UNK> an addiction to scratch cards is now <UNK> on <UNK> pop i absolutely loved american movie it <UNK> real empathy between the viewer principal characters and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative i would <UNK> recommend it to anyone
<START> i did not know what to expect when i decided to watch this documentary i knew it was about an ex <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in who escaped but i didn't know much else in reality i wasn't expecting too much oh what a surprise the story of this man's life is very interesting in itself but what sets this film apart from other biography type <UNK> is that <UNK> himself tells most of the story himself <UNK> is very comfortable in front of the camera his personality really shines he tells his story about his life growing up in germany during wwii and the <UNK> we are there with him in that same small town as he describes his family <UNK> and struggles we follow him to america and his path to fulfilling his dream to be a pilot then later <UNK> describes his story of capture escape and survival in the jungle we are again with him in that very jungle as he describes and re <UNK> his <UNK> and path to freedom with great detail we see the same primitive <UNK> villagers and forms of he dealt with that really hasn't changed for 30 years we see the thick jungle mountain <UNK> and rivers <UNK> faced during his escape it helps us to understand his emotions pain and plight i enjoyed the man the story and the style job well done
<START> a new wrestling show <UNK> way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable the giant <UNK> network president does everything in his power to draw <UNK> champion rip into the <UNK> circle to face off against <UNK> for the championship of the <UNK> of the tough <UNK> but <UNK> is unlike any <UNK> rip has ever faced br br normally i would give hogan some <UNK> as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role however this film didn't ask the to make very much of a stretch it simply asked hogan to play himself which he failed at miserably <UNK> <UNK> made a good effort as the mighty <UNK> but even his work left the film lacking something namely acting br br watch this movie if you so desire with a grain of salt and a sense of humor otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes in
<START> after being off the air for a while columbo returned with some new made for tv mysteries that while not being as good as the original series are better than the shows that were done in the later <UNK> br br murder can be <UNK> to your health used the then and i guess now if you think about it true crime shows as the situation for a murder the murder is committed by a very successful <UNK> true crime show host george hamilton in a nice bit of casting his chain smoking nemesis who lost the job to him played by peter <UNK> attempts to blackmail hamilton when he discovers a porno video hamilton made with an <UNK> actress in his <UNK> days hamilton uses <UNK> <UNK> to deliver the death blow via poison giving himself an <UNK> as well br br columbo is brought in to find out what happened you know the rest highly entertaining
<START> like i'm sure other people have said this guy isn't a very worthwhile subject sure our society has a morbid fascination with death and it's funny hearing him talk about how much he <UNK> and how much coffee he drinks but he's into giving himself an <UNK> <UNK> anyway the bottom line is that he's a moron racist using feeble methods to try to <UNK> the mountain of evidence of the holocaust and as such he should be forgotten by time but morris is in love with any kind of which normally i wouldn't fault him for
<START> this film attempts to cash in on the success of richard curtis movies particularly love actually which i loved a series of <UNK> scenes following the love lives of various couples br br it's a great idea poorly executed the script tries to be a little too clever and simply doesn't <UNK> most of the acting is stilted which is more a reflection on the director than the actors br br the version i saw on a plane was called scenes from a park which is a more appropriate title as not all the scenes were of a <UNK> br br i was so looking forward to this movie but ultimately it is disappointing don't bother
<START> the is a hilarious film that not many people have seen clearly not that many because it only got a 6 8 there is nothing wrong with it at all it's my favorite of the disney classics which have tons of fantastic films already made like beauty and the beast snow white and peter pan the reason why the is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is i hate to say this but i don't blame edgar for what he does i probably would've had them taken care of too i'd be <UNK> of some old bag who i'd been working with for so many years just decides to give her will to the cats i'd of killed them also i don't even like cats so i wouldn't give a damn i think that the is so funny and cute there are many characters that are hilarious like edgar the is my favorite of the disney classics and that's final the <UNK> out of the bag br br the
<START> film noir meets anime brilliant this was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative <UNK> shorts this was one of my favorites if not my favorite i also loved world record this is basically a reference to those classic film noir detective stories and movies of the 40s except it's animated and involves the matrix but by being animated it is able to take the extreme camera angles the detective life style the shadows and everything film noir to an entirely new level the femme fatale <UNK> the detective in this story seems to be living in the 40s in his mind but stuck in a modern world and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black walks into his office br br my grade 9 10
<START> i'm sorry but i just can't help it i love watching iron eagle now do not <UNK> me i am not saying that this is a great movie no rather i would put it that this is an endlessly entertaining movie for people who cut this movie to pieces for not being realistic are kinda missing the point of course iron <UNK> plot was ridiculous but i believe its target audience was kids and i sure remember finding this cool when i was little now i just find it amusing as a guilty pleasure kinda like road house this movie is part of the great <UNK> of 80's kids taking on the <UNK> adult power structure movies you must remember d a r y l real genius e t etc if you ask me just watching doug and ride the snake in the beginning is worth the cost of the dvd that whole sequence was so stupid but at the same time it was hilarious funny totally 80's all that good stuff so bottom line iron eagle is a great 80's guilty pleasure the <UNK> the dancing the music the dialogue its all funny as hell i have iron eagle on dvd and to me it was totally worth 9 99 at best buy if you love laughing at dated unrealistic action movies this one is a must see oh yeah and i think its plot was only <UNK> <UNK> than <UNK> other fighter pilot action <UNK> top gun
<START> as with so many modern us films there has to be a supernatural element to the plot but if you just let that go this is a tale with <UNK> of charm and a kindly heart <UNK> in a <UNK> shell br br we are presented with a scene of a town in an <UNK> depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about beau <UNK> character is really up against it with a family on the increase a <UNK> bank balance and a brother in law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates but in which he is willing to rub nose <UNK> finds his rather surface <UNK> lifestyle <UNK> by having to look after his baby brother joey and is <UNK> to escape the <UNK> of this dead <UNK> town their <UNK> business is closing down much against his will because of a lack of new customers and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds up the tension towards his own attempt at self destruction br br joey who had seemed to <UNK> the curse on their lives is lost at sea believed drowned in a freak accident his <UNK> <UNK> to them by the portuguese whose boat they had just built and launched perhaps symbolic of an <UNK> crew is the sign they've been waiting for and they all decide to give life one last throw of the <UNK> br br there is a beautiful brooding mood throughout this work which <UNK> in holding our attention as brilliantly as 'the <UNK> <UNK> there are other parallels with the later work too which lead one to suspect a touch of a remake i like of <UNK> for its simpler less contrived story and star performances from actors working at their craft rather than to be noticed as stars
<START> for the record i am a curly fan through and through but i do have to say that in reality <UNK> wasn't really that bad yeah he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that curly had but in his own way he was hilarious at least he wasn't as bad as joe <UNK> br br in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays a music professor <UNK> a professor yeah right who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle and moe larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six <UNK> that night or no money br br this was one of the <UNK> first skit with <UNK> before they started <UNK> their material perhaps it isn't surprising that <UNK> was part of the stooges before curly came into the picture so he seemed natural at this the slapstick gags are hilarious especially this one scene with moe and <UNK> in a phone booth essential <UNK> short to be honest
<START> the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director martin campbell after viewing a few of his credits in later years this must have been one of his first directorial <UNK> he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all where was his head was he on drugs i was looking forward to this movie just because of <UNK> bacon maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to bang it out i can't imagine that the story that campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote <UNK> bacon along with the rest of the cast must have <UNK> under their <UNK> if they went to the screening as one poster pointed out karen young did do a pretty good fight scene with bacon she really did <UNK> <UNK> it's unfortunate that i have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really don't have anything more to say about this uninspiring film one does not have to be forced to be a when <UNK> a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of words to fill up a critique
<START> i always loved that <UNK> voiced guy in all those westerns he was the sidekick <UNK> in the wild bill <UNK> show back in the fifties in this he has the perfect vehicle for his wonderful <UNK> character he is harmless and no one believes him but he is non <UNK> and goes on anyway when you have a guy like this there's no challenging because the details aren't there to <UNK> with of course in this episode he is taken on board a space ship by a group of aliens who have no sense of humor and believe everything they hear they don't have the word lie in their as it turns out he is so <UNK> that they can't handle him and then of course there is the secret weapon see this just to watch andy
<START> this film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts even little things like flynn <UNK> one <UNK> after another when he almost certainly would have used a <UNK> is one of the annoying things flynn was never tried of <UNK> or murder he is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody and he did not end up on <UNK> row in sydney he did not get his role in in the wake of the bounty by <UNK> and this role did not turn him into a well dressed film star br br this is just a mediocre film where the name of errol flynn has been tacked on just to sell more tickets and more videos
<START> fantastic chaplin movie with many memorable moments as charlie joins the army to fight in <UNK> 1 br br at first he goes to boot camp where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line that's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight br br next thing you know he's in france in a <UNK> hilarious scenes here include a starving charlie eating the cheese of a <UNK> and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder br br when charlie goes to sleep he finds his <UNK> all <UNK> and his roommate <UNK> this is such a funny part i can't really describe it just watch the movie when charlie wakes up his legs feel <UNK> so he tries to <UNK> them <UNK> it had me rolling on the floor when it turns out his second leg still feels <UNK> while charlie actually <UNK> his foot br br the movie then turns a bit grim as charlie shoots a couple of germans from his <UNK> although it's done in a very funny way and him as a tree to get close to the enemy saving a friend of his from a death squad br br last part is him getting a french girl in trouble by hiding in her house he then has to save her and while doing so he captures the german <UNK> as well to do so he <UNK> a german or something i love it when charlie is asked something in german and he's like the soldier looks at him in a funny way so charlie changes his mind <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> gets captured and charlie is the hero but then he wakes up again in it was just a sweet dream br br charlie did one of those <UNK> before the bank comes to mind but who cares this movie was so funny it had me laughing all the way chaplin also has something to say with this movie as his later work became more of a social comment to several <UNK> in the world and is explained best in the last sentence of the movie <UNK> on earth good will to all mankind ' br br in short a charlie classic very funny timeless 9 10
<START> david <UNK> movies are easily <UNK> or at least elements within the movie stand out as his <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> between the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> things that shouldn't be <UNK> and <UNK> is classic <UNK> briefly it's about a future generation of computer games but instead of a video <UNK> visuals are <UNK> by your mind the game <UNK> directly into a in the base of your spine and while the game is running the player can't tell reality from game jennifer jason leigh plays the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> jude law through the <UNK> <UNK> while in the game they <UNK> strange goings on and possible crimes but are they real or is it the game not even the <UNK> author knows br br the movie is quite a treat keeping the viewer engaged but in the dark until the final minutes another thing i like about is that it doesn't use a heavy <UNK> on special effects it's the story itself that <UNK> the movie recommended for the saturday night when science fiction is called for
<START> this movie is a shame especially considering is not an amateur but professional director however this movie fails to deliver anything you could expect br br first of all i am polish so i can tell all the background story because i read books but how can you tell there is even a war from this movie bunch of people are going back and forth some soldiers are shouting this is really the second world war or soldiers are on <UNK> br br acting and dialogs poor miserably poor a d m w <UNK> a fit in their roles the rest of polish cast is out of the place most notably m one of the leading characters what an unfortunate choice 99 of the dialogs are not spoken they are just put there actors had difficulties to perform and it is no surprise considering what odd things they had to say br br and this leads us to the most disappointing issue you can't feel it everything is so theatrical artificial there is no real life there is no feeling in it there are a lot of original footage from the wwii and guess what the material is much more powerful dramatic than what a did br br i can see only one positive despite historical mistakes like <UNK> it was made for post 1945 propaganda purposes to please polish that was gone and now there was but in 1940 there was no luckily it is undoubtedly shown killing in <UNK> was done by <UNK> yes it is a fact not some controversial <UNK> great two hours for 5 10 minutes scene br br anyway time and potential wasted this is tragedy of epic proportions will to fight in 1939 barely shown not <UNK> war against soviet union by polish authorities <UNK> not shown here <UNK> of soldiers shortly after living in the outrageous conditions not shown here hope and fear what will come next barely shown and then <UNK> hand to hand with germans <UNK> were <UNK> polish nation aimed at people who <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> unfortunately they succeed and the results are still visible to this very day
<START> i can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining in my case i at the time this film was released was the same age as some of the junior <UNK> in the film for me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years while some of the pranks that takes place in this movie like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road strung up in the trees or out on a lake are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not when i went to camp the <UNK> and <UNK> pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole <UNK> battles and boys <UNK> the girls cabin as i grew older i realized these night <UNK> to the girls cabin that i <UNK> in were carefully <UNK> by the <UNK> so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time i thought it was real and it was fun that's what <UNK> <UNK> is br br <UNK> captures not only the <UNK> beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and <UNK> <UNK> give a great example of pre teens teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys <UNK> up with girls and girls <UNK> up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high high school and college the opening title song that goes are you ready for the summer no more <UNK> no more books no more teachers dirty looks describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids br br i personally enjoyed the two <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> what boy nerd or jock didn't spend all camp trying to <UNK> up to some pretty girl <UNK> what guy didn't want to be accepted by the other <UNK> and <UNK> while these two characters are somewhat over the top i bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys these two characters are a mix of charlie brown from <UNK> and jack larry dallas from <UNK> company i would bet that most viewers even cheer for <UNK> in the egg carrying competition and for <UNK> as he attempts to beat the stomach in the hot dog eating contest br br lastly this movie had normal looking kids and <UNK> no super models for <UNK> or <UNK> that wore trendy clothing it is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie
<START> this is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film total reality don't waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film this is without <UNK> the single worst movie that i have ever seen in my life i had nightmares of this movie ever since i saw it the acting was terrible and any amateur film maker could make a more decent film the film <UNK> rips off far superior sci fi films such as <UNK> or total recall where the title seems to have been derived from i'm sorry but i just think that there is more entertainment value in watching the side of a cardboard box for two hours if you already have seen this movie i feel sorry for you for going through what i did
<START> a finds a young <UNK> in need of help to young to be on his own the cat soon takes up with the rugged camp workers <UNK> good time <UNK> his antics <UNK> everyone at first his wild nature eventually begins to cause trouble and <UNK> him into his natural <UNK> becomes an issue this film is among those wonderful disney nature films that were common in the 50's and 60's lots of action beautiful scenery and some endearing animal to charm you these films were not long but included fascinating glimpses into <UNK> and the effects of human contact unlike disney's animated talking animals the animals in these films remained true to their own nature they also make great travel films for seeing the western states
<START> this was perhaps the worst movie i've seen in a long long time forget that it's clear no research was done regarding detroit forest in downtown detroit the writing was horrible the premise completely implausible and quite frankly the characters were embarrassing i cannot for the life of me understand why seasoned actors would <UNK> to such a low and participate in something this god awful now i have never seen the original and don't know if this movie pays tribute to it's original form it's my understanding that the original was not set in detroit why they would <UNK> from that without <UNK> details about the setting only tells me that it was more than the cast that was looking to pay the rent br br don't waste your time on this junk unless you're from detroit and wish for some comic relief
<START> the story of a little girl who was driven once by fear and now by pain she becomes woman and a vengeful crime fighter her power is to <UNK> strong anime characters onto herself this movie <UNK> animation with live action as she <UNK> her animated sword through all that stands before her she struggles to deal with life her demons and her fears br br young emily watched her parents fight and argue she watched her dad leave her emily soon discovered she had the power to do something about it emily grew through life traveling as a loner and at night she had the power to make a difference in the world br br this movie is a great blend of animation and real action there are many themes and <UNK> that run deep through the movie this movie is broke up as a 12 part series
<START> this one is a bit more stylish than the average erotic thriller and <UNK> wilson is a very sexy presence but it plays like they lost a few pages of script somewhere subplots come in and out of nowhere the connections between some of the characters are murky and the killer's motivation is unclear to say the least maybe they could get away with this in a porn version but here some more <UNK> is needed
<START> i just rented <UNK> valley <UNK> because the cover and pictures looked terrifying and i don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto dvd but this looked so interesting and scary i was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about just look at the exorcist or the <UNK> of emily rose both terrific movies that made break <UNK> not only horror wise but story as well br br <UNK> valley <UNK> is about a girl isabelle who from the get go is automatically possessed so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with but a former wife <UNK> turned priest is on the case with a <UNK> i know i know then they go into several other stories with the priest and <UNK> sister and the priest hit the sister and messed around with isabelle i'm not sure then we get into a story with <UNK> dad and his questioning of his wife's <UNK> to him br br i mean the story just goes into too many directions and wasn't well developed at all not to mention that the <UNK> didn't seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film which i didn't like at all because i couldn't take it seriously whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well so i wouldn't really recommend this br br 2 10
<START> the inspiration for this film was the fact that american gangsters are well dresses but the <UNK> well when you might kill a guy as soon as look at the <UNK> then you can dress as badly as you want and people won't criticize you br br jimmy is fighter an illegal boxer sometimes <UNK> and is offered work by the local gangster boss in the cross that is <UNK> notorious kings cross district not the cross of london fame as many a british finds out the hard way br br due to feelings of love he <UNK> up a job loses a lot of money and has to get it to before and his <UNK> can kill him br br lots of dark humour interesting action revelations about the <UNK> <UNK> and human nature it is very <UNK> in the australian nature and explores the nature of australian criminals versus the american and british ones br br one problem is that each of the elements of the story don't have enough substance and depth but it is a painting with broad <UNK> that covers a lot of area not covered previously so as an overall package it is worthwhile br br team it up with <UNK> and dirty deeds for your aussie crime fest or lock stock and two smoking <UNK> and <UNK> crossing for an international falling short of the criminal gangs fest br br by the way bryan brown is a great actor who has just done a huge number of really bad movies here is one of his great movies
<START> this is the first time i feel the need to comment on imdb to write some sort of a review and as it so often happens it's not because of a really excellent film but a truly appalling one br br take the <UNK> style the youngest might relate to the max payne video game series a cast of virtually which is not a bad thing in itself poor dialogs some dark scenes but not many enough and make a film out of it don't worry about the bad acting the length way too long the lack of <UNK> the lead character has to be one of the <UNK> interesting i've seen in a long time couldn't care less if he died or the often ridiculous <UNK> they find to certain problems the lead character finds himself in br br i wouldn't have written anything if it hadn't been for another review here giving it 10 stars i gave it four but maybe three is closer to what i feel about it not only do i not wish to see it again but the mere thought of it takes me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself oh and a so called noir film is nothing without a good soundtrack not the case here the ending song sounds like it was more suitable to a western movie br br it's not romance it's not action it's not noir it's not good that would be my review if it weren't for the minimum of 10 lines
<START> this movie was definitely on the boring side the acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice the soundtrack is definitely for fans of kenny g and michael <UNK> speaking of the soundtrack i found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in it's titles that was a blatant ripoff of paul simon's you can call me al except that they don't acknowledge it at all isn't there something a little <UNK> there the scene that the main kid was in where he was <UNK> a game show host was my favorite 10 lines i have to write ten lines about this movie to be included what a ripoff i don't think it's too fair to force people to write more than they would just to get it included
<START> every time i watch this film it just really makes me wanna go out and have a good night my mate uses the weekend has landed speech to psyche himself up before going out and so do i sometimes br br this film is a great debut for the writer director well done mate br br the acting is great all the characters are believable and are larger than life the scenes are a joy to watch running mr <UNK> flashbacks explanations <UNK> are all great the scene in the pub when everyone stands up and starts singing the mock national <UNK> is a laugh too there's loads of comedy here howard <UNK> speech is hilarious br br oh god you just need to see this mind you i felt the film did somewhat <UNK> the use of <UNK> but hey that's the truth of the matter eh at least the film doesn't shy away from this fact i suppose the film does carry a decent message to it as well don't take life too seriously you have to let you hair down sometime and of course the chat in the pub when tries to explain to his mates that he's coming off the drugs is a sure reminder that when the come <UNK> out way the good times you know the <UNK> over br br this is at times a very clever film in it's use of the camera lighting etc it was a realised piece of cinema and a great feel good tale of mates love <UNK> and drugs br br get outta the people br br 8 10 br br enjoy
<START> my boss at the time and showed it to us at a halloween party at our office he is the chris <UNK> that co wrote and acted in it he knows it's bad we know it's bad and we all agree that the monster looks way too much like a <UNK> to be coincidence maybe it was from a experiment gone wrong br br it was a very low budget and the actors were all friends so what you have here is a case of hey gang put on a show br br nobody got hurt and it was a first attempt nothing wrong with that it gave us all a good laugh and it's a great film to watch with friends and make fun of
<START> this is a great example of what happened at comedy central after dave <UNK> left here's the problem with carlos <UNK> firstly his birth name is ned and was known that until he was 18 when he switched his name to ned <UNK> he was born in <UNK> though he acts like he's from mexico he grew up in the united states as well br br i might be able to forgive all that crap but br br he's been caught stealing other peoples material joe has been his most vocal critic in this way the stereotype <UNK> was an idea he ripped off a couple of <UNK> from miami he has stolen jokes from bill <UNK> he stole george <UNK> material in his own hbo special 13 minutes of it br br he thinks what he's doing is so original but dave <UNK> and lisa have been cracking on race for years before this idiot <UNK> others br br this show will crash and burn the word can't last that long before it gets old he hasn't done anything new since the first episode br br wanna hear a joke a jumping a fence that's funny for 3 seasons not br br awful
<START> beowulf is like a very bad game no characters no story no real dialogues bad fights it's probably the worst movie in the history of cinema it's deadly boring a lost of time i'm really sorry for <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> doesn't know how to choose a role if someone suggests you to see beowulf believe me run like mad
<START> son of the mask is a terrible excuse of a movie i went to see this with my friend and i still wish we had seen because of <UNK> instead i must say that it is partially my fault as i agreed to go see it with him being a fan of the first mask movie jim carrey was hilarious i had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was br br ten minutes into the movie i knew it was headed for disaster disgusting and pointless attempts at being funny got little seven and eight year old children <UNK> with laughter but the rest of us were left staring at the screen in disbelief br br finding the movie as repulsive and unfunny as i did is surprising to even me as i loved scary movie and anchorman two films which many people i know found crude and offensive but the thing is son of the mask is not funny unless you're under the age of ten br br the film features lots of cgi in it but it cannot save this piece of rubbish whoever allowed this movie to make it to the big screen was probably thinking it had potential considering the success of its original unfortunately it has none of the laughs fun or excitement of the first creating a mockery of the original movie i recommend renting the original mask to anyone who is thinking about seeing this one 1 star out of 10 is generous to this awful mess
<START> may contain spoilers br br i was super excited to go see blood and chocolate with my friends i couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites but as soon as the movie started i couldn't believe how different it was at first i was like okay so both of her parents are dead maybe it'll be okay but then came the rest of the movie by the time it was over i was furious nothing was correct but their names and the fact that vivian fell in love with <UNK> by the end of the book gabriel was my all time favorite and then the movie goes and turns him into a complete heartless idiot the movie also showed the or werewolves as these vile evil creatures were as the book shows them as just wanting to fit in and keep their pack safe they would never kill humans for the fun of it br br if they wanted to make a movie like they did they should have given it a different title and named the characters different because then i would go out and watch it again and buy it but when i think about it all i can see is the bad you couldn't pay me to go see it again or buy it
<START> this is a <UNK> <UNK> presentation staged at radio city music hall in new york city of the three irish dance musicals that i watched during the mid to late <UNK> which includes the first <UNK> and lord of the dance i liked this one the best br br i thought it was better than the original held in <UNK> ireland because it adds segments that are mostly good it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated <UNK> for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with this is just a very solid show with few weak spots to be certain there are some songs dances that are just fair but none that are poor which is amazing considering there are 20 numbers in all br br the cast is similar to the first <UNK> with the main exception of colin dunne replacing michael <UNK> as the featured dancer both are extremely talented the major difference might be in their looks with dunne a little black haired guy while <UNK> is the clean <UNK> blond i prefer dunne because ego is so big he gets annoying at times the female lead jean butler thankfully is still there and is great to watch what <UNK> beauty and talent butler and the rest of these women have the greatest legs i've seen on dancers i also enjoyed the dancing of maria pages a spanish flamenco performer and two guys daniel b and <UNK> thomas one number with those two pairing off against dunne and two other dancers 0 is called <UNK> <UNK> and is terrific fun to watch maybe the highlight of the whole show i have no complaints about <UNK> <UNK> either br br the fast irish songs here <UNK> to me the most i appreciated the audience not getting in the way of the performance either with <UNK> and screams like the women do in the lord of the dance video
<START> this version of the <UNK> stories is definitely bizarre the production adds a frame story that's what it's becoming famous for of <UNK> returning to his wife and son in one incredibly overlong and sometimes fails to hold attention throughout but the odd images and diverse cast will keep you looking mary <UNK> does the best job of the cast <UNK> seems a bit out of place with his american accent the whole asylum thing is awfully disturbing often but is nonetheless interesting and holds the <UNK> of <UNK> together well character really does seem insane however he should have worked on being a little more <UNK> to everyone in my opinion also confusing is going from present to past anyone else think the <UNK> are the <UNK> things ever to grace a television screen or in line for it confusing sometimes boring but still <UNK> by some good acting overall wonderful visual effects and a few enjoyable parts <UNK> first of many event films from robert sr see it for yourself to decide how it goes for you however i give it 1 2 out of 5 stars
<START> though several scenes of can be described as over the top i thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of near taboo twisted comedy br br is a great film with great dialog i wouldn't say that this film is for everyone but the film is on my top 10 list br br if you can look beyond it's occasional <UNK> and watch it for the film that it is i would hope you could see it in the same light that i do
<START> this thing works on all levels it's intense as a thriller full of lars von trier <UNK> but also very much its own film and it does have a message happiness comes from within best <UNK> in the wounded soldier who practically and believe it or not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> throughout the film all the while <UNK> to others for <UNK> on them you laugh at him but you envy him as well the central character is a well meaning but clumsy writer who spends the whole film trying to help those he befriends on a train from <UNK> to berlin just after world war ii he ties the parallel stories together and really <UNK> people up in the process to say things go wrong is an understatement and <UNK> the characters are all in perfect opposition to each other it's like every one of them has an opposite just so tight like watching anti matter <UNK> you will not believe the sick stuff you end up laughing at to say more would qualify as a spoiler all i can say is it is a shame this film has not been released in the us not even on dvd some moron probably told them americans wouldn't get it which is crap because we not only get but produce things like south park if this film gets <UNK> in the us it should be sold as a mainstream black comedy because that's what it is over the top sick and twisted but
<START> i guess it wasn't entirely the <UNK> fault though the film suffered from the <UNK> stupid decision to tell <UNK> moore who had done the role in the 1950's and was the lone ranger us old folks grew up with he couldn't wear the mask in public now mind you the poor guy wasn't making all that much money doing so and it wasn't like he was going to take anything away from this film but the whole thing seemed gratuitous br br the other thing the film suffered from besides a leading man whose voice was so awful they had to <UNK> it was that fact that westerns weren't so hip in 1981 john wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a decade long major liberal guilt trip about how the west was built on <UNK> of the native americans that and blazing <UNK> sent up the whole genre the <UNK> scene enough said hollywood <UNK> away from westerns because science fiction was cool then br br the one scene that <UNK> it was when after <UNK> the drunken president grant and seriously i'd have let grant stay with the bad guys the country would have been better off grant asks <UNK> what his reward should be honor your <UNK> with my people yeah right like that was going to happen
<START> this is <UNK> debut as a director and to be honest it shows it looks like he threw in every type of camera trick that he learned in film school to try and add some style to a badly written script which he helped write film has lance <UNK> and a group of others searching the pacific <UNK> for a plane that crashed that his daughter was on and also a special machine his company has built that he wants to also retrieve the first 5 minutes of the film is either <UNK> or shaky or out of focus tries to capture the blair witch mode with these type of shots and they grow tiresome very quickly and there is also the <UNK> shots that are right from <UNK> and predator these shots are from the point of view <UNK> of the sasquatch the editing is very choppy at times as a scene seems to shift right in the middle i have heard this film was shot in about 12 days and i suppose instead of starting back to one they just <UNK> without stopping and edited the scene together and the rest of the film is fade outs from one scene to another they're are so many scenes that fade out that i lost count now the nude scene with <UNK> roth its not her you can easily see its a body double and you know your watching a bad b movie when in the middle of the pacific <UNK> a hot chick decides to go to the nearest hot spring and <UNK> spoiler alert br br and the sasquatch himself is not bad when you don't really see him and he's just a <UNK> image behind some trees or <UNK> but when you finally see him at the end your of course disappointed first of all he's not that tall the actor who is playing sasquatch is only hairy in certain spots on his body its a partial suit and he's bald i have heard that a make up person died during filming and maybe that explains why the costume looks <UNK> made some of the sound effects that are coming from the sasquatch are nothing more than the familiar lion <UNK> that we have all heard in other films i do have to admit that <UNK> is not to bad yes he's working with bad material but he has one of those interesting faces that can actually enhance certain moments of the film people keep saying that a good bigfoot film has never been made but i disagree i have always said that the creature from black lake is a good film and i highly recommend that one i'm a sucker for a sasquatch film but this one is just to amateurish
<START> having <UNK> a copy of cup i must confess it is not as funny as i originally thought it is better charlie williams eat your heart out match <UNK> never pitch at 45 <UNK> and <UNK> kay george best the coach driver who thinks is in south <UNK> it's all this and that <UNK> tim lucky cup hat not that he's into gimmicks sugar <UNK> fairy confused watch it again the innovative use of real footage with players was brilliant and the producer should be proud of giving us a masterpiece come on <UNK> do the viewers and yourself a favour show it again please
<START> okay so i went into this loving i still love him her but think a little less this is one gross movie that shows a lot of male <UNK> this is a spoof of the 1970s black exploitation films and is <UNK> done badly the only fun part about it for me is that all of the voices have been <UNK> with those of drag queens even the voices of real women this is over an the top <UNK> laugh your rear end off it is so stupid badly made movie i would never watch this again but i do appreciate what the film makers were trying to do there is no rating on this but it would be r or even <UNK> 17 has done much better work
<START> a lack of character development proves fatal for this movie <UNK> character <UNK> starts out looking like a <UNK> personality but quickly <UNK> into a caricature and seems unreal the other characters are thin probably the writer's fault not the actors' the only exception is as the younger son his energy and <UNK> are funny and convincing br br i suppose the children's petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of <UNK> and emphasize the <UNK> primal spirits in the town but for me the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way for example when the <UNK> dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show the pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie
<START> dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a wealthy <UNK> with psychological issues regarding the opposite sex kidnaps an employee maria <UNK> <UNK> a free thinking liberal woman who believes men must be the ones fixed instead of females <UNK> <UNK> to his <UNK> estate running maria through a <UNK> series of mind games threatening to <UNK> and kill her desire it seems is to dominate her body mind and soul making her his sexual slave <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> to his every wish and <UNK> after resistance at first maria slowly <UNK> towards his objective but has plans of her own she says she wishes to help <UNK> <UNK> his sadistic behavior towards women so that he could love and not feel such yearning desires to harm it seems that <UNK> has her under his grip <UNK> to certain rather embarrassing scenarios such as his <UNK> making love to a blow up doll which is a recreation of himself often spending time topless and even getting down when she <UNK> him hard across the face bringing blood from his nose which almost break her but something happens as the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with maria and through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness maria <UNK> an upper hand <UNK> with lust for her body br br more of a battle of <UNK> a kind of sexual <UNK> where it seems one is in charge when in fact the other truly has the upper hand through a great deal of the film <UNK> <UNK> maria forcing her it seems to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well designed <UNK> it's a typical european art <UNK> kind of palace fashioned and <UNK> by a man who has kept to this weekend <UNK> of his for quite a spell it features walls and doors opening at his command with an area <UNK> off for his victims but once maria seemingly downs a bottle of <UNK> as a result of her anguish at his hands the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him he finds that he actually <UNK> her and maria uses this to her advantage playing hard to get when <UNK> wishes to embrace and <UNK> her and i could understand his frustration because she has this <UNK> that can drive a man crazy br br i felt the film works ultimately as a war cry for women their <UNK> and <UNK> against men who have the notion that they should always have control sexually and mentally the twist this ideal i couldn't swallow fate because of his <UNK> <UNK> activity and exercise <UNK> we see how he develops his toned athletic figure and how this <UNK> is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin if he is so well fit and spends such time developing himself for the <UNK> activities which follow his <UNK> how could he suffer the fate which follows his <UNK> the deal with maria at the end when she stops <UNK> his advances br br maria he would later admit is the first he's actually kidnapped others from the past call girls were paid for their services so that <UNK> could feel the power of <UNK> a woman even if it's all a <UNK> <UNK> brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex the spontaneous decision to do so to take a leap from the norm costs him more than he could ever know br br all this psycho sexual sub text is rather fascinating to see unravel but <UNK> <UNK> such a <UNK> sex <UNK> was my reason for enjoying it so without her i couldn't have liked it as much because she's vital as a victim worth <UNK> to obtain perhaps the film's highlight the delicious dance as <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> the wardrobe exposing her breasts to a <UNK> score it's the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and <UNK> sweat <UNK> <UNK> must've been a joy for fashion <UNK> because she wears those clothes so well she has this kind of cool a sophistication and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers <UNK> <UNK> the part to create an iconic character which would define her career even if the film isn't well known i found about through word of mouth the provocative nature of the script and <UNK> subject matter might not appeal to certain crowds as it deals with sex and pain in many different forms the dialogue quite <UNK> and at times i couldn't help but chuckle at comments towards an imprisoned maria regarding how he enjoys making women suffer and the thrill he gets at forcing them into a type of slavery in an attempt to make the words poetic it all feels rather hokey but <UNK> is the real reason to see it and the film to me works at it's best as a fetish film a possible male fantasy with this seemingly <UNK> and proper <UNK> captured and held against her will forced into a <UNK> situation her fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous <UNK> her <UNK> and how she <UNK> towards his aggressive behavior with her there are times where she unfolds to a <UNK> desire to embrace him <UNK> a possible attraction towards him which in itself might <UNK> some who watch it are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature my other favorite scene besides the dance is the piano <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> maria as she plays a <UNK> melody
<START> horrible acting with the worst special f x i've ever bore witness too it's bad enough i wasted 3 to watch this crummy pile of crap but it's the hour and a half time i lost that i could've been doing anything else like getting a root <UNK> or <UNK> for jury duty getting drunk couldn't even help this video br br to put it <UNK> i sincerely believe i actually lost a few iq points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind numbing work perhaps i should have followed my own advice this time never expect a decent film if it's written directed and produced by the same person and never ever expect anything of value from jeff <UNK>
<START> is a unique low low low budget gem from the late 1960's which probably would have been forgotten in time if it hadn't been for two things paul thomas anderson who named don <UNK> character in boogie nights buck after the eponymous hero of this film and the limited dvd release watching is like listening to hardcore punk rock it may not make a lot of sense at least to me it didn't upon watching it for the first time but you have to respect the film for its passion and <UNK> rebellious message i didn't understand a lot of things about but for the most part i liked it the more i think about the movie the more it grows on me br br the film is advertised as a parody of new <UNK> madison <UNK> best known in the 1960's as the advertising capital of the world members of generation x and y may be lost on this concept but fortunately mad men is on tv to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of u s history what you need to know before watching this movie is that these ad <UNK> were largely male and even more largely white <UNK> br br with this premise in mind the movie opens up with an ad agency board meeting the members are <UNK> white except for arnold johnson who bears an uncanny resemblance to dick gregory in this film the token african american on the board the board members are so self absorbed and soulless that when their <UNK> falls dead in front of them their only concern is who will become <UNK> next without even <UNK> the body from the <UNK> they begin a paper <UNK> to <UNK> the next <UNK> br br is elected by a <UNK> but not because the other members think is <UNK> voting for was an ill <UNK> attempt for these board members to <UNK> any other <UNK> chance of being elected <UNK> with their plans <UNK> takes charge and sink s the boat firing all but one of the original members and hiring all people of color in their place br br after this point the film became for me very weird and hard to follow plot wise there may not have even been a plot really the whole idea of the film seems to be a what if scenario with the result being that the new truth and soul inc firm would be unconventional but successful nonetheless the firm ends up making so much money that the members build a huge glass case to keep the cash in for unexplained purposes it could be because doesn't trust banks although that point is not touched upon or explained in the film it could also be <UNK> in some way but who knows br br most of the movie takes place inside the ad agency with occasional scenes in the white house with a president who for some unknown reason is a midget my <UNK> is here that some political joke was being made but i can't figure out what were the filmmakers saying that the president is a small insignificant part of american life were they saying that the latest elected officials <UNK> at the time were insignificant candidates i don't know i found it a bit eerie however that the man playing the president bore a striking resemblance to future president ronald reagan it is funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie was made br br what this film may have <UNK> from is showing how <UNK> outside the ad agency <UNK> to the new ads of course the ad footage possessed a strange funny appeal for its unconventional creativity but did these ads convince people to buy the product if so how the movie hinted on the idea that the new ad campaign was successful through client interaction and the calls from the white house however it would have been revealing to see average people since that <UNK> has always been most <UNK> for <UNK> br br although the parodies and political messages this film may have made probably didn't stand the test of time this film still had a lot of unique qualities arnold johnson had a <UNK> x factor to him that <UNK> him greatly in this film rough voice was actually director robert downey sr 's voice dubbed in sometimes poorly but fit the character so well in being an <UNK> <UNK> he hires and fires workers at random but earns the respect of all but one of the employees for the ad agency and seeking out new ideas br br the premise of the film was and still is incredibly <UNK> especially since the film was written and directed by a white man robert downey sr however this film <UNK> to fall victim to negative black stereotypes which would lead to the rise and fall of the <UNK> genre years later although some of the sex scenes may be a bit off putting for some viewers the main message is that a black owned and <UNK> business can <UNK> through <UNK> and risk taking many people may not take a positive message away from this movie but i just did br br remains an overlooked movie from a strange era and downey sr even despite his son's recent comeback never quite got the recognition as a director he deserved however if you find a dvd of this movie buy it and watch it if it's on netflix <UNK> it's a movie that can be confusing at times but is worth watching for its gusto ambition and its non <UNK> stature even by today's movie standards
<START> sorry if i disappoint anyone about what i am about to say to this made for tv movie but i paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster the directing is really awfully bad but after i looked up its information here i realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing maybe they don't have budget but anyway ang lee's sense and sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit the director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldn't even keep up a rational continuity in itself it keeps pulling me outta scenes maybe someone need to work hard on story line board the dubbed sound is also awfully bad my god normally i would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and <UNK> of an individual but this time i am just mad i really wanna hit something hard just don't do the job if someone can't fulfill it to its best bad arts its' not even art what is it really hurt people
<START> lucio fulci later known for his graphic horror films like the beyond and zombie was years earlier a master of the italian giallo in the company of <UNK> and <UNK> with films like a lizard in a woman's skin and his masterpiece don't torture a <UNK> this film has all the elements of the italian mystery thriller genre known as the giallo but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a <UNK> in his her own closet this keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself who is killing the young boys in town the young rich woman who is so bored that she sexually <UNK> the eventual victims the reporter who likes to <UNK> with a crime scene to get a better photo shot the with a mentally retarded daughter the local witch the town idiot the list goes on and you have to keep mental notes like a true game to play and solve the themes in this film are very daring and done with that perfect italian style in the early 1970s it is certain that no american studio would have even considered making a film of such strong content and that is precisely why this is such a satisfying film despite some unusual accent choices for the dubbing and will definitely have people discussing its meanings long after viewing it as the saying goes they don't make them like this anymore so get a copy and <UNK> an important film like this one
<START> forget about the plot of this movie forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by vince vaughn and <UNK> forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring jennifer lopez that i can stomach although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived the one and only important thing to remember when <UNK> watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film it is as if <UNK> <UNK> decided to make a crime drama a must see for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a <UNK> on which to display true works of visual art i would have to give this movie a 9 10 for it's amazing visual display
<START> i was cast as the <UNK> dude in the beach scenes almost got cast as the muscle guy since the real muscle guy was really really late that day <UNK> had my brother and i the <UNK> in front of the <UNK> place do some <UNK> stuff in between takes live from <UNK> since he was still doing his mtv thing this movie is really good as well would it have made my top 100 if i wasn't in it
<START> like the 5 year old protagonists of his latest <UNK> <UNK> miyazaki's <UNK> with its <UNK> innocence as though the anime <UNK> has become a child himself in <UNK> a narrative that <UNK> in its simplicity and <UNK> an <UNK> charm in the process miyazaki <UNK> his earlier works paints a <UNK> colored world obviously <UNK> for the younger audiences and the raw <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> off the grim <UNK> elements that <UNK> its immediate predecessors br br voiced <UNK> by a fish with a young girl's face making her look like a <UNK> child in a pink <UNK> halloween costume escapes away from her underwater home and her school of siblings to explore the surface stranded <UNK> she is rescued by a five year old boy who along with his mom <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a house on the nearby cliff this initial encounter and eventually friendship has a profound effect on who now wishes to become human but by becoming so inadvertently <UNK> <UNK> balance and <UNK> a <UNK> on land with help must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a human br br despite the plot lacking the philosophical sophistication of say his most recent spirited away is nothing short of an astounding follow up <UNK> by the extremely <UNK> attention to detail and masterful <UNK> of the real and the fantastic and of the simple <UNK> and great fears it's a straightforward tale that though at times <UNK> by its tendency to <UNK> like a <UNK> keeps in tune with its youthful <UNK> to magically <UNK> i will protect you tells matter of <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> not unlike the manner in which miyazaki <UNK> his story with <UNK> spirit
<START> <UNK> the north african nation of <UNK> is hanging onto a <UNK> independence as the various european powers france germany britain russia spain and now the united states are <UNK> for influence in the region the <UNK> marc is a weak puppet his uncle the who is being manipulated by the french and germans is the real power behind the throne enter <UNK> sean connery the leader of the <UNK> tribe and the last of the pirates who kidnaps an american <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and her two children and takes them hostage back in the us president theodore <UNK> brian keith threatens to go to war over the issue alive or dead seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his big stick <UNK> though secretary of state john <UNK> john huston is not so confident however the has less sinister plans for the who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event br br john <UNK> great historical film based very loosely off of a true story i e was a middle aged man is a wonderful bit of <UNK> it has some amazing action scenes a witty well written script a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material and does not <UNK> its welcome like say pirates of the <UNK> or the lord of the rings movies it's not really an epic film in the <UNK> sense but it's one of the best pure action movies ever made br br while the historical context is shaky the storyline is interesting and as some reviewers point out it is even more <UNK> today than it was when made as president <UNK> says america is like a <UNK> bear fierce strong but a little blind and reckless at times at the time of the film's setting america has just been <UNK> onto the world stage as <UNK> following their <UNK> victory in the spanish american war and <UNK> <UNK> this incident as a way to prove america's worth in real life it didn't quite work out that way but <UNK> it works well while written from a right wing perspective <UNK> screenplay is pretty accurate in <UNK> america and its place in the world he <UNK> <UNK> and his method of big stick <UNK> and correctly <UNK> in the words of <UNK> that while america may be feared and respected they'll never be truly loved by the world no matter what they do and there are some scenes like <UNK> target shooting of european leaders and the almost comic surprise attack by marines on the palace which show america's reckless and violent side while others the climactic showdown with the germans show their <UNK> br br the historical political context of the film is of course merely meat on the bones of what is essentially a rousing action adventure film there are some brilliantly done action scenes such as rescue of the from double crossing <UNK> which features some of the best <UNK> in any film the opening entrance of the and the aforementioned march and attack of the us marines are brilliantly done <UNK> set pieces and the final battle which combines elements of lawrence of <UNK> and the wild bunch while a major historical fantasy a three way battle between germans americans and the is a superbly staged <UNK> <UNK> sequence br br the excellent cast gives some wonderful performances everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film and it shows sean connery is surprisingly convincing as a <UNK> with a scottish accent but manages to pull off his interesting well drawn and <UNK> character who comes to respect his hostage and <UNK> modern <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an actress whom i've never been fond of gives a fine performance as the <UNK> <UNK> who is every bit as tough as her <UNK> brian keith is an amazingly convincing <UNK> you really feel he must have been like this an athletic <UNK> yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self the scenes of <UNK> boxing and target shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest bad ass moments in movie history and who can forget lines like why spoil the beauty of the thing with <UNK> john huston provides solid support as the weary <UNK> <UNK> acting as a perfect foil to the much more <UNK> <UNK> br br among the fine supporting cast the best are geoffrey lewis as samuel the cynical <UNK> caught in the middle of the political intrigue and steve <UNK> as the <UNK> ho marine captain who <UNK> <UNK> and carries out military <UNK> as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation other familiar faces such as roy <UNK> larry cross marc and <UNK> also do fine work no matter how small their role spaghetti western fans will recognize <UNK> saint john a <UNK> of dynamite as the german general and <UNK> as one of <UNK> br br the wind and the lion is all around a wonderfully done adventure film it has something for everyone wonderful gun and <UNK> a lot of humor a tough <UNK> heroine and her two cute children a nice if romance and an interesting if <UNK> political historical context it's not a masterpiece but hey it wasn't trying to be i give the wind and the lion a stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation
<START> as bad as they get this film commits the fatal error of making the viewer not care what happens to characters the two women in this flick are so stupid that you begin to root for the bad guys so this thing would end br br this film is one of the few that was so bad that i had to turn to another channel br br put in <UNK> language this film lacks <UNK> people not even people from <UNK> simply do not act like this well maybe the writers do br br there is not enough beer in the world to make this film bearable br br
<START> these days asian horror films are among the best in the world noted for their atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society this is not one of those films instead the record is a mediocre slasher movie highly derivative of american movies like i know what you did last summer and scream the plot is familiar 5 teenagers <UNK> commit a terrible crime but cover it up swearing to <UNK> one year later they're being stalked by a knife wielding maniac with the <UNK> disguise of a hospital <UNK> mask and an orange <UNK> it doesn't help that the teenagers are a generally unlikable group this is one of those movies where the killer's motives seem pretty reasonable and there are numerous stupid plot <UNK> to keep the story going the direction of the movie is <UNK> more influenced by mtv than by current asian horror films like the ring the last third of the movie isn't too bad though delivering some decent suspense scenes though there is probably one twist too many in the end 4 10
<START> the cave got released more or less simultaneously with the english film the descent directed by neil marshall both movies share a similar premise only the cave is dreadfully unoriginal <UNK> and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is the descent it feels like neil marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas depth and a <UNK> style whereas the cave director bruce hunt simply went for the most <UNK> <UNK> of the screenplay that was thrown on his desk the result is an unbelievably mediocre film that features every single horror clich√© you can think of and in which most of the violence happens off screen and we all hate that don't we the story introduces a <UNK> of <UNK> cave <UNK> that become trapped in a completely <UNK> romanian underground <UNK> hideous <UNK> creatures that also happen to be <UNK> soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to a <UNK> the first half hour is still mildly entertaining if you keep yourself busy with <UNK> all the clich√©s and listening to the cheesy <UNK> dialogs but the whole thing just gets too dire none of the events are even slightly plausible and it looks like the entire cast is competing with each other to deliver the worst performance i've seen better special effects in anonymous b movies already the filming locations aren't used to the <UNK> and the ending downright sucks very much not recommended
<START> no one in this movie has very much to do this is probably the longest <UNK> minutes i've ever spent watching a movie the makeup effects on the <UNK> with are pretty good but that's the only thing that keeps this from being rate a 1 the doctor's assistant goes through extreme mood <UNK> from <UNK> to <UNK> in seconds and then seems to forget where she was in the next scene the director assembled a lot of the right ingredients for a mad doctor movie but somehow forgot the <UNK> of a story to hang them on unless you know someone in the cast or crew i wouldn't recommend even <UNK> this one
<START> this movie certainly is a weird one to say the least the basic plot is 3 old business associates invite 2 strangers into their home for returning a lost <UNK> with 10 bucks in it the two whom show up fall in love the 3 older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out okay so that may make sense but then we have 3 old guys whom apparently have some bread living together slightly weird here harry carey plays his part way off base you can't tell if he is a nice guy or really a <UNK> i mean really make up my mind i can handle it then there is richard <UNK> playing james <UNK> from texas <UNK> he sounds way more like a southern gentleman from kentucky than a person from texas this one isn't even close then we take the 3 ghosts whom would stand a better chance of helping the new orleans saints win a play off game than actually helping out in fact they are really no help at all and why they are even in the film is beyond any scope of knowledge silly film in which a cast of characters act totally out of character you can avoid this one
<START> an excellent film for those who simply need to switch off and enjoy the beautiful scenery of scotland based on fact the film takes you on a journey of love amidst spectacular scenery the cast are <UNK> for the parts they play so no glamorous costumes or hair in this film where acting is superb gritty and down to earth each character is believable giving a convincing portrayal of island life beliefs and culture of the time a definite for those who have even the <UNK> drop of scottish blood as it will <UNK> at the heart strings and stir the soul something that can be shared with the family and watched time and time again a real classic one that i am sure will walk alongside some of the great films that never die
<START> the parallels between this film and captain <UNK> an <UNK> film shown at the team projection film festival in 1994 are so <UNK> obvious that any praise for sally marshall is not an alien must be viewed with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work br br in captain <UNK> two young boys <UNK> and roger played by dean turner and brett allen respectively examine the bizarre behaviour of their new <UNK> britney played by louise <UNK> as the two boys watch through their <UNK> they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform who they call captain <UNK> played by peter <UNK> however the emphasis in captain <UNK> is on the pointless and somewhat power hungry actions of the <UNK> britney and less on the friendship between the two boys br br a critical success at the film festival the plot of captain <UNK> has obviously been <UNK> and <UNK> in order to give the australian film community another notch on the belt with regards to children's product although sally marshall is not an alien is a fine film and a credit to its producers its leaves something to be deserved
<START> ok so it can be done we have here the perfect vampire movie gothic beautiful with all the ingredients a realistic vampire a wonderful story take note i am from <UNK> and i assure you this movie respects the vampire <UNK> it's exactly like the tales i heard in my childhood for a <UNK> it is quite believable you must see it if you are interested by real vampires as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how are they done in recent hollywood movies as far as i can guess the hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the <UNK> which is pretty hilarious for me vampires are never good looking or attractive they can inspire only horror and <UNK> the <UNK> called in my country the night <UNK> is the one beautiful demon which kills his victims by loving them i strongly recommend this for any gothic person out there see also the sequels they are all 4 very good and of course don't miss dark shadows something similar is <UNK> in <UNK> with <UNK> kinski i recommend that one to
<START> the bbc and the arts entertainment network should be ashamed of themselves for <UNK> this unfortunate production onto the world the acting is with the exception of robert hardy as general amateurish at best and excruciatingly painful at worst the costumes are over the top and feature some truly <UNK> <UNK> was the costume designer obsessed with <UNK> for women's hats surely every woman in bath didn't have <UNK> in her in the early 19th century the production values are poor and the pacing of the film makes one feel it was <UNK> and clumsily edited at the last minute altogether an <UNK> film that i had to force myself to watch to the end it's a shame as the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and location shooting compared to emma <UNK> sublime sense and sensibility or the extraordinary 1995 production of pride and prejudice or the subtle intensity of <UNK> <UNK> this production of <UNK> surely has jane austen turning in her grave
<START> i found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible i knew some of he facts about but here they were twisted and puzzling the images were <UNK> interesting but i was looking more for a <UNK> and or critical <UNK> of life and works not an <UNK> type drug trip the dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains <UNK> and <UNK> was extremely distracting had it been <UNK> an artsy film i wouldn't have purchased the dvd now i have a dvd that i'll never watch again and who would buy it i prefer mainstream films not those that require translation or <UNK> thumbs down on this one for me
<START> this movie was excellent from start to finish i was <UNK> by the action the black humour and the incredibly bad luck our hero encountered at every turn thomas jane is a great actor and i hope to see him in many more movies to come reading through other people's comments i have to admit i never once thought about <UNK> while watching <UNK> but now that i think about it i guess there are some similarities i guess i don't spend much time trying to relate everything to everything else the rape scene between and thomas jane is one for the record books <UNK> scene ever
<START> i thought this was a really great movie especially since it was <UNK> filler for me i was bored i got it from the library and i really enjoyed myself i've watched it twice in the two days and the more i watch it the more i like it i thought that the plot was going to be really corny but in the end it really could be said that it would be true i liked the main characters and i thought that they were well cast and you could see true friendship i thought they all did an excellent job the ending was good and you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys which is what a movie is supposed to be like
<START> as a fan of the book this work is fantastically adapted remaining true to the source <UNK> and <UNK> an honest respect for the literary work the <UNK> translate well to film by virtue of ron <UNK> good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity br br i like hanks as robert <UNK> his portrayal is genuine and <UNK> with only the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> we all knew and loved back in the day he is a good dramatic actor and while i miss his comedic efforts i do enjoy his more serious performances br br the subject matter is no less controversial than the <UNK> code and the <UNK> seems to never learn their lesson as with the aforementioned film the holy see <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and called for a global catholic <UNK> of the film which of course generated millions in ticket sales br br although the story of the god <UNK> was played down dramatically and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction the fiction that was left was entertaining and extremely well done and the truth be known people who have not read the book will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story as the screen version carries the main story well on its own br br in fact it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise in order to enjoy this second which should have been a prequel in all honesty although that does not <UNK> the <UNK> nor does it <UNK> with the continuity or flow of this second work br br all in all this is good for a friday saturday <UNK> viewing although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones br br it rates an 8 8 10 from br br the fiend
<START> albert finney and tom are brilliant as sir and his <UNK> of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the <UNK> and of theatre and i think you listen better in theatre but on the screen we become more intimate we're <UNK> more than we are in the theatre we witness subtle changes in expression we see better as well as listen both the play and the movie are wondrous moving intelligent <UNK> of the <UNK> story of the company of historical context of the two main characters and of the parallel characters in <UNK> itself if you cannot get to see it in a theatre i don't imagine it's produced much these days then please do yourself a favor and get the video
<START> this is easily one of the worst movies i've seen in a long long time and i've recently seen starship troopers 2 i could find nothing to redeem this film the acting which is probably the best aspect of the film is fair at best michael madsen <UNK> it up in his standard character persona denis hopper doesn't seem to know what he's supposed to be <UNK> jones accent is bizarre one positive thing is that <UNK> looks fantastic her acting is pretty poor but i doubt that's why <UNK> there br br the dialogue is truly appalling it is quite simply rubbish i don't know who signed off on this but they really need to get professional help next time round br br this film is the reason <UNK> rating system should be able to include zero stars out of ten avoid at all costs
<START> watching this film today i got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story john wayne rides up on this <UNK> post saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some <UNK> all he sees is the signs of a massacre some dead bodies signs of a fight and no one alive in sight that's because the <UNK> daughter is hidden in a secret room the kind you find in old english murder mysteries br br the reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were <UNK> catholic families <UNK> to the old faith in <UNK> century england built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith not something you see in westerns but a good gimmick br br unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought wayne to this place exactly but this was a b western and not even a good one at that br br <UNK> hayes is in this and he's clean <UNK> and playing a mute part of the time an unusual <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> br br if you want to bother and find out what happens and see a <UNK> hayes then see this film
<START> <UNK> is a man that makes a living out of <UNK> other solid citizens of their hard earned money together with <UNK> an older man with a lot of experience he pulls out <UNK> that allow him to make a decent living but that is not making him a rich man by any means enter <UNK> an older man who is more experience in the art of deception together with the younger <UNK> they prove a winning combination that only lasts until <UNK> former love interest appears in the picture br br this spanish film directed by <UNK> <UNK> is light in tone and pleasant to sit through other better made caper films have been made with much clever plots than this one but the film is easy to take and at times it has a lot of funny situations br br this viewer will see <UNK> in anything even reading the <UNK> <UNK> he is an actor's actor we have had the <UNK> of having seen him in the <UNK> <UNK> stage doing excellent work before his international film career as <UNK> he does what he does best it's impossible to imagine anyone better in his role <UNK> <UNK> the son of hector <UNK> is a young actor who promises to have a great career victoria <UNK> makes <UNK> fun as she gets involved with these con men <UNK> alexandre a veteran actor is also good as <UNK>
<START> i really like this show it has drama romance and comedy all rolled into one i am 28 and i am a married mother so i can identify both with and experiences in the show i have been watching mostly the repeats on the family channel lately so i am not up to date on what is going on now i think females would like this show more than males but i know some men out there would enjoy it i really like that is an hour long and not a half hour as <UNK> hour seems to fly by when i am watching it give it a chance if you have never seen the show i think and luke are my favorite characters on the show though mainly because of the way they are with one another how could you not see something was there or take that long to see it i guess i should say br br happy viewing
<START> michelle pfeiffer is <UNK> cast as the frustrated mob widow in this colourful black comedy matthew <UNK> plays a clumsy fbi agent who has taken a fancy to her dean <UNK> steals the show as the big shot who keeps on pfeiffer <UNK> <UNK> is dynamic as his jealous wife it's all very eighties but that just adds to the fun a nice little flick though not for every taste
<START> i have probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times every time i get more and more impressed by how far the wish of a young heart can go and the <UNK> of both <UNK> and to struggle for what they believe in br br and the whole story is presented in such a way you just get <UNK> into the plot and before you know it you are there you can see yeah there's <UNK> working hard on the mirror a little jump there's fighting for her love and there's the snow queen br br it's just a wonderful mix of love adventure tension br br it's brilliant 10 out of 10
<START> i'm not going to say too much as this movie isn't worth the effort to put it simply the movie absolutely sucked this is the worst movie i have ever seen the storyline was stupid you couldn't follow what was happening the characters were so annoying especially the main guy i wanted someone to kill that kid and put him and the movie out of it's misery br br very very bad
<START> finally i discovered what i thought i remembered as a four year old after seeing the 1960 color version on vhs i kept saying i remembered seeing it in black and white 2 times before now the imdb has helped me to know the truth that it was broadcast twice 2 productions in black and white in 2 successful years 1955 <UNK> these are the ones i remember best as a four year old i didn't realize the <UNK> broadcast was not the same as the <UNK> in 1960 i was 9 and the color production just didn't do it for me the black and white version was wonderful with just as much awe and wonder impact as the high tech films of today even without any computer effects you had to have been there please comment if you had a similar reaction to the b w version
<START> these guys combine low brow with low budget it's glorious br br look if you want bergman rent <UNK> seal or something if you want to see gross out humor and exploitation sex this is the one br br i think jane <UNK> as julia makes it all watchable she can actually act really well she's a complete <UNK> and she doesn't seem to feel above it all
<START> watch out this is not a gross out comedy like american pie or you know the comedies of the new <UNK> this is a sweet satire of dog shows focused on a bunch of completely different characters oh and the <UNK> is hilarious br br 10 10
<START> i saw <UNK> last night and it was an <UNK> experience br br it is a film that is visually rich but with slow direction poor plot line and 2 dimensional characterisation br br i did however know this when i went in i was willing to trust the two gentleman that i went with comic buffs that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so they were unfortunately <UNK> of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict though this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to screen and who are given charge of direction the pace of the story is lost as the camera lovingly <UNK> on the pretty pictures br br i would not have gone at all without that <UNK> that the style of the film would be worth seeing i have tried with neil <UNK> work but am always left with the <UNK> new clothes feeling i live in hope but last night was no exception br br i do not think i can continue with an analysis of <UNK> work without losing the will to live read the rest of the comments and all his faults are <UNK> described i cannot comprehend however how he imagined that he had any understanding of the mind of a fifteen year old girl nor that what he had to say added anything to the sum total of human knowledge on growing up and assuming adult responsibility or the changing relationship that a girl might have with her mother these are the central themes of the film and they are handled <UNK> <UNK> and with no depth of imagination all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core
<START> eddie <UNK> was simply bad possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently placed employees the song was totally stupid i think i could <UNK> offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far <UNK> it and probably win a <UNK> then as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the <UNK> of the scene <UNK> says something to the effect of don't tell insert the guy's name he doesn't like music and smiles i can't describe how bad this is i felt a little embarrassed and that guy debbie reynolds works with and who's always hitting on her is so annoying too i can't even imagine someone like her wasting a <UNK> of time on him the jokes were delivered without any sort of chemistry between characters which made the movie crawl by at least the baby had cute hair the two stars are for reynolds who was like a <UNK> among ugly br br see bachelor mother instead
<START> this is one of my favourite films a delightful comedy so i was thrilled to learn it is about to be released on dvd in the uk september 2007 br br played by daniel <UNK> is a rich company president of a <UNK> firm juliette played by the excellent richard is a <UNK> of the <UNK> paris <UNK> juliette a black mother of several children discovers a plot against who initially ignores her attempts to warn him slowly he <UNK> what this charming lady from the <UNK> <UNK> has been trying to tell him <UNK> seeks shelter in her crowded apartment as his marriage and career fall apart an unlikely love <UNK> cultures clash in what is a truly delightful light hearted comedy
<START> i am surprised that this well above average 80's comedy scores only a 5 2 from all the imdb voters dan <UNK> does his usual satirical turn as a con who <UNK> a great opportunity to steal a contract from his <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> to california to start his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous dr lawrence the only person that knows he's an <UNK> is the drunken priest walter matthau who comes along to be <UNK> by <UNK> new found wealth having him charles <UNK> throws in a good supporting performance too for its genre i think this film deserves the same as <UNK> <UNK> or 7 5 10
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is not a shred of historical accuracy in fact reality is <UNK> just one example morgan <UNK> on the few ethnic chinese he encountered the acting is over the top the script is a poorly written lie i have never seen worse fake <UNK> br br hopper arrived in australia and reportedly only would make the film if the script was totally <UNK> so he could be a hero since the script was ten made up on the fly the may explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie is br br any movie about ned kelly is a lot better than this film
<START> i had the pleasure to view this film when i was 10 years old having an existing interest in <UNK> i know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and <UNK> but over all this is the best film to date with the look of the 18th <UNK> br br the film only <UNK> the egyptian in plot a good portion of the text never made it to film as we have to consider the running length br br the music score by b <UNK> and alfred newman is beautiful performances as follows the late <UNK> <UNK> gave an excellent performance as an <UNK> child adopted by parents past their child bearing years he states that he keeps to himself has the best education available and face it is a rather emotionally distant person given his upbringing and high intellect br br jean simmons is fine as a humble <UNK> maid honest loving and sincere <UNK> people complained about her accent well she is a <UNK> it is not that apparent in the film as to why is so insanely obsessed with her correct name in the book is enjoying her <UNK> <UNK> and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving drugged body with the house of the <UNK> workers br br gene tierney as is brilliant when she tells that he is <UNK> she looks like she could <UNK> him in his weakness she is intense brilliant and <UNK> beautiful br br michael <UNK> is <UNK> tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one god i believe that we are viewing thru the lens of <UNK> a a view at the time that had a pre <UNK> feeling about <UNK> did his <UNK> influence the jewish people note <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> imagery in the <UNK> br br mr peter ustinov provided the alter ego to he is street wise and cunning a survivor excellent acting as always br br mature never thought much of his acting personally his is fine as an ambitious super <UNK> who ultimately has murder more than one person in his quest for power book br br i felt that the ending to the egyptian was confusing as personality changes too easily he has a living son <UNK> dies in the novel power is handed to him through is half sister he world <UNK> now and has a grip on international affairs so he became <UNK> he could have <UNK> the <UNK> as he was capable br br but no gives everything up everything including his son's future to become a <UNK> <UNK> preaching <UNK> love br br this change was too immediate and the major flaw in the script br br again the look of the film colour most of the costumes gold dress was too over the top as she is more richly dressed than the royal family music is beautiful br br i will watch this film again easily br br p s i know that you know that did not directly but i could not resist stating this fact
<START> after having spent a lot of my youth watching such movies i found this one very easy to follow in both the <UNK> and cut versions although the story has much more to hold it together in the <UNK> version unlike ninja <UNK> this movie hit a much more serious note and i think that's where it hit me the animation while grainy is very original and i just love the way artists in that year <UNK> shadows to show different emotions i think the story is perfect the beginning of the movie really hits hard and as the movie progresses you get the feeling that you're going along in this adventure with the characters as they meet become allies and find out the their greatest strengths a lot of heart was put into this
<START> set in <UNK> hong kong in <UNK> times as we are informed this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors <UNK> yet restrained <UNK> as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication it's not hard to see the influence of <UNK> here since she is known for <UNK> in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and non verbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of re <UNK> scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters' lives from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the <UNK> rooms of mr <UNK> tony <UNK> and mrs <UNK> li <UNK> maggie cheung to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in <UNK> this relationship br br the plot even resembles something that could have written mr <UNK> and mrs <UNK> li <UNK> neighbors in a <UNK> apartment while both being fairly successful professionals begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their <UNK> are cheating on them and they discover quite naturally it's with each other the question is should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other and at one point it is suggested that eventually they do though as <UNK> as the camera is in <UNK> to us their encounters which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of <UNK> dresses we never see it and just as not seeing either of their <UNK> <UNK> their own love story not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual <UNK> even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen some <UNK> and the only one which comes is when <UNK> reveals to her that he loves her followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband which implies that neither will he it also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do from a western point of view a <UNK> of their romance into a more solid lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 60s but as it's hong kong cultural values are <UNK> different br br performances here are of the high order it's very easy to play a <UNK> love affair but to continually play a repressed <UNK> relationship that is <UNK> with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the <UNK> more cerebral than <UNK> or visual cheung and <UNK> <UNK> and their <UNK> chemistry <UNK> long after the credits have rolled
<START> now we know where they got the idea of snakes on a plane to put it <UNK> do not pay to see this movie if you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life then either catch it on cable or get it as a free pick from netflix or blockbuster do not pay to rent this if you do pay to rent this then you are one stupid individual the acting was awful the plot was awful everything was awful except for the snakes whether they were real or cgi generated they did look pretty good but that being said still this movie has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen even the nude dancing scene was pretty bad that i actually fast <UNK> through that don't sat i did not warn you
<START> this is a documentary about homeless women it was interesting in the sense that this focused on women who are engaged socially having jobs and lasting friendships but are in situations where they can not afford <UNK> br br i found some of the women covered to be interesting but there was little focus or progression in the story the direction and editing failed to maintain my attention there were differences in the stories of these women of course but the message was essentially the same and could have been told by focusing on any one of them in more depth br br i made it to the end of the movie but it was a rather boring journey
<START> given the budget and the <UNK> of everyone involved <UNK> <UNK> life could have been worse <UNK> wants to be chris tucker whom i've always found very annoying as a previous <UNK> has noted but <UNK> edward d smith while some of his over reactions go on way too long a director's problem has some <UNK> subtle and funny moments such as when he is trying to <UNK> <UNK> on the proper method of smoking a joint with a buddy throughout he is usually more <UNK> and self possessed than <UNK> which could have been the <UNK> of a nice exploration of the <UNK> in the relationship but wasn't developed very far br br but the <UNK> of the writer director cinematographer etc is no excuse for his <UNK> has he ever seen a movie faces are important has he ever heard of a <UNK> even ed wood could do a <UNK> i don't think it's much of a budget issue i could only give a general description of what any of the actors look like and not just because of no closeups but the lighting lights for <UNK> shooting may cost too much but you can make a with pieces of paper that would have required moving the camera closer to keep the out of the shot helping to solve the <UNK> problem at the same time if that's too technical you can turn the actors around so they are not in shadow or you can expose for the shadows and if it hadn't been shot in l a i'd say take advantage of <UNK> days it goes without saying that the movies this one steals from are all with the possible exception of weekend at <UNK> better than this one but <UNK> <UNK> life would have left a much better impression if it hadn't made the viewer <UNK> all the way through just to catch a glimpse of whatever the human element might have been br br p s the scene in the <UNK> is just stupid
<START> this movie quite literally does not have one redeeming feature the characters are one dimensional cliched incredibly misogynistic and stupid the script looks as if it was <UNK> together from 100 other movies the acting is horrible and some of the <UNK> <UNK> humour made me feel <UNK> br br shame on you gregory for thinking any of this would be funny or interesting br br the worst movie i've seen in several years
<START> this film is by far the worst film i have ever seen in my life a woman the ex pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex husband killing people for no reason in <UNK> to achieve her goal the women i don't think ever went to acting college she just spends the whole film making stupid expressions and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera failing on most occasions she makes friends with her ex husband's wife and son she does this to use them against her husband at first when you watch this film you think that the ex wants to kill her ex husband maybe because he has treated her in a bad way but in fact the women is obsessed with the man and wants him back the two of them used to enjoy rough entertainment using <UNK> of course my advice to the general public is do not buy this film do not rent this film and do not watch it like i did at 1 on fox
<START> at first glance a film like <UNK> a town set to be <UNK> in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent out to <UNK> the remaining <UNK> could be just an ordinary film as we soon meet a remaining priest taking care of a sick child a greedy land owner we could be set up for a simple story we could all easily <UNK> however when one is first introduced to this film you notice the amazing wide open cinematography and a scene involving a church hall missing a wall that opens up to the <UNK> and <UNK> view of the mountains with cattle <UNK> it soon becomes clear that after this scene and a few of the towns peoples introduction that this is no ordinary film and no ordinary story it is something very special and unique br br at first glance things are not as clear but the cinematography and landscape that the viewer is witness to is stunning and the characters that inhabit this small soon to be <UNK> area are just in word amazing it's what can either draw you in closer to this film or either have you bored sitting there waiting for something to happen br br the films deep spiritual and dream like qualities give it a slow and <UNK> approach which i am sure will bore some viewers but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture the film is great to witness br br rating 8 out of 10
<START> this film is slow this film is cheap this film makes friday the 13th look like a best picture <UNK> the acting is crap the special effects are crap no one dies for like 40 minutes and all the people do is act badly the only thing that saves it is it's ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity going on the funniest part is watching the heroine fight off the <UNK> she supposed to be trained but she fights like a 70 year old they spend pointless scenes on people who don't die and no scenes on people who do die to the point where you don't even know why they are <UNK> i love slashers but this is just crap
<START> in the early <UNK> production companies had a short lived <UNK> for supernatural genre movies in france after the <UNK> rivers and <UNK> of the wolf turned out to be hits so several movies were green lit or saved from their direct to video fate however france as opposed to the us uk or italy has little tradition of fantasy b movies and it turned out quickly that bloody <UNK> or the <UNK> rivers sequel were ill advised attempts at <UNK> a kind of magic that had never existed in french cinema in the first place as they <UNK> producers have gone back to their usual fare derivative <UNK> or the <UNK> self <UNK> tribute to french new wave by a former critic from les <UNK> du <UNK> br br could only have been green lit during this short window as it serves no other discernible purpose it's your by the book slasher movie mixed with vague <UNK> element and horror references and you'll find <UNK> female characters a french university looking like a us campus and plot twists so lazy you don't even care because you had guessed it by yourself an hour before even before the movie started br br these elements make all the fun of a 70's or a 80's b movie and you expect them in a 70's or 80's movie however we're not in the 80's anymore and nobody warned director doug <UNK> as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie <UNK> himself is no rookie and has been writing as a critic about this kind of pictures since the early 80's but as a first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes a bore br br when you put together clich√©s from a movie and hand them to a skilled and inventive director such as wes craven or quentin tarantino you get a scream or a death proof movies that are <UNK> from old guilty pleasures but also <UNK> these clich√©s and add a great deal to them that's called talent and that's why you can't confuse these recent movies with their original <UNK> shot decades ago br br takes the lazy path and only <UNK> the worst elements from past movies unfortunately for the male viewer the gratuitous nudity is mostly missing there are very strong similarities presumably unintentional between the plot of and the <UNK> halloween 3 season of the witch as both deal with supernatural <UNK> evil <UNK> and some silly attempt at taking over the world on halloween night as even the plot of halloween 3 makes more sense than this one it means that something seriously wrong went with
<START> <UNK> girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm wit and charm at age 16 <UNK> gave birth to <UNK> <UNK> she left her parents house and got a job now and <UNK> have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy they are best friends the girls have an extensive knowledge of movies and tv shows and are constantly <UNK> them in the first season needs money to send <UNK> to <UNK> a very highly rated high school so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents they are happy to give them the money but in exchange <UNK> has to come have dinner with them every friday night i highly recommend this show i love it
<START> well br br first of all as many reviewers have pointed out this is a rip off of the martin <UNK> story first represented by the bbc and by the john <UNK> film the general which is a great film and far far superior to this one br br speaking as a native british person the supporting cast to kevin spacey was really good in terms of british and irish acting talent especially peter but it was totally wasted the characters were c p and as for kevin spacey didn't come across as a <UNK> rogue but as nothing really substantial or significant br br not a lot to redeem this film the best bits are the gags and tricks <UNK> from the other films it rips off compare notes on this film and the general i'd be interested to see what others think br br
<START> many people have said that this movie was not a good movie at a horror perspective i agree it was not very scary it did have some gruesome ways of torture yes <UNK> going where they shouldn't but not scary but it was a good movie at a comedic stand point i thought it was hilarious such bad acting from dee <UNK> with his stupid <UNK> questioning and every second word he said came out as what is define then the angry mob at his house with one of them holding a sign saying we're not gonna take it which is a song from his band twisted sister but i think the part that made me laugh the most was the one guy's wife that was dead and dee <UNK> was holding her up and making her dance when i saw that i broke out in tears so i would not recommend this for avid horror lovers but for those who love horror for its comedy i recommend this movie 100
<START> i have seen films come and go in my years and when i see a disaster film i keep hoping i wont be disappointed and with this one i was not in the least the story of a whole country sinking into the ocean was a great concept written by a novelist with intense theories on where this earth is going the characters were top notch and even though i am not japanese i didn't need a <UNK> to give the idea of how people in their most desperate needs can come together for the common good the special effects blew me away i was literally on the edge of my seat watching the <UNK> waves <UNK> flows and land explosions that must have taken months of work to perfect as for the acting i thought yes this is acting at its best emotions run rampant throughout the film and i cried at the most severe scenes for movie goers alike you don't need to speak or understand japanese to watch this film you can get the idea and feeling from each person and character to understand it well and to follow it along like you are there my hats off to <UNK> <UNK> for directing it i hope he can <UNK> his work with another mind blowing experience as i said fantastic film
<START> one of the best movies ever the idea of a double interpretation involves we all br br would be a <UNK> or an e t no doubt in my opinion but let's keep the question open kevin spacey the big screen monster plays as it should be done let's not forget jeff bridges and his great psychiatric br br lastly a masterpiece that for itself can keep our eyes wide open from the beginning to the credits and our minds thinking even when the movie is over if you still didn't watch it go right now and again again
<START> i'm not going to go into too much depth but showtime was a pretty funny movie there wasn't any <UNK> your <UNK> funny scenes that i can remember but it had it's moments the cast is pretty good robert de niro is good as usual and eddie murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance <UNK> russo was just fine in the film no complaints there there were two characters in the story that i liked that they didn't explain much at all the first one was <UNK> <UNK> eddie murphy's buddy at the gym played by ken campbell i supposed he was just a friend of but i wanted to know more about him the other character that i liked was mitch <UNK> robert de <UNK> fellow cop partner played by <UNK> <UNK> i guess he was just another cop working with mitch preston but i wanted to know if he was his partner or what not i think maybe i'm putting too much thought into a movie i mean after all it's a comedy who cares about the characters i guess i do though i was really pleased to see this was directed by tom <UNK> who also directed shanghai <UNK> ever since i saw that movie i was looking forward to his next work i think he did a pretty good job with this film and i again look forward to his next work br br all in all it was a good movie but i wouldn't recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you're a die hard robert de niro eddie murphy <UNK> russo fan it was worth seeing in the theater but not for full price i'd recommend seeing it at <UNK> price br br also here's some movie trivia for ya the guy who played the camera man played by <UNK> is the guy in the music video everyday by dave <UNK> band he was also the clerk in meet the parents also starring robert de niro and on top of that he also played derek brother in <UNK> both <UNK> and meet the parents star ben stiller just some useless trivia for ya br br i hope you enjoy the film thanks for reading br br chris
<START> this movie is awful at first i thought it may appeal to children due to the <UNK> ewoks the fury little people from stars wars after sitting through this monstrosity of a movie i am certain that not even a 4 year old would find this movie interesting the special effects are by far the best of this movie and compare well for other <UNK> tv movies the script is bad the actors especially miller and unbelievably bad and the flick is so predictable that i still can't believe i was able to not touch the forward button on my vcr however i came close to switching this mess off more than once
<START> their purple moment br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format silent br br black and white short film br br two <UNK> nightclub laurel and hardy are unable to pay their bill provoking violent <UNK> from a hot <UNK> <UNK> tiny <UNK> br br typical l h scenario less substantial than some of their best work from this period but worth a look nonetheless stan takes center stage this time round caught up in a financial dilemma after holding back part of his <UNK> to <UNK> a night on the town only to find out too late that his <UNK> wife fay has replaced his <UNK> with worthless <UNK> some of the prolonged closeups of laurel as he slowly becomes aware of the unfolding disaster reveal his genius for characterization and <UNK> <UNK> morality is represented by <UNK> <UNK> playing a <UNK> faced busy body who takes great joy in <UNK> l <UNK> respective <UNK> and <UNK> to their <UNK> bad behavior the ending <UNK> but the movie still has much to recommend it directed by james
<START> after some further thought about this film i find it's far too easy to dismiss this as the boy's dream i have actually received some spiritual strength from <UNK> angels do exist we definitely are entertained by angels most of the time we aren't even aware of it at a point of spiritual and emotional in my life i personally really needed this film yes as i wrote before it speaks to so many can't wait to get to heaven br br being so sick of all of the fx and formula stuff i found this film to be genuine cinema all i can say is it touched me in so many ways that i still am <UNK> it all out north <UNK> is a wonderful film one that brings the viewer's mind out of the <UNK> and into the heart the spiritual aspect is so very intriguing to me pay attention as you'll need to use the brain and heart god gave you to follow the story i think it's possibly a bit over the heads of some but i feel those are the individuals it speaks to most importantly i want to view it several more times just so i can take it all in br br the industry needs to study this film to realize we do exist br br my thanks to all involved in the making of this film
<START> i want to say that i went to this movie with my expectations way too high i thought it was going to be funny because it's the sequel to bruce almighty which was really funny and it stars steve carell who is an excellent comedic actor but boy did it sucked br br the movie is advertised as a sequel but it really has nothing to do with the original since the only people <UNK> their roles are morgan freeman and steve carell but <UNK> character is completely different he is no longer the jerk he was in the first one here he is a nice guy the story is different and the actors are different and it's not funny br br all the actors involved steve carell morgan freeman <UNK> sykes john goodman ed <UNK> and even jon stewart in a very crappy cameo have talent but none of them seems to use it and it looks that there in the movie just for the money br br now the plot is obviously shaped after <UNK> story but there are so many wrong things with it i don't know where to start i guess the big problem is that in the everyone around <UNK> thinks that he is crazy despite all the things that are happening to him he grows a huge white beard in two days he gets help from animals from all around the world he builds a giant arc in a few weeks in real life people wouldn't be mocking these guy after that they would be saying he is the new <UNK> br br also the special effects are good but what the hell is the greatest movie <UNK> ever filmed doing in <UNK> almighty did they really had to waste such good special effects as filler for this crappy movie br br jim carrey seems to be a smart guy since he has stayed away of three of the worst sequels ever made son of the mask dumb and and now <UNK> almighty br br this was a giant disappointment and tom should be ashamed of himself
<START> i was very impressed with the latest production from mick as a fan of his i was used to a different kind of humour than displayed here he wisely <UNK> with a more subtle broad style of comedy in <UNK> rather than his usual low brow in your face <UNK> it is at times inconsistent and un even but a decent script works past that and makes for some entertaining viewing directed by paul <UNK> who has directed almost every australian tv series imaginable <UNK> tells the story of jack simpson a bloke that belongs to his local <UNK> club for the sole reason of parking when the club hits financial trouble he is forced to bowl in an attempt to raise the <UNK> to save the club from becoming a poker machine <UNK> a familiar and successful formula that is handled well there is no denying that the film owes it's success to the great casting of he seemed to have a great <UNK> with samuel johnson and excellent chemistry with <UNK> lucy and while the character is probably not a far stretch from his own personality you can't help but wonder why he hadn't tried his arm at film earlier to smooth out the in experienced cast the delightful frank wilson and bill hunter support and often steal their scenes they are two fine actors and the pair cruise through their roles with ease had it not been for the huge success of <UNK> big fat greek <UNK> <UNK> would have made it to number 1 at the australian box office but when you consider what he film is about and who is involved even making it to number 2 was an outstanding effort all in all a witty feel good movie great cast great crew and a great soundtrack combine to make one of the better australian films of 2002 7 10
<START> minor spoilers br br you know it's getting to the point where walt disney television animation might just as well be called walt disney sequel animation these sequels range from excellent beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas and the fantastic lion king ii <UNK> pride to horrible the return of <UNK> this is of course my personal opinion now disney brings us their latest sequel adventure and while it is flawed it is still entertaining br br the quality of animation is not up to par with disney feature animation still the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life lady and tramp have not aged a day since 1955 <UNK> still talks about his sense of smell and ol' reliable and jock still gives him grief about it there's a nice fight between tramp and a huge dog in the dog pound and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads though it is highly <UNK> that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor br br i really don't care for most of the songs though roger bart and susan <UNK> the singing voices of <UNK> and angel sing their parts very nicely both melissa <UNK> and norman have done much better work in the past danny score is okay but nothing memorable and some of the <UNK> gang seem like excess <UNK> that is they really don't do much br br the voice work on the other hand is quite good while i don't like jeff bennett as the he is very good as tramp <UNK> <UNK> does a nice job as buster leader of the <UNK> gang and <UNK> <UNK> gives what may be her best performance as angel then there is <UNK> who is the spitting image of his dad he is voiced to perfection by scott wolf wolf does a superb job of showing wild streak and his soft side br br all in all while adventure is flawed it still makes for rather entertaining viewing it is my hope however that walt disney television animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases br br
<START> i don't usually comment on films since i am in the movie distribution business but i have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time the acting is fantastic and the script is even better there were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more hollywood james <UNK> is such an outstanding actor i could not look away from him if i tried i was impressed with steven robertson as well i cannot believe this is his first real film brenda <UNK> plays a small role but as usual she is outstanding this is a movie for everyone to see just how lucky we all are if you like <UNK> and mask you will enjoy this story you owe it to yourself to check this film out
<START> <UNK> man was okay for the first 5 minutes but as soon as the so called special force agents hit the screen it went down hill faster than a fat kid on a <UNK> br br the opening makes us think we might have a corny yet fun horror flick on our hands but no the film makers ruin any hope of that when the special force agents show up i wish the screenwriter took a different route and had the <UNK> man chase down some dim witted teenagers until one of them finally gets the upper hand instead the <UNK> man chases down some dim witted special force agents and offs them until their captain finally gets the upper hand br br i know the whole stalking of dim witted teenagers by a killer thing as been done before but it would of been more suited for a movie like this br br when the <UNK> man finally does meet his so called demise in a building that blows up the captain of the special force agents is asked the following by a police officer outside of the building what the hell happened in there my answer to that question who the hell cares
<START> there needs to be a 0 10 option for <UNK> like this br br it was painful to watch but strangely compelling all the same compelling because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could actually suck this much i kept thinking it must get better it got worse and worse br br how on earth were people <UNK> into producing such a <UNK> piece of junk i'll never know the most surprising thing of all though is all these reviews i see of people actually loving the movie yes the acting was good but the movie was very very very bad worst movie ever
<START> i think that there was too much action in the end don't you think that too there was romance adventure that just like told me to put 9 to this movie but action place was too long i liked reeve a bit i didn't understand why did he have to die i thought that one of the girls gonna die too but my lucky no one else who i liked didn't die how about you what did you liked i saw the movie twice actually and after that i bought that too it was worth it who did you liked best person the book was really really really cool and the actresses and actors too everything was perfect what was the song name in the end will someone answer my questions too please please please
<START> director jay craven's adaptation of howard frank <UNK> the rivers flow <UNK> is one of the <UNK> transitions from literature to the screen craven is an admirer of work he also directed 'a stranger in the <UNK> br br the cast is superb especially rip torn and <UNK> torn offers what could be the finest role of his career <UNK> lord the <UNK> independent former <UNK> who is at the center of this story portrayal of <UNK> live in <UNK> common law wife is dead on as well i'm both amazed and disappointed that neither of them were nominated for oscars when this film was released performances of this <UNK> should be acknowledged the only character that's a little hard to swallow for me is the power company executive played by michael j fox he just looks too much like a kid in this role i guess there's a curse attached to youthful looks no matter how much people want them br br craven has done a nice job here in bringing the character of early 20th century <UNK> to the screen locations angles sets all combine to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story cinematographer paul ryan was exceptional the score by the is also first rate it fits the mood and scenery perfectly br br and the story itself one of the most compelling portrayals of the <UNK> independent american <UNK> spirit ever a <UNK> that is on the <UNK> in this day and age when it appears in modern times the person is often looked upon with suspicion and disdain in <UNK> lord we have a character whom we can admire for his values and even for his <UNK> br br this is not a <UNK> but a vibrant look at an era that is gone and a type of character that has all but <UNK> these are not gold <UNK> heroes but real people with both strengths and weaknesses at play within them struggling in a harsh environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world in which they live like today there are those who <UNK> power that would have it otherwise
<START> i was lucky enough to see a test screening of <UNK> a couple months ago in santa monica i was blown away you don't see films like this anymore in the vein of <UNK> tells the tragic story of <UNK> as he <UNK> the tough streets of la to rise above the ranks to become a drug lord of proportions the characters are complex and conflicted the emotions are real the action is fast and furious the stunts are <UNK> and <UNK> is hot she hasn't looked this good since her days i'd recommend this to anyone it's a fantastic homage to the epic action films of the late 80s and early 90s and to all the <UNK> out <UNK> watch it again you obviously had your eyes closed the first time <UNK> to all involved in the film i'm counting the days until the sequel is released anyone have a date on that
<START> the movie opens with a scene that simply could not be a man wakes up and while his wife remains in bed he begin his morning <UNK> in his bedroom while his wife sleeps <UNK> morning <UNK> are <UNK> but only the ones <UNK> finds controversial the rest are conveniently <UNK> then while in and a he kisses his wife good morning this is not an accurate depiction of jewish <UNK> in any home let alone a home <UNK> is not interested in accurately portraying life he is interested in adding to his ever growing list of melodramatic and empty films the ritual bath scenes are far from accurate and his jewish wedding was laughable as it does not even approach the atmosphere of a wedding i have many problems with the way of life but i have no use for <UNK> commentary on these issues he would have you think that the are all dense with severe <UNK> of depression i may not agree with the lifestyle but i acknowledge that life has many layers <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> by his own pseudo intellectual <UNK> and is therefore incapable of portraying an accurate of life aside from his poor research and <UNK> portrayal of life <UNK> fails in other aspects as well the plot is full of holes the dialogue loaded with silence the soundtrack is too repetitive and the acting while at times <UNK> was too often loaded with melodrama the movie drags on and on and the ending is not worth sticking around for watch if you must but be warned if you want to learn about life go to the <UNK> and talk to do not rely on film
<START> most likely <UNK> will be of little interest if you did not watch the series when it was broadcast and i don't think that many people did but if you are still somewhat intrigued it is a buck rogers in the <UNK> century premise without space ships and with no budget for wardrobe or production design br br in this case the buck rogers part <UNK> is played by jennifer sky which one might expect to be a good thing as jennifer is very beautiful and quite talented and has a nice comedic touch but a quick glance at the <UNK> material will show that she is somewhat the worse for having a bad <UNK> and a salvation army <UNK> store wardrobe if you remember how <UNK> jennifer was during her time on <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> look will be a huge disappointment with a target audience of teenage boys looking to burn their <UNK> looking at hot fetish <UNK> girls it is not a good idea to <UNK> on the exploitation value of your heroine or her costume and they wonder why some series don't attract much of an audience love it or hate it buck rogers had <UNK> costumes and much better looking guest stars br br the other two exploitation elements are two female associates <UNK> gina <UNK> basically playing her stock <UNK> character and <UNK> victoria <UNK> another <UNK> connection an extremely wooden version of natasha <UNK> <UNK> does a good job playing off the <UNK> character providing most of the show's comic relief br br <UNK> sings the theme song a somewhat lame parody of rick in the year and <UNK> 1969 you remember the one that opens with the words in the year if man is still alive if woman can survive they may find i suspect that they gave the series its title so that they could butcher this catchy little song although who knows perhaps the title is a homage to buck rogers and they thought of using the song later br br so the premise of the show is that the <UNK> surface has been taken over by aliens called not the <UNK> one and the humans have been driven underground our three <UNK> fight against the under the direction of a <UNK> presumably female voice appropriately referred to as voice unlike buck rogers <UNK> is kind of a <UNK> third <UNK> still <UNK> and confused from her sleep or maybe just <UNK> from the creepy <UNK> there are a lot of nice close ups of sky wide eyed and <UNK> like buck rogers the running gag is <UNK> using a common 21st century expression and everyone finding it either totally profound or completely <UNK> br br unlike <UNK> the action is more of that hyper edited <UNK> garbage which is neither realistic nor particularly entertaining one good gimmick is that the girls travel around <UNK> fashion a sort of web <UNK> through <UNK> and <UNK> in the <UNK> of their underground world br br strangely or maybe not considering the budget these are only half hour episodes and except for one two part show there is not enough time for any subtlety and nuance br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> seeing this show gives me respect for mtv though i imagine that mtv sees this random edgy material as its main selling point and is much less concerned with the <UNK> truths it expresses br br i write and play music for a living and this show gets me really emotionally <UNK> up for me serves a completely distinct function from most tv instead of <UNK> or distracting the senses which can be often really nice at times it <UNK> my spirit of right and wrong it makes me very uncomfortable but in a very <UNK> way br br i don't think a lot of viewers <UNK> most of this show's content but if they do kudos to television viewers everywhere
<START> i don't know if this exceptionally dull movie was intended as an <UNK> sequel to 'the french connection but it does have many of the same <UNK> the script is so confusing that the viewer remains <UNK> and feels left out of the picture and the direction is so cold so lacking in energy that even the great chase sequence can't <UNK> things up 1 2
<START> <UNK> i think i'll be the only one who's saying this but yes i was a <UNK> bored during the film not to say that this is a bad movie in fact it's a very good attempt at portraying the <UNK> emotions dilemma sorrow love <UNK> it's the director's debut read from somewhere is it true i felt that <UNK> not quite right maybe it's just me i'm not drawn to the characters enough to <UNK> me in their world this is a simple story about ordinary people ordinary lives through simple and short dialogs the director tries to relate a simple guy's life and how <UNK> with the news of his illness by laughing it away every time oh ya his laughter was kinda cute at first but gradually it gets to me such a deep <UNK> <UNK> for a gentle man i must say i didn't feel the impact that most readers felt in fact i was more drawn to the trivial scenarios like spitting of <UNK> <UNK> with his <UNK> that clearly shows that they're comfortable with each other the <UNK> who came back for another shot this is kinda <UNK> the thoughtful gesture of writing down the <UNK> for his dad hmm but this is predictable don't misunderstood that i'm an action lover independent films are my cup of tea perhaps i just have a really high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger imagery some asian films worth the watch br br tony depicts loneliness <UNK> cloud only 1 dialog my sassy girl i like it 4 30 loneliness as well 15 gangsters lives in local setting before sunrise and before sunset i just have to mention these even though they are not asian films fans will understand
<START> when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldn't see <UNK> in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was <UNK> of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though i'm not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot
<START> this was a wonderful little film that truly was creative and fun something you see all too seldom in movies the film begins in russia just after the fall of the communist government as a result society seems to be in chaos and life has yet to improve now that the old regime is gone dirty cities crime and lack of <UNK> still plague the poor residents of st <UNK> br br into this scene of <UNK> and <UNK> comes an idealistic music teacher he is among those without a home and he finally gets a letter from the government that tells him he has a tiny room in a nearby flat when he arrives the place is a mess but the people seem friendly enough so they all have a lovely party in the middle of the night they are <UNK> by an old lady walking out of the giant wardrobe in the room i was half expecting lucy and the other kids from the lion the witch and the wardrobe to come out but they didn't they are too shocked to do anything at first but decide soon to investigate instead of just being a clothes closet the wardrobe opens into paris how the residents of the flat respond to this magical <UNK> is really intriguing some like the music teacher are thrilled and in awe most of the others are more <UNK> and are mostly concerned with <UNK> everything from paris before the <UNK> <UNK> once and for all these russian thieves are awful people greedy coarse and crude but down deep very deep are hearts of gold i like how this is a metaphor for the nation now on the brink of capitalism at first they run amok grabbing everything they can and only later do they reveal some depth but mostly they act much like guests on the jerry springer show the film has many twists and turns and is both funny and mesmerizing about the only negative is that due to some harsh language and a nude scene albeit a very funny one this is not a film for kids this is a real shame as with some very minor editing this could have been a great family film
<START> i love camp movies believe me and the usual gore of gordon lewis don't bother me at all but this is just one of his most stupid movies even more than blood feast i'm not kidding the gore gore girls is about a mad person who kills a lot of go re go re girls of a night club a detective and a reporter tries to find out the big secret maybe the performances here are slightly better than the usual average acting h g lewis films but that is not saying much the camera work is even dreadful br br but at least is kind of watchable with the go go girls acting you going to pass a good time with it and the killings are just absurd in a very very bad way a girl is killed with a wooden hammer <UNK> in her butt and just don't let me talk about what it does with the <UNK> you going to laugh like anyone with this but the better of all this mess is a scene that i only love of it's the go go girl before being attacked by a lot of <UNK> dancing in a very american way though is important to note that this was one of the first films that got an x rating because of it's violence br br only if you want lo laugh and pass a good time but only with a lot a lot of beers
<START> if you like shoot em up westerns this is a keeper i thought that the movie was fun to watch and to see folks that i have not seen in a while i am no expert but i liked the acting the town and props etc seemed to fit the period and kind of town that you would find out on the frontier this is not an a western not enough people and budget the costumes and <UNK> were correct for the time i expect to see the young actors in the film again in the future rachel chance and <UNK> were great the <UNK> single action shooting society members that contributed to this effort were pretty darn good hope to see more
<START> well i generally like iranian movies and after having seen 10 by <UNK> the night before i was expecting a great movie i was very disappointed this is by far the worst iranian film and one of the most boring asian movies i have ever seen if you have never seen a <UNK> movie before watch ten instead if you want some good iranian movies you may also try aka the apple this movie is divided in 5 parts and only the fourth featuring some funny <UNK> is worth watching if this is the first iranian movie you see you probably won't want to see any more i don't blame you but you will miss some great movies
<START> i saw this with my with my kids they love it but i don't she did not get run <UNK> by a <UNK> in the song but what the heck in this crappy movie she got hit by the <UNK> it's like what the heck why why when my kids heard the they thought it was good but we they watched this they were like this daddy why did <UNK> thats how my kids say grandma any way my kids said this daddy why did grandma get hit by a <UNK> i told them that the movie was crappy they agreed it's sad why would any one name there dog that's just dumb when every one dressed in black that looked so so i mean daphne looked like a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> girl every one looked like in the song they found grandma on the ground i think she died in the song but in this weird crappy movie she was gone i think they should take this show off ok every one would love this i give this a 1 out of 10
<START> i have been a fan of <UNK> since all that and she is still funny too me it's as simple as that if you like the <UNK> you will like this film it's harmless fun and quite funny in parts wacky sebastian accent and mannerisms are entirely unrealistic but made me laugh so hard at some points i almost <UNK> on my popcorn br br and anything that gets teens reading shakespeare maybe is a good thing for me br br on a shallow note <UNK> <UNK> is quite <UNK> freaking hot he also does a good job with some of the film's <UNK> scenes br br some of the side characters are very broad but they are broad in <UNK> night so it's cool
<START> this movie is well made it is beautiful and wise it is heart warming it is great and again it shows how great peter falk is he is fantastic and he even gets better the older he gets thank you peter falk thank you very much for this gem of a movie br br this movie entertains there is lot of wisdom in this movie there is lot of humor in this movie there is life in this movie and meaning this movie shows how life can be br br peter falk is in that movie he is just great where is the oscar for peter falk he deserves it so very much br br peter falk just turned 80 i do sincerely hope that there will be more movies br br walter j
<START> being in the <UNK> of new york when the z boys were creating history in <UNK> i was only exposed to a glimpse of what was going on i had a p o s black knight <UNK> with clay <UNK> it is long gone and on the ash heap of my personal life but i never forgot it's like watching long lost brothers and friends and it hits me right where i live i cannot watch this film enough every time i view it some other aspect rises to the top some other viewpoint come into sharp focus the vintage footage the incredible stills the current personalities with the vivid shadows of the <UNK> lit past the heartfelt and not over done narrative all beautifully edited together in such a way as to make a landmark documentary of a genuine slice of american history in the words of <UNK> <UNK> it was f ing unbelievable
<START> saw this as part of the <UNK> reel <UNK> film festival i hope they got better movies than this because this film failed to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained from the fantasy of seeing james franco without his shirt down to more simple wishes such as decent acting coherent direction character development or actual production values plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress and obvious influences ranging from my own private <UNK> to terminator 2 this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience after the first twenty minutes of <UNK> trying to take it seriously the audience <UNK> threw up it's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent <UNK> of the film i could be upset that i paid nine bucks to see it and it was two hours i'll never get back but on the other hand it was an entertaining two hours i'll never get back this would have been a classic mystery science 3000 episode
<START> i saw the movie in as the closing film of film festival i didn't know anything about it but right now i'm glad i didn't refuse the chance to see <UNK> a <UNK> less it is one of the funniest movies i've ever watched and believe me i've seen <UNK> of movies i'm a film critic clever script and dialogs smart details what else can i say an indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor one can't stop by wonder what he's capable of right now <UNK> a <UNK> less was shot five years ago and i'm sure the director is more mature now i heard that his next feature will be a political satire and i really can't wait to see that too among with his previous works like house of <UNK>
<START> yes it's sean connery playing bond again looking more alive and into his part than any time since the first time they made this film in 1965 when it was called <UNK> but the tongue is so firmly in cheek one wonders if connery isn't <UNK> a few observed tricks from his friend and more humorous <UNK> roger moore br br moore is my favorite bond but connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual outing the only serious bond film not made under the of the classic <UNK> bond series never say never again is an <UNK> return to the well soft on action it's nevertheless strong on character and clever dialogue br br bond it's made clear right away is a man in no matter how many times he has saved the world his new boss thinks little of his fat lifestyle too many free <UNK> that's your problem caused by eating too much red meat white bread too many <UNK> then i shall cut out the white bread sir bond <UNK> replies br br an early fight sequence in a <UNK> represents the movie's high point action wise with bond and an <UNK> fighting their way through a kitchen a bedroom and a laboratory before bond finally <UNK> his <UNK> ironically with no small help from those free <UNK> humor is <UNK> applied in the film rather more cleverly than most of moore's <UNK> though connery seems to be having more fun sending himself up as a result of moore's less <UNK> example br br was it because he was making a good <UNK> of the gross or was it working for less <UNK> producers whatever it is the screenplay serves his laid back style well and the result is <UNK> and more entertaining than <UNK> prior two <UNK> bond <UNK> you only live twice and <UNK> are forever br br the 1980s were not a good decade for bond whether it was connery moore or timothy dalton leg <UNK> video games and ugly sports cars are all in evidence and the <UNK> jagger <UNK> <UNK> maria <UNK> is seen wearing in his first scene do him no <UNK> forget first impressions <UNK> role as the chief villain <UNK> <UNK> is one of the best in any bond film with <UNK> <UNK> playing up his character's menace and <UNK> at one point he allows bond free <UNK> of his situation room with a <UNK> to boot and his dancing eyes and mad engaging grin make for compelling company throughout br br the best thing in this film other than connery are the bond girls shot with more attention to personality than normal in bond films a testament to cinematographer douglas and director <UNK> <UNK> barbara <UNK> was nominated for a golden globe for her role as the <UNK> <UNK> every bit as crazy as <UNK> and even <UNK> to look at she doesn't last the whole movie you almost need her gone in order to focus on the others br br kim <UNK> breasts and <UNK> should have had their own agents for the screen time they get in this film but i'm not complaining <UNK> a rare beauty who in this early role as <UNK> mistress mixes incredible with a <UNK> vulnerability that brings out the bond in me and many others i suspect her lips and <UNK> are pretty sweet too br br it's not a well constructed film it's a <UNK> of a better bond movie with a sloppy storyline a terrible score and a flat ending but it does have connery proving his was the definitive take on <UNK> definitive secret agent even if he steals a page or two from my <UNK> mr moore the end result is entertaining enough so i'm not complaining
<START> this 1 hour 30 minute inside joke is best understood by <UNK> the number one religion of self <UNK> comedians the world over that isn't to say it can't stand on its own which it does that the film isn't without its flaws which its got technical issues mostly belief that in 1998 digital was the answer when in fact it was in its <UNK> a <UNK> of a <UNK> if you will and re <UNK> will never improve it for the love of god hal please get yourself a red one or three br br if you like hartley films of course you'll like it i liked it because i liked grim fool and there were added benefits of retrospect i couldn't help <UNK> a disturbing self prophecy an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> used as a <UNK> of <UNK> in this 1998 movie it was as if <UNK> had gotten the whole idea from hal it's true hartley moves his players round into the camera like it's the house of just one piece of the <UNK> that needs a rest after all we're already paying attention to the actors and the writing is alive not great writing but <UNK> can i use the word <UNK> <UNK> intelligent not condescending br br absolutely love <UNK> harvey in this course i'd love her anywhere oddly if helen <UNK> needs a younger self she should look harvey up and bring a bottle of blond
<START> simply awful i'm including a spoiler warning here only because of including a jokes from the movie there is nothing else to spoil as it is already rotten this <UNK> was made during what must have been one of <UNK> for a few dollars more periods when he'd participate in any crap for a few bucks i'd seen this as a 15 year old high school student in 1972 and <UNK> it then no need to view it again after 35 years i remember it now as one of the top five worst movies i'd seen as a kid as i recall sellers had more of an ongoing cameo role than a lead here but even his presence couldn't the stale jokes lame plot and <UNK> <UNK> one ongoing theme revolves around <UNK> use of his fingers in one scene he holds up his open hand to a group of <UNK> and by <UNK> down his fingers <UNK> the groups for which a hospital exists the <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> etc until only his middle finger is left up <UNK> he says and the patients <UNK> <UNK> in another scene to avoid <UNK> lab <UNK> he <UNK> a finger into a <UNK> <UNK> and sticks it into his mouth to check for sugar then the <UNK> gathered around him to do the same which they do he then <UNK> them that he'd placed his middle finger in the <UNK> but sucked on the <UNK> finger and <UNK> them to pay attention <UNK> <UNK> the only reason that i remember this and this movie and am writing this review is that a friend told me an even dumber version of this <UNK> today if <UNK> you gonna <UNK> <UNK> if not see with george c scott came out the same year 1972 for some genuine marvelous black medical humor better yet read 'the house of <UNK> by samuel and if you can see the movie version of it which has never been released please make a copy and send it to me i'd love to finally see it
<START> ok so i loved <UNK> ray before but now i adore her how innovative i love that she has a cooking section i admit that occasionally i skip that part only because it makes me <UNK> too hungry but i also love that you can get the next day's <UNK> list on her website i love that she has regular <UNK> and that she's made some of her viewers become her <UNK> i love how <UNK> she is and how creative she is i also like how she does her mystery guests she just seems so much more genuine than so many other talk show <UNK> she still gets a little <UNK> occasionally and i love that i love that she talks about her personal life on there and reminds people how happy she is she's even mentioned <UNK> before and it's so funny she also has the funniest stories anyway i'm a fan for life even my 2 year old knows who <UNK> ray is and he loves her too
<START> mr bean was great fun i loved it every episode was really funny <UNK> <UNK> was perfect for this role he's a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious br br the series was so successful that they even made a mr bean movie in 1997 which was also pretty funny by the way br br it's funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into this series was a classic for sure and i still watch an episode from time to time br br mr bean is well worth a 10 10 in my book fans of offbeat comedy must check this out
<START> i don't think the number of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> contained in this turkey can be beaten everything in this mess was done on the cheap and made soldiers look really stupid examples at the start the 2 star general is given <UNK> advice by a lieutenant and accepts it <UNK> the map used by the lt shows enemy positions but they apparently have only a single narrow valley to use in <UNK> on the <UNK> even though the map showed a dozen more the rear guard takes up position from which they are clearly spotted by the enemy and exposed they pound our heroes from high ground but this superior fire power makes little difference an single enemy tank advances near the end at the beginning referred to as <UNK> division <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> point who moves extremely slowly without cover <UNK> the area then the tank on when he <UNK> it save to proceed a most bizarre scene the soldiers take cover in a cave all around them is ice and deep snow but in the cave not a yard from the entrance is a deep <UNK> through which they all <UNK> repeatedly their feet would last mere minutes before they freeze off later the survivors <UNK> <UNK> slowly and chest high through a river to return to their unit remember it is deep winter and the ground is frozen yeah right br br and on and on it goes they yell <UNK> to positions on higher ground they lay mines near their own position and warn each other not to <UNK> on them at the start credit is given to some soldier who had been awarded the <UNK> <UNK> of honor was he blind or did director fuller just ignore him truly the most inept soldiers i've ever seen br br one of them <UNK> around in his own wounded leg with a <UNK> and eventually pulls out a piece of without a <UNK> or a <UNK> he <UNK> that that should qualify him as a surgeon now that was funny
<START> hey it's only tv sure it's star trek the most beloved <UNK> <UNK> and this is a great one but it's all relative what it <UNK> down to is a guy in <UNK> ears <UNK> with a <UNK> of pizza colored <UNK> <UNK> br br there's a kind of third man to the tunnel hunt and it's <UNK> than many episodes of what is after all one of the better tv shows the suspense is actually suspenseful the peril really feels <UNK> as a little kid i think i cried when spock told me that this hideous creature was as sad scared and horrified as the people it was eating this was one of my early lessons in empathy a lesson <UNK> by the episode which was if less thrilling even more melancholy br br what bothered me when i was five was that this thing which looks like meat and <UNK> <UNK> somehow actually consists more or less of rock now that kind of choice might seem <UNK> a hippie <UNK> idea of through the looking glass one but it might also just <UNK> of the drug era
<START> way too many christian films become centered around the fear of the judgment and as a result come across as condescending and cheesy second glance gets it right this is a near perfect <UNK> tool it deals with the real reason why so many young people want nothing to do with christianity it <UNK> viewers that one must give up their sin not their fun to succeed in the christian lifestyle second glance even works as a piece of film making the filmmakers obviously were working on a very low budget but they managed to write a script dynamic enough to <UNK> <UNK> attention from this obvious fact this film brought me to my lord and <UNK> jesus christ and thanks to christian stations everywhere which show it it surely has <UNK> more people than just me
<START> it may not have had the big budgets celebrities or <UNK> of scream urban legend or i know what you did last summer but <UNK> tales had one thing these three movies lacked true horror br br this film <UNK> the subject of urban legends a year before the <UNK> titled and less than enthralling urban legend did it was intriguing masterfully scripted and logical in a way i know what you did last summer could only dream of finally it held its focus and finished with a <UNK> while scream <UNK> and died br br what's most exciting about the film is the variety of horror that the writers and directors achieved the <UNK> story of teenagers around a <UNK> was classic dread at the unknown but certainly expected doom that <UNK> them in the forest but the tales themselves are where the movie really <UNK> br br the opening sequence is pure fast paced urban myth it's based on a popular legend and the director plays on this with the style and pace of the action making it more enthralling because we know what's going to happen br br the first <UNK> tale is a straight forward thriller based on another popular myth we don't actually realize this until the end both because it <UNK> so well into the story and because the action keeps our attention being the thriller of the trilogy this one plays off our fear of the unknown and includes several well done jump sequences that don't feel nearly as cheap or <UNK> as those in movies like scream or urban legend br br the second tale is more suspense this time though the characters still don't know what's going on we do and this provides the horror no need for cheap thrills here br br the final tale contains elements of the supernatural and uses a creepy <UNK> atmosphere to scare the viewer because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation our fear comes from their intensity and what they can't explain this is the true ghost story of the trio br br i didn't expect to enjoy <UNK> tales when i rented it i figured that if i didn't like its more acclaimed bigger budget counterparts how could i like it br br the truth is though this film succeeds where the others fell far short of the mark
<START> dear scifi channel how have you been how was your summer i've been ok but i feel like our relationship isn't the same anymore and we're growing apart i don't understand why you don't love me anymore i've just finished watching your scifi channel original <UNK> man and once again you've shown a blatant lack of respect for my feelings by killing off every hot girl in this movie i mean i understand that you're just in this for instant <UNK> all you care about is producing a movie where people get <UNK> and <UNK> by a homicidal indian spirit creature legend whatever so you really don't have time to put some thought and effort into anything else like finding a costume for <UNK> man that doesn't make him like the gay lover of <UNK> from he man seriously his <UNK> looks like a <UNK> <UNK> sheet and his skull is smooth as a <UNK> behind he almost looks like a killer halloween costume for a 6 year old as he <UNK> through the wilderness on a homicidal rampage so we throw you a bone because we're not looking for oscar winning performances intriguing plot or realistic character reactions to the situations at hand because we realize that even though michael <UNK> <UNK> van <UNK> and all the girls are supposed to be trained special <UNK> agents they are all mysteriously transformed into <UNK> <UNK> who can't shoot or see straight whenever <UNK> man appears and we also fully expect that nothing bullets explosions <UNK> nothing can kill <UNK> man until there is one minute left in the movie and we need to find a way to tie things up neatly we expect to see blood and guts but you have a knack for taking the least attractive actress in the entire cast and making her the only female who survives and quite honestly i think you do it just to me because this movie as silly as it is has the potential to be a so bad it's good classic and just killing off all the <UNK> ruins everything and forces me to lower its rating all i ask is that once just once you take my feelings into account and let the <UNK> girls survive the movie please
<START> i grew up in <UNK> and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday there are good and bad in every race why make them all out to be bad that goes for all races today john <UNK> was an educated man he <UNK> from high school he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the <UNK> how do i know this john <UNK> lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school and he kept in contact with us the year after <UNK> he was a kind and gentle soul he could be fun loving and he could be serious when the times were right i wasn't very old when he left our house but i can still remember all the times he helped me with my <UNK> when my own brother couldn't be bothered he even taught grade 3 the year before he came to <UNK> none of this is mentioned in the movie and the suicide of <UNK> cross is an admission of guilt as far as i'm concerned what happened to john is unforgivable not only in the native community but also in the white community not everyone in <UNK> think like the police do i knew the person inside and what he was like as a person not an indian
<START> the film listed here as having been made in 1980 is not the film which is available from something weird video in their <UNK> ed scare films <UNK> 5 for one thing the 1980 version is in color has on this disc an earlier version 1972 of the film made in b w for television channel 5 in <UNK> either way this film is notorious however unlike most other <UNK> ed films this was intended for television broadcast and viewing by the general public thus the level of carnage has been down it's still a pretty grim exercise in exploitation of bloody death for a <UNK> educational intent i live in the <UNK> area and i remember this thing being shown every year around prom time on channel 5 if you're looking for one film that demonstrates the tone of this uniquely american film phenomenon the last prom is pretty typical <UNK> <UNK> extremely <UNK> heavy on melodrama whether it really affected any <UNK> driving at all is anyone's guess
<START> there are a lot of people that put down on these type 80's movies but those people may not have been coming of age during this time i was just starting college when this movie was released so i could really appreciate it at the time and my friends and i still to this day will occasionally joke about certain lines in the movie as much as i liked sean <UNK> character jeff in fast times i actually enjoy chris <UNK> character tommy more because he is the lead character with more of a actual speaking roll opposed to just a series of one liners such as with chris penn should probably pop this film in his vcr and use it for motivation to lose some weight yes the subplot with the randy quaid vietnam vet character does seem a little out of place but he does a convincing job in the role if there is anyone out there that hasn't seen this movie but liked the other similar type movies such as fast times etc i highly recommend it
<START> firstly let me get this of my chest i hate <UNK> with an absolute passion what is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence unfortunately post the opening sequence it all goes downhill firstly there was absolutely no plot to begin with just an excuse for moore to tell his corny jokes next there are several sequences that would make a bond fan cringe for instance the sequence in which bond turns up to a bomb dressed as a clown the villains are pretty poor louis fails to make an impact as kamal khan and bollywood veteran <UNK> <UNK> is equally poor as his henchman it's funny that when people debate over what the worst bond movie is and <UNK> gets overlooked when it can easily give them a run for their money
<START> playwright john look back in anger the entertainer <UNK> of oscar <UNK> only novel positively <UNK> in the homosexual subtext of the original perhaps too much so nonetheless the dialogue the acting with a cast headed by sir john gielgud jeremy brett and the brilliantly cerebral production marred only by a too quick ending make this worth the while of any lover of theater with a capital t
<START> i've heard that this move was put together by a bunch of high school students as a high school art or theatre project it's not too bad unless you lived near in the seventies or knew someone involved in the making of the movie this is pretty awful most of the actors are clearly not actors but locals who <UNK> bob <UNK> the original host of creature features on in <UNK> appears but only for about a minute some of the monster effects are done with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster suit and each works okay on it's own but there is no continuity between the two watching without dialog you'd assume that the movie had 2 monsters i guess the most aspect is that even the main characters who i assume are the kids behind the movie cannot even pretend to act these kids must have been involved in theater in some way to want to do this project but they display zero believable emotion in front of the camera
<START> each frame in the movie is a lesson to new directors or existing directors to know how a movie should be taken hats off to he is <UNK> in indian film industry the director has got all the qualities in taking this movie in the range of ray every character is portrayed effectively in the movie though it's simple story it's been taken to such extent it can be considered to one of the best in india i don't have enough <UNK> to praise the movie just as the way the life goes in day today atmosphere the movie has been taken though the songs in indian movies are considered to a weak area songs in this movie has given extra energy to the potential of the movie especially background score it's amazing
<START> let me first just say that in the past i have been a huge <UNK> fan i think george is one of the <UNK> people and best comedians on the planet what made george so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way and give us his unique perspective on those things it wasn't always meant to be funny but you always respected his opinions because they were presented in such a clever way but you are all <UNK> is just a long rant he doesn't give us any unique perspective on anything he just gives us a long list of stuff that he's p o <UNK> at there is no insight no <UNK> just an old man complaining for one hour straight about things that we have all complained about and on top of that it wasn't even funny you are all <UNK> appeals to dumb people who can't handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct i don't mind anger <UNK> comedy but george could have done so much better i really hope that george <UNK> next show will live up to the quality that george has shown in the past
<START> this film <UNK> me for the simple fact that it was made only because shepherd was gay the men who murdered him are clearly wicked what happened to the poor man was truly horrible and a tragedy however where was hollywood when four religious white kids were executed after being forced to perform a host of sex acts on their killers and each other by two evil black men in <UNK> just two years ago the celebrities only <UNK> for the camera when it serves a political purpose also <UNK> is portrayed in a poor light by this pseudo documentary which of course is hardly surprising because they are the <UNK> <UNK> who must be educated by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> still it's always a treat to see laura <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie many years ago have tried to locate it but perhaps understandably it is nowhere to be found it was so <UNK> yet one of a handful of movies that remains with you for a long time i am still not sure what the reality of the movie is and perhaps like the <UNK> principle the obscurity is the definite thing acting is superb the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of foreboding an overall <UNK> yet it is hard not to be absorbed in the story i rented it thinking it was science fiction it was in the sci fi section with some totally misleading <UNK> but quite clearly it is not or horror or even suspense in fact one feels thankful the director took the courage to make a movie like this for which obviously there is no solid audience i know some people have complained about <UNK> <UNK> short role but i think it is very appropriate his limited exposure is critical to the <UNK> of the mystery of this movie
<START> this movie is so bad there are not words to describe it if i got a video camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half it would be a heck of a lot more entertaining than this the plot is so dull and it is not even worth mentioning the best part of the movie was when the credits and i got a chuckle out of knowing the lead actors name was james bond iii just trust me and stay far away from this trash heap
<START> antonio <UNK> director of the <UNK> cheesy cult horror cannibal apocalypse <UNK> this gothic <UNK> giallo starring gap <UNK> 70s icon jane <UNK> as well as her massive french lover of the day <UNK> <UNK> br br unfortunately despite the inclusion of such treats as a tasty <UNK> sexual french teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer <UNK> seven deaths in the <UNK> eye ends up a dreary mess which is a struggle to endure br br pretty <UNK> <UNK> returns to her family's scottish estate after many years away only to discover that a maniac is murdering her relatives one by one using the whole array of <UNK> old <UNK> tricks hidden <UNK> dark corridors creepy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> covered rooms <UNK> <UNK> together a confusing tale which at times promises supernatural goings on but ends up with a lame cop out ending that is unimaginative in the extreme br br <UNK> where exactly does the cat fit in to all of this ' i hear you ask well a rather <UNK> witnesses each murder thus <UNK> <UNK> rather cool sounding title br br stylish <UNK> claims the dvd cover pile of says i
<START> i don't mean to sound pretentious here but to call this the next cult classic is yet another example of the <UNK> standards filmmakers have for themselves this movie is an offense to everything we hold sacred and not in the good artsy way of <UNK> this film becomes the <UNK> for painful dialogue delivered by even more pathetic actors
<START> it's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters but immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters the fly over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon the all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from <UNK> 1 and 2 the story line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it's entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated this gave me with no option but to award the film 3 10
<START> some people drift through life moving from one thing or one person to the next without <UNK> an eye others <UNK> on to a cause another person or a principle and remain <UNK> committed to whatever it is and <UNK> or literally they give their word and stand by it but we're all different made of different clay ' as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting some people are just plain crazy though and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses who knows who knows what it takes to make things life work writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one committed and obsession in committed ' starring heather graham as a young woman who is <UNK> committed obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy too her name is and this is her story br br admittedly has always been a committed person in work relationships in life in general she's a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what and when she marries carl luke wilson it's forever the only problem is someone forgot to tell carl and days into the marriage he's gone off to himself and figure it all out when realizes he's not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage maybe it's because of that she's made of regardless she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him which she does in el <UNK> texas of all places but once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his <UNK> and not even letting him know she's there she considers carl as being in a spiritual coma ' and it's her job to keep a spiritual over him until he comes to his senses and while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters a young woman named carmen patricia <UNK> a waitress at one of the local ' <UNK> who is something of a <UNK> t bo mark <UNK> a truck driver who has issues concerning carl and neil <UNK> <UNK> an artist who makes and takes a fancy to her for it's a journey of discovery during which she learns a lot about carl but even more about herself br br there's a touch of humor a touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger presents it all extremely well delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and <UNK> that make up the human condition a rich and <UNK> bunch through which she tells her story we see it from point of view as krueger makes us <UNK> to thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold that along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to <UNK> up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for a very effective piece of storytelling there's an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that <UNK> from the people and situations that encounters and the result is a well <UNK> affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life br br heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make a character totally of her own creation she <UNK> herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real and for this film to work it was <UNK> that be <UNK> and believable and graham succeeds on all <UNK> her screen presence has never been more <UNK> and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely it's all a part of the character she creates there's an appeal to that exudes from her entire <UNK> who she is inside and out she's a likable <UNK> person and because you've shared her <UNK> thoughts you know who she is it's a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way graham brings her so to life br br as carmen patricia <UNK> is totally engaging as well her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character she has a charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is <UNK> down to earth she is <UNK> open and up front you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all <UNK> and that too is part of her appeal and as with this character is well written and <UNK> brings her convincingly to life br br overall there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of luke wilson <UNK> affleck as brother jay <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and especially mark <UNK> as t bo who with very little actual screen time manages to create a memorable character br br the supporting cast includes kim dickens jenny <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> summer phoenix meg art new york car thief dylan baker <UNK> editor and mary kay place psychiatrist a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture <UNK> upon who we are where we're going and what we really need is an enjoyable experience a ride definitely worth taking 8 10
<START> julie andrews plays a german spy who falls in love with an american pilot rock hudson while on an assignment for germany br br the songs are beautiful the two are well paired julie demonstrates a more <UNK> side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays br br a half german half english girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in <UNK> i julie sings some endearing <UNK> songs br br i loved the film some will say it's a chick flick but so what it's wonderful br br supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped it may not be up to <UNK> performance in <UNK> talk magnificent obsession or giant br br blake <UNK> shot the film in ireland and authentic <UNK> i type planes were used in the film scenery for england and france is absolutely gorgeous
<START> when i first got wind of this picture it was just called shepherd and was supposed to be the film that would put back into chances of doing theatrical i was very well excited about the whole piece br br by the time it was titled the shepherd border <UNK> i was tap dancing in excitement for this flick with <UNK> at the <UNK> of directing and <UNK> perry pulling stunt <UNK> i almost <UNK> me pants in anticipation <UNK> were released of kicking 8 different kinds of <UNK> as well as scott <UNK> playing what i thought was the villain and i was mind blown in excitement i thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like lone wolf br br then it came out i ordered it off blockbuster online for 20 and was ready for anything the reviews from net kinda had my ideas <UNK> altered but i <UNK> myself the mail came on day 4 and i ripped open the package my initial plan was to rush upstairs rip the face off the cardboard <UNK> then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my dvd player however i <UNK> at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film br br by the time it was over i was cool as a fool in the pool the shepherd is certainly one of my all time favorite direct to video films ever and makes <UNK> look like even more of the toilet mess that it is sure some of the fights ran a <UNK> bit short but they were still very awesome the <UNK> were superb as was scott <UNK> who should have been the villain unlike the forgettable steven lord br br i highly recommend this flick seriously
<START> i was really excited when i read the ghost would be shown on tv however i was deeply disappointed i loved the original story written by oscar <UNK> and sadly nothing of that was transferred by the movie
<START> a few things to touch on as a response to the earlier person's comment you just have to pay attention to what is going on in the film br br i guess they are spoilers br br the red stuff under david's mouth poison <UNK> the wife says not to scratch it or else it will spread br br david goes insane because the stranger is telling him to get out of the house which probably proves david's theory of an affair happening between the wife and stranger he runs after the man br br david does not lose him in the woods he simply hits the stranger a couple of times and leaves it to his wife to pick up the pieces br br only the wife eats the <UNK> br br i must say after that one point with the wife and stranger i began to feel disappointed but the ending made up for the entire film br br and for that and the very last scene this is one of my favorite movies ever i should have put it together earlier but let myself get <UNK> i was really surprised honestly br br this film is interesting to say the least but if you are not watching this for the performances that the actors give i'd say you better let this one go because that is all that keeps this certain film together
<START> mild spoilers below br br the <UNK> of war was clearly on the horizon when was filmed from the opening scene of european <UNK> to the final <UNK> that <UNK> will be the death of millions of germans this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after pearl harbor there isn't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember it the rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the <UNK> coburn with a pretty bad accent and daughter <UNK> into america with wayne's help other than the dust bowl scenes the only memorable aspect of the movie is one best viewed with <UNK> <UNK> speech comparing <UNK> to a <UNK> worse than cancer and describing the then current <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> of energy from a patient right before death were <UNK> accurate and dr played accurately to post war <UNK> footage of <UNK> nazis <UNK> their actions br br when viewed from a historical perspective some aspects of are interesting if you look at it for entertainment outside of the wwii perspective you'd have to say this is one of wayne's less successful efforts
<START> i find it <UNK> that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling <UNK> is unknown and we are all scattered across the whole spectrum of possible beliefs that a <UNK> and fraud of caliber as a <UNK> he is exceptional there is no denying he had a special gift it's a pity he <UNK> it though for the <UNK> of his wounded ego feeding on the <UNK> of <UNK> sheep who were at his <UNK> and call and in awe of him can inspire such extreme <UNK> and <UNK> this movie presents an <UNK> version of own largely fictional and fantastic account of his <UNK> and awakening which i would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could <UNK> the minds and <UNK> of certain types of sadly <UNK> people see it if you dare to have a <UNK> eye opening about how sadly <UNK> we are of true religious leaders to the extent that a clown like could inspire such devotion and be careful to have your blood pressure medicine at hand if you are one of those who still hope for a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of christianity as a supreme example of cinematography at the entire service of the premises and <UNK> of a dysfunctional cult
<START> this is the kind of film they used to make amusing heart warming <UNK> authentic with convincing performances by people without nose jobs <UNK> jobs eye jobs in other words real people macdonald plays the female love interest and she is so real you want to give her a <UNK> at the very least imagine that a real girl in a movie whatever next hollywood would hate her because her <UNK> is a sharp <UNK> to every false <UNK> in <UNK> this story has the same hilarious feel as sandy <UNK> classic <UNK> with the humour of remote scottish <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> from outside and enjoying a wee from time to time the actual <UNK> between those times often being rather short director stephen <UNK> displays a rare skill in pulling this off just right and it is shocking to discover that he died before his film's release aged only <UNK> which was clearly a substantial loss to the screen <UNK> <UNK> does very well at playing a german rocket scientist who in the late 1930s goes to in the <UNK> of harris to build a small rocket to carry <UNK> between the islands there he falls in love with the <UNK> macdonald <UNK> and she <UNK> the affection some wonderfully colourful local characters <UNK> the tale and the film is pure delight there is of course the threat of <UNK> war with hitler and we learn that hitler executed 1000 rocket scientists who refused to build weapons of war which is a shocking <UNK> tragic love is never far from view but lips must remain sealed in a review as to what happens in the end this film is a magnificent example of just the kind of films which people in britain should be making but are they being properly released in a nation whose tastes have been so <UNK> by reality tv shows where repulsive have become the national heroes is there even a market anymore for a film like this after all there is no <UNK> sex there are no close ups of wounds or of anyone's <UNK> there are no drugs taken there are no mindless celebrities <UNK> around wanting to be looked at and so one wonders whether there is anything to interest a public which has become so <UNK> and jaded that only the most extreme <UNK> can briefly <UNK> the tedium of their pointless existence anyone who is looking for an <UNK> to the <UNK> of contemporary britain can take <UNK> in this refreshing and honest film
<START> a movie that tries hard to say something and generally fails like the <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> the movie it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> endless it seems like forever listening to it conversation for some action or plot direction br br sadly it's one of the best examples of canadian cinema i've seen
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> are members of a bank robbery gang who double cross their leader during a robbery they hide out in a <UNK> school and disguise themselves appropriately to avoid <UNK> from the mob and the police alot of catholic humor and slapstick but the script is kinda thin as are the laughs there is a good shower scene though on a scale of one to ten 4
<START> one of the best tv shows out there if not the best one why simple it has guts to show us real life in prison without any clich√©s and predictable twists this is not prison break or any other show actually comparing to oz the show sopranos look like story for children's profanity <UNK> shots of explicit violence and using drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes all this and more in oz but this is not the best part of oz the characters are the strongest point of this show they're all excellent and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals the actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan <UNK> and <UNK> because they're so unique and changing their behavior completely and most of all the don't have no <UNK> for their actions overall oz is amazing show the best one out there forget about <UNK> and shows about stupid doctors this is the deal oz
<START> that welles said was that he's been in decline his whole career br br there was an interesting story here unfortunately welles seemed completely incapable of telling it instead he was trying to tell a bunch of different stories about about <UNK> irving about his pompous view of critics and experts oh yeah and trying to jump start his current <UNK> career by giving her <UNK> screen time <UNK> honey when they told you to sleep with the director they didn't mean one washed up like a whale on a beach br br welles was probably trying to cash in with a bunch of footage of <UNK> irving as irving was becoming a household name with his role in the <UNK> auto biography of howard hughes unfortunately it means the subject of his film didn't get the time he deserved and he was probably the more interesting story br br the great tragedy of orson welles was that he <UNK> early and then spent the rest of his career <UNK> finally doing wine commercials and awful documentaries
<START> accepted is one of the best teenage comedies i have seen in a long time it has an original script talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure <UNK> fun br br it tells the story of a high school graduate <UNK> b <UNK> justin long who is not accepted in any of the he applied to so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional <UNK> in the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school everything goes smoothly until a lot of other accepted students turn up on his <UNK> now he and his friend have to figure that <UNK> thing out not only for themselves but for the others too br br justin long as a lead man is absolutely brilliant his character is as natural as he can be and the supporting acts are outstanding <UNK> hill as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> short as hands maria <UNK> as <UNK> adam as <UNK> and lewis black as uncle ben br br the humour is fresh and simple and most importantly funny right from the start to after the credits the plot develops so easy that by the time you stop laughing at the last joke you start <UNK> at next other along with all the fun the movie brings a very common subject to our attention i e the <UNK> education if usually the students in the movie are united against the school government in this case they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and learn br br yet the movie doesn't brand all other schools as wrong it just shows that there is another way you what they say if there is a will there is a way and may be sometimes the children know better what they need than their parents br br this movie is an <UNK> little story about the great opportunities in life wrapped up in the best format possible
<START> first i'm a huge buddy holly fan i grew up knowing who he was and i knew all about that <UNK> plane ride that <UNK> three incredibly bright flames just like that but i had never truly listened to his music i had heard much of it yes but not until i sat down with the intention of getting something out of it did i truly come to see the real buddy holly and let me tell you that my world is a different one now because of him br br because of this <UNK> for such an incredible man i bought the buddy holly story without ever seeing it previously i'm torn on my views of this film perhaps it's because buddy feels so alive to me that i just couldn't bear seeing gary busey in this role i'll admit that he did a nice job acting but his singing sounded so forced it seemed to me as if he knew he didn't sound a bit like buddy himself and therefore was using far too much energy to make an attempt at a similar sound in some parts of the film he succeeded but others <UNK> br br the movie <UNK> a period of several years but i feel that portraying this time span could have been handled much better i had a difficult time <UNK> at what point in <UNK> life certain events were happening i also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies i think the worst one was the portrayal of the <UNK> i understand how their real names couldn't be used and how for <UNK> there were only two of them in the movie and maybe this was a good thing because the film's background <UNK> were cringe worthy and i disliked the way they were portrayed as a <UNK> to <UNK> career something else that really made no difference to the film but <UNK> me was gary <UNK> teeth they wore me out buddy holly had much better teeth i don't know why i noticed it but i did br br i'll end this review on what i felt was the best part of the movie <UNK> last performance his final phone call to maria the big performance bringing him and <UNK> to the stage followed by the still frame ending it <UNK> even me and i feel that it effectively shows the audience how at one moment buddy holly was so alive and energetic and that his flame was <UNK> out in the blink of an eye it was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy i think br br good movie despite the obvious problems 7 10 br br some obvious flaws could use some work but not bad
<START> i've read every adventure of <UNK> and at least 5 times and i'm also a fan of les and les <UNK> des <UNK> and so i expected a lot from this movie and i finally got satisfied unlike the first adaptation of <UNK> on the big screen et <UNK> <UNK> which wasn't a real success besides the appearance of <UNK> this one really captures the spirit of the comic and we get the beautiful monica <UNK> in the first movie the director tried to be too realistic about the time where the story is set and it killed the whole spirit that made <UNK> hilarious in this one all the clothing the way of talking and everything is identical to and work more it really stick to the original story with the downside that we know pretty much everything that's going to happen but <UNK> <UNK> gave us a few surprises at the end i really enjoyed that movie and <UNK> that the first sign of <UNK> starts to appear comes in and makes us laugh like crazy this movie is a big mix of all the kind of humor i really like and even if maybe it's mixing it too much i can't help but to like it so if you like <UNK> and the humor of all these young talents that started in part a french mix of the tonight show and snl go see this movie
<START> i could never imagine i would start loving movies like this after seeing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i decided to check his other movies perhaps looking for something similar the second <UNK> <UNK> movie i watched was <UNK> one <UNK> after which i realized what kind of cinema i'm now in no wonder why i got <UNK> immediately it is a simple touching and brilliant piece of cinema i pay my respect to the director br br this movie shows that it's not the amount of money makes film good it's all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is in doing this the story is very simple a typical <UNK> of a typical daily life moreover shown in a very simple way the movements of camera also <UNK> the impression and the feeling of the movie i give a top rating to this film and <UNK> waiting to see other <UNK> <UNK> films
<START> who else other than troma can take the classic tragedy and change it around to todays standards no one in my opinion the <UNK> <UNK> one sucked juliet is a definite stretch from the original tragedy but it holds up well its sick demented twisted but yet insanely funny and fulfilling for the most part it follows the true romeo and juliet story but many troma elements are added will <UNK> gives a great performance as <UNK> the acting is solid and the story is great many people look past these movies not only the kaufman troma movies but all the ones they <UNK> sure troma movies are an acquired taste but you need to see some of these it is <UNK> filmmaking at it's best
<START> i saw this at the london film festival last night apparently the shorter version james summary of the content of the film is very good very <UNK> <UNK> his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about <UNK> the effect of the mass media the power of capital and the need for diversity br br the film is shot on hand held <UNK> which some might find <UNK> but which does <UNK> to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment br br despite the <UNK> feel of the film the editing is very sharp not only giving us a parade of the world's dogs but also <UNK> a number of comments with somewhat <UNK> visual images and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves to a degree this <UNK> michael moore's recent work although <UNK> in a more subtle way but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel <UNK> the sorrow and the pity both in the way the film is constructed and in the <UNK> of of the <UNK> french <UNK> as the stars de <UNK> et <UNK> were present at the screening and answered questions afterwards we do indeed all need a little disorder bravo <UNK> br br overall an excellent film with <UNK> that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we <UNK> ourselves as people and <UNK> our world
<START> i was so looking forward to seeing this film that i can't really understand how i got the impression i would enjoy it i'm afraid it really is a yawn fest every single <UNK> in the cinema i attended <UNK> and <UNK> frequently during the whole film this is a shame because it is a fantastic story i'm inclined to think that it would make a better read it is not helped by the principle character only showing his teeth once and that was as a result of the camera angle as the story unfolds it becomes easier to understand the main character's <UNK> however the suspense and drama that could have made this a really top rated film have been completely <UNK> by the dull treatment dull as a half baked documentary
<START> franco films can be divided into 4 categories the often black and white and inventive the late 1960s early 1970s often involving miranda the of various periods but using full frontal female nudity as plot drive and the rest br br this is part of the rest it is not really a cannibal movie at all it is certainly no <UNK> the few women in the picture dont even lose their <UNK> <UNK> and there is little full frontal stuff at all the picture quality on the german dvd i watched is poor the film peters out <UNK> as it ever catches fire as a franco fan i would tell others not to bother do something else with your time read a book get a copy of women in 9 anything really
<START> as a reviewer has already commented this made for tv comedy is up there amongst the best football parodies ever but having failed to video it when it was first aired i now find that it isn't around in any format ok so this has only <UNK> 17 votes to date but a 9 average does seem to suggest something special basically i suppose it's a case of tough luck if you missed it <UNK> it's no longer available to view
<START> the most impressive thing about <UNK> is its title an <UNK> which is very nearly also a unfortunately it only works in american english since in britain is <UNK> differently br br i've always found the <UNK> man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious and i've never understood why his work <UNK> so much attention apart from his which he invented by accident and which are merely direct contact photo <UNK> his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn but surely this had to happen eventually and there's no real reason why ray deserves the credit the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the <UNK> new clothes br br back in the early 1960s the second season of 'the twilight <UNK> opened each episode with a shot of revolving <UNK> circles in black and white there's an image in <UNK> which is so similar i wonder if <UNK> <UNK> borrowed it from this film the main difference is that the revolving image here is a black and white spiral indeed if ever there was any movie that deserves to be described as a spiral this one is it throughout <UNK> we're treated to shots of a revolving disc containing words in french moving in a spiral the effect is <UNK> and the <UNK> about incest and <UNK> are nearly <UNK> in their <UNK> i did laugh at one clever sexual pun br br the emperor is naked folks and this movie just barely rates 2 points out of 10 <UNK>
<START> i've seen this movie a few times and with each viewing i still feel the excitement of <UNK> on a journey and the frustration of trying to overcome the <UNK> that <UNK> the path it's more than a mere desire of finding home it's about the very basic human spirit of finding one's way in the world of <UNK> despair of facing the character <UNK> that <UNK> our goals underlying these human <UNK> is the challenge to <UNK> the origin of life while this film is <UNK> with serious ideas it has just enough comedic lines to leave the viewers hopeful it is surprisingly funny the execution of the story line is excellent this is all <UNK> with visually engaging animation a must see br br
<START> now more than ever we need peace love in this world br br this film really showcases the wonderful music of the broadway show and the fabulous choreography of the legendary i saw it again after many years and it still holds up well br br thank you mgm <UNK> for putting this on dvd i love the option of seeing in widescreen mgm rocks for doing this on many of their dvd releases br br ya gotta love treat williams as <UNK> and john savage as claude they couldn't have picked better actors actresses for this film beverly <UNK> is such a <UNK> in this film i had forgotten just how hot wow br br the supporting cast is absolutely great br br with the late great <UNK> carter making a singing cameo in a couple of scenes as well as the <UNK> charlotte ray mrs <UNK> on of <UNK> br br the story gets a little weak toward the end but the anti war sentiment of the late 60's still holds up and is relevant today br br it's beautifully filmed quite a bit on location and is so colorful and lovely and really brings the spirit of 1968 back on the big screen br br i saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when i was 15 and was moved by it then and it still moves me now at 40 some other reviews on here say they think it should have been made sooner i don't think hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late 60's early 70's br br the vietnam war ended in 1975 and the whole thing hit a little too close to home i think for this story to be filmed before it was like in 1969 70 <UNK> br br bravo to director <UNK> <UNK> i love this film br br it's nice to see it again this time on dvd it never looked better
<START> it's the 1920s and a man named walt disney was on a mission to satisfy the families and children all over the world with one thing entertainment what did he do he made cartoons <UNK> and he made a character that is as great as a mouse mickey mouse ha ha oh boy br br two films were drawn out by mr disney himself plane crazy and <UNK> willie this review will focus on the <UNK> feature <UNK> willie br br ever since i learned about this movie as a little boy i've always wanted to see this movie well in 1997 i rented an ancient vhs that had lots of old disney cartoons on them starring the mouse mickey mouse and guess what that short was on there and i loved it shortly after i took the tape back this was playing on the old disney channel note the old disney channel early one saturday morning br br yes this is a great cartoon this <UNK> the way for more great disney stuff from <UNK> to 2002 br br 10 stars indeed
<START> flesh feast starts at miami airport ace reporter dan carter harry <UNK> he is also credited as production designer phones his mate ed <UNK> phil <UNK> to let him know that he has just returned from south america where he has been investigating carl doug foster that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back killed meets dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lake she also executive produced who has recently been released from a mental institution together they discuss their grisly plans the news of death has reached <UNK> he decides to take the story up himself do some investigating well actually he gets his secretary day to do most of the investigating just report back to him lazy <UNK> virginia informs <UNK> that they have someone on the inside named <UNK> heather hughes since dr <UNK> <UNK> her spare rooms out to <UNK> <UNK> reports back to <UNK> about dr grotesque youth <UNK> experiments involving human flesh specially <UNK> <UNK> br br co written co produced directed by brad f flesh feast is a pretty poor film on all accounts first lets start with the script by thomas <UNK> who was also responsible for the cinematography you get the feeling that most of the cast crew had more than one job basically it's terrible the character's are one dimensional idiots have no personality i didn't like anyone in this film for what it's worth i quite like some of the ideas here the flesh eating <UNK> the basement laboratory stealing bodies from a hospital that unforgettable <UNK> ending that's almost worth sitting through the rest of the film for on it's own unfortunately the dialogue is so badly written stiff unnatural sounding it's untrue i mean there is one scene in which a nurse says that they won't let us out of the house which is fine except for the fact that she is speaking outside in the garden to someone no thought has been put into the story as no explanation is ever given for why flesh eating <UNK> are able to <UNK> youth in fact at one point near the end when <UNK> about this very thing dr <UNK> claims there is no time to explain at that point which to me sounds like the people who wrote this didn't have a clue either even at an extremely short <UNK> minutes long flesh feast is very slow dull the poor editing doesn't help with scenes shots lasting for far too long for example there is a scene in which an <UNK> pulls up outside a hospital drives up to the doors the guy gets out he walks to the back doors opens them etc etc did we really need to see every single detail there is also another sequence in which dr <UNK> enters room puts some <UNK> on then she takes them off walks into the opposite room puts another pair on i personally think that probably didn't shoot enough material so he stretches every scene out as much as he can to make the run time up i do like that bizarre ending though i really do technically flesh feast is complete crap i'm not sure what the budget was on this but it must have been small very small just about the entire film takes place in one house dr laboratory consists of a table some plastic test <UNK> some ancient looking electronic medical equipment a strange screen with funny colours on it don't ask the cinematography is poor the music sucks the entire film looks dubbed badly dubbed too the exploitation elements are also disappointing there are a few <UNK> shots but they don't actually do anything other than a bit there is a brief scene where a dead body has it's leg off a ok looking <UNK> corpse limbs hanging on <UNK> the acting is awful from everyone concerned i mean really bad which makes the <UNK> dialogue even worse do yourself a favour avoid flesh feast yes there are one or two unintentionally funny moments that ending is well unique to say the least but for the most part this is real amateur film making that quickly becomes painful to watch i doubt most people will make it through this is one sitting i can tolerate just about anything but even i considered switching it off definitely one to avoid you'll be pleased you did if you really have to see it don't say you weren't warned
<START> i get the impression that i was watching a different movie to the majority of other people i know who have seen this film it's not really that i found the film offensive or anything just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it i really respected paul work on the million dollar baby script and was <UNK> disappointed to see how bad this script was it was clear to me that it was desperate to be the version of traffic but i don't think traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place br br the worst feature of is the way it shamelessly <UNK> <UNK> its audience does think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the <UNK> do need to see the phone book sitting on <UNK> address in black can we not be left to make in logic for ourselves br br i also had a major problem with the dialogue which was so <UNK> the i have heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is <UNK> high because even though people may not speak this way they certainly do think this way that is irrelevant it is the job of a script like this to <UNK> dialogue in a way that helps add to the <UNK> and believability of the in this case highly implausible situations that are set up these characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism br br surely the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be an issue in these situations but by making it the sole focus of every scene doesn't it become <UNK> racist itself characters walk around <UNK> their <UNK> and conveniently <UNK> on race relations as though they're <UNK> <UNK> from the research <UNK> they've just written it's utterly unconvincing and obvious br br a film should reveal its meaning gradually not slap us in the face with it in the opening scenes and then never let up i can see that intentions with this film were honorable but dare i suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and therefore overcome its flaws i really hope that writer directors will be really careful in future when approaching this style of narrative it has been done well a number of times but getting the balance between the personal and the political right is very difficult and robert altman will not be <UNK> in that department
<START> ben affleck about to be married is <UNK> up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers sandra <UNK> forcing herself to act insane who is to blame for this inept ugly <UNK> it is so badly edited when i looked in the credits it wasn't to read the <UNK> name it was to see if the person actually took the credit <UNK> with clich√©s <UNK> and sandra <UNK> in <UNK> eye makeup the movie doesn't even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters laughs are non existent the scene in the gay bar with affleck might have gotten a big laugh if it weren't so stupid the bar <UNK> a big <UNK> bunch of them shout for affleck to strip and start digging out their cash it's not supposed to have any significance other than getting ben to <UNK> up a little but the direction of the whole scene is wrong headed and the outcome is unseen because the idiot editor cuts away or was that all the film he had it's a small moment but it's typical of this film an amateurish piece of pop goods that wants to be an edgy modern comedy but doesn't have any guts it is <UNK> made for the bottom shelf at your video store from
<START> falls into my favourite genre of film historical action adventure with comedy which is probably why i rate it so highly br br the action <UNK> around a <UNK> and a <UNK> who gets <UNK> with him and his schemes this leads to all sorts of <UNK> and adventures which are all <UNK> with comedy there is also of course a love interest br br the rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the <UNK> of the wealthy at this time br br this is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment
<START> joe wes jim adam re <UNK> us with the beauty isolation psychological as well as physical and utter terror of murder most <UNK> in the <UNK> characterizations settings and plot continually build even if at times the personal <UNK> leave us wanting more with some interesting alternative choices as to who done it flashbacks e g peter fonda good to see him provide clues but they don't go where you might think comic <UNK> e g the preacher are mild and appropriate where and <UNK> waits start to drag thief <UNK> the <UNK> and four <UNK> you around the next corner never quite sure what's there disagree with joe manic comment to jim <UNK> to slow down for the <UNK> wrong there are no <UNK> in the plot just tracks to follow on to the next episode great photography as always appealing characters and more to explore
<START> i was recently given this film on dvd as a gift and was unsure at first if it would appeal although one of my favourite actors has a leading role in fact it's on its way to becoming a favourite br br first of all thankfully it's not the same as the book the ending of which i think is <UNK> melodramatic secondly it's one of the best films i've seen about the first world war what you may ask it's not a war film true we see no battles or no <UNK> no gas but it shows the cost of war the damage done to the lives of the men who fought in it and the impact this had on those close to them br br we first see helen sarah miles a widow awaiting her release from a mental hospital all the women in the film appear to be <UNK> some from the war but <UNK> much older husband sir thomas we see him later in a photograph was taken ill and died while she was at a party hence her guilt stricken breakdown she is lost and lonely the wire around the hospital grounds evokes <UNK> camps and the <UNK> like many of the men in the outside world helen is suffering from a kind of shell shock br br out of hospital she has to find her feet in the outside world again a world we experience through her eyes as bleak desolate and <UNK> her mother is unable to provide her with any real support herself a widow she has put up her own emotional <UNK> behind which she hides to avoid dealing with her daughter's distress like many people especially in that time she seems to find mental illness embarrassing br br the hired driver becomes a supportive presence and helps helen begin to <UNK> to life again but she does not realise that he is becoming dangerously obsessed with her this is a superb performance by robert shaw is a former regular soldier an ex sergeant major who runs a boxing club and has set up his own car hire business <UNK> he seems tough and strong <UNK> but there are cracks beneath the surface he has not really <UNK> to <UNK> life he <UNK> for reasons he later explains a family and home life he does not have he has brutal <UNK> with colleagues and affection less sex getting close to helen ¬ñ a woman whom even with the greater post war social freedom he could not realistically have hoped to marry ¬ñ exposes psychological fault lines that tear him apart these days one might <UNK> <UNK> br br the same is true of the other man in <UNK> life aspiring politician captain hugh peter <UNK> he is ambitious handsome but also very young <UNK> his girlfriend connie caroline <UNK> mothers him <UNK> his hair and making sure he has a clean <UNK> before he goes out he is known to both and helen the former had served under him during the war and helen had met him in political circles and had thought him a <UNK> however he and helen now begin a relationship with helen <UNK> to support his political career <UNK> and emotionally peter <UNK> fresh from his stage success as in r c <UNK> <UNK> makes hugh more than an immature <UNK> there is a revealing understated scene in the back of the car between helen and hugh in which they quote <UNK> 'the old at she asks of his war experience was it very bad he cannot answer she says well you're back now but his <UNK> spoken <UNK> ¬ñ am i sometimes i ¬ñ is the key to his character as light and shadow <UNK> across his face we know that there are some horrors that cannot be put into words the <UNK> <UNK> suffered by junior officers of his sort ¬ñ straight out of school or university and expected to lead from the front ¬ñ are well known in a nervous speech during which helen <UNK> him to local political folk at a dinner party he reveals that he will stand as an independent no longer as a liberal the party which had taken the country into the war his emotional life is as damaged as he cannot easily <UNK> himself from connie who depends on him emotionally and <UNK> reading between the lines she is probably a war widow perhaps of a former <UNK> with a child whose drawings we see on the wall of her home br br spoilers br br the crisis between the trio builds slowly with a frightening scene between helen and in the car and listening in to hugh and connie when he is driving them as hugh tries to <UNK> connie that even as his relationship with helen develops they can continue theirs that he will at least continue to support her jealousy obsession and his belief that he must protect helen from a <UNK> gold <UNK> lead to confront her and hugh violently in her home br br the ending is entirely different from that of the novel and is better for it it is dramatic but less melodramatic and maintains an <UNK> tone we began with one character recovering from a mental breakdown we end with another suffering one helen one senses is now <UNK> and stronger than both the men who have been unable fully to adapt to the so called <UNK> fit for <UNK> to which they returned from the nightmare of total war the new ending is open one feels that she at least will cope with whatever lies ahead without <UNK> in this it reflects well the reality of the time in which women helen connie and so many others had to pick up the pieces of a world in which too many men had died or had come home with varying degrees of mental and physical damage br br well you're back now ¬ñ am i sometimes i
<START> wow thank god i was on an airplane and could look out the window bad hollywood fire scenes predictable terribly acted who the hell was that awful woman who played the wife badly casted awfully written this movie was apparently made to appeal to the type of person who's willing to <UNK> at the alter of either <UNK> specifically heroes or gods in general i suppose i just don't have enough bad things to say about this film it couldn't have been cheap either with all the stars that were in it plus all those special effects and fire scenes had to have cost a fortune yet it still sucked worse than any movie i can even remember seeing funeral scene astonishingly bad <UNK> between <UNK> and aforementioned awful woman corny contrived trite <UNK> pranks don't we all wish we could be both so <UNK> and <UNK> at the same time
<START> a chick flick that guys still like yes wonderful now i can have fun enjoy the company of my girl and not feel like i can't wait until the movie ends light but funny great stuff what ever you do don't miss the dvd extras this a great blind date file too will smith does well in this even though in is light acting he pulls <UNK> it all well the movie is a little slow in pacing don't expect too much action the laughs are there and so is the message but the timing is a little slow use the low moments to <UNK> or kiss it will pick up the ending makes the feel good moments worth it most of all expect fun light hearted fare and watch for some great <UNK> by the supporting actors they make the film the plot twists are predictable but it is a date move so get the of popcorn from the kitchen and don't make her pause it count on more dates after this movie she'll want o see what is next in line remember <UNK> advice br br enjoy
<START> i found this film rather brilliant initially i wanted a when animals attack flick along the lines of <UNK> or even rogue but was delivered a truly horrific ordeal that was not devoid of humanity having been to the areas this was made including the croc farm at the start of the movie even sharing the same guide it added to the fear factor those <UNK> really are everywhere up there though i don't think they had the attitude of this <UNK> yes there were some melodramatic moments but they contributed rather distract from the whole atmosphere i genuinely cared for the characters and <UNK> <UNK> what would i do in their boat not knowing where your enemy <UNK> or the sound of the croc <UNK> down at night was genuinely frightening i would argue that this flick is one of the best horrors i have seen in years coming close to the descent i give it four alligator <UNK>
<START> given that roger corman attached his name to this production i had high hopes for this film corman directed many memorable low budget horror flicks in the 1960's i particularly enjoyed his adaptations of <UNK> stories such as the house of <UNK> ' and the pit and and the which starred the late great vincent price these films had solid acting atmosphere suspense strong characterization intriguing plot development and delivered some chilling moments sadly house of the damned ' for the most part sacrifices these qualities in <UNK> of cheesy low budget special effects gratuitous nudity and mindless gore topped with cliche fast edits and camera angles br br house of the <UNK> starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in ireland but it's straight downhill from here unfortunately instead of spending some time building atmosphere creating characters we might care about or building suspense the director <UNK> to begin running up the body count after a brief introduction to the lead characters a young couple and their daughter the audience spends the balance of the film being <UNK> from one event to another which in this film <UNK> for coherent plot development the lead characters are so ill conceived and are so badly acted the audience doesn't care what happens to them to make matters worse the events are either utterly clich√© or unconvincing due to low tech low budget special effects the soundtrack has been lifted from the omen ' the plot what little there is borrows heavily from and the legend of hell house ' but lacks any of the qualities which made these films convincing br br if you interested in seeing well done haunted house flicks i recommend you check out classics like the haunting 1963 ' the <UNK> <UNK> or look into <UNK> early american international films and pass on house of the <UNK> unless you're <UNK> or mindless br br 3 <UNK> out of 10 br br rob <UNK> br br <UNK> canada
<START> after a long run in the west end this charming film re cast margaret <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> successful adaptation made in 1950 br br all interior shots took place at <UNK> studios in london the exterior scenes were filmed on location at a public girl's school near in <UNK> during the 12 week shoot both margaret <UNK> and <UNK> were staying in a hotel nearby and would often visit the school during the <UNK> where they would happily enjoy the company of the real school <UNK> br br although the film's script contains only two original lines from the original play the leads and supporting actors are in fine form and you can only feel sympathetic for their <UNK> especially in the final scenes
<START> this one's as cheesy as they come ¬ñ the concept of a massive and <UNK> <UNK> bird is already too <UNK> for words but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen i tell you i laughed so hard through this thing that i missed out on some of the <UNK> dialogue ¬ñ then again the latter is often so heavy on scientific <UNK> and laws of physics and such at which i've never been any good in spite of my love of sci fi movies that it didn't really matter anyway the bird ¬ñ first depicted as a mere <UNK> form <UNK> through the <UNK> but subsequently shown in all its dopey glory ¬ñ is so <UNK> silly that it wouldn't be <UNK> in a looney tunes cartoon witness the series of <UNK> taken photographs that start with the creature in the distance and end on a side splitting extreme close up of its face br br director <UNK> had <UNK> much better with his other film about <UNK> the fine earth vs the flying <UNK> 1956 ¬ñ with special effects provided by a master ray <UNK> speaking of which i've just given away my copy of the latter in anticipation of <UNK> <UNK> recently released se dvd also it seems to me that some of the footage <UNK> the <UNK> rampage in new york here were lifted from the destruction of washington seen in that earlier sci fi classic again the leads are played by genre <UNK> ¬ñ namely jeff <UNK> from this island earth 1955 and <UNK> from <UNK> 1955 as with the <UNK> mentioned flying <UNK> these titles are highly regarded and beloved by fans ¬ñ consequently they are vastly superior to this <UNK> addition to the alien monster animal cycle prevalent during the sci fi <UNK> and beyond incidentally other flying <UNK> were featured in the flying <UNK> 1946 which i haven't watched and larry <UNK> tongue in cheek <UNK> of same in q the <UNK> <UNK> 1982 br br unfortunately the giant claw can't even rise to a decent climax ¬ñ which is so rushed as to be a wash out to quote a jet pilot from the film itself whose assault with rockets on the bird proves completely <UNK> that is before <UNK> realizes that it's <UNK> by an invisible <UNK> and then has to figure out a way how to be able to <UNK> it ultimately apart from the and frankly tedious technical <UNK> one gets a feeling of so bad it's good watching this after all it only lasts for <UNK> minutes ¬ñ and in any case the bird is such an <UNK> <UNK> creation as to put a huge smile on your face every time it turns up
<START> when family guy first premiered i was not in a <UNK> mood with the 1990s containing a wealth of clever surreal cartoons why should i be <UNK> produced doug <UNK> and <UNK> and modern life among other fine cartoons yes this includes <UNK> all had quirky <UNK> animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog the simpsons became an outright phenomenon perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest <UNK> claim it to be but a very fine investment of your time and certainly <UNK> the false <UNK> that all tv is junk south park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath it evolved to become a monty python esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal <UNK> such as their defense of the noble <UNK> <UNK> and eventually settled to be entirely self <UNK> and <UNK> like the simpsons did and has unfortunately jumped the shark family guy is <UNK> like the simpsons and south park it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and <UNK> <UNK> however what it has in it lacks in true wit br br the show is famous for its use of gimmicks especially for flashbacks many are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funny especially from the first two seasons most are not are references <UNK> funny i'm not sure but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting where homer and bart have charm and <UNK> has an <UNK> of self awareness and pure <UNK> to back up his awful behavior peter <UNK> has no excuse he's just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day lois is also very shallow and dull meg is a prop only to be abused chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars of the show and brian are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointless br br other gimmicks i can't stand are when a character points to something obviously and <UNK> on it for an <UNK> long time this happens a lot lately and i can't bear it any longer not just the <UNK> mentioned chicken that likes to beat peter up i'm talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and <UNK> it as if they are alien <UNK> that's not wit or even ironic humor it's totally boring and lifeless br br not that the show can't be funny in fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling highlights include the pilot episode where peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television when peters religious <UNK> father shows up and <UNK> havoc when peter becomes a <UNK> at <UNK> school and the <UNK> episode i suspect these are the episodes that accidentally <UNK> actual human traits in its characters or merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspiration br br one last thing the show is not offensive it's only offensive to those who wouldn't watch the show in the first place so it's almost like a circle jerk to the choir of <UNK>
<START> this movie was absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot could have been made to work had the movie been written better the acting was some of the worst i have ever seen i was very slow and made me want to leave turn off the movie several times i watched the entire movie in the hopes that the ending would make it worthwhile but it didn't this movie i think should be rated in the negative numbers in my humble opinion
<START> i've always been a fan of jackass as well as <UNK> la <UNK> and and when you're a fan of something your expectations are high to whatever your heroes might star in and if there's one thing i've learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love to watch and listen to it's never to expect to much 'cause in 99 out of a 100 times you'll get disappointed br br although when i heard there was a jackass 2 coming up i thought not even i can turn down my expectations for this movie and as a result of that i sat down today ready to laugh but also ready to say in the end well it was ok but i'm a little disappointed how wrong was i every single member of the jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other making the whole world see that there's nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves and that's what we love i cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie at some times even <UNK> in laughter not able to control myself stunt after stunt prank after prank and hilarious comments on the flow it can simply not get any better than this amazing from start till end guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off i've got two things left to say watch it and please god let there be a jackass 3 these guys clearly has a lot to offer
<START> i saw this movie on a show that was showing bad b movies and trying to get you to buy them it basically was just a long trailer but gave you a really good idea of what the movie was about after viewing the trailer i thought i would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic but could still be entertaining in a perverse sense it's not entertaining in any sense of the word the film has two or should i say four things going for it and it's not the number of deaths it's the women they are hot and naked a lot and ms <UNK> could be a <UNK> actress but not in a movie where the emphasis is on t a and corny dialogs this isn't even a horror movie or scary unless you are talking about watching the actors try to act the production value is pathetic the acting is worse and the writing is the worst what was the point in making this movie to scare people to rip off texas chainsaw massacre to try and be funny to show off the women's breasts to put some guy's head into a retarded outfit with fake hands and legs to have a character just say the word snow over and over to not have any real violence but have enough nudity in an attempt to cover up the fact there is no real plot to be able to make a sequel to a movie no one has seen or will ever watch i made a mistake in picking up this movie don't make this mistake too br br stay away from this movie
<START> i really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can comes to terms with the death of his wife i suppose this was to play like a quirky light romantic comedy but the theme is a little uncomfortable for me br br but putting that aside i found the dialog was too much like a stage play despite being based on a novel and also the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially by the young lead vincent <UNK> br br i have been sort of trying to catch up on all the eighties movies i missed during that decade it has been my pet <UNK> that eighties nostalgia buffs seem to focus on the same core <UNK> of films usually featuring the brat pack actors and actresses and <UNK> the other films like creator that have fallen through the cracks but in the case of this feature i have to say i can understand it not all of these eighties films were magical and creator is proof of this
<START> so first things first br br angels and demons is a much better and very different film than the da <UNK> code br br following the recent slew of comic book movies remakes and questionable <UNK> of aged <UNK> it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of shaky <UNK> filming techniques lens <UNK> excessive <UNK> and over the top action sequences br br in this respect angels and demons almost feels old fashioned it offers a good and considered debate on the age old subject of religion vs science offers an insight in to the parallels between the grand houses of god in rome beautifully shot by the way and the temple of modern science that is large facility br br hanks is hanks pretending to be the smart guy and he fits the role much better second time around than his wooden performance in da <UNK> good support is offered by a rock solid cast with a particular highlight being <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stoic <UNK> but the films main saving grace is it's pace for the entire running time i was totally <UNK> in the story and the film never really gave me time to sit and pick apart its faults in logic br br my only serious criticism is that some of the science depicted is at best <UNK> regards real world authenticity but that is not the fault of the film makers rather an observation of the old <UNK> that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story br br speaking of which the story is a cracker mixing adventure and a race against time with a good <UNK> of intelligence and a nice twist or two along the way br br overall i would highly recommend this to fans of either of the national treasure movies which this clearly <UNK> but with a much more serious vibe and fans of ripping adventure tales in general
<START> paul thomas <UNK> stylish and compelling take on the 70s porn industry follows eddie adams aka <UNK> <UNK> mark <UNK> through six years of sex drugs and disco his chance meeting with pornography director jack <UNK> burt reynolds starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time character is based on real life porn actor john holmes who like <UNK> was renowned for being extremely well <UNK> this is where <UNK> finds initial success br br the main themes in boogie nights are the obvious ones relating to a film of this genre pornography drugs sex betrayal violence and music boogie nights deals with the pornography theme with some control it is not <UNK> and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal but mentally explicit when they take place on screen br br throughout the film cocaine is abused enormously and the film's setting los angeles 1977 1983 reflects the popularity of the drug at that time which the film captures perfectly however boogie nights does not promote cocaine as there are some scenes involving addiction and <UNK> for example at jack's party they find a girl who has recently and <UNK> <UNK> blood <UNK> from her nose and she begins an unconscious fit the film before this scenes has been fairly upbeat and comic but from this point it <UNK> the darkness that it will occur br br the music scenes are executed brilliantly from superbly staged disco scenes to a down and out <UNK> singing terribly in his new music career the soundtrack too is excellent featuring tunes from the emotions the beach boys and the unforgettable sound experience the standout scene in the whole film comes down to the music <UNK> <UNK> john c <UNK> and todd parker thomas jane visit drug dealer <UNK> jackson's alfred <UNK> house in order to make some quick cash from selling <UNK> drugs but night sister christian which is playing in the background <UNK> the intensity of the scene incredibly proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene boogie nights is filled with those kind of scenes which makes the film even more fantastic br br the standout performance in boogie nights is burt reynolds as the enigmatic yet moody film director in the scene where he attacks a young guy for <UNK> his movies it is a complete shock for the audience because before this point he has been pretty <UNK> and content other notable performances are <UNK> moore heather graham as the beautiful john c <UNK> and mark <UNK> who delivers the performance of his career br br boogie nights is also a surprisingly original film using common themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way <UNK> approach has been fully captures these characters in a time when nothing seemed to be going wrong or at least until the 80s arrive from then on things turn very dark indeed and all signs of the <UNK> characters and situations from the first part of the film have gone this does not however <UNK> the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offers br br boogie nights was not a box office success <UNK> only <UNK> million at cinemas in the uk but this is not the film's or the director's concern anderson <UNK> quality not popularity which is evident in his three other films hard eight <UNK> and punch drunk love i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple <UNK> filled with excellent and <UNK> situations because at the end of this film you will realize that boogie nights is a simple morality tale but one which will stay in the mind days after you watch it boogie nights is at once shocking hilarious devastating and both visually and <UNK> outstanding
<START> i was on a mission to watch uwe boll movies to see if they were really as bad as all that the first one i saw <UNK> was not a complete loss i liked it more than most people and actually rated it a 4 out of 10 next up was the first house of the dead movie now that was <UNK> bad i could stand watching ten minutes of it and fast <UNK> a bit and that was it i could see where it was going and i didn't need to see any more of it in order to rate it a just 1 out of 10 br br but i had access to the sequel too which however is not by uwe boll but mysteriously written by the same guys who so <UNK> wrote the first one and since it got a higher rating at imdb than the original i thought i'd give it a chance and i actually managed to watch all of it it started out with some funny references and cool lines like how the president got his orders from the vice president and acting wise it is light years better than the first here we have cool like the ultra hot <UNK> <UNK> whose <UNK> is in league with carrie anne moss <UNK> black and <UNK> <UNK> man i hope some matrix style movie comes along for her sometime and the always <UNK> super victoria <UNK> i love athletic women and there was also <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on my name is earl who performed quite well br br the story wasn't much and the action wasn't great either and the ending was a disappointment as they didn't succeed in their mission oh well at least the two <UNK> survived guess that's some small victory too br br good cast but a pretty bad movie the actors make it watchable but there's no real substance there br br 3 out of 10
<START> after <UNK> the lackluster novel heart of darkness i moved on to watch the movie which was a complete and absolute disappointment at the <UNK> i expected that the movie would help put together the jigsaw puzzle of a book however even though i had read the novel the movie still made no sense at all so i can't imagine how lost i would be if i had <UNK> the book altogether it seemed as though the writers picked out their favorite parts and put them in the movie and left out anything that may assist the viewers in <UNK> the meaningless plot this dreadful movie made no sense at all and i would strongly recommend against watching it as it will do nothing more than leave you completely <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> <UNK> baby is another pam <UNK> <UNK> film it was one of <UNK> less visceral films of this genre pam plays <UNK> <UNK> who's a chicago <UNK> <UNK> father is the owner of a small <UNK> company in <UNK> when local <UNK> try to run her father of of business <UNK> goes after the bad guys br br pam <UNK> had already made her mark in <UNK> films by the time <UNK> baby came along fans of both <UNK> and <UNK> brown know that pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress in <UNK> baby the fiery performance that viewers had come to expect from pam wasn't as evident in this film not that pam doesn't kick butt in <UNK> baby she's just not as much of a runaway train vigilante as she was in her previous <UNK> films br br the supporting cast in this film are a distinct disappointment so <UNK> baby is <UNK> film through and through and though <UNK> a bit more subdued than in her other films she still gives a compelling performance in <UNK> baby this film is definitely worth your time if you're an <UNK> pam <UNK> fan
<START> pick a stereotype any stereotype whether racial sexual cultural etc and i bet you'll find it in <UNK> <UNK> do you think that all hispanic teenage boys are stupid hairy <UNK> and dirty <UNK> are hispanic girls sex crazed easy ass <UNK> <UNK> do black people all want to start fights and carry guns do all gay people throw themed parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them are all white teenage girls rich stuck up <UNK> who are bored with white teenage boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous if you answered yes to any of the previous questions you my friend are a <UNK> and you will love <UNK> <UNK> br br director larry clark likes to shock his audiences i was 15 years old the first time i saw kids and i think that's why i'm still a virgin but <UNK> <UNK> isn't it's just bad he tries to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialog and body hair close ups but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic br br simply put <UNK> <UNK> is a teenage boy's fantasy what 14 year old boy doesn't want to be a <UNK> who gets in trouble crashes parties drinks 40s and is told by the hot rich white girl that his penis looks dangerous besides that <UNK> i really don't know who's going to enjoy this film

<START> i hate it when people in the movie theater talk back to the screen it's one of the main reasons why i stick to dvd's or videos i saw the <UNK> on dvd but if i had seen it in the movies i would have had to stand up and scream he's not dead yet you moron br br the <UNK> is another in a long list of horrible movies that feature mr redford legal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up close and personal <UNK> last castle and spy game if robert redford told me to <UNK> in something i'd go the other way br br but the worst possible thing you can do to an audience is this say you're being kidnapped and your <UNK> has a gun he's holding it on you for most of the movie you turn the tables on him and start <UNK> him whatever you do keep <UNK> him until he's dead don't just <UNK> him for ten seconds stay with it ten minutes at least but bob stops too soon walks away and forgets about mr <UNK> until he gets up finds the gun and holds it on our hero again at this point i wanted mr <UNK> to shoot robert redford more than a few times and i wanted to shoot him as well

<START> blame guy ritchie the late 90s success of <UNK> clich√© ridden lock stock and two smoking <UNK> <UNK> a series of pitiful gangster movies from which the genre never really <UNK> sadly rise of the the true story of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> isn't likely to reverse that trend despite a decent lead performance from <UNK> the film falls victim to all too familiar east end stereotypes they're either busy blowing someone's brains out or <UNK> a scantily clad blonde br br from <UNK> football <UNK> in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld during the nineties <UNK> rise through the ranks of <UNK> leaving the for <UNK> <UNK> becomes a <UNK> where he's given <UNK> <UNK> to kick the crap out of anyone here he gets in with notorious <UNK> leaders pat <UNK> <UNK> and tony tucker stone and begins to realise gang <UNK> ain't what it's <UNK> up to be br br there is fun to be had <UNK> writer director julian laughable join the <UNK> <UNK> as every sentence seems to start with an <UNK> gonna or <UNK> or on occasion <UNK> then i only went <UNK> typically <UNK> with a mandatory ' the direction too <UNK> of <UNK> especially the obvious glee gets from filming violent scenes in close up and in the case of the bloody shotgun to the face denouement in br br director use of the classic rise and fall gangster narrative isn't what will <UNK> to big screen obscurity nor is it the fact that half way through the film annoyingly <UNK> <UNK> in favour of the events culminating in the infamous shooting of <UNK> and tucker it's sickening <UNK> for <UNK> shot violence that ruins the film whether it's a brick in the face or axe in the head during a vicious attack on a train it's all unnecessarily prolonged doesn't so much pack a punch as leave you feeling <UNK> and more importantly <UNK> you of two hours of your life you won't get back
<START> i am an australian currently living in japan i saw this movie on tv here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of western and japanese <UNK> <UNK> whoever wrote the screenplay and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it's like to be a <UNK> living in japan the only part i thought was too hollywood y was when tom character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him public displays of affection are not really acceptable here finally a movie that highlights the true experience 9 10
<START> i had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory non stop action great movie br br these people were obviously watching a different movie honestly sucked from the word go i kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better and it was to no <UNK> some said this movie was brutal and others said gory but i can't find either of those <UNK> actually showing up in this i mean hell there are so many scenes with people getting shot and there being no blood at all it's not even funny i guess the best way to sum this up is it probably should've been rated pg by 1984 standards and now in the year <UNK> there is no doubt this would be pg bad bad not in the fun cheesy b variety movie
<START> i should start off by saying i have something of a love hate relationship with musicals some of them are fantastic some are downright crap so i expected hair to fall into one of those categories however it didn't falling instead in the middle br br the songs aren't brilliant though the <UNK> song did make me smile a lot and everything is rather dated looking but the movie didn't draw me in as others have such as rocky horror although that's a bad example since for years i hated rocky horror then all of a sudden i got it and have loved it ever since maybe hair will be the same although i doubt it will get as much exposure as rocky horror due to the language and nudity content so i doubt i will get the chance to have it grow on me hair grow oh suit yourself br br anyhow i didn't get to see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical <UNK> which was a shame since i would have liked to see how it ended especially after reading some of the reviews here br br not a film for the casual cinema goer but definitely one for musical lovers i really hope they don't re make it though since i think any such re make would end up a shallow pale pc version of the original br br worth a look for lovers of the genre
<START> a fairly interesting look at some characters from <UNK> <UNK> middle class although india is rapidly <UNK> her culture is not keeping up this film involves the <UNK> society where women are not yet truly free citizens a land of arranged <UNK> men who <UNK> with <UNK> with total <UNK> and women who are expected to tolerate all this will eventually come up short i was impressed with <UNK> <UNK> who was quite attractive and played her character with total <UNK> but i was even more impressed with <UNK> <UNK> who i understand is a long time <UNK> of bollywood her quiet beauty and low key psychic suffering was excellent the lesbian subtext of this film was never particularly erotic and never <UNK> darn worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures
<START> while driving in a highway to the wedding of his beloved betty ann adam eric is surprised by his former <UNK> <UNK> justin <UNK> on the <UNK> of his car adam has broken off with the <UNK> and moron <UNK> because of betty ann along their road trip <UNK> makes fun of some <UNK> in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road after some incidents they give a lift to the <UNK> sarah <UNK> brooks and sooner the trio is <UNK> by a scary monster driving the monster truck br br in spite of having one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a horror movie the irritating <UNK> monster man is a surprisingly good trash horror comedy the story is a collection of clich√©s beginning like joy ride or duel then it turns to one of the countless rip offs of the texas chainsaw massacre there is a surprising twist ending with a hook for a sequel there are hilarious scenes <UNK> brooks is extremely sexy and this film really entertains my vote is seven br br title brazil monster man
<START> i'm sure i saw future kill for the same reason as most people the awesome poster by <UNK> <UNK> and like everyone else i was disappointed to find that the movie could not live up to the poster <UNK> said that director moore actually <UNK> him to do it when i first saw this at the age of 14 i thought it was the worst movie ever made i'd still think that if i hadn't seen certain movies on mst3k since then br br the plot has a bunch of annoying college boys driving into the mutant city to kidnap a gang leader for their <UNK> that's when they meet splatter ed <UNK> a mutant cyborg psycho who kills the gang leader and blames it on the <UNK> as an excuse to hunt them down and <UNK> power the rest of the movie consists mostly of chases a hand full of <UNK> try to battle their way out of mutant city which i think is supposed to be la even though it was made in texas there's some pseudo political stuff about the frat <UNK> society being pro nuclear weapons and the mutant society being anti <UNK> there's talk of how splatter became a freak due to radiation most people develop cancer from radiation but splatter just shoots <UNK> and <UNK> girls yeah that makes tons of sense at one point our heroes rescue a mutant girl from two pro <UNK> police and she shows them how the other half lives the other half it turns out are all punk kids who dance around to a bad 80s pop band so our little epic is both dumb and dated that's really all there is to it frat boys running around in messed up buildings while guys who look like <UNK> try to kill them oh and it's the future br br i don't think you'll have any doubt about why ron w moore never made another movie this thing is a real stinker if you like <UNK> buy his books they have the poster without the horrors of the movie or just watch alien again future kill is a waste of time that nobody needs br br if this description makes the picture sound good there's another crappy movie that does the same thing only bigger and better after the fall of new york it's crap but it blows future kill off the screen
<START> i read the book written by bill carter on which this movie is based many years ago the book is certainly stronger than the movie it provides more detail than a movie can possibly provide the end result being that i thought the movie seemed a wee bit <UNK> on a handful of items all things considered though and given the limitations of the medium the movie provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the battle between jay leno and david <UNK> in the early 90's to host the tonight show after the retirement of johnny carson br br the highlight is clearly the performances i can think of no more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and well known and on tv on a regular basis john michael <UNK> nailed the part of <UNK> perfectly watching him really was like watching <UNK> daniel <UNK> tried <UNK> to be jay leno but somehow didn't pull it off as effectively his whole look seemed fake and he just didn't seem natural in the role in a less central role rich little not surprisingly nailed the voice of carson although the look was a bit off in the book the most interesting of the central figures was probably <UNK> agent helen in the movie kathy bates was perfect in the role although not quite as out of control as <UNK> portrayal of the woman in writing br br in the end this is light and entertaining viewing the subject matter isn't especially important in the overall scheme of things but it's a fun behind the scenes look at a memorable time in the entertainment industry 7 10
<START> this short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its <UNK> for religious br br after a session at a recording studio frank sinatra leaves and comes upon a group of kids beating up on another because he was jewish he <UNK> them as only an american icon could about the meaning of prejudice and what we had just fought for against the nazis the meaning could not be <UNK> br br both songs from this short subject were recorded and sold big for columbia records if you are but a dream and the song written for the film the house i live in the latter is one of the best songs about an <UNK> version of america we'd all like to <UNK> for br br sinatra in fact recorded the house i live in again during the sixties for a joint album he did for his <UNK> record label the album is now a <UNK> and it shouldn't be his <UNK> were bing crosby and fred <UNK> and his with the orchestra <UNK> by nelson <UNK> br br <UNK> was sinatra's primary music conductor and <UNK> during the forties when he died that position eventually fell to nelson <UNK> does the <UNK> for the short and the columbia record <UNK> for the <UNK> record br br sinatra <UNK> and others should listen to both back to back and compare and catch this worthwhile film whenever it is shown
<START> this is the first feature film from australian comedian mick mick wrote the film with his brother richard with help from john clarke another comedian and actor mick john also have starring roles along with several other iconic australian actors bill hunter frank wilson et al the basic premise of the movie is that slimy jack simpson mick has become a member of a lawn <UNK> club for the sole purpose of getting a free car park near his work the club is in dire financial <UNK> and calls on jack to help john clarke plays the <UNK> arch nemesis he is trying to take the club over and turn it into a poker machine <UNK> jack and the other club members band together to try and save the club with many funny twists and turns and <UNK> eventual redemption this is quite a clever little movie it is well above mick usual <UNK> humor it is pretty well written and well acted the older aussie actors are brilliant bill hunter frank wilson monica <UNK> and the film <UNK> along rather then going at break neck pace but that adds to the charm of the movie there is low level coarse language
<START> what a wonderful film filled with eccentric unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast the director also did a great job keeping the story held together getting those wonderful performances on not messing with them and using music and what wonderful music it is to great effect s in the lead role is great i had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is and although i have enjoyed her on law and order this really shows what she can do with a filled out complex role macy gray is terrific <UNK> <UNK> as usual wonderful lou <UNK> great jimmy terrific and doesn't try to pull focus because he's a star a true piece of ensemble acting br br rent it enjoy it groove to it and treasure it something special
<START> you could tell from the opening shot of the <UNK> belt in the bank that this was going to be a great film br br a touch <UNK> in feel with a twist of retro this film <UNK> style the brilliant camera work acting script and the manner that the secret life of the protagonist unfolds all <UNK> each other in possibly making the best italian film i've ever seen up there with la <UNK> del albeit different br br shame on the people sitting behind me who made it obvious that they couldn't see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes <UNK> crafted by the camera don't miss
<START> one of <UNK> a combat veteran himself early works of average quality but accurately hits on the many <UNK> aspects of life in <UNK> germany the main character starts the movie in as a sgt with c co which really did end the war in <UNK> as in the movie same unit in the previous month had fought heavily in and then <UNK> part of the <UNK> facility to the <UNK> the movie may seem confusing by flip <UNK> between showing the good bad of the german people but anyone who has been there or at least well read on it would know that most of what is portrayed in the movie are things that really did happen in 45 <UNK> germany the only <UNK> i noticed was minor while on a boat cruise of the <UNK> passing the remains of the bridge he comments he crossed there but his unit really crossed well south of there north of worms germany
<START> i never heard of this film when it first came out it must have sunk immediately o i saw it on cable while sick in hospital so i hardly had enough energy to watch it let alone turn the channel better choice than the style channel 0 filmed on location this <UNK> should have been on the travel channel the plot is recycled from ship board <UNK> of the thirties and forties the cast seems to have been recycled from the fifties donald <UNK> star of musicals and edward as a card shark as to the main cast walter matthau is still playing the same part as he did in guys and dolls or was it the one about the orphan girl irresponsible <UNK> and <UNK> but it just doesn't take with a man of his age as to jack lemmon he plays his part so straight he can hardly <UNK> and <UNK> when dancing and as mentioned <UNK> cannon is <UNK> attractive as another <UNK> <UNK> with her mother who thinks walter is rich while he thinks she is rich <UNK> plays mother another <UNK> from the fifties the most fun is the running <UNK> between brent <UNK> as the <UNK> and <UNK> cruise director who immediately spots walter as a poor dancer and spends his time trying to get him <UNK> so he will have to pay for his free passage in the end though he receives his meanwhile jack <UNK> about meets an attractive woman with mutual attraction but their affair is broken up by <UNK> lies that jack is a doctor when he was actually a retired department store <UNK> but finally the two men take to the sea in a rubber boat to <UNK> her and all is well there does not seem to be any principal player under the age of fifty
<START> i saw this movie in september with my mother i was expecting a good movie and i saw an excellent one this is now my most <UNK> movie it did not leave me after i left the theater the situations in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother meryl streep and <UNK> <UNK> were equally incredible this movie has made me realize how important family relationships are rent it i can't recommend it enough
