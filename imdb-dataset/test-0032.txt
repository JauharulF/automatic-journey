<START> this movie about a man on the run for killing a mobster is the kind of film you can watch entirely on fast forward once you know who's who and not lose a thing it has an attractive cast but the plot is a virtual writer's guide to cinema cliche and boy does the dialogue
<START> this film was brilliant i absolutely loved it wesley snipes was great for this role and i'm sure blade 2 would be just as good br br blade is by far one of my favorite action horror movies out there and if you <UNK> seen it yet and like vampires and blood all that stuff you should really rent it because i assure you that you'll love it
<START> a mesmerizing film that certainly keeps your attention ben daniels is fascinating and courageous to watch
<START> i really enjoyed the <UNK> this movie had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization one line in the movie from wesley <UNK> seagal stuck out in my mind to be very true of our society western medicine is in the practice of <UNK> illness and i am in the business of <UNK> it br br
<START> the best thing about the prey is the tag line it's not human and it's got an axe the movie itself is a padded endless <UNK> and <UNK> shots make the viewer wanna die no slasher fan will like this garbage watch friday the 13th again and burn any copy of this film you find br br it also rates as one of the 25 worst films ever made
<START> <UNK> <UNK> don't come much than this but it's a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright except in this case it doesn't based on a <UNK> novel by the <UNK> lloyd c douglas he wrote the <UNK> and already filmed in <UNK> with irene dunne and robert taylor it's got more <UNK> than a <UNK> br br rock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane <UNK> a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight to make <UNK> he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and <UNK> it no it quite that <UNK> he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy in between times they fall in love br br try as i might i can't quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american <UNK> that are supposed to lie just below the surface of <UNK> films this one isn't too deep on the plus side rock hudson isn't half bad i think i am <UNK> him and of course it looks great in <UNK> films people live in rooms the size of <UNK> nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap opera terms this is definitely daytime tv
<START> i just purchased an running out of time on dvd and it was an excellent film i must say not really action packed in terms of gun play but definitely exciting and witty i do not think i have seen andy <UNK> in better form and the editing on this film was very well executed go watch this now if you are a fan of <UNK> or hk action film
<START> fans of horror comedy will like this one others might get quickly annoyed and shut it off it's sort of a buddy film with over the top violence and gore deliberately stereotyped characters and a lot of <UNK> br br it looks to have been made on a budget of about 100 by a bunch of <UNK> guys after a big beer <UNK> party there's a lead who's a frustrated nerd and his <UNK> prank pulling friend who <UNK> him about 30 times per second there's a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles which is the highlight of the film whenever this thing and its <UNK> mask wearing driver appear it's a great scene there's a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat and plenty of giant guys in <UNK> hanging out in red neck bars the <UNK> friend never <UNK> his and gets them in one mess after another their arguing got on my nerves but other aspects of the film make up for it br br sight gags <UNK> fun at several psycho <UNK> and trying to somebody films are everywhere take your pick which one is <UNK> the most hills have eyes saw and <UNK> <UNK> were some that i recognized br br it's enjoyable insanity if you're in the right frame of mind <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with your friends can make viewing this more fun it's a good bet that's the condition of the movie makers when they put this thing together
<START> is less funny and less interesting than any episode of <UNK> <UNK> where is their bob denver do they even have a <UNK> <UNK> a french man moves to <UNK> to attend classes he moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself and they do and say uninteresting things this movie is unbelievably bland the only bright spot was a pretty french girl who played a <UNK> lesbian she places her hands behind her head and reveals <UNK> not the usual of dark <UNK> hair but bare <UNK> does not a good movie make was funny so was la cage <UNK> and le <UNK> makes you wonder what is going wrong with french comedy
<START> the movie angels of the universe is a pure masterpiece and it proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie on a low budget e g american beauty and blair witch project the director <UNK> <UNK> gives the novel a new life on the white screen the movie is a breakthrough in <UNK> film making because it's the biggest and the greatest movie that has been done in <UNK> br br the music in the film played by is very symbolic for the film it is absolutely brilliant i recommend everybody who are able to think to go and see this film as soon as possible you won't be disappointed i would bet on this film to win the best foreign film award next year Â– all over the globe
<START> this movie was a major bait and switch i rented it because of rebecca st james a popular christian singer i have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a <UNK> movie well br br i think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend or a friend of a friend my first clue that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when i witnessed the special effects of the <UNK> encounters cheesy as the movie progressed i noticed how plastic the actors were it was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors there are a few exceptions br br rebecca was disappointing she is always found in the house and doesn't show the realistic facial expressions of one whose husband has return to the <UNK> doesn't she ever leave the house br br i had to turn off the movie several times in order to finish it i hope that rebecca doesn't believe the message of this movie believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell jesus spread a message of love and hope his message inspired others to change out of love not fear
<START> i was wondering if there was a place or a link that someone can send me or post for me so i can watch this show it seems to be a missing show i have been looking for years now its about oz and a girl who has to help save it it was really good but i found a good oz type thing on the web but i cant find it again or seem to remember a lot of it due to being years and was thinking that this one maybe it and from reading all this it sounds good and maybe the missing show that i really liked please someone help me thanks so much so please anyone that can help me or give me a link that would be so helpful again thank you so much or if anyone has an oz based good videos please post as well
<START> as with many sequels this one just doesn't have the quality or the impact of the original the first one belongs up there with the rest of the <UNK> this one just doesn't cut it the first film had a magical good time feeling about it that is totally missing from this film we became <UNK> of all these characters minus richard dreyfuss in an age of innocence now a few years later they have changed so much that they are largely different people while this is what happens in real life we don't expect this to happen to our favorite film characters the film doesn't have the humor that the original had and we were expecting to laugh what little humor is there is dark the first film also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever while this one is good but not even close to the <UNK> this film is so totally different from the original that it isn't even actually a sequel i gave it a 4
<START> when the long running <UNK> ever came to an end its characters june were <UNK> for the longer running and more popular sequel although their <UNK> were changed from <UNK> to br br terry has received a new job and as a result he and june move to where they end up in all manner of <UNK> <UNK> guests dropping by to visit at an <UNK> moment the boss <UNK> himself to dinner and terry trying to chance his arm at d i y but <UNK> it up each time a fellow imdb user <UNK> this show as <UNK> and <UNK> well fair enough it wasn't clever but that was the whole point as for <UNK> well some of the episodes were pretty <UNK> i will admit but overall i found it to be extremely well written highly amusing and very well acted br br it was warm hearted slapstick not <UNK> to the later b b c sitcom up eight different writers contributed to the nine series giving the show plenty of scope terry scott was a comic genius as he well proved in productions such as <UNK> the <UNK> films and of course here june <UNK> likewise was a comedy legend in her own right br br i enjoy some modern shows i e <UNK> <UNK> 'the catherine <UNK> <UNK> and i even enjoyed the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 'the young <UNK> and 'the comic strip but i am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy such as this humour that you don't need to think about is excellent for when you are feeling down and want to lift yourself up for the record was wonderful stuff special note should be made of the catchy theme tune which caught the mood of the show tremendously well
<START> general is a super being who wants to play a little game with the crew of the enterprise a lot of extremely unlikely and nonsensical stuff seems to be happening and seems obsessed with the human practices of <UNK> and murder he seems to need to experience what he <UNK> to be a thrill and has created a human environment though a few hundred years out of date in which to play out his fantasies the environment is subtly <UNK> and the crew immediately begins to spot the inconsistencies pretty soon it becomes clear that is not just an immature god but a very <UNK> one regardless of how you feel about this one stick around for the twilight zone like ending it is well worth it br br as many have pointed out character inspired the more developed and amusing on going character q and you can see in john construction of that personality more than just shades of <UNK> it is fun to compare how the four <UNK> we have seen <UNK> with q all deal with him so <UNK> differently
<START> i quite enjoyed the <UNK> crew 1999 which was the last of the three films in this series the first being urban menace 1999 which i've yet to see i know it was <UNK> but the three leads did a pretty decent job all things considered br br this however was truly atrocious ice t was dreadful and he's the producer can't say i've ever heard of the shocker who apparently never <UNK> how to spell but his performance was one of the worst i've ever seen in a movie br br miss jones did pretty well in her small role though she later went on to make some atrocious racist jokes on her radio show after the se asian <UNK> plus other occasions sadly way to go girl br br no one else comes out with any credit strangely <UNK> storm and ernie hudson who are both pretty bad here are far better in the <UNK> crew which was made along with urban menace at the same time as corrupt how that works i don't know br br i'm going to try the ice t commentary now to see whether he <UNK> for the film or tries to make us think it's a great piece of film making
<START> fool for love is one of the several now forgotten films robert altman directed throughout the 1980s this one a screen adaptation of a sam shepard play that features shepard in the lead role just simply isn't very good altman made many not very good films over the course of his fascinating career and many times the fault was his but here i think the fault lies with shepard for writing such a flimsy play altman's direction is assured the performances are o k given what the actors have to work with but this <UNK> screenplay goes nowhere and takes its time getting there br br shepard is eddie a <UNK> who has a love hate relationship with may kim basinger the two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere while a mysterious man harry dean <UNK> who may be either a <UNK> or literal father to both eddie and may quietly <UNK> randy quaid rounds out the four person cast as a gentleman <UNK> br br the only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that <UNK> and <UNK> relationship is incestuous however this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything the screenplay doesn't explore their relationship in any detail and it doesn't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes shepard and create eccentric mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes <UNK> and quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots br br the last half hour or so of the film is especially bad when <UNK> and <UNK> back stories begin to play out in flashback over <UNK> <UNK> voice over br br <UNK> this up to another of altman's experiments gone awry br br grade c
<START> this may well be the worst remake hollywood has ever produced and that's saying something i'll take it further than that and say this movie is so stunningly <UNK> bad that it must be seen i don't know if i'm even capable of <UNK> all the things wrong with it like the fact that the casting director appears to have pulled names out of a hat or the mind <UNK> of richard <UNK> character being allowed to walk away <UNK> free at the end i'm sure the people saying it's just fiction who cares would have no problem if it was a former al <UNK> <UNK> who just wants to return to his home country so i'll just <UNK> my review to the utter hilarity which is mainly the scene where bruce willis is testing out his gun br br in the original version you'll recall the practices his kill on a <UNK> the <UNK> explodes on impact an effect known as understatement in this version willis sets up a <UNK> target but he doesn't use a sniper rifle he uses a gigantic remote controlled cannon which costs <UNK> of thousands of dollars and can only be <UNK> in the back of a huge <UNK> this man likes a challenge he reveals the cannon by pulling away a <UNK> at which point jack black who is there to observe jumps around and says that rocks this thing rocks about 18 times i guess willis didn't have to <UNK> it first he just lifted it <UNK> and all out of the back of the van despite it probably <UNK> several tons the scene then turns into an austin powers movie as willis misses the <UNK> and takes out a tree then has black run through the mud with his pants falling down finally blowing off <UNK> entire arm the <UNK> falls to the ground <UNK> br br if i can recommend this movie for one non ironic reason it's for the diane character as a tough russian major who becomes <UNK> linked to gere despite having a facial <UNK> a bold move for a hollywood feature by mid movie i was really liking this character so it was a shame when she had to be killed i would have liked to see a movie about her other than that this pile of crap is only useful as an objective intelligence test 3 10
<START> let me waste a moment of your time to explain how i approached this film 1st i <UNK> the trailers out of hand because the film appeared to be an uncredited remake of aliens which i consider to be one of the weakest films in the alien series <UNK> continuing to dismiss the film after i heard positive things about it from people whose opinions i trust i missed the theatrical run completely i then became hooked on <UNK> in its 3rd or 4th season at the time and found pitch black on cable one night around bed time so i said oh why not at least it has <UNK> black in it soon i recognized keith david and began to realize that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mitchell and cole <UNK> could all act why this should surprise me i do not know i was captivated i have now remained captivated for four years i just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time and i still love it br br this is not an art film not an independent and its not entirely original but where it fails to break a lot of new ground it utterly succeeds in providing interesting realistic characters hard driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot and non stop entertainment an absolutely beautiful environment with <UNK> rendered special effects sound to good to be true don't take my word for it see it for yourself br br the film also <UNK> the charisma of the now somewhat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> introducing the character of richard <UNK> <UNK> would go on to star in the somewhat <UNK> chronicles thereof which i also enjoyed though <UNK> its rather huge flaws and is now something of a legend <UNK> is so charismatic so big and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor but a smart one too checking out the dvd version of pitch black with the audio comments on might just blow you away br br the film is about the crew of an inter system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash landing in which their captain was killed the new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic mitchell but she is caught between two <UNK> and dangerous personalities a bounty hunter with secrets <UNK> and a dangerous criminal who has been <UNK> altered to see in the dark <UNK> is that all of course not the planet is inhabited and the inhabitants are hungry br br as unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be pitch black is beautifully filmed well told and very nicely performed don't expect to learn anything and don't expect to have to think a whole lot but do expect to have fun with this modern sci fi action classic
<START> <UNK> the picture of the diner on the cover of the dvd made me realize that this was a local movie the word detroit in the title <UNK> my and i did some looking up of things and yes a local movie it was br br so i picked it up someone i knew actually knew some of the producers director dont remember which and said the producers directors got people to pay to be in this movie br br brilliant what a great idea the movie makers get some capital to do the movie with thanks to their cast and crew then the <UNK> cast crew others get some of the <UNK> i'm imagining br br <UNK> br br um anyways this film totally <UNK> me the special effects were special as in special children who ride the small <UNK> to school the acting was very amusing not intentionally however there's a great line where a guy says well this bone <UNK> gonna smoke itself as a pickup line unfortunately that is the only fun part of the whole film the story well i sort of followed it about 3 5 of the way in then everything stopped making sense and as we were sitting there watching it it suddenly ended i mean as in no resolution of anything like they ran out of time sorry folks out of time <UNK> br br we sat there <UNK> and <UNK> and threw in another film then about 20 minutes later a neighbor of mine showed up with one of the guys from the movie we threw it back in and he the actor gave us a running commentary which was awesome because he totally ripped on the movie br br what more could you ask for br br the most absurd scene for me was a <UNK> chase scene were it was so dark that it could have literally been a guy running past with a <UNK> and not a <UNK> at all that and the jaw <UNK> in your face sudden ending is enough to make you <UNK> in pain the zombies looked less like zombies than my <UNK> do and i dont work at the <UNK> either br br so i recommend seeing this if you can get someone from the movie to come over and give you a running commentary as to all the things that went on behind the scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because that just adds to the fun br br otherwise give this one a pass rent something like if you want a jaw <UNK> bad in a funny way movie
<START> <UNK> a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best paul <UNK> film to this day cinematography accompanied with philip glass mystical musical score added a completely magical aura to the story of one of the <UNK> greatest <UNK> whose originality and <UNK> narrative are beautifully portrayed in this picture as any gifted character <UNK> was troubled with severe self conflicts the main of them being the conflict between the pen and a sword as the director puts it in his final chapter or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings living in a <UNK> <UNK> society with centuries long warrior traditions thus <UNK> the gap between the sensitive and the traditional side of <UNK> himself br br all <UNK> films and the ones he wrote scripts for are basically stories of the inside conflict within a man that doesn't belong in an environment he lives in that also goes for <UNK> who apart from japanese military school upbringing is brought up with love for theater and words his demise consisted of both of these key points in his life it was about words and theatrical ending in a life long play film like this comes along once in a long while and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty 20 out of 10
<START> hey <UNK> the best drama every is now on <UNK> music channel go to their website to see the schedule and find out what number it is on your cable or satellite this was one of my favorite shows growing up it has everything that i want a tv show to be a clean family friendly drama that does not gross me out the story about a man who after <UNK> his work decides to set off for a great cross country adventure along the way they meet all sorts of interesting people and find themselves in the midst of all kinds of trouble this show was originally a spin off of touched by an angel another really good family show make sure you check it out
<START> once upon a time quentin tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker br br now unfortunately he not only makes terrible films but puts his names to ones like this br br a supposedly cool retro flashback to biker movies of the 60s and 70s this <UNK> new depths br br believe you me i enjoy it when a <UNK> falls off in a film more than the next man but even i felt kind of sleazy watching this to use a word i never thought i would its you see i can't even spell it the plot in the <UNK> sense of the term is as incomprehensible as <UNK> jones' accent the fact his terrible acting does not stand our particularly is as <UNK> a testament as one can think of br br this is just terrible shocking it almost made me cry in horror
<START> the movie adaptation of heart of darkness is disappointing both as a movie and as a representation of joseph <UNK> classic story br br there are several small differences between the book and movie but that's expected in any book to movie transition <UNK> dies in a different location the manager does not <UNK> <UNK> on his voyage mistress spends much more time with him than in the story the real issue is the amount of footage that's put into the movie but has no basis in the actual story for some reason the director finds the need to spice up a few of the scenes adding drama or actions that seldom make any sense and are always <UNK> to the story some examples that come to mind are mistress beating <UNK> over the head and knocking him out nothing happens while he's unconscious and <UNK> didn't even <UNK> the attack a couple hours pass and he wakes up total waste of time <UNK> has a pet monkey which for some random reason he kills on a <UNK> also when <UNK> leaves station he makes the noble decision to leave behind all the priceless <UNK> he had <UNK> for no real reason at all one other flaw is character john <UNK> is a terrible choice to play the man who is described as tall and inspirational a man with a commanding presence he practically <UNK> all of his lines which in a more capable actor's hands could have been very thought provoking i can't remove the image of john <UNK> playing a mentally disabled in of mice and men when i'm watching him <UNK> the role of <UNK> over all i would rate the movie at 3 out of 10 stars it's a good movie if you've read the book and want to see it in movie form perhaps to help you visual the scenes but as a source of entertainment i would never recommend it
<START> grand champion is a bit old fashion at first glance andrew <UNK> at the <UNK> worth star <UNK> said it best if walt disney had <UNK> from texas he would have made grand champion br br the movie does not have the video and special effects but it has heart and soul the kids are great and the array of stars is incredible i bet bruce willis and julia roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see g rated br br this is a masterfully crafted simple little film made in texas by texas barry take your kids take your kids friends take grandma too they will all enjoy it and you will too
<START> one of the <UNK> on the subject of <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> got it right when he she stated that the movie is really bad but i take exception when he she commented on the animation br br the animation wasn't bad because of <UNK> flash it was bad animation because it was directed wrong flash is just a tool in the right hands an artist can create animation as full and fluid as any disney film and in the wrong hands it can look as bad as the stuff on the internet which is where <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and should've stayed there br br studios such as cartoon network <UNK> disney and warner bros create wonderful animation using flash i e <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> home for imaginary friends etc br br <UNK> <UNK> was an ill conceived piece of tripe that was made because revolution studios bought media <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> was one of the <UNK> included roth and company thought they'd make a quick buck <UNK> a turd like <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> was <UNK> by it's producer amy the reason for this third <UNK> abortion of an animated film is that none of the executives at revolution studios had the <UNK> brains to <UNK> mark brooks and peter they really tried their best but were way in over their heads and hire real writers directors and at least a semi competent producer they did one thing correctly though they hired some of the best <UNK> and animators in la but as <UNK> <UNK> demonstrates one can buy the best sports car on the floor but if you're a moron you'll wreck it for sure
<START> being a wrestling fan movies about wrestling generally suck backyard dogs jesse <UNK> story but this one isn't the worst i've ever seen yes its bad but its better than some of the others i've mentioned br br hulk hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn't want to be on that network let me explain it so everyone can understand picture usa network having rip and <UNK> will go to any <UNK> to get him br br does this make sense no well don't feel bad because it doesn't make sense nor does it make sense to have a <UNK> ex con have a real fight with rip at the end of the movie br br none of this movie makes much sense but compared to other wrestling movies and later hogan films its not so bad br br 4 out of 10
<START> missed it at the cinema but was always slightly compelled found it in the throw out bin at my local video shop for a <UNK> two bucks will i now give it away to anyone who wants it probably no <UNK> plot one dimensional characters plastic world ripped off from many far better films no decent dialogue to speak of you know that empty feeling when you come down off ecstasy its that feeling right here sad thing is the australia i know is heading in this direction minus the melodrama and simple answers interesting only to see the older aussie actors who had to act back in their day to get by vs the newer aussie actors who have to look good to get by like some horribly <UNK> narrative introduction to a film clip that never actually starts poor <UNK> started her career as an actress as well
<START> this movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason definitely not a well made movie so unbelievable the scenes where the president <UNK> were downtown and walking among the people were a farce there would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 <UNK> of the president in that situation in real life if it wasn't for the blood and profanity this was shot like a tv movie it could have been decent if it was done differently <UNK> president talents were never realized in this movie <UNK> acting is okay the production values in this movie leave a lot to be desired overall i think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair
<START> an <UNK> film not made for an irish audience with <UNK> and spacey each of a half decent <UNK> accents the powers that be had but one choice force the irish actors to adopt equally bad <UNK> accents <UNK> the whole thing to the lowest common <UNK>
<START> this review may contain spoilers the decline of western civilization what a great title eh and of coarse a great movie this is the best concert film i have ever seen a close second being the talking heads movie stop making sense i first heard of this movie when <UNK> world came out in 1992 i looked at the director's name penelope and thought cool name what else has he directed i thought the first name was <UNK> like <UNK> after some time looking in movie <UNK> i came across the <UNK> acclaimed decline and realized penelope was a woman my mom <UNK> me i spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down i finally saw it on vhs in <UNK> where i currently <UNK> it was worth the wait this captures the la punk movement very well this is teen angst at it's best folks my favourite is the band the <UNK> who need subtitles for the lyrics because <UNK> crash sings so crazy you cannot understand it i laughed when i saw this the band black flag live in an abandoned church and the band x are a very intelligent bunch also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to slash magazine about how we do not need to save the <UNK> there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour <UNK> in i became a huge penelope fan after this and saw all her punk movies <UNK> was ok and <UNK> is a cult classic i own both of these on vhs she is a true underground film maker and i love her stuff i would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when <UNK> was so popular i was a big <UNK> fan then but alas i saw this in 2002 and by that point i had grown out of <UNK> and now i listen to crystal method <UNK> slim quite a change of pace i know but what can you do but if you want a true depiction of the punk movement this captures it better than anything much better than 1991 the year punk broke this is a tough movie to track down but if you get your hands on it rent it even if you don't like the music it is an excellent piece of work now days it might be easier to find with dvd's being so popular by the way penelope produced a little known albert brooks movie called real life which i also own very funny stuff in todays reality tv <UNK> rent decline highly recommended thanks
<START> although it's definitely an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and it's always worth a watch this film never quite meets the targets that it should for two reasons firstly after the first forty five minutes or so it focuses heavily on helen and johnny who are far less interesting characters than most of the others janet jennifer george and miss are all much more <UNK> although at first this works since in life we don't always know everything about everyone else and because the point is being made that perhaps helen is slightly self involved it quickly wears thin and we want to see more of the other characters br br secondly the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half the letter itself holds far less significance than it does in the first half and again although this works well in some ways it seems odd to leave so much of the potential displayed in the first half behind br br overall this film is sweet and good natured with some genuinely hilarious moments for example janet explaining to an avid audience the lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that helen feels is heavy and the sense of living in a small <UNK> town is accurately portrayed but the film isn't quite as intelligent as it's trying to be it just misses being both a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life however it's still good and if you get the chance it's definitely worth seeing
<START> why is this one no good when the first one <UNK> try the fact that they attempted to replace rodney <UNK> with jackie mason please that's like replacing the beatles with <UNK> al randy quaid is the only one that saves this movie from a zero br br however don't let this stop you from watching the first movie which was outstanding
<START> i saw the <UNK> new film tonight at a special advance screening and i was so blown away by its sheer greatness that i felt i had to come onto imdb and get the word out admittedly i was already a huge fan of the <UNK> work i loved the hbo series and listen to their music weekly there's nothing better to sing along to but this appreciation actually made me more <UNK> going into to <UNK> screening for we've all been disappointed one time or another by something we love when it attempted to make the jump to the big screen with <UNK> <UNK> the pick of destiny this is not the case br br simply put this film rocks harder than anything i've seen and is funnier and more <UNK> than anything peter jackson pixar and will ferrell together could produce it tells the story of the d before we came to know them setting up intriguing <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> their <UNK> together and how they were inspired to write songs about such things as lee sasquatch and <UNK> most importantly they reveal the true inspiration to the greatest song in the world tribute and how it came to be which is different than the hbo <UNK> version after you've witnessed it you probably won't be able to remember it hence the tribute but your mind forever be changes by its genius br br i don't go out to movies very often anymore due to the high ticket price and the <UNK> of getting parking paying outrageous <UNK> <UNK> etc but i usually make exceptions when it's starring someone i really love or concerning something of the the same variety the pick of destiny was so good that i have no <UNK> going back to see it again when it releases <UNK> and i plan on convincing all of my friends to go too last week we saw <UNK> and loved it but this is honest to goodness ten times better for anyone who truly loves rock music and comedic brilliance see this film these <UNK> talent is so great you should have no <UNK> supporting their cause you will not be disappointed and the rock <UNK> will smile upon you <UNK>
<START> without doubt one of the worst films ever made <UNK> and without structure tension or story the film <UNK> on the thin premise of putting together a show conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their <UNK> and dialogue is random and incidental everything is put together in a <UNK> order and often stepping out feels more like a deleted scenes reel than an actual movie the film seems to exist merely as a showcase for <UNK> and totally random <UNK> musical numbers <UNK> winters can be seen in the far superior epic <UNK> and the real <UNK> can be found in the showtime release of <UNK> duck the movie
<START> i remember thinking that due to the cast the subject matter and the director i was going to love this movie br br stepping into the theatre and taking my seat i was like a <UNK> <UNK> as my anticipation for the opening scene built br br i was not disappointed with the opening and felt that i was truly going to love this movie br br if you haven't seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes might be seen as a spoiler please stop reading i'm not going to give away anything really important but it might be seen as such so that is the warning br br spoiler may be included below beware br br i think that the first scene that really hit me as just utterly ridiculous was the russian space station scene i mean honestly <UNK> a <UNK> with no real prior warning and then to simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the entire thing to just explode br br while all of this is possible it seemed to me to be way over the top i'm not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy acting the silly view of the russian technology or just the campy attitude of the scene itself br br it only got worse for me after that because then we endure what seemed like 2 hours of constant super loud explosions in space you know that place where there is no sound because it's a <UNK> br br but the coup de grace for me honestly was the gun scene spoiler possibility earlier in the movie we see bruce willis <UNK> apart their land vehicle the vehicle that they will use to drive around in when they get there and to help them <UNK> when he is told that this is what they will be using he is taking pieces off and complaining about it because much of what's on it is heavy and not required for what they are doing br br so then as we are wandering onto the <UNK> we see that they have <UNK> to add a massive <UNK> like gun to the vehicles you know standard <UNK> fare is to have heavy <UNK> on all space missions in case you know aliens or something br br i could have taken the explosive 2 hours the silly russian space station <UNK> scene the cheesy love scene near the end the bruce willis character being nothing more than most of his other past characters but the steve <UNK> going mad and shooting the space gun all over the place and causing havoc damage well that threw the entire thing over the top for me br br save your money and time and avoid this movie if you want a good meteor movie see deep impact if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects see space <UNK> but no matter what avoid this flick
<START> this wonderful movie really takes the time to step back and tell the story without words the end of the movie contains almost no dialogue but what is in the minds of the characters is always perfectly clear you know the film is not going to have a happy ending but you leave the film feeling hopeful
<START> this film's a big bore it has a plenty of predictable plots endless sentiments from the start it starts good with a classy number but seems lost <UNK> br br <UNK> on screen chemistry works out really good a good part by <UNK> why include in it he disappears totally after a good half an hour proves his wit again by timing comedy br br tunes sure will last for sometime but he could have done better what ever be the <UNK> still it's worth watching once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time pass
<START> this movie moves and inspire you it's like you are one of the family just to see and witness life during the depression era makes you feel humble and grateful jonathan silverman delivered well so convincing and very witty a must see for teens
<START> during the sci fi <UNK> marathon of january <UNK> 1999 this episode was the last one aired in the 20th century in my time zone eastern it was new year's eve and when the clown starts singing we're here because we're here because we're here because we're here i realized that this was clever nod to it being new year's eve because that tune is also the tune to old lang coincidence we will never know br br i love this story for the little touches the tear on the <UNK> the antics of the clown and the hit yourself in the head ending this and the art <UNK> santa <UNK> are the only ones that are about christmas br br my personal top five episodes after five characters 1 the hunt 2 the after hours 3 the <UNK> 4 the lonely 5 little girl lost
<START> first off i'm an american i haven't seen any comments on imdb about this series yet from a u s viewer secondly i work in the television business in development so i <UNK> in much of the <UNK> that comes out of american broadcast programming unit one is an example of television that's a <UNK> to what i would <UNK> as '70s style scripting feature wise namely those films made by young who had free <UNK> to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow for <UNK> character development it <UNK> more along the lines of stellar british dramas like cracker and prime suspect as well as <UNK> brilliant <UNK> unit one features stand alone cases that are committed then solved each week the mysteries aren't extraordinary or particularly <UNK> they usually center around one single twist <UNK> in generally at the 40 minute mark and resolution is neatly wrapped up in the 15 minutes thereafter what makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features main characters that you are hooked on and find <UNK> by episode 2 these are real breathing alive characters that have personal <UNK> yet it's not a talky <UNK> type of <UNK> that american <UNK> such as <UNK> <UNK> or desperate <UNK> <UNK> out these are realistic individuals whose <UNK> unfold <UNK> over the course of the series as if you work with them on a daily basis after the mindless decade of and criminal minds along with their subsequent <UNK> it's refreshing to actually sit down to watch friends you want to spend time with as is the case with unit one the banter the <UNK> wooden dialogue and the over the top <UNK> that those american series i mentioned <UNK> us with each week are absurd compared to the nuance and the quiet <UNK> you get with this remarkable danish series i'm on episode 7 of the first season but i've already bought all four seasons and am in for the long <UNK> if you need explosions and <UNK> <UNK> up <UNK> along with music by the who and fast cutting <UNK> lit <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> action with <UNK> like main characters as your main <UNK> of television drama viewing i suggest you stay away from this series if you are an adult with a <UNK> for subtle poignant thoughtful and yes sometimes straight forward <UNK> crime dramas i urge you to check this show out
<START> this is among one of many usa attempts of <UNK> a old classic british tv show that's more famous than this one from what i see none of you haven't mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a tv 50's 60's called secret agent man the original secret agent man starred the great patrick <UNK> the prisoner braveheart ice station <UNK> the phantom etc a man who was <UNK> to be the first james bond but he turned it down because <UNK> was a very <UNK> man and he considered james <UNK> bed <UNK> and violent ways to be against his values br br this show was done in black and white and it's a pity for those who haven't seen it you are missing out on a lot the character mr <UNK> played in secret agent man was named drake and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial tv series called the prisoner the character he played in the prisoner was that of a agent who's identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him what he does know is that his <UNK> want to know the reasons behind his <UNK> from the british secret service and on this island the <UNK> don't have names but they are referred to by numbers and character is assigned a number which is 6 it was <UNK> that his prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in secret agent man but <UNK> himself <UNK> this br br there is the <UNK> famous theme song that the original secret agent man <UNK> it was written by johnny rivers a famous 50's and 60's pop musician and from what i read some of you are actually think that the song comes from this version of the show you're very wrong about that it was <UNK> and it comes from the original tv series so let me help to set the facts straight to those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid well in england it was actually called danger man and in the us it was <UNK> secret agent man for such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first aired br br granted this current show has little to do with the original no such main character named drake in this one and i guess they did their best to make this show their version of secret agent man but it does use the <UNK> version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a <UNK> albeit however inferior <UNK> version of the original series
<START> bela lugosi is a real <UNK> in the early 1930s he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula yet again and again he made lousy decisions regarding his career perhaps he had a bad agent perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy regardless he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film ranging from excellent horror films such as the <UNK> to big budget flicks like <UNK> to grade z flicks for the <UNK> and <UNK> of studios interestingly enough although he agreed to do this terrible film he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein as for this movie it is a very silly an <UNK> produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing lugosi spends much of the movie murdering <UNK> not a bad thing at all but at the end we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the american looking men he killed were actually japanese the funniest part of this is during a flashback you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to american like men when the camera <UNK> them the men are clearly asian but on all the other non close up shots they are all very western looking many with bald heads they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men i suspect the plot must have <UNK> a re write and this might account for the obvious mistake or it could just be shoddy production values and editing in fact early in the film they show a street scene in the city and all the cars circa 1942 are old model t <UNK> obviously from stock footage the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull unlike plan 9 from outer space it's hard to laugh at the <UNK> just be put to sleep by it
<START> have you ever watched a film when after it's conclusion your left <UNK> what in the world it was all about well say hello to scream baby scream it's not that the story's complex or anything like that it's just that it plays out in three completely different <UNK> 1 a fun 60s drug movie 2 a much <UNK> soap opera and 3 a horror flick with very little to scream about much to my surprise i've found out that it was written by one of my all time favorites larry cohen well i guess even the best have to learn through trial and error br br playing out much like something from h g lewis only with lesser fx this bad film does have it's <UNK> for most of it's short running time there's a pretty cool jazz score to be heard and there are a couple of memorable scenes one of those being where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice long <UNK> bike ride to the <UNK> the camera tricks the director uses to indicate their <UNK> state is just plain retarded but amusing trust me when i tell you there's no need to run out of the house to catch this one
<START> this was such a beautiful film such an amazing performance from joseph and brad very <UNK> written and performed a must see i cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie this is a movie that every family should sit down with their children to watch it does teach us all a very important lesson in life and how we should be approaching the harsh subject of aids how we should be teaching our children to cope with it and people around them not only with aids but with any <UNK> illness i hadn't even heard of this movie until i through t v one day and happen to run across it i recommend everyone to watch this just don't forget your box of <UNK> more movies should be made like this one extremely heartwarming
<START> to this day i have never seen elizabeth <UNK> in anything else because of the <UNK> of this movie poorly acted poorly plotted and <UNK> <UNK> it took place in a chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club spoiler ahead br br spoiler her blues solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the intro into it <UNK> leaves without singing the <UNK> was as dumb as a post the children her character was <UNK> were <UNK> and well before the movie's end i was wishing for something horrible to happen to all of them br br i have to say though there is one special thing about this movie it takes a lot for a movie to offend me but this <UNK> piece of tripe did what <UNK> the phantom menace and <UNK> could not make me sick to my stomach
<START> what a shame what a terrible shame the table was set the <UNK> were lit the guests had arrived and then br br well nothing really just pretentious drivel it could have been great ok maybe not great but it could have been very good all the elements were there but at the end of the day the bottle was empty no lightning how that happened is a mystery with everything at the director's <UNK> br br the story was quite brave although it certainly needed considerable work with possibly several finishing <UNK> to fix the story and <UNK> up the characters a lot the only thing that was consistently and constantly and unnecessarily tight was the cinematography but i'll get to that but the direction was lousy the acting was just that a c t i n g with a heavy side of cheese and lots of ham and then the cinematography br br well that was something to behold but only if you are in film <UNK> cinematography 101 how to never ever use a professional movie camera under any circumstances obviously the student had fallen asleep through part of the introduction and only heard use a professional movie camera then <UNK> back to la la land as the sentence finished off br br what can i say amateurish and pretentious to the last i can only see this film meant to appeal as a chick flick because it's supposed to be sad but then falls flat and just ends up being <UNK> as an excuse for a movie so that even those wouldn't be fooled by this br br ps i felt bad for miss diaz she's a lot better at her craft than what this film allowed her to be even though she was totally totally miscast actually i feel sorry for everyone in this movie except the director and you guessed it the cinematographer i say against the wall for them when the revolution comes ' ok not really after all it was only a movie but perhaps a good <UNK> and <UNK> and running out of town might be more satisfying or at the very least a lot more entertaining br br
<START> no movie could ever do justice to command of the english language but they did a pretty good job here lucas is exactly the way i <UNK> him in the book as is chick what the movie couldn't really go into was how wasn't liked by the <UNK> people either because he was equally as stubborn not that it is a bad thing but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world yet i got the feeling it was white <UNK> racism that started it and it <UNK> over into <UNK> society until that became his attitude toward everyone br br the best part of the movie is that you get to see county actually <UNK> <UNK> exactly as <UNK> wrote about it the film was made when <UNK> was alive and writing it doesn't look that much different today because of this alone the movie is worth a watch considering it is filmed in backyard a true must see for <UNK> fans
<START> i went it to see this film with caution a <UNK> comedy didn't seem consistent having a brother who is has attempted suicide and seeing the <UNK> that has caused our whole family i know first hand how <UNK> it can be to deal with this issue i must say this film deals with it in a way that allows the viewer inside someone who is suffering and simply doesn't know why or how to stop it while the film is not perfect it respects the subject matter and more importantly makes it accessible for the masses i know for our family humor has helped us through a lot of the pain and max and grace is just what it <UNK> to be a <UNK> comedy it's funny and i also felt that characters were real and vibrant it's also extremely intelligent yet simple it cuts to the chase and i appreciate that i give it a 9 and will recommend it
<START> this story starts at the end so the film's opening credits advise us unfortunately that's not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical b science fiction movie of the 1950's the story is dreary the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget as was often the case in those days br br the story could have covered any situation where people are taking <UNK> in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci fi story br br the scenery consisted of a few rocks <UNK> and smoke oh yes there was a pool of water as well someone wore a rubber mask with a <UNK> like face and what looked like <UNK> br br written by lou who penned several sci fi stories around that time including the she creature and it <UNK> the world the filming was completed in a matter of days not allowing the actors time to develop their characters to better advantage the low budget <UNK> also prevented this film reaching its potential it could have been a much better film than it turned out to be br br mike <UNK> and richard brought some life to the film but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say 'i enjoyed that <UNK> richard acting career began in <UNK> he starred with gregory peck and deborah kerr in an affair to remember and later became more well known on television in the series hawaii five o and the flying doctor series br br directed by roger corman who has many films to his credit both as a director and producer he has made some good films and is still making them he became very well known for his direction of films from the stories of edgar allan poe often starring vincent price he also made other low budget films some were good and entertaining for one reason or another and most were much better than this br br i would not recommend this film to anyone br br br br <UNK> september 2007
<START> if you listen to the <UNK> god satan then you know what's going on with split i found that watching the film under the influence of <UNK> helped to deal with audio video from fantastic editing job the plot was only important from second to second the acid helped to interact with the sounds <UNK> and general pace of this masterpiece don't bother writing about something out of your reach there just isn't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it's most raw amateur level i dare anyone to make a movie that can equally mess with my head and change the way i look at visual arts and the world's reality not to mention the many realities that haven't yet been explored by this humans mind i love the vision of chris shaw i also appreciate the <UNK> film the <UNK> by e <UNK>
<START> being of descent i was happily surprised when watching the movie i have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in but when watching the movie and reading the book the <UNK> bits of history were filled it is all true the italians would sing the <UNK> and the <UNK> that rock the island so often the <UNK> in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion if you haven't seen the movie go and watch it and read the book it is not only a love story and yes there were plenty of italians in love with women in fact boat loads of women were taken to italy after the war it is a true depiction of history
<START> <UNK> davis <UNK> <UNK> travels to tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister karen sarah michelle <UNK> and gets caught up in the same mysterious curse that has killed so many people with a group of others she tries to solve and end the curse for good br br the grudge 2 <UNK> everything from the first one and it produces only a couple of scares the first grudge was an average movie at best the premise was decent but the acting was wooden and some of the scenes were really ridiculous the grudge 2 is even more silly and less scary than the original also scary movie 4 has made it nearly impossible to take these films seriously and i had trouble keeping a straight face during the scary scenes which should encourage laughter more than fear how takashi <UNK> messed up his own franchise is <UNK> yet he succeeded at creating a decent atmosphere unfortunately he kept the film at a slow pace with a bunch of dull characters and lame scare tactics clearly he did this movie for money and i'm glad it failed br br the screenplay was pretty bad mainly because it made no sense and they didn't develop the characters at all in the movie there were three different stories going on and each of them were somehow related to the grudge the connections were weak and a bunch of people were killed without a real reason they don't explain the rules of the curse very well and it ended up being a bit of blood bath because of everyone dying although the pg 13 rating kept things from getting interesting so even some of the death scenes were pretty lame the dialog was weak and none of the characters were likable or developed well enough to truly care about br br the acting was on par with everything else and it was a lot worse compared to the first one <UNK> <UNK> was annoyingly wooden she moved on screen very slowly and all of her emotions seemed fake sarah michelle <UNK> was okay although she just had a cameo jennifer <UNK> gave the best performance she had a few good scenes and was kind of effective <UNK> <UNK> was okay a little bland the rest were either horrible or just too forgettable to mention overall the grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel it lacked a lot of things and it's not worth watching rating 4 10
<START> for producer david o <UNK> no one director would ever do hence on a farewell to arms 1957 we get two Â– charles <UNK> and john huston though both men were quite accomplished in their own right neither could make head or tail of this disastrous remake of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in general has never translated well from book to screen but under <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> it into his next with the <UNK> the <UNK> is both <UNK> and <UNK> at this point in <UNK> career he was no longer the <UNK> who could take box office poison and <UNK> it into gone with the wind tired <UNK> minus his studio and with an impending sense that his second marriage to jennifer jones might have been a mistake <UNK> handed the creative <UNK> of this flick over to fox studios Â– but he kept enough of himself in it to become a damn <UNK> on the set br br by now one is or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse <UNK> <UNK> jennifer jones and her soldier hero lt <UNK> henry rock hudson their passion is supposed to serve as the force for what is essentially a war tale with <UNK> thrown in for good measure but the chemistry between hudson and jones is both turgid and dull in the final reel jones' facial <UNK> during child birth are so bad i am surprised that neither director <UNK> to cut them from the general release part of the problem with jones is that at thirty eight she's far too wise to play the optimistic <UNK> with any great conviction yet older actresses have frequently managed to make an audience forget <UNK> in age not so with jones one is painfully aware that she doesn't fit the bill in either acting chops or years invested on this planet <UNK> <UNK> charm is hopelessly out of touch with to <UNK> of an army soldier whose heart is broken but head remains strong the supporting cast is <UNK> with such <UNK> as <UNK> de <UNK> and <UNK> but these are wasted bits of nonsense that in no way reflect upon the <UNK> talents of either actor and best made evident elsewhere in their <UNK> of film making br br the <UNK> picture element for a farewell to arms looks good enough though there's just a bit too much film grain present in certain scenes for this <UNK> liking overall colors are subtle and muted though balanced in <UNK> with the <UNK> color <UNK> employed at this time some <UNK> is evident flesh tones don't appear very natural contrast levels are a tad weak blacks are generally solid whites are almost clean there's not much to recommend this film <UNK> it's essentially a <UNK> picture with gun shots as a backdrop there are no extras
<START> i watched the first few moments on tcm a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes i saw it listed on the schedule at the <UNK> theatre in <UNK> <UNK> and i <UNK> i would make the 40 minute drive the <UNK> is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the <UNK> still shut yes they have <UNK> they opened as the fox <UNK> <UNK> began to play when the best of everything appeared in huge pink letters spread against the new york city <UNK> i knew i was right for waiting br br i <UNK> this movie up there were so many little moments that added to the look and feel of the movie when hope lange walks into the <UNK> office for the first time the titles of the magazines published there are <UNK> on the glass the teenager and <UNK> joan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without her outfit the way the camera <UNK> to indicate how crazy <UNK> parker was becoming it was almost <UNK> at one point how hope lange kept living at that <UNK> flat she shared with the others even though she obviously was making a lot more money than at the beginning of the film guess it was too <UNK> for a single gal to live alone br br hope lange was so beautiful so was <UNK> parker and how about mark <UNK> in a non speaking role i fell in love with him when i was a kid watching lost in space br br seeing this gem on the big screen <UNK> me to plan another trek down to the <UNK> to see the old dark house incidentally i bought a small <UNK> and popcorn at the <UNK> stand and i was taken <UNK> when the worker asked me for two bucks
<START> let freedom ring was probably made with the best of intentions but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final product br br the folks at a western town where the <UNK> is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant <UNK> workers working on the <UNK> being <UNK> by <UNK> baron edward arnold there are a few <UNK> and <UNK> whose land stands in the <UNK> path and these folks are dealt with <UNK> by <UNK> hired men one man who won't give in is lionel barrymore whose son is coming home from <UNK> a lawyer and ready to take up the cause br br only nelson eddy decides the best way to fight is to go zorro on the bad guys but other than charles <UNK> no one knows he's the <UNK> a very interesting choice of names by the way br br what <UNK> done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east getting the immigrants to vote <UNK> idea is simple if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy arnold is they'll vote with the original <UNK> and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst he kidnaps newspaper editor raymond <UNK> and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> and distributed br br the <UNK> workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants not the irish working west or the chinese working east as history has it it's a real united nations working on <UNK> <UNK> the workers are kept in line by <UNK> victor mclaglen and nelson has the <UNK> task of beating some sense into him like john wayne did in the quiet man br br of all the films that starred <UNK> and nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo this was the worst of what they did at mgm nelson is about to be <UNK> along with barrymore for crimes that are <UNK> at best but certainly nothing worth being hung for and virginia bruce who plays the <UNK> girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of my country <UNK> of <UNK> that the immigrants join in with in the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters arnold quite <UNK> packs up and leaves town to build his <UNK> somewhere else br br i kid you not that's the ending here just what is the message vote with the <UNK> and lose your jobs with arnold but somehow you'll get by here br br i do wonder some times if 20 years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy <UNK> of the west while some towns where the <UNK> has come through that are now cities that the good citizens of that town haven't <UNK> about what nelson eddy did if they did they're probably running him out on a <UNK> br br nelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a <UNK> to the immigrants written by <UNK> where else but here the song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country too bad it didn't have a better <UNK> br br the almost <UNK> blonde virginia bruce i'm sure is dubbed here and i'm sure <UNK> macdonald was just as happy she wasn't accompanying nelson on this trip west
<START> i have a friend that works at blockbuster and he gets 5 free movie <UNK> a week so one day as we were <UNK> the <UNK> for something interesting i stumbled across 18 weapons of kung fu and judging by the box alone this movie seemed pretty <UNK> but nonetheless we gave into temptation and rented it <UNK> it was free and thank god it was this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen the budget must have been a <UNK> and a piece of string the plot was ridiculous the only mention of the 18 weapons is that there is some book that teaches the ways of the 18 weapons that some bad guy is after and thats it there <UNK> even any weapon fighting in this movie that and the action sequences are just flat out bad 9 times out of 10 the other guy's punches and kicks come about a foot away from landing on the other guy's and there are many times when the the movie will skip frames a result of ridiculously poor editing the dubbing is as well laughable and it is hardly even understandable and we wont even get into the acting the ending will definitely leave you saying wtf however to be fair i must mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent and the old guy is a mad <UNK> but thats about it thankfully i didnt have to pay for this movie but i guess at least now i know exactly how bad a movie can actually be
<START> this looks decidedly like the amateur hour how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etc it's all wrong why lance <UNK> accepted this will remain one of the great mysteries of cinema maybe he was in dire need for money or maybe be was under the influence of some illegal drug br br it is pointless trying to explain you what this movie's about it deals with the big foot legend but done in the worst possible manner in fact this stinker <UNK> like a direct to video release br br avoid at all costs 0 out of 10
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br one time heroin addict frankie machine frank sinatra gets out of prison to his bumbling <UNK> partner <UNK> arnold <UNK> <UNK> of a wife <UNK> parker and bit on the side molly kim novak he's trying to make it big as a drummer in a band but until his big break comes along he's stuck doing the only other thing he was any good at other than being a <UNK> dealing cards in high stakes games and try as he might even prison hasn't <UNK> him of his addiction to the devil's drug causing him to lie to and <UNK> all those around him and driving him to desperate <UNK> to feed his habit his yearning to come off it is his only motivation towards a happy ending br br when people think of frank sinatra they generally think of classic high pitched songs like under my skin new york new york and it had to be you but <UNK> anyone forget he was actually a renowned actor too and if his performance in the acclaimed from here to eternity wasn't enough he will also be remembered for this cutting edge drama dealing with what was at the time the ultra taboo subject of drug abuse br br the film is often listed as one of the first to feature graphic heroin use probably the reason behind the 15 <UNK> in a time when it was a subject that was still very much pushed underground in his portrayal of the main protagonist sinatra is fine perfectly conveying the despair desperation and sincerity of a man losing every second chance that is being given to him his cold turkey scene is much more intense than ewan <UNK> in <UNK> the first co star to make an impression is parker as demanding <UNK> <UNK> of a wife using her husband's guilt and sense of duty to all the effect she can novak as his secret lover still manages some strong moments but is less of a star than parker does his usual comic relief thing as the bumbling sidekick who <UNK> the leading man around with his <UNK> new york accent br br director otto preminger does allow the pace to drag a bit sometimes but this is still a <UNK> absorbing film all the way with plenty of unexpected twists and turns and which should be admired for being one of the first films to bring such a grim subject so <UNK> to life
<START> is a bunch of short stories with an only common point the little town of in this film the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a <UNK> the result is a strange film as it has any main character the movie spends about 20 min to each tale other than the town of any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring it was by far the best film of the year in spain but well that's not saying too much the only good thing of the film is the precious scenarios it is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more enjoyable to spend the time watching the scenario rather than being aware of the story
<START> <UNK> <UNK> folks i'm not going to lie to you is a one or two hit wonder but what a film it almost excuses suspect zero i'm also not going to pretend to understand it completely half of what makes it what it is is trying to second guess what the hell they are doing on the screen because of the <UNK> br br richard says it is as if a cult had re <UNK> for real three bible stories creation the <UNK> and <UNK> torture and death on that's not a bad description but there seems to be more to it than the seemingly one to one religious br br there's an <UNK> theme right up near the surface note that toward the end after the of the landscape there are large <UNK> not unlike those on a construction site oh no he's going to say look at how people are <UNK> mother nature one rarely sees a dead metaphor in action and with this much <UNK> but to see it acted out is way than language implies br br and yeah if you just want something to sync with a death metal soundtrack it does have the requisite atrocities but as for myself and others like me it's an important art film that should merit a <UNK> collection release ranks right up there with <UNK> <UNK> br br ray
<START> the stage star grace hayes stars in this obscure little film after years of being on the stage she is going to visit a small college town to check up on her son who is being raised by his grandfather the kid doesn't know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local <UNK> shop he's a <UNK> jerk part of the problem is that he is a college clown the other part is that he's really spoiled br br interestingly it turns out that mom is really quite wealthy and has been not only funding her son's life but is a <UNK> <UNK> to the college so she has the idea of forcing the young man to mature she talks to the man who's raising peter and has his <UNK> cut off completely hoping he'll rise to the occasion it also turns out that she puts the <UNK> to the school because she thinks all these kids need to stop playing around and be more responsible br br now here's where it gets pretty dumb to show that they know the value of hard work she hires a bunch of them to sing and dance at the <UNK> shop she just purchased talk about contrived what happens next is like a long and not particularly good talent show or perhaps a poor man's version of a judy garland mickey rooney musical i'd suggest the kids try to do something else to earn money or perhaps sing and dance until people pay them to stop i know i would pay them br br considering that the talent is far from talented peter is a bad actor and his change from <UNK> to responsible adult is almost <UNK> the whole thing is a bit hard to take not a very good film by any sane standard this is an obscure film that should have stayed obscure br br by the way it is interesting that ms son in the film peter is actually her real life son the only problem with that is that peter <UNK> hayes is a truly awful actor he's not handsome enough to be a leading man and he comes off as either dull and uninteresting or downright obnoxious in particular all the stupid impressions he does are really bad and he has the charisma of the <UNK> that you <UNK> off <UNK> despite this terrible performance he did go on to have a reasonably successful acting career who would have believed it if you'd seen him in <UNK> boom <UNK> because here he's about as welcome as the <UNK> plague
<START> i'm not a disney fan at all but i happen to be in orlando for a friend's wedding so my traveling partner and i went to disney for a few days i haven't seen a good 3 d effect in well ever so i usually try to stay away from these <UNK> the 3 d effect in this was so good i'm a grown man of <UNK> and even i wanted to try and reach out and touch it's that good word of advice at the end look to the back of the theater on the wall put it like this the first time i saw it the effect wasn't working so i told my friend it would have been nice if my friend said that's exactly what happens it's not working for some reason it's an awesome show you will not be disappointed
<START> spoilers beautifully photographed slice of life home front wwii love story with norman <UNK> paintings in the beginning and end of the movie about how a war hero is not just someone who kills for his country but is also someone who thinks for himself and isn't <UNK> by the war propaganda that's constantly <UNK> into his head <UNK> out of the marine <UNK> marion jan michael vincent is kicked out of boot camp after five weeks and forced to put on a baby blue marine uniform that shows that he just didn't have it to make the <UNK> and <UNK> wherever he went as he's going home to st louis and terrified what his family whom his dad was in the marine <UNK> in wwi would think of him in that he couldn't cut the <UNK> as a us marine br br stopping in a bar and finds sitting next to him is a marine member of the <UNK> and deadly marine <UNK> richard gere whom a <UNK> <UNK> buys a beer making conversation with richard <UNK> is shocked to find out that not only is he being sent back to the pacific theater after all the battles he fought in and combat <UNK> he got but the totally gray hair and mid thirty looking richard is going to be 21 next month that's what being in the marine <UNK> and wwii did to him buying <UNK> a number of drinks richard takes the drunk baby blue outside and knocks him out taking his baby blues and leaves his impressive us marine uniform with some money in it for <UNK> to <UNK> br br as soon as <UNK> puts on <UNK> uniform that fits him perfectly he's confronted by this big drunken us <UNK> who calls himself <UNK> head wanting to have a fist fight with the marine <UNK> <UNK> doing everything he can to avoid trouble is forced by <UNK> head to belt him after he himself <UNK> two beer bottle over his <UNK> head to get himself <UNK> up for the big bout between marine <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> head <UNK> incredibly floors the big <UNK> headed <UNK> knocking him out cold with one punch i guess the trick is not hitting him in on top of his head a stunned <UNK> tell his <UNK> heads fellow g <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> to this small town of <UNK> notices this us military camp for japanese americans who are there because their considered a threat to us security it's later in the movie that <UNK> shows everyone what a real hero he is not who the people in the town think he is by <UNK> his life to save one of the hated <UNK> who <UNK> together with two of his friends escaped from the camp where the hell did they think they were going anyway <UNK> <UNK> his life by saving the scared to death japanese american from drowning in the dangerous <UNK> outside the town <UNK> in his actions taught the people of that not all <UNK> even those who are american citizens are bad and <UNK> <UNK> screaming <UNK> like they were thought by the <UNK> magazines and movies at the time to think that they were br br <UNK> strikes up a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress at the local diner rose <UNK> <UNK> who's just crazy about him that even <UNK> at first thinks that it's his uniform not him that impressed her later when <UNK> admits to rose that he's not what she and her parents think a us marine <UNK> that he is rose had by then gotten to know the sweet and caring washed out marine so well that it didn't matter to her at all what he was supposed to be a marine a <UNK> or a post office worker it was what was inside his heart that really counted br br the film has a number of touching and beautiful scenes in it between <UNK> and rose that shows how movies used to be made years ago without all the sex and profanity that we see and hear in movies today that involved two people in love with each other br br the way the film accurately not phony <UNK> shows the true feelings of average americans back then in 1943 about the war in general and japanese in particular couldn't have been done in more authentic and accurate as well as good taste baby <UNK> marine does it's best not to be too politically correct in not showing the hero's or leading actors and actresses in the film having the same feelings and ideas back then during wwii as most people have now which would have come across as phony as a three dollar bill to those people watching the film who lived during those historic and <UNK> times when the film was to take place
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is by far the most interesting and insane <UNK> to ever live his baseball career was <UNK> in absurd <UNK> brilliant <UNK> and pure <UNK> violence every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty so of course the film about him deals with none of that instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al <UNK> now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory as <UNK> himself <UNK> even further into paranoid <UNK> as years progressed and the stories of his crazed <UNK> even as a senior are shocking even by today's <UNK> standards but instead of focusing on these events which i guess was simply too interesting the film is a pseudo <UNK> road film with clichÃ©d a clichÃ©d plot that will cause any <UNK> <UNK> fan to cry <UNK> tears br br tommy lee jones does quite well as a <UNK> <UNK> but somehow manages to <UNK> his cartoon most stories about <UNK> are barely believable but to make him even <UNK> seems both impossible and unnecessary robert <UNK> portraying the writer al <UNK> is a dark <UNK> of nonexistent talent he sucks the life out of every scene trying to make this film his own <UNK> there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore <UNK> doesn't count it's barely a show even the played out inevitable role <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that don't sound like a poor book on tape narration voice br br for all the awful writing and bland film making on display there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting it's from the same film is near impossible a hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying <UNK> psychology and brutal <UNK> while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance the camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster <UNK> every slide hit and tackle are rendered even more <UNK> due to enhanced sound and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the master player it makes the viewer <UNK> over the possibilities of a true biopic of <UNK> in his prime with the same actor it's worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone just to see what could have been br br i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of <UNK> <UNK> and wanting it to be something it isn't but to make such boring <UNK> movie about this maniac is nonsensical i'm glad ron career has <UNK> ever since
<START> this movie started out as a quite decent looking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didn't manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all it's supposed to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting br br to be frank the actors weren't all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your days br br overall a watchable movie but it doesn't add anything and once you've finished watching it it wont last long until its already forgotten br br the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it 4 out of 10 if you still want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch <UNK> on instead br br
<START> this movie was such a waste of my money it was disgusting as well as disturbing honestly i would never recommend this movie to anyone who thinks of a movie where a girl blows her dog seriously it was a waste of my time i kept watching the movie hoping it would get better and a plot would emerge but that never happened i'd rate the movie an f this movie should have been rated r for its disturbing nature i would never let children of any age see this movie this movie sucks this movie is horrible this movie was a waste of my time i could have spent the night doing some worth my time instead of renting this movie this movie was a waste of gas money to get to the store and definitely a waste of two dollars to watch it pretty much no one should watch this movie this movie should be banned and burned
<START> i always enjoy watching this cartoon with <UNK> trying to catch <UNK> on a train rather than at <UNK> house it's actually a standard fare but entertaining especially when <UNK> pulls the <UNK> stop <UNK> one of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train when you watch this over and over like my little boy did who loves trains which is why he liked it so much you begin to notice some things br br throughout this short the position of the <UNK> car changes on the train either 3rd 4th or <UNK> and in long shots not at all the engine has either the number or or none at all the coal tender has either the number 99 or the letters s p q r on it or no number or letters at all the <UNK> carry the s p q r without the in long shots and then in closeups it has the words <UNK> and western br br all of this doesn't <UNK> with the story but the production details were obviously not looked into very carefully br br still this cartoon is among my favorites with <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> even worse then the incredibly boring the <UNK> of emily rose it started off <UNK> and right up until the mom said to the dad see i knew she was possessed in an i told you so voice it was a terrible line spoken badly and it <UNK> the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie every family member has an issue from the past with the priest the dad starts to <UNK> everyone of either liking his wife or actually having an affair with her culminating with him killing his buddy then himself in the obvious instant <UNK> after he realizes his friend hadn't slept with his wife after all people are dying others are coming under possession and by this point most viewers don't even care anymore except for their employee <UNK> none of the characters in this movie was actually likable making it hard to care about any of them the acting was terrible and the writing even worse glad i saw it for free although i feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time i lost
<START> this movie travels <UNK> on 8 <UNK> 2 kisses and 100 clichÃ©s than should be possible yet it still works brilliant br br as i was driving home from the theater i tried to figure out how it got away with movie <UNK> like the pages of a novel <UNK> blowing across a beach or the impossible series of <UNK> <UNK> without the entire audience standing up and screaming i've seen that a million times before and you've pushed beyond the edge of believability but the actors were so enchanting and the screen so filled with believable extras that i forgot to care a friend who saw it with me said it transported him to paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized we were still in indiana br br overall a romantic comedy thriller with subtlety wit and <UNK>
<START> i really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star because the film has so many eye rolling lines that it's almost worth the price of the rental br br the acting if you want to call it that is so stilted and contrived that it makes ed <UNK> actors appear life like sammy the lone black character must be husband in real life because he appears in her other films but he has zero acting ability his lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery though i suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character his old man make up in her other turkey pushed to the limit is no budget junior high school quality with <UNK> ball <UNK> and white <UNK> painted hair br br i cannot <UNK> anyone actually buying this video unless people like to throw their own mystery science theater parties and need a copy of something like this on hand it really is beyond fear it's actually beyond funny
<START> this film would have put the typical hollywood <UNK> to shame the emotions portrayed are subdued and understated in a very comfortable fashion the plot is cliche enough with a lead role having <UNK> disease this is not a spoiler and was well established quite early into the movie the method of execution is somehow unique from most love stories you ever saw not even a kiss was being <UNK> and yet you will feel the enormous current of love between the two leads initially i assumed this <UNK> on emotions to be something to the typical eastern values but later decided against it br br this film is so understated that if you compare it with movies like cinema <UNK> <UNK> would have felt overtly manipulative by comparison so it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea br br after watching the film i have this strong feeling that holly wood love movies or love movies all around to be accurate have been <UNK> romance or passion and label it as love i am sure we all have our own <UNK> and i wouldn't say these qualities are <UNK> <UNK> but i would venture to say that the movie will let you wonder if there is any added dimension you have with you loved one br br it's very obvious that i enjoy this movie a lot considering the fact that the movie is so plain in appearance it is <UNK> one of the more cinematic movie i saw lately
<START> <UNK> in the curse of the were is the same type of animation and from the same creators of but the story now is other wallace a <UNK> who loves cheese and his smart dog <UNK> who is always helping wallace in his problems are trying to keep the <UNK> away from everybody's <UNK> since there is in their town an <UNK> giant <UNK> competition but when wallace tries an invention he did to make the <UNK> avoids <UNK> the one who is going to be cursed is him before watching this movie i didn't knew that these two characters already existed and were famous i loved <UNK> and i think he is one of the coolest dogs i already saw br br aka wallace <UNK> a <UNK> brazil
<START> after spending five years in prison dr thomas reed played by the <UNK> vincent <UNK> himself to <UNK> <UNK> and winds up <UNK> bar he soon meets the <UNK> angel faced sunny alexandra <UNK> you are wicked he tells her you have no idea she replies as she her <UNK> comfortable screw and <UNK> drags on her <UNK> reed finds himself <UNK> in the violent troubles of her family and the femme fatale story unfolds set against the <UNK> and desperation of the oil <UNK> western town br br <UNK> direction great performances superb <UNK> work and some lust scenes that <UNK> like the sun in <UNK>
<START> <UNK> directed by boris who sees eight friends experiencing a night of terror when a psycho killer dressed in a old <UNK> rubber mask and a <UNK> their party br br they say you can't judge a book by its cover but it appears that the same is not true of dvds i was in the mood for a really bad horror film last night and since the cover of <UNK> featured a <UNK> photo <UNK> image of the titular killer swinging an axe terrible <UNK> they even use the system <UNK> sand a definite design no no and credits featuring absolutely no one i had heard of i <UNK> it would be pretty lousy br br it was br br when a film <UNK> in at just under an hour long it really shouldn't waste too much time before getting to the action <UNK> however spends the first 20 minutes or so with its unlikable group of friends <UNK> in pointless games and extremely banal conversation anyone who actually stays with the film long enough for the killing to begin and i doubt most sane people would bother will be treated to several dreadful death scenes featuring amateurish gore loads of awful acting and a surprise ending that comes as no surprise if you've seen april <UNK> day then you'll guess what the twist is way before it is revealed br br <UNK> is uninspired <UNK> and almost unwatchable avoid
<START> i once saw a bit of this film and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars the result being that i agree basically the film begins with <UNK> the frog steve <UNK> telling all his muppet <UNK> that they have lost everything and he ends sitting depressed and possibly thinking about suicide on the <UNK> meanwhile in another world heaven angel daniel david arquette who had already been in muppets from space visits the <UNK> whoopi goldberg another reason i wanted to see the film to show that <UNK> really needs help in the flashbacks it shows <UNK> miss <UNK> eric <UNK> not the original and better frank oz <UNK> dave <UNK> <UNK> bear also <UNK> <UNK> the bill and all the other muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the christmas holiday and it all seems to be going well but the really mean rachel <UNK> joan cusack is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down and <UNK> is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen of course <UNK> fails the last time and <UNK> tells him that they are finished and she can officially take the theatre this is where daniel is sent as <UNK> guardian angel to try and help him but <UNK> is not in the mood and eventually ends up saying i wish i was never born obviously you can <UNK> the spoof of it's a wonderful life with <UNK> as the george <UNK> and cusack as the mr potter and in the end obviously <UNK> realises how much he means to everyone and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark also starring <UNK> as rizzo the rat and <UNK> <UNK> as dr <UNK> and <UNK> as dr teeth <UNK> the dog and swedish chef <UNK> as animal and <UNK> the only character who sounds similar to <UNK> version william h macy as glenn matthew <UNK> as luc <UNK> carson <UNK> molly shannon <UNK> sarah neil flynn john c <UNK> and judy <UNK> mel brooks as joe snow brian <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> jerry nelson as robin the frog <UNK> pops and <UNK> pepper and kevin clash as sam the eagle the most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of <UNK> <UNK> besides that and the well known faces in it not fantastic it was nominated the emmy for outstanding music and lyrics for the song everyone matters the muppets were number <UNK> on the 100 greatest pop culture icons adequate
<START> ok we were going along with the stereotypical bad <UNK> experience and explaining to our son adopted from russia that this was over the top acting and <UNK> so we could get to the dog playing soccer since he plays soccer but the last scene in which the dog goes back to his original owner put my son over the edge and he cried for 15 20 minutes he's been replaced this from an <UNK> child i do not recommend this movie to any family that has an adopted child it displays <UNK> <UNK> and adults badly and in the end even though they win the game the dog that the boy <UNK> with has to leave and this is too much please be <UNK> if you have any adopted children and beware families with <UNK> children because the impression of children who are adopted is not positive and paints a stereotype that is <UNK> and nasty the dog is cute but not enough to save our family's reaction to this movie
<START> sure it's hard being gay especially in the south we get it over and over again br br what stood out was that the film makers focused almost wholly on the more extreme characters in these small town gay bars the drag queens the seedy sleaze of a bar long closed and on a guy who was brutally murdered for being gay yet had nothing to do with either of the bars which were the focus of this film br br there were snippets of interviews from other people people viewers would perhaps be better able to relate to but they were <UNK> over practically <UNK> maybe shown in a glimpse in the background br br it would have been more interesting to me at least to hear the experiences of the more common gay men and women who were either <UNK> or otherwise by the experiences of a small town gay bar and or the absence of that community
<START> much about this movie was beautiful the acting the scenery and without a doubt <UNK> cinematography background showed through on the beautiful shots definitely worth watching as your attention will be captivated the entire time and it ends on just the right note br br the acting by newcomer jonathan was superb as one would think he was a pro acting since he was born he has gone on to act in other feature films but this starring role will always be remembered br br the film does have that academy award feel to it at times where it's slow and <UNK> and quiet so it's not a movie that a d d kids can sit through however the <UNK> feel of east bend and played out well as a 1940's era film
<START> a straight forward x file that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence rob <UNK> direction is crisp and sharp the episode looks just as fresh now as it did almost a decade ago david and gillian both give fine performances and both seem to <UNK> the lack of <UNK> it's a <UNK> x file that even non fans could happen upon and enjoy junior brown gives both the leads a run for their money during his scene with them he's so convincing that you could believe the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to bryan <UNK> is intense and energetic as patrick <UNK> he has since admitted in interviews that he knew next to nothing about the x files prior to this role a fact that makes his hit the floor running performance all the more incredible a brilliantly dumb episode
<START> i have seen this movie last week during the berlin film festival and had medium high expectations the director is <UNK> <UNK> and i was familiar with some of his previous work in french cinema i actually enjoyed some of his earlier movies the cast tommy lee jones john goodman peter mary <UNK> i was looking forward to see all this talent on screen i wasn't familiar with the book it's based upon and i hadn't read anything about the movie beforehand but i was told that it was an investigation movie set in the deep south we've seen a lot of those in the past maybe this one's gonna be as good as the others br br 2 hours later the end titles appear thank god it was over the plot is beyond <UNK> if you've read the book you have a significant advantage there were too many minor characters and there were a lot of useless plot <UNK> we didn't understand a thing the accents my god tommy lee jones' accent is decent but i still have nightmares from mary <UNK> french singing poor casting in my opinion i can't believe old man tommy lee jones can beat the crap out of a <UNK> built <UNK> and i'm not afraid of john goodman who were these people we barely understand who all these characters are and what they do there's a bait shop tommy lee jones has a girl from <UNK> the comedic attempts were pathetic the funniest thing about the movie was probably its action and suspense scenes they were horrible no thrills bad acting can tommy lee jones make different faces or is he like derek <UNK> and then there's the sci fi stuff no spoilers but it gets ridiculously and annoyingly weird br br i usually don't write any comments on imdb but i thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that i felt compelled to share my opinion but that's just me
<START> subject matter quantum physics and stephen <UNK> br br soundtrack phillip glass br br have i died and gone to heaven br br you will be <UNK>
<START> as far as i know i've seen most of lucio <UNK> films with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on dvd now and i would have to say this was his best pre zombie offering in fact it beats out his later movies hands down this is a tale of <UNK> and suspicion in a small italian town out in the middle of nowhere where young boys are dying mysteriously it's no mystery how they died i guess it's more who's doing it is it a woman that the <UNK> have always considered a witch is it a young woman that lives in a fancy modern house on the <UNK> of town who used to do a lot of drugs is it the village idiot who gets <UNK> early on because of being in the wrong place at the wrong time you'll only know if you watch and watch you should for this is a top notch mystery thriller or should i say a giallo i've seen this before but it's been a long time and upon a second viewing it was still as powerful as the first time for those of you that only know lucio fulci for his zombie flicks well open your minds to this because it's well worth seeing and while the monsters in this are human they're as nasty as anything <UNK> up in his later films 9 out of 10 stars see it please
<START> <UNK> is a bright <UNK> young women who falls unexpectedly in love with <UNK> a highly <UNK> bachelor with a <UNK> for losing money they get married but almost at once <UNK> is subjected to addiction to lying gambling and getting into debt despite his flaws she is unable to resist his charming manner until she starts to suspect he may be <UNK> murderous thoughts toward her br br this is a good movie well made with an attractive cast a good script and possibly the single <UNK> ending in movie history okay that's maybe going too far but not by much lots of films change the ending of a book great expectations the shining etc but the last two scenes of this one not only manage to be horribly lame but also render the entire <UNK> plot completely meaningless the story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and moral lacking and what she knows about him to kill her it should end as it does in francis anthony <UNK> book before the fact with him attempting to murder her the reason it doesn't is that the studio forced <UNK> to the ending one of the first examples of the <UNK> process of preview audience testing <UNK> was <UNK> and did what he was told this was only his third film in hollywood knowing that if he played the game sooner or later he would gain creative control of his films <UNK> by his masterpieces of the fifties but that still leaves us with a turkey of an ending this is a great shame because it really is a very good movie with an intriguing theme does anyone really know their husband or wife that well the script is excellent with many off guard moments such as when <UNK> father dies and <UNK> assumes she's crying about it a finely judged performance by grant who never played a villain again and fine photography throughout culminating in the famous glass of milk shot fontaine won an oscar for this performance although personally i prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier wife role in rebecca i would like to rate this movie higher but i really can't forgive that ending this is what happens when movies are made for money not love which i guess is curiously the theme of the film itself look fast for hitchcock's cameo as a man <UNK> a letter
<START> this movie was cheesy and it was more than that it was about this guy who gets a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla i had to see how bad it was because of the title before this guy turns into a gorilla he gets married i was a little upset because she wasn't a bride of a gorilla she is now the wife of the gorilla she should have married him when he was a gorilla then the title would have made more sense there are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and they all want to leave this isn't just a b movie it's more like a z movie i didn't even see any <UNK> for a wedding gift oh right he wasn't cursed yet
<START> i saw this movie just recently and i said to myself this movie is bad william shatner is a great actor but he is no director br br it's not just that the acting is bad it's terrible and instead of a plot we have a very bad storyline that is called a plot what i really thought was bad was at the beginning where kirk and mccoy were teaching spock how to sing row row row your boat br br do i have something against william shatner i do not but when it comes to being a director he sucks this film is not one of the worst movies i have ever seen but it is the worst of the star trek series br br i noticed that after this shatner did not return to direct another film in the series they apparently did not want him to direct another film again after this happened br br overall this movie sucks br br 2 10
<START> this is a wonderful movie it's funny dark poignant thought provoking <UNK> naughty and generally entertaining all around i don't know that i've seen the like before the rapture or maybe one of todd black as night comedies or even the recent movie teeth come to mind but those are all bitter nasty little gems despite the darkness around the edges manages to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heart br br the story is similar to john <UNK> low down dirty shame only this film <UNK> in that it actually has a story and something to say as well beyond <UNK> juvenile sex isn't dirty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> message a conservative repressed family <UNK> a <UNK> change as a result of a car accident and suddenly aren't so conservative anymore in fact they're finally actually happy probably the only people in their town or maybe the entire world who are to talk about why this is the case would be to spoil the film simply put everyone should see it though of course only people who are already sold on what the movie's upbeat hopeful philosophy is ever would br br the acting is great just this side of realistic enough to keep the proceedings from getting too heavy <UNK> willis gives an especially memorable and brave performance as an uptight mother who emerges like a <UNK> when she's freed up both she and robertson dean deserve kudos for their <UNK> sincere performances not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes they turn what could have been a <UNK> joke involving a <UNK> sex practice into a touching believable and endearing moment as the daughter is a standout and someone to watch perfectly capturing the attitude angst and speech <UNK> of a girl her age vince as the brother with a secret is good looking and <UNK> although his storyline and how everyone <UNK> to it is more rewarding than his actual acting <UNK> <UNK> as the conflicted best friend to mother franklin is wonderfully cold confused and even compassionate in a role that could have gone over the top br br technically the film looks fantastic all bright colors and wide open locales it looks like it may have been shot hi <UNK> if so the line has gotten very thin it looks very much like film there is a great deal of talking and a lot of it philosophical which gets a bit preachy <UNK> i'd imagine to a viewer who <UNK> with the film's politics but this film says a lot of things that need saying if only people wouldn't be afraid to listen and think the arguments that take place are smart and well thought out first and foremost <UNK> to either the religious or non religious parties br br the ending is on the ambiguous side which i found a bit of a disappointment somehow i think it would've worked better had the author as jay <UNK> is since he produced wrote and directed given a more <UNK> denouement some sort of solution but then again there probably isn't one when it comes to <UNK> people with different <UNK> against one another all the same it was a moving memorable final image that left me <UNK> up a success meanwhile i'm awfully glad mr <UNK> got this film made and look forward to sharing it with as many people as possible check it out
<START> the story is about a working girl ann <UNK> who has a pretty <UNK> boyfriend paul kelly this boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets dates or shows up late the final straw is when <UNK> has a birthday and kelly says he's too busy to take her out to celebrate so not wanting to just stay home she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man neil hamilton sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after <UNK> breaks off her relationship with kelly that new boyfriend hamilton is a love 'em and leave 'em sort of guy how all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict just suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectly br br this is a very modest little film from columbia pictures with a relatively small budget as well as second <UNK> stars it's clearly a b movie despite there being small roles played by a mickey rooney and jane <UNK> as both had yet to become famous now this is not to say that these are bad actors or the production isn't any good in fact given the production values this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline that's because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across plus the writers did a good job of <UNK> the characters and making you care about them the ending in particular is really sweet and practically had my tear <UNK> flowing because of these factors the film earns a 7 of 10
<START> okay so this <UNK> what i was expecting i rented this film just to see how it would be since i want to see the first one anyway but this film had b movie all over it but when i watched it i realized that it was very funny for the first 30 minutes it was just how the snowman was people and one man losing his sanity but those first few minutes had some funny one liners in it when he throws up the first of his little <UNK> i knew this would be very very funny they all act like the <UNK> in the <UNK> four hit <UNK> that it made it look like it was <UNK> it and made me forget it was a b movie so if you like to laugh rent this one
<START> to me bollywood movies are not generally up to much though they are still quite desired and bollywood is a big file maker as they have their own fans br br the only motive that made me watch the movie was to see to what extent an american actress could change or affect the logic that indian movie were based on not only did not it change the movie story also this <UNK> caused some ridiculous series of events br br i mean it is quite common to see <UNK> of illogical things through indian movies as they have their own world in their movies but once you see such incidents happen to an american it makes you laugh for god's sake can you believe a famous american actress is stuck in desperate situation and feel <UNK> can you imagine an american actress falls in loves with a dance <UNK> whose fiancÃ©e already fell in love with <UNK> boy friend and they met each other at the same time there were lot of similar things to mention the less said the better br br perhaps i was wrong as i expected too much from indian movies
<START> the theme song often goes through my head after all these years i was never much of a tv watcher probably because i was just entering my busy teen years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became part of my life but from the first episode of <UNK> i was hooked and it is the only tv show i've ever <UNK> my week around br br intelligent believable well written and well acted and john russell is still to me the most beautiful man i ever saw peter brown was no dog either o br br i agree that it is one of the most underrated tv series of all time i hope i can find some episodes for my <UNK> to watch
<START> the movie starts good it has a thing going for it about 1 3 into the movie things go downhill carrey starts <UNK> about the number 23 because he sees it everywhere so what thats no reason to go nuts and start writing stuff all over your body and on walls br br the acting by whoever is playing his son is bad from the get go as soon as he hears of his fathers obsession he jumps on the <UNK> and is hysterical about it totally unbelievable i hope i never see this kid in another movie again br br its a waste of time watching this movie grab another boring piece of well the number is killing him give me a break i won't spoil the ending for you but let's just say it is equally disappointing br br 3 10
<START> beginning in 1942 the sherlock holmes character as portrayed by basil <UNK> was set in the then <UNK> britain many holmes <UNK> have praised the first two entries in the series produced by fox but <UNK> the 12 features that followed i for one was never an avid reader and thus i appreciate these films as they are without any initial bias in fact the setting of world war ii for this entry places it as a period piece with the british propaganda evident throughout the film the execution of the modern holmes is handled with much more care than the previous entry sherlock holmes and the voice of terror and <UNK> much better for two reasons first roy william neil is on hand to direct and would be for the rest of the series and second although holmes is <UNK> against the nazis the inclusion of professor <UNK> makes this feel more like a battle of the intellect between two rivals lionel <UNK> performance has been criticized by many as being far inferior to that of george <UNK> and henry daniel but i feel as if its more the script than the character interpretation especially after seeing that <UNK> was very capable of being much more diverse and enthusiastic in other horror roles basil <UNK> on the other hand is exceptional in this entry he seems to be enjoying himself in the role of holmes but for that i blame the writing for example the introduction of holmes in the voice of terror tries to hard to immediately establish how superbly intelligent holmes is as soon as he is on screen whereas this film shows <UNK> brilliant but also his shortcomings even in the climax holmes initially has the upper hand only to then have his blood slowly <UNK> from his body now there are a few flaws in this film i thought i might point out first the opening aren't the germans fooled a little too easily maybe its just me but the book <UNK> just <UNK> into the bar says he's gonna get to not only answer his door after weeks of hiding but allow him to come in and then go for a walk with him what second certainly seems to put everyone around him in danger leaving the secret bomb parts with genius scientists leaving the note with his fiancÃ© like what was he thinking he was <UNK> them all i thought he was this superb scientist trying to save england and isn't the whole concept of <UNK> it on them before they use it on <UNK> a little harsh obvious propaganda third just how in god's name was holmes supposed to fit in the bottom of that chest its really small in fact the entire execution of holmes finding <UNK> in the ex con disguise really doesn't explain itself that well i have seen this film well over fifty times and there are still parts like this that i find are executed in a very confusing fashion fourth okay so holmes finds out the first three scientists are dead then immediately assumes that <UNK> couldn't know the name of the fourth man because he wasn't dead yet well if holmes didn't know the name then how could he assume that the guy could very well have been face down in a lake lucky guess fifth again with the confusion when holmes is supposedly dying on <UNK> operating table how can he recover so quickly he sure was acting like he lost a few <UNK> of blood but not enough to stop him from saving the day now despite these flaws this is a highly entertaining film the <UNK> are well done the mystery of the dancing men is well done especially the back to back scenes of holmes and <UNK> each <UNK> out they were over <UNK> them and dennis as inspector <UNK> is always a plus and as a final note the <UNK> scene still kinda bothers me i always thought that was one of the most well done sequences in the whole film overall this film holds a special place with me as it was the one that <UNK> my <UNK> as holmes obsession a classic 7 10
<START> dare rudd john wayne and sidekick <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> who can't seem to stay in one place very long in the boys are headed to montana where they meet up with <UNK> cousin tom <UNK> johnny mack brown who offers them a job it's a hoot to see the boys wearing as they start out as <UNK> with the herd although dare becomes self conscious when miss <UNK> <UNK> hunt rides into camp judy is <UNK> girl but the attraction between her and dare is evident early on br br <UNK> has a cattle herd to move and <UNK> dare to running the drive partly to prove to judy that he may not be up to the task meanwhile bad guy bart <UNK> <UNK> blue has his eyes on cattle but when his henchmen fail to <UNK> the herd he figures it's easier to win the money that dare was paid at the end of the trail <UNK> dare into a <UNK> card game with his man brady james craig money begins to <UNK> hand after hand it's only when dare fails to show up back at ranch that tom goes out to find his cousin exposing the <UNK> tom dare and <UNK> high tail it before the bad guys can get their revenge br br also known as born to the west was released in <UNK> by favorite films corporation a couple of years after wayne's series of westerns for lone star productions it only slightly <UNK> the lone star formula wayne does get the girl at the end of the film but here he was trying there's a great runaway horse scene where wayne <UNK> <UNK> hunt in which johnny mack <UNK> horse does a complete <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does a nice job as the comic relief pal doing his best to sell lightning <UNK> to unsuspecting victims he <UNK> familiar faces george <UNK> hayes and <UNK> <UNK> here <UNK> of the lone star films john wayne's charisma is beginning to develop here preparing him for the leap to super star status that he eventually achieved br br was based on a novel by legendary western author zane grey if you're looking for more films based on <UNK> stories try fighting <UNK> with gary cooper the light of western stars with victor <UNK> drift fence with buster <UNK> and <UNK> of the desert with randolph scott
<START> i can only assume the previous <UNK> came from <UNK> at the production company br br attended the uk premiere last night zane and <UNK> attended they probably knew i was gonna be there and are undoubtedly stars but what a turkey of a film i felt sorry for them at times when the audience <UNK> in laughter at what were serious <UNK> scenes br br but perhaps i was missing the point perhaps an element of tongue in cheek was intended if so pure genius if not career <UNK> br br on the plus side zane always shines and <UNK> can actually act a little as the other half said as we ran out the cinema <UNK> broken <UNK> they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people the scriptwriter however should be <UNK>
<START> i have been a huge <UNK> peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow 2004 where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest role br br <UNK> as i'm sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driver br br unfortunately other than <UNK> amazing performance i'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much going for it br br oh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like you son of a gun you son of a witch shoot and well forget you br br o k bye br br p s does anyone know where i can get another <UNK> peterson poster
<START> i thought this movie was pretty good ok so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that it keeps the story alive i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major <UNK> michael murray fan but because i enjoyed it i was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and i really enjoyed it and we were talking about it the whole way home i would tell my other friends to watch this movie i'm not saying it's the best movie that's ever hit the box office but it's a lot better than some people are describing it to be everyone has their own opinions so if you really want to know whether it's good or bad watch it and then decide
<START> if you've ever seen open water this is the same kind of gritty edgy indie style of film i liked the action suspense the slow building of it all i just hope they don't do to this one what they did to open water with that sequel but anyways the one thing i didn't like was the annoying younger sister i was rooting for the croc the whole time film starts out pretty much like it should kids <UNK> up for a trip they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 mins before they got there so i guess his assistant takes the two sisters and the boyfriend out on the water now mind you this is the second day of their adventure curiously enough the first day they spent at guess hmm a crocodile farm so they are out there and all is good for a little while then bang crocodile time very intense you know something in this movie you don't see the crocodile a whole heck of a lot but when you do gosh it is very scary i love the <UNK> <UNK> and eyes and the <UNK> of fog that seems to the croc every time he raises his head above the water very very creepy but good overall this is a great film if you can get past the annoying little sister
<START> this movie made me laugh so much it was a bloody joke to tell you the truth so unbelievable and the worst plot ever the acting as well was bad i don't how come so many popular bollywood actors and actresses took on to do this movie the script must have been somewhat of a joke the visual effects in this movie was painful to watch i believe that a <UNK> kid could have done a better job of the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job of coming up with a plot br br the plot has numerous attempts at <UNK> major hollywood movies like the terminator but it fails miserably i laughed my head off seeing this movie a total disaster in indian cinema history
<START> punishment park is a pseudo documentary made by peter the premise is that the <UNK> hippies musicians <UNK> <UNK> etc are being rounded up and tried by a <UNK> and then given the choice of prison or running the course of punishment park it's a <UNK> mile <UNK> trek through the desert to an american flag with police national guard and various other authority figures in pursuit the idea is that if you make it to the flag you're set free the <UNK> consists of a bunch of conservative types all <UNK> any behavior that is not like their own and there is no result except a prison sentence or the option of punishment park for any of those on trial there are a lot of things in this that still ring true today which is quite disturbing in itself the people running the course are promised water at the half way point which isn't true and the pursuing officials are mostly a sadistic bunch that are just out for a bit of target practice this is not a very graphic film but it's more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else the scary thing is it could happen not a very upbeat film but definitely worth seeing warning it might make you angry 9 out of 10
<START> the original grudge the original american remake surprisingly pulled off just about everything you could do right with a ghost flick it had suspense dark and moody atmosphere some good <UNK> and some genuinely creepy images the grudge 2 attempts all of these techniques but ultimately fails only showing us the same old stuff we saw in the first movie as well as a messy storyline constantly switching from tokyo to california it begins in tokyo with some <UNK> who wander into the house now heavily <UNK> by one strip of police tape one of them comes face to face with a similar wide eyed ghost girl while trapped in a closet she gets out screaming <UNK> and they all run out of there next we cut to america where <UNK> sister is sent by their mother to japan to find and bring her back home we eventually find ourselves following a very familiar concept involving a curious guy and girl investigating the history of a mysterious house we cut back and forth to the girls from the beginning who are disappearing one by one as well as a young boy hearing strange noises in the next apartment at night all leading up to a very unsatisfying ending the scare scenes are dull and <UNK> like the ring 2 avoid this god awful sequel
<START> another fantastic offering from the monkey island team and though it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of ron gilbert it's another worthy installment my only <UNK> is that it was a little short seeming in comparison to the previous two though that might be because of a glorious lack of <UNK> <UNK> roll on
<START> this video is a fantastic testament and insight into the work of bill <UNK> thought provoking barely begins to describe it it's funny and moving and educational and a whole host of other things that are good for you make sure you see it
<START> having read all of the comments on this film i am still amazed at <UNK> <UNK> to release a full screen restored version in dvd yes the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book but it was the 2nd film by fox made in real <UNK> and the production values alone merit a <UNK> and distribution i saw this film in second grade and it <UNK> my <UNK> interest in all things egyptian culminating in my visiting egypt 4 years ago amazing the power of film on a child's imagination eh in high school i read the book and made a promise to myself to one day take that dream trip now true this film was made in the old school style meaning that <UNK> were portrayed by pink skinned and blue eyed brits however has anyone seen the current hbo series rome everything old is <UNK> again one can't imagine why in this day and age we are still casting actors <UNK> around as <UNK> <UNK> in roman drag not one actor on rome could pass for an ancient italian that being said the period in egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history this film is immensely appealing to borrow a word from for its historical information beer brain surgery iron and its gorgeous cinematography and score i have a dreadful <UNK> dvd version which i watch over and over again praying that one day a true restored widescreen version will be available for anyone else interested in this subject i highly recommend the historical novel a god against the gods by the author of advise and <UNK> if anyone of you film buffs out there knows how to contact fox to urge them on please let me know
<START> i haven't seen many movies worse than this one the story line the dialogues the acting it's horror the story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps in between every time you think you've missed something but no that was the way it was intended to be and why on earth is the character that jenny <UNK> portrays so in love with that no no loser guy who actually now plays in the movie cinderella man with <UNK> crow o well it's no spielberg of course i have to write ten lines to get posted this movie really isn't inspiring enough to write 10 lines it's a romantic feel good movie with a lousy story so if you're up for that you'll have a ball
<START> what can i say about <UNK> and juliet other than if you like twisted troma <UNK> then you must see this movie this is my absolute favorite troma flick and i have seen almost all of them penis monsters <UNK> to live rats and popcorn <UNK> steamy sex scenes in <UNK> boxes incest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shameless troma <UNK> and computer masturbation how can one go wrong it amazingly follows the original story very closely you must see this movie oh and speaking of shameless <UNK> check out jane comic book whore cd on records it is awesome
<START> the film is a remake of a 1956 bbc serial friend <UNK> as such <UNK> thru the material in a relatively short time i found it fast moving enjoyable <UNK> did anyone else notice the scenes towards the end where john mills was being <UNK> the producers obviously decided to <UNK> the scenes maybe censorship but notice when he's sat by the window of the flat deep breathing closely followed by similar scenes with the car window open the francis serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe that of unexplained happenings people being not what they seem the villain being someone close to the hero victim a predictable universe in some ways but one with its own rules <UNK>
<START> most of you out there really disliked this movie you were right a small minority of you really loved the movie can't say <UNK> re wrong for me this movie was too stupid i have seen many dumb silly comedies but this one surpasses every one of them as i was watching i couldn't stop <UNK> my eyes not believing what i was seeing and trying to decide if i should laugh or cry as really stupid stuff were going on on the screen and people were leaving the theater br br according to the leading characters time travel is accomplished just enter any museum and you will actually travel to the past plus if you are seeking an after death experience just go to the nearest there you shall meet lord sorry and be given important <UNK> all <UNK> above t really make sense right well go ahead watch the movie i almost never regret the movies i watch you probably won't like it but you will be intrigued by the writer's ability in producing the ultimately stupid script br br <UNK> m giving it a 3 out of 10 not good far from being the worse
<START> can this really be a troma movie some scenes almost have an a movie look the acting is generally competent the two leads and the nurse surrogate were especially good and i liked some of the <UNK> between the young <UNK> and <UNK> the scenes were smoothly edited the plot is coherent it's funny it has a hip original sound track br br it does have the usual troma gross outs and low humor but i don't think shakespeare would have minded so much in fact i think he might have gotten a few good laughs out of this br br it's a good dvd there is an alternate sound track with a very informative commentary by the director several deleted scenes and the usual collection of troma self <UNK> silliness br br i'm not going to tell you this was citizen kane but it is some pretty inspired low budget filmmaking
<START> i have nothing but praise for this mini series it's only about a year and a half old but i have seen it twice already with greater enjoyment the second time than the first i'm seriously thinking of watching it again soon since i find it <UNK> uplifting br br it is a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful performances sets costumes music and scenes that it has a <UNK> which places it almost in a league of its own among mini series br br some others have commented on the difficulties of living as a lesbian in britain in the <UNK> nothing especially difficult about that it was only male homosexuality that was against the law as poor oscar <UNK> experienced to his great cost and as a great loss to the literary world anyway i <UNK> br br in my view this is essential television it is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas since romeo and juliet although not in the conventional sense br br 10 out of 10 from me br br <UNK>
<START> ok i'll admit it i'm a huge fan of b movies back when michelle bauer <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> stevens ruled the <UNK> and back then even the bad movies were still good unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad even a small cameo by <UNK> stevens <UNK> her role as linda from <UNK> party massacre 21 years earlier doesn't help this one out a group of <UNK> take <UNK> in a fancy cabin after their van breaks down a psycho stalks them one by one catching them in various states of <UNK> bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad skip this turkey and go rent <UNK> party massacre 1 2
<START> the odd mixture of comedy and horror sometimes works and sometimes doesn't had the main male character been a little more interesting the film would have been as well a trio of young americans visit paris run into a beautiful werewolf and the problems <UNK> from there br br numerous logic holes make the possibly intriguing story difficult to take
<START> i'm a petty officer 1st class e 6 and have been in the for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard there were only a few scenes that were far fetched the most far fetched was when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> went down inside of the sinking <UNK> to pull the captain out of the engine room that would never happen <UNK> are not allowed to go inside of any <UNK> no matter the circumstances second the command center supposedly in it looked more like a <UNK> command center we don't have any gear that hi tech third the captain of the would not be running the search rescue cases with like 10 people on watch in reality it would be an e 6 or e 7 as the <UNK> and maybe 2 other support <UNK> like an assist <UNK> a radio otherwise the movie was dead on i think they should have <UNK> more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search rescue instead of just <UNK> based rates some of the scenes from a school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days
<START> mild spoilers br br this movie was filthy and stupid it could have done well without the constant <UNK> and nude sex it was also very <UNK> i think that they had a good story developing but they messed up the whole thing by <UNK> it
<START> watching this movie brings several words to mind <UNK> ridiculous improbable self indulgent and finally and <UNK> boring badly directed badly photographed and badly acted the film is a confusing mess with plot lines if one can call them that <UNK> in all directions someone may have used a five year <UNK> finger painting as a <UNK> as punishment for this childish crime of a movie this cast of stars should be <UNK> <UNK> and sent to their respective <UNK> without dinner all in all it seems like george needed an excuse to get together with his little buddies for a paid summer vacation and we're the <UNK> paying for it bad george bad
<START> in 1989 <UNK> animations introduced the two <UNK> in the grand day out in 1993 they fought an evil penguin in the wrong <UNK> and in 1995 they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in a close <UNK> in 2005 they're back and they are going to fight something that used to be cute and in the curse of the were rabbit in this full feature film wallace and <UNK> work in a <UNK> control business there's going to be a giant <UNK> competition but <UNK> keep eating the neighbors wallace and <UNK> takes care with that problem but wallace had an idea he will <UNK> the <UNK> with his machine after doing that something suddenly eats all of the in the neighborhood and it's big it's up to wallace and <UNK> to save the day as a fan of these two characters i was impressed it kept what the 3 previous chapters had and instead adding a lot of hollywood actors for voice overs they put a no name cast to the job and boy they did a fantastic job wallace and <UNK> has not changed wallace is still the cheese loving freak like he always was and <UNK> is the silent newspaper reading dog also the script was not too <UNK> like other family movies were there is a twist of who the were rabbit really is the direction from nick park the director of the 3 previous chapters does a really good job with the storyline instead of adding the hollywood formula in it he just took the style of the previous chapters and adds a bit of a dark fantasy twist in it well done nick the <UNK> are also funny and adorable but the funniest rabbit in the movie is one who has the mix of wallace in him the characters were not bad and they weren't annoying but they'll never top wallace and <UNK> the animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful i've never seen a clay animated movie that is so amazing since chicken run overall fans of the two <UNK> including the teens will love this fantastic film it is a well done film that should get an oscar next year <UNK> wallace and <UNK> 10 10
<START> it kicks you in the stomach there are other films with more convincing characters a more realistic story and maybe even more depth concerning political <UNK> but then again most of these are not directed by peter maybe the one true genius artist of british film to emerge out of the 1960s has made quite a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outer aesthetic world the world of political <UNK> social problems and <UNK> <UNK> thus his work is probably less <UNK> than say political which some may call a <UNK> of their inherent artistic quality then again why shouldn't art allow itself to become engaged <UNK> and succeeds you won't feel well with this one you won't feel happy actually you won't really like the film it is <UNK> honest direct <UNK> a smash in your face in short you can't help getting angry you can't resist to let the things you see touch you that is what makes <UNK> films so rewarding
<START> norm an ally i don't mind remakes there are some pretty good ones out there but this one is a stinker considering it was practically scene for scene it had a good story and great actors van <UNK> copied <UNK> direction virtually <UNK> and it added color i'm not one of those who think it has to be b w to be classic it should have been at least a mediocre movie but it was pee pee i don't understand how it could have been screwed up so badly if you must watch it as a curiosity but i would suggest that you not bother
<START> the memory <UNK> daughter in the form of a novel by kim <UNK> was a highly successful <UNK> and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its <UNK> so what happened when the novel became a made for television movie perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay <UNK> <UNK> by john that consistently along in an awkward pedestrian fashion <UNK> all sense of credibility to the story perhaps it is the cut and <UNK> direction by mick jackson that misses the pacing and character <UNK> perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the musical score by daniel for whatever of these or all of these reasons this novel to film survives because it does make a good case for <UNK> the public about the <UNK> of those born with down syndrome and for that it is worthy of attention br br dr david henry <UNK> <UNK> a successful <UNK> doctor is married to the beautiful <UNK> gretchen mol and their lives are becoming changed by their <UNK> on a <UNK> winter night in kentucky <UNK> goes into labor and the <UNK> rush to a nearby clinic where david delivers his wife the doctor is caught in a <UNK> with the assistance of his old friend nurse caroline <UNK> emily watson after the delivery of a perfect boy child paul <UNK> continues to be in labor and surprisingly delivers an unexpected twin girl david and caroline immediately recognize that the little girl <UNK> is a this is before the use of the term down syndrome and david having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth <UNK> decides to send <UNK> to an asylum for the mentally challenged caroline is to make the delivery and <UNK> is told the second twin died at birth br br caroline follows <UNK> sees the conditions of the <UNK> where <UNK> is to be <UNK> <UNK> in horror and decides to keep the child aided by a friendly <UNK> caroline changes her <UNK> existence and mothers <UNK> finding a new life in her <UNK> <UNK> insists on a <UNK> funeral for <UNK> a fact that deeply <UNK> david's psyche and the <UNK> life goes on with only the one child paul leaving <UNK> pains about the lack of presence <UNK> gifts david with a camera lives are like a camera that's where they live in a room captured by a <UNK> and david becomes obsessed with photography <UNK> <UNK> drinks and loses david's attention while david <UNK> existence with caroline sending money and letters to <UNK> paul tyler to jamie grows up discovers his mother's <UNK> and is <UNK> about his father's lack of communication and understanding and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician and off to he goes meanwhile <UNK> <UNK> hope has <UNK> into a very highly adapted young girl and the manner in which the broken marriage of the happens and the healing atmosphere of and paul's lives coupled with the courage that has supported caroline struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with down syndrome forms the conclusion of the film br br the cast of well known actors tries hard but only emily watson is able to <UNK> a credible character from this <UNK> script jamie gives evidence of a young actor with much promise <UNK> <UNK> and gretchen find it difficult to mold <UNK> characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver the film is a mess but the message about acceptance of down syndrome children and adults is an important one grady <UNK>
<START> i watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago i didn't know what to expect precisely and for the first ten minutes i feared i might not enjoy this film it was beginning very slowly in silence and almost <UNK> which was all the less exciting as the sound was quite bad and the subtitles sometimes impossible to read br br but i definitely do not regret to have gone on watching it it is one of the most beautiful bergman movies i've ever seen at the same time human ruthless and psychologically so convincing br br seldom have i seen actors play so wonderfully with such an intensity on their faces <UNK> <UNK> interpretation is unforgettable and <UNK> is excellent too br br there is always psychological violence in bergman movies and this one may be the most physically violent of them all the strained relationships between the man and the woman <UNK> in parallel with the physical violence that is surrounding them br br finally this sober violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth an excellent bergman br br
<START> so many people loved this movie yet there are a few of us imdb reviewers who found <UNK> excruciatingly uncomfortable to watch and <UNK> boring i fall into the latter of these two camps and i will try to explain what it was that made my <UNK> <UNK> so <UNK> br br firstly to set the record straight i like neil <UNK> books i sometimes find his knowing sarcastic humour a little geeky and i actually prefer his work when he is playing it straight and leaving the jokes alone but even with his occasional <UNK> into crap gags i find his creativity and imagination to be something a bit special br br interestingly one of <UNK> strongest works is <UNK> a gothic fairy story for kids that is very low on jokes and high on tension and creepiness his latest novel boys <UNK> the and tends to read at times like terry does the sisters of mercy not the nuns but the band <UNK> <UNK> similar territory to <UNK> and when i saw the stunning visuals in the trailer i got a bit excited that somebody had managed to transfer <UNK> spectacular vision and imagination to the screen br br in praise of the film some sequences do look stunning however the visual effects are occasionally ruined by cgi animation that looks like a media studies student project backgrounds and scenery are often incredible but some of the character animation looks clumsy amateur and cheap in an early dream sequence the spider is animated beautifully but the book eating cat beast looks poorly rendered and very compared with the standard of animation found in productions such as 'the corpse <UNK> <UNK> occasionally looks very amateur indeed however in <UNK> the budget was tiny for such a grand vision and a few <UNK> in the effects can be understood and forgiven br br what cannot be forgiven is the stilted <UNK> <UNK> and pretentious dialogue the actors struggle desperately with the dialogue and there is so much of it that they are constantly <UNK> and stumbling over it conversation is rendered completely unnatural the jokes fall flat time and time again and the turgid speeches appear to be the writer's only method of plot exposition combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen which always adds an element of <UNK> this <UNK> the film almost unwatchable in such an unreal setting the actors need to work twice as hard to be believed and in the main they fail terribly the girl who plays the lead role puts in a <UNK> struggle against the impossible stage school dialogue and occasionally shows real promise but it is never enough the god awful <UNK> <UNK> of the valentine character with whom she is forced to spend an <UNK> amount of screen time puts paid to any chance of this young actress rising above the material it appears to be <UNK> job to explain the plot to younger viewers and to add a bit of light relief personally i wouldn't want him anywhere near my 15 year old daughter br br what else is wrong with this film answer rob what's annoying for us brits anyway is we know rob can act we've seen him hold the screen for half an hour on his own doing those monologues and in the first <UNK> <UNK> bit of the film he is fine however stick him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and turns into the worst am ham i've seen in years a real shame br br what else is wrong answer the <UNK> slap sub <UNK> <UNK> and too high in the mix soundtrack that never <UNK> up god the music is <UNK> loud distracting irrelevant and if that isn't enough has <UNK> slap bass <UNK> all over it it makes the dialogue very hard to hear but that could be a <UNK> in disguise br br what else is wrong with it answer the <UNK> <UNK> artist in modern society there should be no place for <UNK> apart from certain secret places in france every moment the camera <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> moss <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> idiot i understand why the <UNK> locals get a bit anxious and when festival time comes round again br br my final criticism is that the film is pretty dull <UNK> often is dull Â– it either requires its audience to slip into a <UNK> <UNK> accepting state or for the audience be constantly <UNK> by bigger and <UNK> surprises a story with a bit of pace involving characters that we could believe in and care about would have gone a long way to giving this film the emotional centre that it sadly lacked whilst stopping the <UNK> from <UNK> br br finally apologies to all those who found depth meaning and wonder in this film you have managed to suspend your disbelief you have seen past the <UNK> cgi ignored the crappy dialogue and the abysmal performances that resulted and understood the <UNK> grand imaginative vision i wanted to but i couldn't see past the real world <UNK> that dragged it down br br i hope neil <UNK> gets it right next time if he gets or even wants the opportunity
<START> first off this movie leaves you in a <UNK> mood wise you don't know what to feel so much so that you don't feel bad for character when his son gets murdered which was actually mostly due to bad editing the script was too bland none of the situations matter as you watch them the soundtrack or lack there of if there was it wasn't good enough to even remember does not help it one bit only good surprise to this movie was andy performance it was on par if not better than <UNK> the story would have probably gone better off if would have killed him because quite frankly you don't feel any kind of redemption in the climax just a feeling of lack of feeling if ya feel me basically this movie <UNK> lacks draw leaving the audience <UNK> throughout the entire thing
<START> i have not seen and heard the original version br br i am no russian but i am learning right now br br i also have no <UNK> for russia the us etc br br but what i have to mention is br br in the german <UNK> in the whole film all russians speak with russian accent americans talk without accent i have never heard such a stupidity besides this is boring br br i hope the original is better br br the rest is a simple thriller not really good ideas like a cheap version of a james bond film
<START> let's see what are the <UNK> to watching <UNK> <UNK> well if you've never seen anything to do with <UNK> there's a lot of <UNK> footage of both <UNK> and the countryside and jungle side and of the various native peoples at work and play as well as plenty of <UNK> <UNK> if you like william smith he plays a bit of a <UNK> as he has always been wont to do br br and that's about it if it wasn't for william smith this could probably pass as a <UNK> raising film for save the children or some other organization that benefits the third world the only time you really see the fish of the title is during the opening credits no mutant killer fish like in roger <UNK> named <UNK> you'd figure with twice the fish in the title there would be twice as many monster fish <UNK> on the characters but alas this is not the case br br the story starts with a <UNK> and her brother coming to <UNK> to do a story on one of the last <UNK> places on the planet but their motivation quickly changes to one of wanting to find <UNK> which are apparently fairly <UNK> there br br there's not a lot of real action or danger in this movie what could've been an exciting motorcycle race is <UNK> by the mass of landscape and animal footage that is inserted in it to draw out the films running time there's not a whole lot more action until the last fifteen minutes or so of the movie which is probably about how long the movie would last without all the br br in my view the only ways that a movie can really be a bad movie is to be boring or incredibly stupid <UNK> <UNK> certainly qualifies for that former <UNK> and is pretty damn close to the second the only reason i won't rate it a 1 is that the added footage is more interesting than the rest of the movie
<START> to put in simple words or rather a word would be best suited by pathetic the movie starts with <UNK> a little interest by the plot but but as few minutes by audience is getting restless for <UNK> and getting <UNK> or to get a breathe of fresh air outside the closed dark hall br br it seems like watching a movie from 1960's where colors were dull directed by a <UNK> and acted by high school students movie revolves about a american high headed actress trying make a comeback into films by acting in one of the not so great indian movie her acting is real sad <UNK> by the worse dialogue delivery br br overall i would not recommend anyone to watch this movie still want to watch then try watching it at home when some tv channel <UNK> it believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single <UNK> and no <UNK> br br and better carry a <UNK> u might need it if you cant find a remote control to change channel p s i have no clue if the other reviewers even watched the movie i did and wasted my 10 on the ticket
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i didn't go in with high expectations but as soon as it started i thought it might be o k it wasn't jim carrey seemed to try but he spoke all his lines as though he were some <UNK> cartoon character the other actors all seem to try their best but are kind of wooden the plot has a good basis but the melodramatic lines make it dull and kind of stupid i was laughing during the whole second half of the movie and after five minutes of that i got tired of that most plot <UNK> you could see from several miles off it's just not worth watching i really wish i hadn't wasted my time with it
<START> the female cast of this movie is terrific you've got linda blair <UNK> nicely julie strain who doesn't get too many speaking lines that's a good thing <UNK> <UNK> equally convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as an evil possessed girl toni <UNK> and the most beautiful of them all imo the simply stunning <UNK> how the goofy male lead larry <UNK> deserved to get sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery however beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women the movie has little to offer the plot is disjointed and doesn't really get going until the last 15 minutes or so and when <UNK> finally manages to create some suspense a ludicrous twist ending comes and ruins everything 1 2
<START> jean pierre <UNK> le <UNK> follows the lives of two criminals <UNK> <UNK> maria a murderer who gives the cops the slip while he's being transferred from one city to another by train and corey <UNK> a thief just released from jail fate decides to join these two men to pull off a spectacular heist in the background there is <UNK> the detective <UNK> escapes from <UNK> in his pursuit and sometimes ruthless in his methods along the movie the viewer meets other minor but fascinating characters the best of which is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> ex cop and an excellent <UNK> br br <UNK> has such a unique style one doesn't need to watch many of his movies to catch on le <UNK> un <UNK> and le <UNK> are clearly made of the same cloth the <UNK> angles the long shots the <UNK> the <UNK> and hats and <UNK> the quotes at the beginning the amazing <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> criminal life everything that's great in <UNK> is present here in top form br br and his shortcomings didn't bother me so much this time the illogical <UNK> behavior of his characters and confusing storytelling which hurt my enjoyment of his other movies are almost invisible here since le <UNK> <UNK> un <UNK> that doesn't mean he got better with time perhaps i'm just getting more used to it and reaching a mindset where it doesn't bother me anymore br br <UNK> made unique crime movies as old as they may be they show more <UNK> realism and grace than the modern <UNK> thrillers in which cool thieves use computer systems and james bond esquire <UNK> to pull off impossible crimes <UNK> criminals aren't cool they're lonely socially awkward and probably aware they're not good for much more than planning <UNK> they're <UNK> <UNK> living in the night always one step ahead of the police in a game they know they'll lose eventually there's nothing romantic about them br br amazingly for a movie of this type the cops aren't complete idiots either is smart <UNK> patient and even compassionate he's not an unlikeable villain or a clichÃ© he's just an old man doing his job and doing it right he knows when to use force and when to use brains many movies could learn from him br br it's this down to earth <UNK> style that makes <UNK> movies such a joy to watch and puts him on a special <UNK> as one of <UNK> great crime masters
<START> this was probably intended as an arty crime thriller but it fails on both counts there are few thrills and not enough substance the plodding pacing makes it hard to sit through and the occasional action scenes are too <UNK> edited and <UNK> staged to offer much <UNK> at least the level of acting is high
<START> this trio of 30 minute short films on gay related themes are all quite <UNK> executed each coming of age story is played out with pleasant charm and <UNK> this film deserves to be widely distributed and easily however it isn't i had to order my video copy none of the local video stores or even the <UNK> had it in stock
<START> i sat through all 2 hours i do not know what was worse the awful plot the lame characters or the <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> 11 kid and 80 year old grandpa made sexual advances toward the money spent on this was just <UNK> down the throne simmons should be ashamed the original idea for this movie was a swiss family <UNK> and it somehow turned into this mess the only bright spot is that it's ratings were so bad we will never see this on tv again avoid at all costs rent ernest saves <UNK> or something else
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen this in my opinion is rob lowe at his best i'm not quite sure why this film has gotten such a low rating i guess you either love it or hate it but if nothing else it is definitely worth a rental
<START> by the mid 1990s the career of animator director don <UNK> had seemed to drop to its all time low before <UNK> had made a series of popular animated films many which remain beloved today such as the land before time 1988 the secret of <UNK> 1982 and an american tail 1986 but beginning with in 1994 his films seemed to <UNK> more and more in quality and popularity and one of the many unfortunate entries is <UNK> box office bomb the <UNK> and the penguin a film that didn't attract audience members beyond parents and children under the age of seven frankly the latter are the only audience members i can comprehend taking enjoyment out of this rather bland animated feature br br the story is absurd the film stars a poorly drawn <UNK> and <UNK> penguin named voiced by martin short who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head voice by annie golden sort of like in real life <UNK> present their bride to <UNK> with a <UNK> as a substitute for a ring but when is swept away by the current he teams up with a lone james belushi with a dream of flying and they race against time to return to <UNK> before it's too late the reasons why they could be too late is one of many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak even if they were there br br it becomes very clear very early on why this animated children's musical does not and will not work for anybody older than say six or seven years of age it just does not have any of the qualities that are required for a good animated feature number one the film looks bad on account of a very poor drawing style the animation in this film is very <UNK> even as far as animated films go it's dark gloomy there is no <UNK> in the colors and on top of that the design of the film and the elements in it are universally <UNK> and laughable take for instance the <UNK> who star in the film with only a few background exceptions every single penguin looks absolutely nothing at all like a bird for example looks <UNK> ridiculous with wide <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> big eyes and that preposterous hat that he wears wherever he goes combined with his hand like <UNK> he looks like chris <UNK> in a penguin suit result he's an ugly poorly drawn cartoon character but the most absurd looking and <UNK> designed character is the evil penguin drake who frankly looks nothing at all like a penguin he's a muscle man wearing a penguin mask he's got a chest <UNK> than that of arnold <UNK> and teeth larger than the teeth of the <UNK> <UNK> and killer <UNK> that serve as the film's <UNK> basically he's a two dimensional recycled villain he lives in a cave shaped like a skull he wears a cape laughs a lot and gets mad when people laugh with him result who cares and what's also bad and maybe worse is that this is an animated musical and there's not a single noteworthy or memorable song to found anywhere within its running time the opening <UNK> was memorable but harmless but after that the songs became <UNK> and <UNK> and there was one in particular that had me <UNK> all the way through it's the moment that viewers press the fast forward button for whenever it comes up br br i felt the <UNK> and the penguin was lame all around save for the very few moments when and the penguin are placed in peril at the jaws of <UNK> <UNK> and killer <UNK> who were thankfully given no dialogue and treated as animals instead of cartoon characters but in a way for this reason i cannot <UNK> recommend this movie to children this is the reason the film displays killer <UNK> are the natural predator of the <UNK> my concern is that children familiar with free willy 1993 may be offended or by seeing their favorite <UNK> of the sea portrayed as a <UNK> the <UNK> seal was a better antagonist and was more funny seeing as how his jaws opened wider than a and how he appeared to smile while <UNK> but the point really is these moments with the there are only a the only interesting moments and they're not enormously interesting mind you br br bottom line i cannot recommend this to anybody below the age of seven my advice if you have children around that page rent it for them they might enjoy it
<START> this movie was in my opinion very ignorant there is only <UNK> as the motivation of the the police <UNK> was unrealistic the generated no sympathy from me the story must have been written as the movie was filmed unless you like police bashing stories don t waste your time br br
<START> as i type these comments i'm watching a dvd of this movie that i just got from a mail order dealer and i'm finding that it holds up extremely well with strong characterizations believable situations and well staged action scenes br br it's been a good 45 years maybe 50 since i saw hell below but the one scene that made an extremely deep impression on me was sterling death scene which several other <UNK> have mentioned here i haven't gotten to that scene yet on this viewing but i can <UNK> for what other comments have said once you see sterling death scene in this movie you will absolutely never ever forget it judging from how strong the film so far is holding up i fully expect that scene to live up to the memory of it as <UNK> one of the greatest death scenes in movie history the movie's worth seeing for that moment alone but even without it it would be a first rate early submarine drama
<START> spoilers a hot and sexy linda blair as the witch <UNK> reynolds is very upset with her friend and rival witch across town <UNK> julie strain <UNK> getting her husband hal edward albert to get a promotion at his job at the <UNK> <UNK> law firm over the more deserving larry barnes larry <UNK> who happens to be married to <UNK> has her cast a spell on hal causing him to lose control of his car and end up almost killing himself br br larry finding out about attempt on his best friend <UNK> life has a violent fight with her causing <UNK> to fall from the balcony to her death it's when larry goes back to his ex wife carol <UNK> that things begin to really heat up emotional and sexually the wicked <UNK> tries to have the dead spirit of <UNK> take over <UNK> body and end up murdering larry who she holds as being responsible for her husband <UNK> injury that left him <UNK> confined to a wheelchair br br not much of a story but <UNK> of cheese and soft core action with poor larry getting manipulated by <UNK> through the <UNK> of <UNK> who plans to kill him the first chance he turns his back on her <UNK> is a bit whacked out herself not exactly knowing who is and who isn't a threat to her <UNK> even gets her poor and innocent <UNK> stan michael parks to first lose him family in a bloody house invasion break in then his mind by being accused by the police as being the murderer and finally is life by getting <UNK> by herself as he's made to runs into the <UNK> house under her control as mad as a <UNK> trying to murder both her and the crippled hal br br larry parks looked and acted so weird that you had the feeling that he accidentally walked onto the set of <UNK> and ended up being in the cast playing his part as stan without the help or benefit of a script he improvised his way through and then slowly realized just how god awful bad the movie really is stan getting killed off early in the film was a big plus for him since he didn't have to suffer like those of us watching through the entire brainless and mind numbing movie br br it becomes evident to you as well as it did to the makers of <UNK> that all this on the screen has to come to some kind of hopeful and successful conclusion and a trick ending is put in to finally end the movie the ending is about the best thing besides miss blair and the rest of the very well <UNK> woman cast that one can say about the film
<START> for several reasons this movie is simply awful other posters have listed some of this movie's historical errors well i have a <UNK> knowledge of roman history and even i found the inaccuracies <UNK> i usually forgive errors in historical movies because i understand that the purpose is to entertain not <UNK> and <UNK> a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some let's say historical license but this movie goes well beyond mere <UNK> br br there's worse to tell a story from a distant period the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing unless viewers have some prior knowledge of the period they will quickly be lost in addition the movie was obviously filmed simultaneously in italian and english with various actors being dubbed later at times the actors seem as if they were in completely different movies which were then edited together in fact this is not far wrong the actors were obviously <UNK> onto a cheesy computer generated ancient rome br br the only reason i give this boring mess any stars is because i always find peter o'toole entertaining but that is no reason to rent it if you are curious about roman history there are much better movies available
<START> although not the most technically advanced film i have seen this was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours the main characters are sweet and you really get to like them and feel something when <UNK> q has to go but feel good again when she returns as maggie br br lots of stock dialogue and a contrived plot line but most of all lots of fun
<START> this is a classic war movie one of the best a stark image fest of flashing lights harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter <UNK> <UNK> into ceiling fans a star <UNK> spectacle of immense power br br martin sheen is a <UNK> sent up river to <UNK> the general gone <UNK> a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great marlon brando also along for the ride are robert duvall as an over the top <UNK> with a <UNK> for <UNK> in the morning or at least the smell of it dennis hopper is an edgy <UNK> with a view <UNK> views about the war and about his leader also in this amazing film you'll see up and coming stars such as laurence fishburne r lee <UNK> sam <UNK> albert hall and keep an eye out for harrison ford too br br behind the lens is francis ford delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed godfather films he highlights war in it's most basic form which for the most part is something you can't see you can only feel it as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war <UNK> in is quite unbearable the feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual <UNK> from the viewers honestly no films has ever made me feel like that br br criticism is hard to find the biggest <UNK> from some is that brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role but in all fairness this is <UNK> it was money well earned a role that physically <UNK> him being at the time an <UNK> man and a role that he really made his own i can't picture anyone better for the role and if you get the apocalypse now <UNK> version there's some extra bits of the great man and i think the <UNK> does make the film miles better br br final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the <UNK> version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool <UNK> minutes extra footage if not then still you won't be disappointed this film is up there with the best and deserves some great recognition and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made
<START> conclusion very but very very boring yet i watched till the end hoping for some upside down effect but the end was worse because it was nothing the old black white game didn't helped at all it usually helps psychological movies but this was not the case the script the plot etc were linear had no substance nothing in going when you deal with psychological you deal with analysis therefore with details that <UNK> diversity formula there was no essence no detail just a story there are many stories to tell but something makes them unique and hard to forgive with the tools and creativity of movie makers well this is not the one
<START> i first saw this movie with my fiancÃ©e many years after it came out i thought i would hate it but to my surprise it is so cheesy that it's great we've spent many hours <UNK> parts of the movie sylvia yes mickey or i'm sorry you had to see that baby sometimes in this world we see things that we don't want to my cracks up every time i imitate neil also the music is classic and fun to sing along with especially on road <UNK> of course i don't admit any of this to my male friends it's like a guilty pleasure i seriously watch dirty dancing once a month or more and it is just as good every time jennifer grey is also so cute in this movie its too bad her career never really took off
<START> i've been playing this movie <UNK> this month and i just love it i was around in the 60s oh dear so it is nostalgic in one sense however it's the funny premise the snappy dialogue and the great performances that keep me watching br br dr <UNK> reactions to stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless i'd be more specific but don't want to spoil it for anyone who other than matthau can play a man not entirely on the up and up and yet have us still love him as for <UNK> costumes i think she looks as <UNK> as she's supposed to i think she was robbed the one time that she appears in an evening <UNK> it doesn't suit her at all which is too bad i never liked it when i first saw it on her and i still don't br br goldie won an oscar for her role people thought it was a groundbreaking performance at the time and yet it's the one performance that i don't love as much as the others she does have the right amount of <UNK> and <UNK> however which is important for this role br br and i agree i thought rick <UNK> was great in it and it's too bad that his movie career didn't take off after this br br i hope more people watch this movie they'll love it
<START> i think rosemary's baby is the most overrated horror film out there not scary interesting or much of anything it's reasonably well directed and ruth gordon was wonderful but that's about it but this sequel makes it look like gone with the wind br br i caught this on tv back when i was 14 unfortunately i still remember it from what i remember rosemary's baby andrew is now grown up and the <UNK> wants him to start taking over the world that is but there are forces trying to stop it and andrew is having doubts himself br br i'm giving this a 2 for a few reasons gordon is in this and still very good stephen <UNK> was actually pretty good as andrew and there is one spooky moment at the beginning with <UNK> patty duke being kidnapped by a bus with no driver br br other than that it's dull silly and needless the original didn't need a sequel ira <UNK> book <UNK> in 1999 wasn't much better br br tune in for the beginning with duke then tune out not worth the effort
<START> i saw this movie because every review i read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium i really don't understand what all of the hype was about for one thing the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad what if something strange is going on what the acting didn't blow my <UNK> off either it could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with the characters are purely 2 dimensional to me and i didn't give a hoot about them at all another thing is that the movie extremely boring extremely sure there are a couple of <UNK> here and there but for the movie's <UNK> minute length it sure didn't use it's time up wisely most of the movie contains characters talking about stuff that had barely anything to do with the plot what was the point of that br br to top it off the movie makes no sense yes i believe i understood the intentions of the ghosts but how that fits into the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me also much of the movie is played out in little vignettes which makes the story hard to follow at times and don't even get me started with the ending what exactly happened there br br i can give kurosawa credit for placing some truly frightening images throughout the film there are very creepy shots of ghosts and other unsettling images if they reflected more on those images and <UNK> on them it would have made the movie much stronger but they didn't and instead <UNK> more on social commentary which was interesting but again portrayed in an extremely dull way yes it's a message movie okay fun i'll just get the message of my review right out here in the open find a better way to spend your spare time than watching this
<START> critics have started calling it the oscar winner club understandably what after <UNK> <UNK> won it for monsters ball then going straight to the diabolical <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in boys don't cry and follows it with the core jamie foxx takes a <UNK> as a pilot in the dull stealth after <UNK> a <UNK> for ray now it's seems hollywood <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all over her monster oscar with this one of the worst sci fi <UNK> ever made br br the film loses its audience interest after a mere 20 minutes meaning the only thing really worth staying for is the fact that despite the film being rubbish <UNK> <UNK> is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a crude and laughable premise not only is <UNK> ultimately shallow but for an action flick it's also really very dull it will only really appeal to comic book fans and teenagers who like the idea of <UNK> running around half naked for 90 minutes <UNK> only really succeed in failing br br set against the virus that kills 99 of the world's <UNK> and in the last city on earth the survivors some four hundred years later in the year are continuing to live in the <UNK> the name of the scientist who developed its cure br br all is not well in this <UNK> and it is not what lies beyond its high walls that <UNK> its citizens from the never ending jungle but what <UNK> <UNK> taboo that holds and <UNK> these <UNK> taboo that holds and <UNK> these together that lies within these walls of paranoia <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> filmed in and around berlin ironically this is a story set against a <UNK> state a <UNK> city where its peoples are no longer capable of <UNK> and its sinister and most secret plot of how it <UNK> life br br <UNK> is the assassin that has been assigned by the underground rebels to change the course of mankind forever this is the story of her fight for justice freedom and revenge br br <UNK> combined lousy <UNK> pacing and truly dire effects looking more like an unrealistic video game rather than a film the only thing that is fortunate about the failure is that no sequels are in the works <UNK> might just be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst <UNK> in history thank god for the lousy box office then br br my final verdict on this truly lousy feature there really isn't a story here just <UNK> <UNK> jumping around in a black suit like a grass hopper the acting is very wooden moronic and <UNK> compared to the other cinemas that are out there today it <UNK> too much to be like an adaption and doesn't really take much from the cartoon which is what i was expecting the only thing that was done half right that pays tribute to the cartoon was the fly in the eye scene avoid at all costs
<START> it has been widely agreed that <UNK> miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters his movies from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> laputa and <UNK> to the recent <UNK> moving castle are all not only <UNK> rendered in terms of art but in terms of movie making as well can this man do no wrong not really but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star <UNK> his <UNK> film an <UNK> family friendly tale of a <UNK> out of water is as <UNK> animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect and yet this is the first film of his which <UNK> into lesser territory don't get me wrong is not a bad movie by any means as mentioned it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as <UNK> and <UNK> the problem is that the story doesn't stay <UNK> to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing in depth plot br br for its opening hour is miyazaki storytelling at its finest in which a <UNK> and young <UNK> who later becomes named makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is subsequently adopted by a boy her own age named <UNK> interestingly after the director's own son this does not please father a mysterious wizard named <UNK> who is very angry at the humans for their destruction of the sea this <UNK> theme is not much different from miyazaki's other films a problem he very much <UNK> to <UNK> by creating <UNK> from the of his submarine he <UNK> the pair and tries to talk into staying underwater with him the <UNK> however has already <UNK> both blood healing a cut on his finger and some of the human food ham which she becomes inexplicably addicted to and of course steals into her father's forbidden <UNK> <UNK> into a <UNK> young girl who is the spitting image of <UNK> from my neighbor <UNK> this <UNK> a dangerous <UNK> which threatens to <UNK> the entire world with water <UNK> with his wife <UNK> a <UNK> sea <UNK> who shifts from super sized <UNK> to human size form <UNK> decides to test the two love for each other they do this by <UNK> the sea to the level of house <UNK> the youngsters to set out across their now ocean <UNK> world in an over sized toy boat made possible by own magical powers br br it is at this point where begins to run out of steam although and are adorable and the scenes involving them are funny and cute they slow down the film where the film really takes on water unfortunately is at the climax in which must prove his love to presented in a way which is strangely <UNK> and rushed bringing an otherwise charming tale to an abrupt halt this will likely viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered far more interesting <UNK> for many of his other movies remember the destruction of laputa search for little <UNK> <UNK> rescue of fight with curtis the rescue of the forest <UNK> head or even the test between <UNK> and all those <UNK> were far more satisfying and felt more complete than this one br br on a technical level cannot be <UNK> the animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at produced entirely without a single shot of computer generated imagery and naturally joe <UNK> provides us with yet another breathtaking musical score the best moments being the rousing sequences underwater accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice and the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as any other <UNK> movies br br having proved themselves worthy on <UNK> and dubbing previous movies into english with top quality results disney studios and pixar once again provide an english dub complete with a mostly capable cast of actors frankie <UNK> is surprisingly good as sounding very natural and believable throughout <UNK> <UNK> as on the other hand sometimes goes overboard in shouting her lines before eventually <UNK> down toward the end leads aside the rest of the cast includes liam neeson as the <UNK> <UNK> who manages himself <UNK> well in the character <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> in an <UNK> tone which is not much different from her <UNK> in lord of the rings matt damon as constantly <UNK> father <UNK> who is good but nothing to write home about and tina <UNK> as lisa of them <UNK> is the best voice in the entire cast <UNK> the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality her scenes with show real chemistry on the other hand <UNK> <UNK> who was spectacular as <UNK> in castle in the sky is <UNK> wasted as one of three handicapped elderly women she barely has any lines who are also voiced by betty white and lily <UNK> of them only character a <UNK> woman named shows any real personality but if i were casting the movie i'd switch <UNK> with <UNK> probably the only really jarring <UNK> of the dub is a <UNK> <UNK> of the film's catchy but ridiculously repetitive title song which thankfully doesn't occur until <UNK> through the closing credits br br on the whole is a good film a fine piece of animated work which is perfect for youngsters and family audiences due to the loss of momentum toward the end though it falls far short of classic status since miyazaki at his least is still better than a majority of other animated films though i'll be generous and give a full star recommendation because any feature of his is still very much worth watching particularly on the big screen be sure to catch it in the theaters while you can
<START> an evil spirit takes over a girl and <UNK> panic in the <UNK> museum that's all i think the summary of the movie and the movie itself which i think it's one of the worst french or non french movies ever made in the history of cinema br br nothing good in here except the music of the credits only some tender moments of sophie and of course the movie's finale shot not because it ends ages of what seemed to be a countless years we had in watching that crap but also for being so perfect as one magical c g i work that was too good to be true in here br br by the way i want to change the plot summary to be like this an evil spirit takes over some cinema artists to make lousy movies just like this one for sure
<START> i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success at least he'd have wound up with something br br the film struck me as pointless rambling and very stylish like some other recent french films not to knock it most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever we should be grateful i suppose for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a wind blown <UNK> winter and for <UNK> conversations that challenge our ability to understand what's up br br but there can be too much of a good thing <UNK> is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the <UNK> night carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood you'll love it if you're <UNK> the <UNK> lots of people die catherine <UNK> dies in a suicide by motorcycle i don't know why young girl dies too and i don't know why she dies either she gets slapped in the face falls to the <UNK> and dies br br there is supposedly an explicit sex scene too i'll have to take their word for it because although it is <UNK> photographed it is <UNK> photographed in almost complete darkness don't worry about the <UNK> being shocked they'll probably be asleep by this time anyway br br depardieu isn't a bad actor as we see him <UNK> from a carefully <UNK> handsome young man well handsome except that his nose can't seem to get out of his way to a <UNK> murderous hairy physical wreck we feel sorry for the guy <UNK> has a wan pretty face with enormous half eyes and wide <UNK> like a doll her next movie should be a remake of <UNK> i walked with a zombie then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band i guess it's a band as far as i could make out the band is made up of about a dozen <UNK> and a dozen musicians playing electric <UNK> every viewer will find the <UNK> sound interesting but <UNK> fond of easy listening might not enjoy it if you don't like the music there's a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with <UNK> walking stick br br i must say i found it barely worth sitting through and it's a too at times it was like waiting in your car at a <UNK> crossing while a long long <UNK> train <UNK> slowly by sometimes stopping entirely i wish it had had a few jokes
<START> great movie post apocalyptic films kick ass this one is no exception kept up the pace and interest without a <UNK> of dialogue mainly through some good character development the fight between reno and the hero was tight i also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and the connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey that is i had a hard time understanding the <UNK> between the hotel and the opening sequence in sum kick ass character progression design story without the <UNK> of dialogue and most importantly the always appreciated desolate scenery of a post apocalyptic <UNK>
<START> a good script or director couldn't fix br br the original <UNK> was a story of human courage <UNK> against terrific odds and personal tragedy the survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength who would take anything god threw at him br br the follow up tries to recreate the mix but fails through a formulaic script and pedestrian direction irwin allen may have been a great producer of disaster flicks and done a fine job directing the action scenes in but he just can't bring any human depth to his characters if the characters aren't credible any danger they face also falls flat br br the script also tries to copy the original too obviously so we have peter boyle doing the ernest <UNK> thing by being tough and obnoxious but he has a tender heart karl malden is the red buttons influence and is <UNK> ill for good measure slim <UNK> does the comic relief for shelley winters and so on br br to make the story more contemporary we have a rogue arms dealer ready to <UNK> weapons grade <UNK> to the highest <UNK> a really nasty piece of work who <UNK> <UNK> wounded men the actors playing his henchmen were presumably paid as extras because they don't seem to have any lines and has a woman shot in the back what a <UNK> thank goodness the french rescue services made the hole in the <UNK> twice as large as in 1972 and on the other side of the <UNK> <UNK> so he could he get his goods out and while we're on the subject how did they get the <UNK> to the oh forget it br br i actually paid good money to see this when it was released given the film's current reputation this may seem odd but it actually got quite mixed reviews at the time some said it was junk some said it was as exciting as the original never mind nobody can be right all the time
<START> not your everyday tom and jerry short for many reasons one there's a <UNK> narration by jerry which is odd because tom and jerry rarely speak two the two are friends which was also rare and seldom works as well as the more <UNK> shorts do third and most importantly the cartoon is rarely humorous by design and the jokes here are dry chuckles with a little <UNK> and a bubble of blood at the end think a tom and jerry cartoon directed by tim burton not wholly successful but it largely does work the <UNK> ending for an mgm short that i can recall not for everyone and proof that these shorts were never intended solely with children as the target audience well worth watching recommended with the <UNK> above
<START> my girls 4 and 6 love this show we stumbled across it on a <UNK> station and they always ask when its on now it reminds them of their grandma that takes care of them everyday in the summer its funny too and sometimes they can't stopped talking about one scene or another i would definitely recommend this show to all young kids it is very clean and shows you to slow down and its not about watching tv all day long when <UNK> reads a story it is slow and she talks about each page with <UNK> it reminds me to slow down when i read the next book to my girls at <UNK> and talk about the book instead of going through it quickly just to get them to sleep
<START> i appear to be in the minority but i thought radio was pretty awful it seemed to contain almost every cliche in these types of heartwarming movies br br the motivation for the characters falling in love with radio was never really explained we were just supposed to accept that everyone was fond of radio except for a couple of bad <UNK> br br you could see almost all of <UNK> big moments in the story from 100 <UNK> away when the movie wanted you to go <UNK> or pull out your <UNK> i was rolling my eyes and wished i was watching <UNK> instead br br there were some good performances by the cast too bad they weren't given a better movie in wish to appear
<START> i love foreign films and this is among the best i tend to not see this as a comedy as it is listed and find it a commentary on how we see others around us the lead in the film is not regarded must as she is a domestic in a large firm and people say and do things around her all the time that they otherwise would not say in front of others br br this leaves her with a <UNK> of information that can make or break the mere mortal this actress is wonderful as this character and it is a poignant tale there is an underlying tale and almost many stories within the story in this film i just hope that if someone does decide to make an american english version of this film it is not the vein of three men and a baby that would definitely do a <UNK> to this film a must see
<START> hysterically painful perhaps the kind of movie <UNK> would have made had he made movies what's really funny is that the two cousins have so very much in common many <UNK> of their relationship on this site are dead wrong br br what's really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they just can't bring themselves to talk to each other or anyone else it's horrible if you've ever been too shy worried self involved or just plain scared to talk to someone and who hasn't you'll definitely see yourself in this film and it won't be pretty br br it holds a mirror up to the audience and says if you don't like what you see change it
<START> that this film <UNK> at the box office and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today is a great pity yet somehow rather appropriate the commercial suicide the <UNK> committed by making this film is <UNK> by the <UNK> suicide they commit on screen to destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome american alternative to the beatles is courageous to the point of <UNK> as is the admission of being no more than <UNK> in the entertainment industry trapped in the movie literally in their own <UNK> the television series was not that conventional but head is utterly <UNK> although in the end there is actually some kind of <UNK> logic to it all <UNK> by a genuine storyline the surreal sequence of events is by turns hilarious and rather disturbing the greatest irony is that the <UNK> effectively signed their death warrant as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak their exploration into <UNK> reached its <UNK> with the soundtrack to head all the songs are <UNK> woven into the film which is one of the <UNK> albums of the the <UNK> began to <UNK> after the box office failure of this movie but head serves as a noble legacy
<START> the box at my video store is why i rented this one it looked cool from the guys face <UNK> in half so of course i had to give it a try i was pleasantly surprised when i actually watched it being an evil dead fan the swedish makers must of been fans as well as they included lots of references in this masterpiece a criminal tries to break into the house evil ed was editing the movies that ultimately drive him insane in and says <UNK> as he looks at his weapon quite like bruce campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in evil dead 2 there is also many posters of that movie scattered around the house and office in the movie they don't just spoof evil dead as there is a <UNK> style puppet monster that at ed in his <UNK> my personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says i'm coming to get you barbra which in case you <UNK> know is <UNK> brothers main line in night of the living dead this movie pretty much has it all good plot cool characters funny stuff <UNK> puppet scary stuff demon doctor excellent effects exploding head and a fair amount of female nudity i only gave it a 9 because its kind of slow before ed goes insane but its well worth the wait so if you liked evil dead 2 or any of the other movies i mentioned above you gotta rent and watch it with a and when your done try brain dead because i hear it is <UNK> to this masterpiece br br
<START> bottom has been my favourite sitcom ever since i saw it on t v and the movie is even better if your a bottom fan i say this is a must buy the plot is that eddie and ritchie run a hotel named guest house paradise but not all goes right for them as customers leave until a famous actress come to stay they try there best to impress her but not all well go right this is a upbringing to british cinema so buy this and you will wet yourself with laughter also starring simon shaun of the dead and also bill <UNK> love actually it might of not done good in the box office or by the looks of it on this website but don't listen to them buy this and i swear you will love it
<START> talk about false advertising what was this doing in the comedy section of my video rental place i think there was maybe one laughable part in the movie i can appreciate black comedy but this had only the <UNK> without any comedy the movie was generally disturbing and un funny yes kevin spacey was good as buddy and the rest of the cast was also good but generally the movie falls apart because we don't really see a good enough reason for guy <UNK> to lose his mind so badly the ending was disappointing as well what would <UNK> motivation be for letting guy get away with what he did this isn't really explained at all why would buddy go for such a plan wouldn't it be more like buddy to screw guy completely by turning him over to the police the ending didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me no matter how i looked at it br br generally i disliked the film despite the good acting spacey essentially <UNK> scenery for most of the film but towards the end he gives buddy a bit of needed humanity the story just wasn't as good as the cast
<START> surprisingly well acted well written movie about hard <UNK> but decent young man getting that much hoped for ticket to stardom his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer not far fetched the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over the top it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business but the script despite solid dialogue follows a tried and true formulaic pattern and gets <UNK> down by its own clichÃ©s in the final act i enjoyed it much more than the <UNK> <UNK> almost famous it has a nice bitter edge to go with its heavy metal <UNK> but a stronger finish <UNK> made it more memorable 1 2 from
<START> <UNK> this was one of the best funny road movies ever i laughed so i fell out of the chair with many norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves <UNK> is the producer known for films like agent cody banks and of course one night at br br it is about norwegian crazy fans going to the world cup in soccer in germany 2006 and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it it was hilarious i couldn't stop laughing i haven't had so much fun in ages rumors say it will come a number two but i do not know it will be hard beating this one br br recommended to everyone it is a must see film i was suppose to see it at the cinema but i had work at the times it where shown and been trying to rent it for a month but all the time rented out got it today on dvd well worth it
<START> i was waiting to welcome arnold return to action after the dismal movies he'd made after <UNK> end of days however can be added to the dismal films he's had the misfortune of appearing in br br end of days starts well with a gripping action sequence yet quickly becomes a bore taking the focus off action and suspense and instead <UNK> on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching <UNK> read <UNK> br br performances are stale special effects so so and gore <UNK> considering myself a die hard <UNK> fan i couldn't believe i didn't like this film but with such an awful lame script what could arnie have done besides passed on this turkey br br 3 out of 10 br br
<START> i think <UNK> is a bit of a <UNK> for this movie more like plantation grown but it doesn't have quite the same ring to it my guide described it a comedy but the pathetic <UNK> of these hapless <UNK> is not my idea of a belly laugh more in the genre of the <UNK> thriller drama the characters developed well enough an all star cast made it oh so promising just a shame the plot was <UNK> absurd ted <UNK> provided a fine cameo as did jamie lee curtis in her walk on part jon bon <UNK> has this amazing ability to measure content in the front seat of his car i guess if you <UNK> a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this one not for the gun shy paranoid types though
<START> especially if you love horrible movies when i first started watching it all i could say was i hope there's a dance sequence in it imagine my delight when not only did the two main characters dance but the main ghost began break dancing as well and on top of that <UNK> <UNK> sings the break dance song not to mention the theme song it makes me a little sad that he went broke because of this movie but i've never liked him as an actor and he really should have known better not even the director would take credit for this movie and you should check out some of the other films he directed br br one note of warning though the writer seemed to really like jokes about the um male lower <UNK> for example one of the characters discovers a book called <UNK> of the darker species i am not kidding and that to me is the most disturbing part of the film other than that find the most obscure video rental store in your town get the movie invite all your friends over and laugh until you cry with ghost fever
<START> i remember reading the original <UNK> story in college french br br i remember ken of tv in chicago reading it as one of his late night shows br br always loved the story but never believe they could or would make a movie of it to my surprise they did and did it very well br br few of any <UNK> stories lend themselves to <UNK> which is unfortunate and cat lover that i am i was always hoping it would be filmed without a lot of hollywood up this is as close to perfect <UNK> as could be done br br the theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see but this is as close as i think it can come to letting the imagination of reading meet the reality of seeing
<START> ruthless evil <UNK> superbly played to the hateful <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> the peaceful residents of a small village the giant stone statue <UNK> eventually comes to life to destroy and his wicked <UNK> director and screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient age old legendary there's a very strong sense of an ancient time and <UNK> remote place it's specifically set in <UNK> japan the good guys are noble and appealing while the villains are truly nasty and <UNK> the occasional stirring <UNK> are staged with considerable skill and gusto the special effects are fine and impressive the serious tone and steady pace never <UNK> for a minute and last reel rampage of savage destruction is extremely lively exciting and more than a little scary moreover the fantastic elements of the narrative are given substantial credibility by being firmly grounded in a <UNK> believable dark harsh and gritty world this film earns bonus points for depicting <UNK> as more of a brutal and frightening force of angry vengeance instead of a pure spirit of absolute good veteran composer <UNK> supplies a typically rich <UNK> and rousing score <UNK> sharp moody cinematography likewise hits the <UNK> eye the capable cast all give admirably sound and sincere performances with especially <UNK> work by <UNK> as the <UNK> protective and <UNK> as mean henchman highly recommended
<START> if you ever visited <UNK> as a child and wondered could there be a worse vacation spot in the world well you could have watched this movie and had your answer flavia a k a dude ranch is often <UNK> by business casual gordon at least since resident water witch jessica was 13 but jessica can find much more than fresh spring water with that rod Â– buried <UNK> <UNK> lost jewelry dead bodies even a <UNK> that will keep her from dressing like a slut and raising drinks with a phony beat and a suzanne <UNK> look alike while <UNK> by a <UNK> head evil evil evil
<START> this show is the worst show ever norris and his family write it produce it direct it etc etc the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain no trees no building just <UNK> thin air he always <UNK> the case or is the best at whatever skill there is no co star ever gets the glory its all norris its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content terrible acting terrible script terrible series
<START> i work at <UNK> <UNK> hospital <UNK> and was also working at texas children's hospital women's hospital and west <UNK> during allison first the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban the texas medical center has a daytime population <UNK> similar to wall street there are huge <UNK> professional buildings and <UNK> <UNK> was the largest children's hospital before it <UNK> in size twice <UNK> with its <UNK> <UNK> is one of the largest hospital in world the texas medical center <UNK> is bigger than that of <UNK> yet the best <UNK> hollywood could <UNK> are that of some <UNK> hospital in the middle of nowhere besides the real <UNK> of the hospital taken decades ago also they combined several real life characters and portrayed them all in one super nurse i actually know the medical <UNK> s working in the blood bank two where actually working at the time but the movie shows only one pregnant <UNK> there was a pregnant <UNK> and another <UNK> that took the precious patient research for more info i will not mention their names <UNK> there was no nurse in the real life lab scene hollywood combined these two most likely to save time and money in the movie military <UNK> true had to transfer the our babies and to all the way to <UNK> why you may ask when we have the largest children's hospital just down the street because texas children's hospital refused to take them you read right they refused being employed by them i was ashamed needless to say i'm no longer <UNK> with that facility any other comments would be repetitive to the ones already posted by the people that who actually live here or lived through the experience

<START> the intricate plot great visuals the world's greatest car chase ever make this movie a lot of fun to watch the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> adds to the enjoyment the sound score is outstanding add to all this an energetic cast that also seems to be having a lot of fun making the movie
<START> i just do not see what is so bad about this movie i loved this movie i thought this movie was the best film in the series though part 3 is the best in the series i still gave this film 10 out of 10 because it is great i don't see what everyone hates this movie who would not want to see just a little bit of <UNK> action i wished that brad brown would of appeared in this one because it might of made it a little better those who like a little bit of drama because wait i won't tell you you will just have to watch it this film also contains a few popular actors who are i won't tell you because i hate it when people give spoilers so i do not want to be one of those people well i guess that is all i have to say about this movie
<START> andy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> wan are both superb in johnny <UNK> <UNK> directed crime thriller which puts most western efforts to shame think of it as the hong kong <UNK> only better everything about the film screams class from the performances to the soundtrack the cinematography to the script the tone remains serious throughout but the film has a nice line in black humour friendship and romance at it's heart sure it gets a little preposterous later on but it would be a hard hearted viewer who didn't find something to love about this movie thank god hollywood hasn't yet re made and ruined a classic do yourself a favour and see this film
<START> monday october <UNK> 2006 so i got together with my dad as i always do we ordered some japanese take out turned off the lights and pushed play i'm an avid fan of horror movies however the <UNK> released on dvd this october was most certainly a let down it seemed promising meeting all the standard <UNK> of any horror movie machine drawn out beginning with <UNK> character present a cannot be <UNK> sex scene and the all too familiar pre <UNK> when they <UNK> you unexpectedly but it turns out to be the idiot buddy then finally when it got down to the <UNK> gritty i was ready for some real gore action the director i admit was keen of course you would have to be to fill in an entire <UNK> minutes with people running back and forth in a space about wide it all begins when some college bound get together for yet another cave dive they all seem like seasoned pros very serious and spiritual about the whole cave experience this time they bring a new by along some annoying photographer too <UNK> by his national <UNK> cover to understand the full dangers of cave diving as they <UNK> deep into what they call hell pit they soon realize that they are not alone in the <UNK> of death i will <UNK> leave out any spoilers if you are naive enough to not <UNK> my advice and avoid wasting your time although the atmosphere and background music was spooky and there was sure a lot of blood and gore when the moments approached to witness some actual <UNK> it was more like watching porn without the full frontal the camera work was <UNK> dark and <UNK> i guess the director used it for effect i suppose the thing i like most about the movie were the moving characters they deserved <UNK> awards for those touching <UNK> scenes i almost shed a tear when they finally got it a tear for joy if you like dry horror soft porn and you hated braveheart then this is the right movie for your next saturday night
<START> does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents one edition featured charles bronson <UNK> <UNK> being interviewed about his new movie br br it's about a man an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and i have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner br br and after what next for bronson br br we're using a new angle my family don't get wiped out but i go after creeps just the same br br this accurately describes the evil that men do it's a bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn't down to a blood <UNK> but this leads to credibility becoming strained br br bronson is a retired hit man who isn't giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of the doctor not the legendary time <UNK> but a infamous expert on torture it's never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has a <UNK> of these <UNK> nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents br br as you may guess it's a <UNK> written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a <UNK> so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctor's sister being a lesbian so some t a can be included br br in many ways it's like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on sunday <UNK> believe me this movie won't be shown until well after the <UNK>
<START> i don't know where this movie was shot but because it was shot on location it has the authenticity that this story deserves it is the story of a young english woman who is taken prisoner by the japanese in southern asia at the beginning of wwii with a group of other english women there is no prison camp for women so they are forced to march for months from place to place because the japanese don't know what to do with them the courage and <UNK> of the english women and the bravery of the australian soldier who tries to help them is the core of the movie this movie is very long maybe 10 hours so you can watch it as it was shown on <UNK> as a series which actually adds to the feeling of the endless journey this woman makes from england across this remote island and finally australia story cinematography location and actors combine to make this a movie not to miss my only question is why this hasn't been released on dvd
<START> i saw this a good while ago but i just cant get over it i have looked everywhere to try and find out where i can get a copy of it but i have not been able to get a hold of it i really <UNK> this movie and if anyone has any info about how i can get a copy then let me know <UNK>
<START> saw this at <UNK> beach film festival the other day the film is really exceptional the crowd i went with all loved it funny poignant and great acting i'm tired of the tried and true hollywood romances who can relate david max is really amazing as the sure and true lover of the ultra <UNK> grace natasha who is also excellent when max falls for grace we believe it why because love at first sight is crazy and we're dealing with two lost and maybe not so crazy souls also of note are diaz as hector and <UNK> arquette as a <UNK> sexy neurotic both roommates of max and grace before they <UNK> on their trip to <UNK> and finding themselves don't miss this one its something special p s the soundtrack led by kevin of bare naked ladies fame is really super super cool as well
<START> this isn't a bad movie it's fun to watch for the first time however it has absolutely no replay value at all when you try to watch it again it gets so boring you have to turn it off i give this movie a 6 out of 10
<START> tobe hooper fresh off mainstream success with <UNK> aims for the <UNK> this time around is an adaptation of colin <UNK> 'the space <UNK> the script by dan <UNK> <UNK> and don <UNK> a bit i was told the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and <UNK> was added to <UNK> with its actual passage by earth a few weeks after the films release so i've read br br the story concerns a <UNK> mission commander by steve <UNK> sent to investigate <UNK> as it passes by earth all goes off without a <UNK> but upon reaching the <UNK> it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the <UNK> the team <UNK> the massive structure and discovers bat like creatures looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three <UNK> two naked males and one rather <UNK> nude lady too in odd <UNK> <UNK> the crew returns to the ship with the <UNK> and a bat creature in <UNK> br br a bit later the ship returns to earth but no contact can be made by <UNK> and another <UNK> is launched to <UNK> the status of the mission upon <UNK> with the <UNK> it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight but the three <UNK> remain however it is learned that an escape <UNK> had been launched but whose <UNK> are unknown br br soon they make the discovery of the <UNK> origin when the very attractive space vampire queen <UNK> from her <UNK> to easily seduce the <UNK> from the men around her if you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust the goal of the three is to drain enough of the essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well br br thankfully the commander survives re entry in the <UNK> crash lands in texas no less and now has a psychic link to her royal <UNK> the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed london dry of their souls br br tobe hooper of 'the texas chain saw <UNK> 1974 does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date the production assembled many fine <UNK> from all over the movie industry production designer john fresh off 'the bounty 1984 ' uses every bit of four stages at studios to create the <UNK> interiors of the ship and such cinematographer alan <UNK> returns to science fiction after a <UNK> on <UNK> wars <UNK> return of the 1983 and three <UNK> james bond episodes <UNK> uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects oscar winner john <UNK> of the groundbreaking effects of the original <UNK> <UNK> 1977 manages to push the <UNK> once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using <UNK> heck even <UNK> henry <UNK> drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci fi horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel in the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of steve <UNK> and newcomer <UNK> may vampire queen <UNK> always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like <UNK> business that comes in hand as his mind <UNK> when the <UNK> grip <UNK> on his soul gorgeous french actress may doesn't have a heck of a lot of lines were there more than ten but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the <UNK> <UNK> to pull it of pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence job accomplished and where do i sign up to be victim i really enjoyed how they <UNK> the old vampire clichÃ©s and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable almost everything is <UNK> for here bats their true form resembles a large bat <UNK> the <UNK> fields resemble these <UNK> they <UNK> your mind and can be anything massive sexual appeal miss duh not to mention they even include the old <UNK> stake through the heart this time a bit of a lead <UNK> to the energy center slightly below the heart the only thing they didn't touch on was religion but i think that the vampires using the <UNK> at the end as home base might just be a bit of a <UNK> and a nod br br in short yeah right <UNK> words later is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different <UNK> the effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged at least at the time and horror and sci fi fans engaged 4 of 5
<START> calling was good but it could have been great the concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening story lines that might have been explored in future unfortunately the writing and an actor let the show down br br the writing wasn't too bad but there were holes in episode 13 drop dead gorgeous an incredibly toxic poison was supposedly used to kill the victim this was so toxic and killed so quickly the victim had no time to run or even scream for help yet there was no plausible explanation for how the killer <UNK> such a powerful poison br br in episode 15 the <UNK> the off duty policeman <UNK> <UNK> in the second diner scene he <UNK> tells the <UNK> to drop the gun and when she doesn't follow the order and in fact turns the gun in his direction he allows it to turn into a <UNK> and then <UNK> into a hostage situation Â– the very situation he'd been warned about his response should would have been to shoot the <UNK> when she failed to follow his order and upon her turning the gun on him there are other faults in the stories but i'll leave it with these two examples in spite of the writing faults i did like the show br br the other problem i had was that i just could not accept <UNK> <UNK> in this roll in my opinion she is too inexperienced and lightweight to carry this part she never walked anywhere she <UNK> and far too often she came to an abrupt stop on her mark br br she also lacked any really emotional facial expression or <UNK> she either has a <UNK> look or a cute smile rarely are other emotions apparent when she tries to appear dramatic she begins her line looking away and turns her eyes to her fellow actor or <UNK> she begins her line looking at her opposite and then looks away both are annoying when done as a replacement for true emotion an example of her lack of <UNK> is in episode 20 two <UNK> and a funeral during her second wedding speech is devoid of emotion <UNK> hearts in our hearts br br i liked all of the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable with improved writing and a lead change calling might have made it
<START> this wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny entertaining sweet and memorable it's difficult to decide where to start br br from the opening number <UNK> connection paul <UNK> excellent score sung with gusto by <UNK> d frog which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about throughout the story this is one fun movie br br essentially it's a road trip movie where <UNK> travels cross country with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain along the way our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors comedians singers and musicians who <UNK> are muppets like <UNK> himself is this how the muppets really started approximately how it happened <UNK> tells us br br not since it's a mad mad mad mad world has the cameo formula been used so and successfully the aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their odyssey some just blink across the screen but others have very memorable cameos steve <UNK> amusing bit as a rude <UNK> is probably the best <UNK> jim <UNK> nod to his inspiration edgar <UNK> is especially touching br br anyone who ever watched the muppets tv show will get to see all of their favorite characters they're all here the <UNK> work is magnificent look especially for <UNK> riding a <UNK> how <UNK> do <UNK> in jokes and references to old movies are everywhere but the best one liners are reserved for <UNK> himself an example when the crooks are <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> she <UNK> says to her short green and handsome beau i wouldn't give up this evening together for anything would you <UNK> make me an offer i also love the <UNK> at the ok <UNK> scene brilliantly absurd silliness br br gotta get <UNK> right along now but to <UNK> a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age or movie genre taste highly recommended
<START> craig <UNK> is now officially a writer director for whom i will see any film by no matter how bad it may look his debut <UNK> and flow was one of my favorites from that year with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic <UNK> characters i wasn't quite sure what i would end up thinking after seeing this <UNK> effort the cast seemed great the trailer used music effectively however it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity and fast fortunately black snake <UNK> hits all its marks dead on the acting is astonishing the writing superb and the editing style as well as <UNK> music riveting the whole way <UNK> seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and <UNK> as they set forward on their paths toward redemption br br the first moment i knew i was in for a treat was during the <UNK> credit sequence at the beginning like he did with <UNK> and flow <UNK> lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled <UNK> coming up the 70's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of <UNK> best from here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both <UNK> and <UNK> each <UNK> <UNK> the other while they journey to the <UNK> moment their paths finally cross the editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and wife leaves him for his brother each feels the loneliness and <UNK> to what they know in that to sex and <UNK> to the bottle only when <UNK> is left for dead at the side of the road and her <UNK> comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear br br samuel l jackson is fantastic as the older farmer trying to <UNK> his life with god and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him there are the moments of stoic <UNK> as well as those of with his captive patient you never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well also the character of <UNK> is not <UNK> up for very long despite what the trailers would have you believe the situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the <UNK> was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two as for that <UNK> girl christina <UNK> really shines i never really saw her as anything special but this role is a true breakthrough for her this girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has <UNK> her very deep down any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and <UNK> to be touched by any man available to let the image go away her <UNK> is not for pleasure but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her <UNK> <UNK> fully <UNK> the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism mention must also be made of justin timberlake again showing some real acting talent where this guy came from i have no clue but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he <UNK> out br br while not as solid and consistent as <UNK> and flow <UNK> still ranks equally to it in my mind because when it is on it is spectacular towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with this little light of mine singing out and earlier the interaction between captive and <UNK> when the chain is first introduced shows some top notch work the truly magical moment though is when jackson sings yes that is him throughout like it was <UNK> howard in <UNK> the titular song while a <UNK> <UNK> and the lights <UNK> if i don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year i won't be surprised what these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of one thing i think i really enjoy with work is the fact that he doesn't show <UNK> becoming redeemed heroes instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been or how bad life has been everyone can <UNK> for redemption and to be better people we don't have saints here but <UNK> people looking to right their ship if the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness no one really knows but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could
<START> i have recently become a huge fan of <UNK> i think he's the most deliciously original comedian to come along in ages he is refreshing and <UNK> in his routines which run the gamut of topics from how much bush sucks to the sleazy exploits of 1970s producer robert evans i'm a longtime fan of maria and her wide eyed innocent <UNK> routine whenever she effortlessly switches her naturally high pitched voice to one that is <UNK> and <UNK> i can't help but giggle i liked brian <UNK> long before i even knew he was on just shoot me and there is something so <UNK> funny about his aging nerd persona all three of these talented unique comedians <UNK> the comedians of comedy a netflix documentary about their u s tour they truly deserve to be stars and this tour gave them the recognition they so richly deserve i thought no i knew i'd like this movie br br but i was wrong instead of the three comics each getting their own routine segments the comedians of comedy is <UNK> down by meandering and dull documentary scenes that contain no humor no insight nothing of real interest i think there is a total of 30 minutes of <UNK> stand up routines total in the <UNK> minute movie what a rip off come on is anyone really interested in seeing our stars banter in their <UNK> where's the humor in seeing <UNK> in an <UNK> and a comic book shop does anyone find random diner scenes particularly funny if this movie couldn't have shown our comics <UNK> their stuff at least make it about what life is like on the road it's not even about that worst of all the comics never appear to be having real fun admits how bored he is doing a radio interview <UNK> <UNK> admits to how much he sucks at giving a tour of his home and <UNK> <UNK> every time the camera is pointed at her and her humor there is only <UNK> br br <UNK> these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional amazingly crafted humor that is a refreshing change of pace from the brainless entertainment of mainstream comics like <UNK> cook instead we have to sit through their mundane everyday routines on the road in a <UNK> bore of a movie whose quality could easily be <UNK> by any student film if you can locate any of or performances on dvd by all means do their talent should be a joy to behold not a chore like it is here
<START> if this film won the <UNK> award for best french language film then what kind of garbage is coming out of france these days br br the subject matter is an important one how the african <UNK> are kept as economic <UNK> by the international <UNK> that are supposed to be helping them namely the international <UNK> <UNK> and the world bank about 40 of the <UNK> budgets of several african nations go to <UNK> of western debt while their people suffer from disease and <UNK> br br but the subject matter was treated in the most dry manner that could be conceived by man <UNK> than the <UNK> that <UNK> the country of in which this film takes place more <UNK> and action lacking than any documentary i've ever seen and i'm a fan of the genre one witness after another comes forward in this trial that is captured on film that <UNK> the world bank <UNK> some critics may site the colorful visual <UNK> within the film but they were out of place and had no <UNK> soundtrack when they were on the screen they <UNK> better in a coffee table book than in this film br br even the characters in the film say something like this trial is boring and when will it be over everyone in the theater laughed were those people on the screen reading our minds br br danny glover had a brief appearance in this film it is a <UNK> movie within and it was set within <UNK> or it was also more ridiculous than any spaghetti western i've ever tried to avoid the only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was where a <UNK> bad guy accidentally shoots an african woman carrying a baby and shows no <UNK> whatsoever perhaps it was to <UNK> the <UNK> of the world bank and how it is unintentionally killing <UNK> br br and one last technical <UNK> shot the subtitles were difficult to read with so much light colors on the screen and not enough black outline to the subtitles themselves br br i've already <UNK> the movie for you don't be fooled by the hype no need to see this film you'll never get these two hours back in your life
<START> i never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re runs i actually enjoyed it for the first to third season once i saw the fourth and fifth one i was beginning to get <UNK> the first problem was that they did that irrelevant scenario of history repeating itself jr having a kid like his parents did the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone ex katie and franklin the third one was when they made jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and <UNK> to the point where i wanted to go into the t v and beat the stupidity out of him until he's unconscious the fourth one had to be that <UNK> <UNK> that claimed as a boyfriend the fifth one had to be katie she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her boyfriend franklin like the <UNK> he was the last but not least was <UNK> gray franklin franklin was just scary it was like watching a terrible combination of and <UNK> henderson only more annoying they seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show there was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that <UNK> can't act <UNK> i saw that kid just made me want slap he silly however b f before frank this show was funny and very entertaining
<START> has this ever happened to you i go into my local video store and see a few new <UNK> in the film noir section i spy a copy of a new arrival of a film i have never seen called naked <UNK> its from one of those mail order video companies that offers mostly looking copies of hard to find titles the description on the box sounds good the film has players i like sterling hayden gloria <UNK> and gene barry so i take it home and watch it about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts about half way through this film i started to dislike it by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i <UNK> it the film opens with cops questioning al willis on suspicion of robbery other than being drunk the police have nothing on him when he pushes a cop and demands to be allowed to go home the cops beat him up detective <UNK> arrives lets the cops finish the beating and then <UNK> willis is in the clear willis <UNK> he will get revenge later one of the police officers is shot dead with no evidence other that willis is sore about the beating <UNK> make willis his sole suspect despite the fact that his boss names a pair of <UNK> as suspects <UNK> <UNK> him but for lack evidence willis is released the next day two more cops are killed by a bomb this time <UNK> goes to the <UNK> that willis owns and tries to beat a confession out of him <UNK> doesn't know it but a local <UNK> whose paper has been <UNK> department of police brutality <UNK> a picture of <UNK> trying <UNK> willis and <UNK> is fired but <UNK> continues his pursuit and willis <UNK> to mexico where willis has a mistress <UNK> manages to convince his mistress who willis treats rather rough to help him prove willis is a killer what this film lacks is a convincing script the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it other than the fact that willis likes to tip a glass now and than there is nothing in the early part of the film to make us think that he is a crazy killer that <UNK> on his wife he treats his wife his kid and employees well early in the film one gets the impression that its <UNK> is the one whose is a loose cannon he seems to casually <UNK> of police brutality <UNK> for no reason is convinced from the very start willis has criminal past he seems to operate on the <UNK> of the old communist <UNK> secret police everyone is guilty of something we just have not found out about it yet later <UNK> shows kindness to <UNK> mistress and young son now we are supposed to like him sorry the early impression i got of <UNK> stuck with me too long and he is also a dumb cop only after he is fired and goes to mexico does he run a background check on willis and discovers that a warrant is out for him <UNK> in <UNK> why didn't he think of this before because this film hadn't used up enough running time the cast is good gene barry does well considering how poorly conceived his role of al willis is i'm big fan of 40's and 50's crime thrillers but not only did i not think this film was good it left a bad taste in my mouth something many modern films do but older films rarely do
<START> but at least this movie got what it deserved to be sent to the satellite of love to be <UNK> on by mike tom <UNK> and crow t robot from pearl <UNK> on mystery science theater 3000 is one of those long lost forgotten movies that are so bad you'll be guaranteed to have nightmares or depression later on in life even though the movie is not that old it's still a very forgotten type of movie if it had never been for the intelligent minds at mystery science theater 3000 the movie would not only seem like it was never made but the movie wouldn't be very enjoyable by us <UNK> br br in real life this movie is really bad in the satellite of love this movie is excellent
<START> having read the other comment about this superb piece of tv drama i felt compelled to balance things a little if you like you murders to be signature and serial and your cops to be british and shout a lot and the gore to be bloody and have a religious <UNK> then this hits every button not quite enough to put the shouting into the <UNK> <UNK> heights but otherwise highly rated ken is excellent as the <UNK> on the <UNK> and the guest stars are also well cast including edward <UNK> and art <UNK> recommended in response to the earlier comments although i accept that <UNK> would not drive away from a hit and run he had just witnessed his brother arrested for murder and i am fairly sure he does not see the boy move
<START> this ingenious and comedy packs many moments priceless and great sense of pace though overlong <UNK> satire with several classics scenes he has <UNK> role as a jewish <UNK> and dictator an offensive portrayal of hitler then the <UNK> is mistaken for the <UNK> <UNK> and happen events funny and acting of all casting as the co stars jack <UNK> as <UNK> alike henry daniel as <UNK> alike and billy gilbert as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by karl this splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes the funniest are the following 1 the one when during the wwi the <UNK> soldier along with a co pilot are flying in a turned plane without aware 2 dictator doing overacting speeches including a twisted <UNK> 3 playing with an enormous balloon of the world 4 the jew <UNK> <UNK> a man fitting to hungarian dance number 5 of 5 when and each try to keep his body higher than other in a chair among them br br hitler banned movie <UNK> to the germans due to its satire of him and put him in his death list after his <UNK> conquest of america the movie is co starred by <UNK> third of his four wives they were married in 1936 although no <UNK> of the marriage was made later one time finished the great dictator the picture was released in 1940 when chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a <UNK> suit but a brush with the house of un american activities was the <UNK> for the usa to refuse him re entry from britain and he <UNK> to switzerland
<START> <UNK> from 1988 touch of death is probably the most frustrating fulci film i've seen to date <UNK> me to join the chorus of horror fans who that his films get worse as you get later into his career considering the plot synopsis i was expecting some bloody bad natured fun with this one but for all its bizarre <UNK> it feels tedious even at a running time of just 80 minutes and suffers from <UNK> <UNK> production values and film making craft or lack thereof br br el story a gambling addict widower and <UNK> rich and strange women he finds via lonely hearts <UNK> before <UNK> them in gruesome fashion sometimes eating them or feeding them to animals and stealing their money to keep his <UNK> at bay sure it's unlikely that just one man would be the host for so much screwed up <UNK> all at once addict psycho <UNK> cannibal but this is fulci br br touch is actually the <UNK> and <UNK> looking fulci film i've seen there's almost nobody in it even in the background of shots out on the street for instance a who keeps appearing on the film's <UNK> to warn the non existent cast about the <UNK> latest <UNK> <UNK> out of the most pathetic tv studio on the planet he never even gets to look at the camera because has to read all the <UNK> off sheets of paper br br some scenes just go on and on with the protagonist <UNK> to himself about what he's done or what he's about to do but the acting is nowhere near good enough to sustain this kind of thing so the main outcome is viewer boredom the film also looks bland and ugly in general i've read that it was intended to be an italian <UNK> did it ever screen in that <UNK> with the amount of gore involved it seems unlikely and it does <UNK> of crappy old <UNK> production values br br this is also <UNK> first <UNK> into outright black humour but he's just too a director to make it work sometimes <UNK> cheerful or music is used to play against a gruesome scene for instance while the hero villain is <UNK> up a dead body in his basement the effect isn't really chilling or funny or ironic anything that you'd like it to be it's mostly just <UNK> and crappy br br there are of course some redeeming moments of gore that you'll be waiting for while trying to stay awake including the eventual murder by <UNK> of a woman who just won't quit life even after her face has been totally <UNK> apart with a bloody great club and a homeless guy who gets a car run back and forth over him about five times the most outrageous element of touch however is all the physical on the <UNK> <UNK> by the crazy guy <UNK> hairy <UNK> messy it's not like he sought out women with these features it's just the way all lonely hearts <UNK> are apparently there are plenty of shots of mr crazy secretly <UNK> while he's <UNK> up these women the black humour of such <UNK> <UNK> might have some staying power or <UNK> if the film wasn't so poorly executed in general in the end touch of death just seems like a really lazy <UNK> mess
<START> endless <UNK> about the evil world bank <UNK> <UNK> and the americans are blamed for all of <UNK> the movie is long about two hours but it seems longer the french actually occupied the country in which the movie takes place for centuries but are only <UNK> bad guys br br one doesn't learn enough about any of the characters to really care what's happening to are completely <UNK> to the preaching which goes on and on and on there's no plot no character development no humor except for a few <UNK> at bush and but that's almost cheating it's so easy and the production values are redemption there br br it is amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching about such a big topic and convey utterly zero real information the irish <UNK> i was dying and then the <UNK> came has more content br br the movie is boring the sub titles are tough to read there is no real content about the subject of the film and the propaganda is relentless br br skip this one
<START> a lot of things in this futuristic satire are more <UNK> funny than actually funny though it does have some laugh out loud moments but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it's mocking many situations aren't allowed to develop there's obvious <UNK> of <UNK> material and worst of all a narrator explains everything most of which needs no explanation probably because some preview audience didn't understand what was going on in other words a movie about <UNK> down has been you guessed it br br one hopes that a longer better version of this comedy will eventually surface on dvd and it will become the cult <UNK> it deserves to be but even in this <UNK> and somewhat comic spirit <UNK> form it's one of the more memorable films of the year a <UNK> of disgust against our culture and all the ways it's become and in the name of appealing to the <UNK> i watched it right after land of the dead george romero's latest <UNK> of the single idea that <UNK> zombies which is basically the same point judge is making yet where romero's <UNK> viewpoint now zombies <UNK> that needs to revolt against the rich seems hopelessly out of date <UNK> take is fresh dead on and far more disturbing just listen to the <UNK> in your movie audience <UNK> it up for president state of the union just like their counterparts on screen and you'll know that we're all doomed
<START> reading the comments i am struck by the obvious effect this wonderful film has on viewers but how can you watch this movie and not reflect that the <UNK> dialog was a subtle and oh so daring <UNK> to the authorities in control in what was then the <UNK> at that moment in history it wasn't the souls only in the time and place of the action being revealed the questions <UNK> asked are <UNK> provocative when directed to the here and now who are the real <UNK> i marvel that the writer stayed out of prison i read somewhere that great stress can be a <UNK> for producing great art this film is a masterpiece of <UNK> apparently pointing one way while asking the audience to look over my shoulder at what i'm really talking about what courage
<START> i didn't care much for this it seemed too contrived for a documentary also the filmmakers seemed to steer me towards certain characters and yet i was completely unsympathetic towards the protagonist because of what they chose to show me of him br br this movie disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting yet the movie fell flat because of snappy editing that didn't allow the viewer enough time to understand each scene the developments in the story were <UNK> over in <UNK> of showing the men in <UNK> or other stuff that was incidental to the tale that they were telling br br i'd that you skip this one and just read up on this story
<START> i just can't imagine any possible reasons why madsen and hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script they got <UNK> maybe or are they that badly out of money the main problem with the movie is that it's boring the conversations between <UNK> and <UNK> character are pointless just like the bored <UNK> between two buddies while drinking beer on a saturday night you never feel for any of the characters although <UNK> psycho killer is very likeable comparing to the other characters hopper always was a good actor and madsen does a fine job as the serial killer otherwise the acting is almost laughable there are about three scenes in the whole movie where something is actually happening each of them last about three minutes although the talking and thinking about murder and the nature of murderers scenes would have been interesting if they were scenes in a book the whole concept would've been interesting for a novel but a movie just can't bare with a story with that much inner thinking and so little action
<START> in my opinion national <UNK> is one of the top family <UNK> of all time it features mickey rooney as <UNK> taylor and elizabeth taylor as <UNK> brown br br <UNK> wins a race horse named pie in a she falls in love with it right away with the help of <UNK> an ex <UNK> they train it to race in the grand after the <UNK> who was <UNK> to race pie backs out at the last moment <UNK> convinces <UNK> to take his place br br this was a well put together motion picture fine storyline and top notch acting the inner play between elizabeth and mickey was magical this is a wonderful family picture expertly directed by clarence brown the photography is stunning this is a movie you will enjoy for years to come br br this picture is what made elizabeth taylor a household name both mickey and elizabeth remained close after the film they still send post cards to each other after all these many years br br one side note elizabeth loved the horse pie so much that the studio gave it to her
<START> peter crawford discovers a <UNK> on a <UNK> course with the moon but when the government doesn't believe him dumb fact 1 he builds a shelter in deep underground and is drawing lots to see who will go plus is willing to kill to save humanity dumb fact 2 with millions of dollars of technology how could a <UNK> see what <UNK> could not plus the ends <UNK> the means moral of this story is just plain wrong this movie is improbable and totally unbelievable what was running through these people minds why the hell do crap <UNK> like this get the green light some times i wonder who someone has to to get a movie made in this ing town
<START> i like a good novelty song no i take that back i love a good novelty song i absolutely despise on the other hand and have from the first note i ever heard when i found out someone had made a cartoon based on it my head almost <UNK> now that i have seen it because my kids <UNK> me i wish my head had <UNK> it would have saved me from the excruciating misery that was this <UNK> first of all making an hour long show based on a three minute novelty song is a ridiculous idea to stretch a song like this which had to pad like crazy just to be that long into an entire hour is even more ludicrous this was poorly written cheaply animated poorly acted the list goes on and on dear god is this ever bad
<START> well let's be fair following up a cult classic like road house is no easy task now <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> and you get a monumental task so with patrick not on board whose <UNK> idea was it to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage i am going to blame the director who didn't even provide 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the entire film i was actually shocked they got will <UNK> to jump on board <UNK> <UNK> did an ok job with the lead but the writing was atrocious turning down his partner brunette <UNK> crystal in the film's first 5 minutes made me want to <UNK> it right there but i stuck with the film hoping to catch a glimpse of that great cheesy humor that worked so well with the double no such luck the cover of the dvd is hilarious they show these two <UNK> <UNK> who make one 10 second appearance in the film <UNK> ellen actually puts in a decent performance as well but again the effort is <UNK> in a piece of garbage and disgrace such as this has jake busey ever been cast in a decent film could they not pull at least a few actors in from the first film for some kind of nostalgia treatment even one of the old <UNK> or two or jeff <UNK> for a performance would have been nice take this film out of your <UNK> immediately
<START> i bought a tape of this film based on the recommendation of other imdb users and have to say that i was very disappointed i'm a college professor and showed this movie to my class they <UNK> voted that it's a terrible film i guess that if you like the old dark shadows series then maybe you'll like this i liked dark shadows when i was a kid in the '70s but now i think it's just awful the first half hour or so at least has the virtue of some <UNK> to <UNK> novel after that the story <UNK> wildly off course at least as compared with the 1945 mgm version which won two oscars <UNK> <UNK> as lord henry is really about the only thing watchable in the whole production a lot of the other acting is bad the music is melodramatic and look of the film is terrible actually it's not a film at all it was obviously shot on video and has that <UNK> claustrophobic bbc look about it the opening scenes are particularly poorly lit the women's costumes are terrible the men look all right and a lot of the characters including <UNK> seem to have 1970s rather than victorian <UNK> the movie does well to include a lot of <UNK> dialog but the voice over narration in the voice of <UNK> contains a lot of rubbish that directly <UNK> <UNK> character i'm a big oscar <UNK> fan and i fear that he must have rolled over violently in his grave when this monstrosity was made its only improvement over the 1945 version is that the homosexual subtext is definitely more apparent without being heavy handed i haven't seen either of the more recent versions but if one is interested in seeing the story well told i would have to recommend the 1945 mgm black and white over this one
<START> i spotted this film in a branch of the <UNK> reed <UNK> in new york on holiday and it seemed like a bit of silly fun and sure enough the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action film for kids and their parents too br br 10 year old ricky bernard jordan <UNK> has his head in the clouds most of the time much to his father's larry miller <UNK> as a member of his school orchestra ricky and <UNK> fly to a concert performance and once again <UNK> mind <UNK> and suspects some criminal plot is happening br br reluctantly aided by best friend <UNK> who is a fan of hot <UNK> what a strange plot device that was and others they try to get to solve the mystery oh yes and <UNK> skills 1 000 hours of flight <UNK> experience prove to be handy when he is called on to save the day in the film's thrilling climax it was good to see eric roberts and mark play parts in a family film and watching the dvd interviews everyone seems to have had great fun taking part br br i totally liked junior pilot charming and good natured performances funny plot line and a real sense of enjoyment and sheer silliness br br if you are looking for an entertaining family film you could do far worse than buy this one
<START> i'm not <UNK> with movies oh i've seen so much crap i could watch anything maybe that was the reason i watched this one to the end im big fan of <UNK> games too but this movie its a disgrace to any self <UNK> there is the security camera footage of a game play would make it feel more realistic than this movie does the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong in some scenes you can see that it was filmed in some photo when spoilers ahead people running around does not <UNK> people sitting near computers i mean would you continue your work if you got ninjas around you oh and the jokes about pirates that's the worst one yet in movies spoilers end at least first one felt like a documentary now it looks like <UNK> home video experiment you can find better movies at youtube top line don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes
<START> this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same generic and boring there's really nothing worth watching here a complete waste of the then barely <UNK> talents of ice t and ice cube who've each <UNK> many times over that they are capable of acting and acting well don't bother with this one go see new jack city <UNK> or watch new york undercover for ice t or <UNK> n the hood higher learning or friday for ice cube and see the real deal ice <UNK> horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film <UNK> at the teeth and i'm still wondering what the heck bill paxton was doing in this film and why the heck does he always play the exact same character from aliens <UNK> every film i've seen with bill paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character and at least in aliens his character died which made it somewhat <UNK> br br overall this is second rate action trash there are countless better films to see and if you really want to see this one watch judgement night which is practically a <UNK> copy but has better acting and a better script the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera the cinematography was almost refreshing which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself but not quite 4 10
<START> spoiler warning br br this is probably my least favourite cary grant film i spent most of the time thinking ignore him leave him etc is he trying to kill her should we assume that after the end when he <UNK> her to return home with him that he will kill her after all i see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers critics have taken finishing early is after all a more reasonable way to film a book than to change the ending and this is a more <UNK> change of ending than for example in altman's the long goodbye unlike hitchcock's earlier example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star has been cast when <UNK> park refers to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> murderous <UNK> are not mentioned the <UNK> ending is not definitely ruled out br br in robin <UNK> hitchcock's films <UNK> he writes as one mentally from ending to ending the significance of every scene changes the apparent <UNK> of the narrative <UNK> the illusion of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the film becomes a text in which the process of narrative is <UNK> i enjoy playing intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else but unless the film stands on a straightforward reading then it fails this one fails even after considering the fatal glasses of milk that <UNK> in a few hitchcock films br br an annoying <UNK> the year is 1941 nothing in the film says that it is set in the past <UNK> bruce keeps his money in a paris bank and goes there to do financial business does he not know that there is a war on indeed were there still any <UNK> from <UNK> airport is he on good terms with the nazis how come it is never suggested that the germans shot him as a spy or something br br a curiosity when <UNK> and <UNK> have dinner with <UNK> the mystery writer and her brother the <UNK> there is a fifth person present who is never explained nor introduced a woman in a <UNK> the credits say that she is <UNK> playing <UNK> is this not an example of how lesbians were <UNK> in <UNK> films are we to take her as lover the books that discuss overt and hidden gays lesbians in hitchcock e g robin wood again do not include <UNK>
<START> well i can safely say i'm human wong and i didn't throw up i laughed and laughed if this movie made you <UNK> there is something wrong with you but this movie is incredible i bought it four days ago and have watched it 5 times already the animal cruelty gets my heart but not long enough to be guilty the movie is shocking disgusting and vulgar the acting is horrific what else do you want from a movie i am a die hard cult film maniac pink <UNK> is awesome it makes rocky horror as someone has said look like the <UNK>
<START> for some reason my father in law gave me a copy of this tape i think because my great uncle buddy <UNK> was the giant in this movie and my father in law thought i'd like to see it i had years before as a child and didn't like it then either br br my son then two watched it and was hooked every waking moment in front of the tv this horrid video played i went to work with the inane songs stuck in my head the two leads were worse than a junior high stage review the dancers looked like rejects from an ed wood horror flick and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> their parts in thankfully i was able to distract my son long enough to lose this <UNK> frankly i think it was the tape from the ring br br to correct another reviewer buddy <UNK> is the uncle of <UNK> max <UNK> jr not his father 0 out of 10
<START> <UNK> the pretty adopted daughter of a recently deceased japanese businessman <UNK> control of her father's company her uncle <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that he wasn't left the business to run orders a hit on his niece when <UNK> <UNK> chef takashi enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks out hit man <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill <UNK> instead he falls for the pretty <UNK> and ends up <UNK> to protect her however she is kidnapped by men while is <UNK> playing an <UNK> game with cop daniel sam lee br br uncle <UNK> keeps <UNK> in a hypnotic <UNK> and takes control of the business but runs into a spot of bother himself when his gangster pals <UNK> to reveal his illegal activities unless he allows them total control br br meanwhile teams up with two martial arts experts <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> candy lo who are hunting <UNK> he learns kung fu and attempts to free <UNK> br br a mixture of broad slapstick humour and fight scenes no problem 2 is a disappointing film considering the talent involved 80s kung fu superstar <UNK> <UNK> manages a few fight scenes but is getting a little old for <UNK> these days director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> delivers the kind of dumb parody <UNK> i'd expect from a scary movie film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to mocking his character in operation <UNK> and sam well sam lee is as annoying as always br br on the other hand <UNK> <UNK> as gangster ben impressed me he has an obviously strong screen presence which has not gone <UNK> by has since starred in two of the matrix movies and is soon to appear in d o a directed by corey <UNK> i was also impressed by but for an entirely different reason this beauty is easy on the eye and should go much further in the film business br br there is some fun to be had from working out what movies are being <UNK> but at <UNK> minutes i found this film a real chore to sit through if people pulling funny faces accompanied by silly sound effects makes you burst your sides laughing then no problem 2 might appeal to you otherwise i would leave well alone
<START> <UNK> <UNK> the young and talented spanish director clearly shows us he is a serious film maker anyone <UNK> it should have a look at his latest film the sea inside this is a movie that has been rewarded with numerous <UNK> not only in spain but throughout the world wherever this wonderful movie has been shown br br if you have not seen the film perhaps you would like to stop here br br <UNK> is a man confined to bed being he depends on the kindness of strangers for everything since his accident <UNK> only thinks in one thing alone how to end his life this is the moral issue at the center of the story based on the real <UNK> life br br mr <UNK> tells the story from <UNK> point of view there is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part after all he relies on facts that were well known in his country as this case became a cause <UNK> in favor of <UNK> a theme that no one in that country wanted to deal with in spain br br with its background of being a <UNK> roman catholic country spain has evolved into one of the most <UNK> societies in europe a distinction that is more notable because of its long years dominated by a dictator yet in spite of the advances in that society the idea of taking one's own life is something not clearly understood by the majority of its citizens who still considered this subject as something that could not be done in their country br br <UNK> was a man that loved life he lived an intense life as a young man when he <UNK> as a sailor to discover the world having no money this was the only way for him to see other lands experience other cultures <UNK> love affair with the sea is something that people in <UNK> learn to love from their childhood imagine how that same friendly sea is the one that takes away <UNK> life as he knew it in a second <UNK> goes from a vibrant young man into a <UNK> br br <UNK> family is <UNK> by the experience suddenly they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home his brother and sister in law are stoic people that deal with the situation as a matter of fact their lives become something of an <UNK> because <UNK> life comes first they tend to the sick man without <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive br br that is why in their minds the can't comprehend <UNK> wishes to end it all haven't they given up having a normal life to take care of him this moral issue <UNK> heavily on these <UNK> and simple people because in their minds they are doing what came naturally br br the second subject of the movie is the legal issue of the <UNK> and the well meaning people that suddenly enter <UNK> life in their desire to help him put an end to his suffering there's julia the lawyer who is herself handicapped and suffers from a rare there is <UNK> the fish worker who becomes <UNK> with <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> makes a brilliant <UNK> his transformation is total we don't doubt from one moment he is no one else but the <UNK> man on that bed mr <UNK> can only use his face in order to convey all the emotions trapped inside <UNK> mr <UNK> makes this man real this is perhaps <UNK> best role of his career he surpasses his own award winning performance as <UNK> the late cuban poet he portrayed in before night falls br br in the supporting roles <UNK> makes an impressive appearance as julia the woman fighting her own physical problems lola is also effective as <UNK> the <UNK> soul that loves <UNK> deeply as <UNK> brother shows a man at a <UNK> of his own life mabel <UNK> makes a compassionate the sister in law that never asks anything of life but tends to <UNK> without questioning why she has to do it at all br br mr <UNK> also has composed the haunting music score for the film he is a man that never <UNK> to surprise one wonders what his next project will be but one wishes him success in whatever he might decide to do in the future
<START> the monster will look very familiar to you so will the rest of the film if you've seen a half dozen of these teenagers trapped in the woods movies okay so they're not teenagers this time but they may as well be three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly abandoned ghost town in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a <UNK> century and a half before you'd think that with a title like <UNK> massacre some interesting things might happen they don't in fact only about 1 10 of the film actually takes place in the mine i had <UNK> teams of terrified <UNK> <UNK> for their lives in the <UNK> confines of their <UNK> praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim <UNK> <UNK> his grisly revenge but instead i got <UNK> twenty somethings <UNK> and in one case <UNK> in the woods a gang of morons with a collective i q that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker <UNK> much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine no suspense no scares and a couple of embarrassing performances somebody forgot to tell the writers that <UNK> gold refers to the <UNK> of the gold not the people who are looking for it 3 10
<START> this is a superb game for the <UNK> with superb graphics and a great one player story line and even better multi player game best played with 4 people br br the many levels and <UNK> for weapons mean that this is one of the best games around for years
<START> there are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst saw is just that br br the movie is simply bad on all points the plot the acting the camera work the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and i cannot begin to comprehend how such trash made it to the big screen br br the simple fact is that saw is <UNK> with plot holes the beginning is <UNK> and leaves much to be expected but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd the film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility people that claim that this movie is gory violent sadistic and scary are sissy girls who have nightmares after watching <UNK> because it is far from that br br so i am warning you know do not attempt to watch this if you have any form of intellect because you will be disappointed a true bore and a mediocre film as can be
<START> superhero movie 2008 is the most recent in the long line over parody movie movies which i despise so much i wish this movie could be the death of the genre but i know that it isn't awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin br br if meet the <UNK> is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go than superhero movie is probably near the top unfortunately meet the <UNK> was actually miles below the barrel and this movie just barely makes it in br br superhero movie has a decent cast of c list <UNK> it's got drake bell the kid from disney's drake and josh leslie <UNK> airplane tracy morgan snl and 30 rock and a few others scattered throughout although it has the star power to light a 40 <UNK> <UNK> the movie fails to <UNK> any humor br br this movie is about 80 minutes long most of which is dedicated to following the <UNK> plot and not one single joke is funny i didn't laugh or chuckle or <UNK> the entire time br br don't see this movie don't even think about it for the love of cinema just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another one br br oh who am i kidding they'll probably come out with another one by fall
<START> like a lot of films from the early sounds days <UNK> must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment the hammy acting of lead richard <UNK> nominated for best actor can be <UNK> as a <UNK> of the silent film school of acting however even giving benefits of the doubt <UNK> is a badly shaped piece of drama a <UNK> film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact the film is two hours and four minutes it feels like four hours when you're watching it there is no reason to waste your time on it unless you want to see every best picture winner or have a keen interest in the early sound days in my opinion <UNK> is the worst choice for best picture in academy history and the award should have gone to city lights or little <UNK> <UNK> is barely remembered today and would have be remembered at all if not for its oscar win
<START> the magic garden is perhaps one of my most vivid '70s childhood memories two hippie chicks with <UNK> carole and paula would swing on <UNK> tell jokes they picked off the chuckle <UNK> dress up with costumes they found in a giant chest called the and argue with a <UNK> pink <UNK> named sherlock that lived in one of their trees they also could <UNK> a mean <UNK> guitar and sing a pretty melody this was a great childhood show very 70s feeling but that's the problem they don't make shows like this anymore pity that you could tell these two girls really had hearts of gold and loved kids they were really sweet magic garden is one of those shows that if they came out with a box set people would buy it because its such a <UNK> walk down memory lane
<START> the film is one of the best horror films i have ever seen overall i'm not a big fan of horror films but there is something about this film that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror film i have ever seen many horror films i've seen i've enjoyed watching however as they are based on horror i know that the stories are unreal as they are fictional therefore i can't take them all seriously on the other hand is a unique horror genre as it has a feel of realism that i've seen in very few other horror films br br this films story on how a man gets murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming nightmare as its a very unique and original storyline most horror films i've seen are all quite fake but because was so incredibly sophisticated and directed with superb acting especially by craig <UNK> aaron <UNK> amazing special effects great lighting and fantastic dialogue i found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity with no silly fake horror parody whatsoever that many other horror films have as well as being horror has elements of thriller romance and action all <UNK> in one if you haven't seen this film i recommend you watch it as i rate it a 10 10
<START> the casting and direction in <UNK> is more insipid than inspired in this noir <UNK> that fails from the outset to get off the ground robert <UNK> wooden style poses a <UNK> almost immediately for the highly affected kate hepburn and it's bad chemistry from the outset br br naive and innocent ann hamilton hepburn falls for handsome airplane <UNK> alan taylor and rushes to the <UNK> with him she soon finds out there is a lot she does not know about him as alan becomes more remote she <UNK> further into the murky past and ann soon finds herself living a nightmare instead of the american dream br br <UNK> resembles a few hitchcock plots but vincent minnelli rapidly <UNK> he is no master of suspense hepburn is no <UNK> <UNK> and she is a hard sell for a character more suited to the <UNK> styles of <UNK> wright or joan fontaine minnelli never really succeeds in getting kate to <UNK> in desperate fashion to <UNK> limited abilities as an actor her attempts come across as silent <UNK> while <UNK> wide descent into madness takes on restrained bela lugosi robert mitchum <UNK> the <UNK> as the sensitive brother talk about <UNK> on br br cinematographer karl provides some highly stylized noir interiors but minnelli and cast <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and the tension remains tepid with minnelli far from his <UNK> musicals and <UNK> victim role fitting her like a bad suit <UNK> <UNK> all involved
<START> the residents are a band known for their strange appearances and odd musical <UNK> so obviously their music videos aren't going to be exactly normal in fact these little videos are <UNK> and bizarre but have a huge artistic value to them the atmosphere is built with lighting and thoughtful visuals it's a great watching experience br br basically <UNK> <UNK> just consists of many residents music videos made for their songs the music itself <UNK> from rock to <UNK> music that sounds like it's straight out of an 80s horror film what doesn't change is the quality of these videos they're great br br any fan of art films will love these they're so original with their visuals and the angles they are filmed at and the lighting especially make these so interesting the music is creepy and catchy and highly original and these short films are mini classics that deserve multiple <UNK> this is a near perfect collection of short videos br br my rating out of <UNK> mins
<START> i know i loved this movie when i was 12 14 years old now that i am 24 i watched it again and i wished i hadn't because all the things i laughed at when i was younger is no longer funny so this is an hour and a half without fun for me the jokes were lame not funny or just too childish so the same thing i loved about the movie when i was a kid is now the things i don't like about it besides not being funny it is not actually believable at all the evil character is very poorly done but i guess that is the kind of movie it is and the last 20 minutes of the movie is pretty lame with bad fighting sequences and so on but if you are young you will probably love it i rate this movie 4 10
<START> is torture ever right no the answer is simple and absolute with no <UNK> possible the reason as this film showed is the effect torture has on a society the values that have been hard fought for in western society through centuries of revolution and struggle are for all men and women to be allowed to live in a free and open society one where individuals are treated equally and with respect to their essential rights as humans to protect this society <UNK> have been developed to deal with <UNK> openly fairly and honestly these <UNK> have been adapted and <UNK> through generations of hard work one could argue that these are the true of democracy as they belong to us all allow us all to be heard if we allow <UNK> acts to be committed in our name if we split our society into those who have rights and those who don't then we <UNK> the work of our <UNK> moreover we are all <UNK> and all guilty and <UNK> whether those that we <UNK> are guilty or not is of no importance we are defined by our attitudes and our <UNK>
<START> this is one of the best films i have ever seen how anyone can knock this movie just my imagination first of all <UNK> and <UNK> performances were simply spectacular especially gooding that is the only way i can describe the acting spectacular you have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off then you see gooding and his performance was magical as for the plot since it was based on a true person it goes where the lives of the characters go for all the action buffs it might be a little slow but then it's not an action film i definitely give this movie a 10 it deserves nothing less
<START> it looked cool from the movie <UNK> but after five minutes we weren't sure if it was a homosexual documentary of west side story without any female interest the film quality was poor and there was hardly enough gang fighting action to sustain even the person's interest for long enough to watch the entire film may god have mercy on the souls of both the actors and the filmmakers responsible for what i can only describe as my new one and only reason why i never will want to see or trust an australian made film again i have to write more so i will again say that the actors were so bad that i'm positive i could make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of <UNK> please don't see this movie for your own sake
<START> however closely the movie is to the comics it doesn't matter this movie <UNK> moves away from the boredom of interview with the vampire although it's acting was good and <UNK> in the wonderful action scenes very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all <UNK> poor graphics does it matter nope
<START> in all honesty i haven't seen this film for many years but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory as anyone who has seen it will understand i first saw it as a child at a <UNK> halloween party in the early sixties and it scared the hell out of us kids in a fun way i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the <UNK> i can't risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared <UNK> followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny <UNK> to a movie in film history and yet oddly moving in a way you have to see it for yourself which is not easy these days i don't know if it's available on home video or not but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults
<START> i have found this show by accident and was surprised to find out that nobody i know has ever heard of it this was by far one of the best shows i have seen in months if not years and i cannot wait for more episodes to come out sleeper cell portrays a psychological struggle of an undercover agent inside of a terrorist cell who has to constantly make difficult decisions in order to maintain his cover while staying true to his real cause this is an extremely well done show it keeps you intrigued from the first episode till the end and though <UNK> slowly is fast enough for you to feel on the edge quite realistic and <UNK> it touches on important topics and every episode presents an interesting question to <UNK> about this show is not 24 or any of the cop shows on tv and is not trying to be anything either it is genuine and unique it is a show about a human being his difficult choices and his life of struggle where a simple mistake can cost him everything br br i gave this show a 10 for great storyline good progression excellent cinematography excellent music and realistic characters each with a story to tell
<START> seriously i thought it was a spoof when i saw it at the rental store but i realized it was just crap i can't even believe i didn't shut it off like we all know those snakes weren't they were <UNK> and <UNK> the acting was lame and i still cant believe the ending <UNK> if your gonna watch it just watch it for the end it was seriously priceless way better then <UNK> sense i don't even know if the makers of the movie actually thought this title would fly the only time it is really going to fly is when i throw it in the garbage just watch it for a laugh it was hilarious in the stupidest way don't buy just rent
<START> some teen <UNK> go to an old deserted farm house left to one of them by their dead grandfather unaware that there had been several murders there decades earlier because their grandfather had made a <UNK> with the devil for a good <UNK> couldn't the guy have thought of something better to sell his soul for the man's <UNK> and his friends are set up to be the next sacrifice for reasons which are never explained the stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend the black guy with a white girlfriend and the two lesbians have to do battle with three killer scarecrows but don't be tricked like i was this isn't nearly as fun as it sounds it's mostly just a lot of <UNK> chat about ball kicking <UNK> smoking and the lead actor complaining about never knowing his parents the camera work is atrocious and shaky maybe done on a hand held camcorder in some scenes which maybe a good thing since the scarecrows look like they just came from some kid's birthday party and apparently they could only hire two people to play the three scarecrows some of the best movies i've seen have been these low budget independent horror movies but this one is just pathetic the cast and crew seems to have just been made up of a bunch of people who knew each other had never acted before and had no intention of acting again and had a few thousand dollars i can't believe this movie cost <UNK> 000 to make and a weekend of free time on their hands even the lesbian skinny <UNK> scene is lame br br i think it's amusing also that as of this writing there is a sequel to this film which no one has even bothered adding to imdb br br out of and i only rate it that highly only because of the skinny <UNK> scene no matter how lame it may be
<START> solid documentary about kids who first surf then <UNK> in the face of the american dream sadly some of the youngest and most gifted <UNK> to the lure of drugs while others become slaves to the crass marketing of their go for broke instincts few come out on top but the die is cast and fruit of it all is the new national <UNK> <UNK> the new york times notes that it was once considered a <UNK> to authority now however <UNK> has its own summer camps video games magazines actually it always had these and corporate <UNK> <UNK> co <UNK> another kid cultural
<START> now for sure this is one of the <UNK> hearted stories that bruce willis has been in to date and yet it is still touching i really like <UNK> style and persona i haven't loved everything he has ever been in but he brings it to the <UNK> <UNK> for me in most all his film <UNK> br br the story begins he is power confidence and style with a <UNK> <UNK> he drives a <UNK> he lives well in a <UNK> estate with a grand view of the fair city that's russell he is an image <UNK> to those who are on the top or rising to it his acclaim he is russell he knows what it takes to make it it just seems that as life is going along <UNK> and foundation ally set there is a problem an intruder at his home the alarm has been <UNK> br br russell can't seem to figure out for the moment what is happening to him it's different and yet it is somehow familiar a small boy who looks exactly like him as their lives run <UNK> <UNK> into each other there seems to be a reason that is screaming out to him you have unfinished business to take care of now br br amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that he has seen and has in his life she works with him puts up with his and yet she is smitten with russell very much so with rusty his past now in the picture and talking a mile a minute singing too late at night everything that was <UNK> is becoming like <UNK> br br willis is fun <UNK> and at times out of his head in this lovable disney modern times classic 'the <UNK> and to add his little heavy duty side kick spencer <UNK> is a perfect addition to this <UNK> story of childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure <UNK> <UNK> is an inspirational supporting character as he is the heavy weight <UNK> teaching <UNK> rusty how to box to defend himself against the bullies on the <UNK> br br all in all this is a real winner of a movie with even <UNK> <UNK> as the secretary and <UNK> to russell i originally saw this back in and then again years later with equal enjoyment this is a shiny family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any disney fan recommended highly
<START> why it's none other than <UNK> played hilariously bad by miles <UNK> surprisingly i had the misfortune of sitting through this turkey before mystery science theater 3000 <UNK> it to pieces i highly recommend checking out the mst3k version since it's hilarious and one of their best episodes ever br br the movie on it's own is basically the kind of typical b movie <UNK> that italian film makers were <UNK> out in the early to mid 80's this film was apparently made to cash in on the conan <UNK> but it fails miserably on all counts br br keep an eye out for the scenes where <UNK> fights a giant rubber snake and also manages to make a complete hang <UNK> during a <UNK> br br <UNK> fish is ready br br rating the movie itself 1 the mst3k version 10
<START> if the directors producers <UNK> wish to promote a film as based on actual events and make a film that is meant to inspire and have meaning then for a start to maintain any sort of <UNK> and integrity you would want to keep a film as honest as you possibly can br br a team wearing all black <UNK> and doing the in america is just plain dumb any half intelligent person would know that the all blacks are the national <UNK> union team of new zealand and their <UNK> are all black and the is performed by them as a part of a traditional dance br br having such stupidity in a movie without explanation merely <UNK> the credibility of the movie to zero and <UNK> the message and inspiration that the movie is trying to achieve br br the question is why why would you do such a stupid thing and for what possible gain br br i can only conclude that the writers or director or producers have seen it on tv before a international <UNK> union match and thought wow that would be great in our movie no one will know that it never happened they're all too dumb to know about <UNK> <UNK> the all blacks this will be great br br how would an <UNK> audience react to a movie made in <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> iron with a team wearing an american indian costumes and war paint doing a native american indian war dance running round in circles shouting oh woo woo woo oh woo woo woo react they'd laugh their heads off br br the people that made this movie and the industry that <UNK> it really should have their heads read for some reason the industry thinks that they can fool all the people all the time br br it's just dumb
<START> nicole <UNK> madonna is just being released from prison although she is ordered to go by bus to philadelphia she wants to stick around the place she was arrested this is because she claims she has information that would clear her record <UNK> dunne is assigned to <UNK> her to the bus by his future father in law will be driving around the city anyway in his future mother in <UNK> rolls <UNK> picking up the wedding ring and a rare big big cat for an eccentric collector <UNK> however starts the ensuing mayhem as soon as she jumps in the rolls to take over the driving between big cats taxi drivers hit men and a wedding cake with guns lawyer knows he's not in kansas anymore is there a way out of the madness this film is a wild trip down comedy <UNK> madonna and perfect <UNK> to each other making their connection <UNK> as they play out their roles as an ex con and an uptight button down lawyer respectively the script is <UNK> in it's ability to send the viewer into fits of <UNK> as one implausible scene gives way to the next one and the next everything secondary from the supporting actors to the scenery to the costumes are also quite nice if you know someone who is in need of a <UNK> of joy rent this movie for them you will both be <UNK>
<START> it may not be oscar material however this was a very funny film i was always a fan of eddie <UNK> bottom young ones were legendary tv <UNK> and it was about time they made a film some of the stuff they get up to is brilliant from the <UNK> is the rear end to the rubber sex pants as well was the infamous line that <UNK> says when he falls and a candle he is carrying goes into his eye he says to eddie candle in the eye candle in the eye and eddie been the <UNK> that he is sticks the candle he's carrying into his eye can't forget when eddie is on his <UNK> and he needs to <UNK> it was a great comedy not to be taken seriously at all but the film lacked with an ending br br overall a comedy full of laughs and lots of fake green vomit a 9 10 br br
<START> a few <UNK> kids <UNK> <UNK> an evil that has <UNK> <UNK> for the past twenty years and have to <UNK> the ill fortune that comes with that the campbell <UNK> film before this midnight <UNK> was fun their picture after the red <UNK> was all right so why is demon summer so mind numbingly bad i really don't know it is better then their splatter rampage wrestling but not be much as the basement level of acting is cringe worthy and when a <UNK> film is as talky as this one is that's not a good thing the story's been done to death in many other better films so why waste your time on this one br br my grade d
<START> this is a family comedy in the very best senses of the term about faith and family ann <UNK> with the help of everybody's favorite grandpa edmund <UNK> gets divine help in <UNK> the above the would be vengeance schemes of mccarthy john mcintire pure fun
<START> ali g has got to be one of the funniest films i've seen in a long time and <UNK> portrayal of a british <UNK> is hilarious this film has cult classic written all over it and it features some really great lines ali g is a good time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end definitely vote ali g and keep it real
<START> the most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors the sense of <UNK> in their dialogue and dances this typical rising star musical has an <UNK> plot even for 1944 but because of the actors it's still fun to watch hayworth isn't even that much of a dancer but she has a lot of charm that fits her character kelly plays his usual caring <UNK> role while <UNK> provides plenty of self <UNK> and laughs the movie can also be very serious at times not a must see but recommended if you like the actors
<START> another film to <UNK> us for the crime of enjoying pulp fiction br br if you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half <UNK> probably fit the bill fans of the debut episode of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the title character <UNK> literally thousands of seemingly <UNK> soldiers single <UNK> will really go for it br br otherwise it's not exactly a clever movie in fact all it is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people sometimes an entire scene goes by and the only thing that happens is you guessed it someone gets shot or to spice things up twenty people get shot first they're just sitting there the next minute they're sitting there dead <UNK> br br rough plot a young american goes to paris an american in paris get it hires a prostitute the <UNK> julie <UNK> gets in touch with some old french buddies one of which has aids they plan and attempt a bank heist of course movie convention states that no bank <UNK> on film go off w o a <UNK> and this <UNK> takes up about three quarters of the running time it's like dog day afternoon without the sidney <UNK> wit patience or humanity while at the bank things go wrong surprise and the <UNK> with aids goes <UNK> with his <UNK> several hundred times no spoilers here but suffice to say that you're at such an emotional distance from these characters that it's not likely you'll care who lives and who dies by the end of the film br br some have called it stylish perhaps it is but it's someone else's style it's a movie that's already been done and killing <UNK> is trapped by convention nowhere in the course of the movie does the director roger co winner of the pulp fiction screenplay oscar do anything really original stylish funky or outrageous unless you consider the fact that no movie that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high body count there isn't anything else to set this one apart from the <UNK>
<START> warning spoiler spoiler spoiler br br this is written for <UNK> who may have walked away from mood for love <UNK> and confused about paths the main characters choose in life from reading other comments and reviews it seems that many viewers and critics missed some very important details which may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful <UNK> of a movie br br we are so use to seeing blatant sex in <UNK> that we forget that there was a time when <UNK> would suggest the dirty deed by simply showing the slack mouthed couples ride off in a <UNK> or <UNK> only to return into the next scene with a <UNK> gut or a fat <UNK> stuck to the hip meet your child br br the director chose the same nostalgic approach in telling the story of mr <UNK> and mrs chan last warning spoiler spoiler spoiler br br mr <UNK> fools mrs chan into showing her real emotions when they <UNK> his departure forever next scene mrs chan <UNK> her head on mr <UNK> in the taxi and says i do not want to go home tonight translation let's do it br br why then did the couple just not do the modern thing of <UNK> their cheating <UNK> get a divorce raise their love child and live happily ever after the answer is that this whole story takes place in hong kong during the sixties a bastard would live in a bleak life of shame if he were the child of an <UNK> whereas a legitimate child could live a tragic but noble honest life if his mother chose to raise him away from his cheating father the invisible mr chan in short mr <UNK> and mrs chan sacrifices their relationship for the future of their child br br that is why mr <UNK> upon learning that mrs chan lives alone with a little boy gives a knowing smile and ends his dreams of making mrs chan his mrs <UNK> he then also realizes why mrs chan went to all the way to <UNK> to be with him only to <UNK> at the last and leave choosing to never see him again but not before taking some <UNK> mr <UNK> lives with this wonderful secret with no one to tell no one except for a <UNK> temple wall and of course we the viewer but only if we listen
<START> i believe this film was made for the not so <UNK> sum of but that didn't really show there wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of the actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of <UNK> stranded on a mysterious deserted and <UNK> planet none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their <UNK> alive there weren't any great explanations of what was going on which can be really contrived so a lot of the plot was left to your imagination rather like the big empty which was a film i also enjoyed i found that i quite <UNK> to most of the characters there were some perhaps unintentionally amusing moments the men were so ordinary that you felt you could <UNK> with them and the film's climax and ending were quite poignant i think mr and his crew should be quite proud of themselves i've seen worse films with a budget of millions
<START> although this movie is inaccurate overall there are some items that may be true certainly he was a wild character in his youth having played practical jokes on his fellow <UNK> at west point almost <UNK> several times <UNK> last in his class of <UNK> and often reckless in his <UNK> during the civil war br br but history may have made him a <UNK> goat of the indian wars certainly he did his share of cruel things but how much was he under orders also there is evidence that he <UNK> before <UNK> at great risk to his <UNK> and command that he <UNK> about the fairness of breaking <UNK> with the indians and that if he was an indian he would also fight rather than live on a <UNK> br br as a character said in the play when asked what will be said about the british about losing the revolutionary war the character states history will do what it always does it will lie who knows how bad a man <UNK> was certainly he wasn't the sympathetic character as portrayed by errol flynn and later by ronald reagan but i also doubt he was completely evil as he is later portrayed
<START> i would probably say this was on a par with films like devil's rain and that sort of film although this is probably a bit better made i love 70's horror and this has most of the elements that make up other movies i like so it was pretty easy to enjoy a family on their vacation stumble across a small town where the people seem to be <UNK> by some sort of <UNK> seems like the children have been disappearing after an initial attempt to flee this place the family is somehow stopped on the edge of town and find their way back but not without first finding a house where the kids are gone and <UNK> and daddy are dead seems like we have a different kind of twist on a senior citizen community center in this town they're all satan <UNK> and they need the kids to <UNK> their lives so they can continue on in their service i guess not that anyone seems too keen on giving up their kids for this enterprise this is fairly classy considering that it's scary and creepy without <UNK> of gore or the loud startling events that try to make people jump in films today which seem to have replaced actual scares we have hank <UNK> moore from green <UNK> as <UNK> a <UNK> deputy that reads <UNK> magazines and jones as the sheriff and a very familiar character actor as the dad of the stranded family and martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty <UNK> to his fellow <UNK> this is pretty good stuff but a tad on the confusing side sometimes but overall works pretty well is recommended for fans of 70's horror 8 out of 10
<START> foolish <UNK> go camping in the <UNK> mountains only to run into a murderous <UNK> gypsy br br the prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination the victim characters are all too familiar idiot teens which means one doesn't really care about them we just wonder when they will die not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless unnecessary nature footage however it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere and a decent music score by don still it's business as usual for dead <UNK> movies br br there are much better films in this vein but over all the prey may be watchable enough for die hard slasher fans although one might be more rewarded to watch just before dawn 1981 wrong turn 2003 or even the final terror 1983 again br br 1 2 out of
<START> spoilers br br br br br br br br br br this is br br this is not br br practically everyone is written horribly out of character when it comes to characterization the only bright spot is the friendship between and <UNK> br br also the <UNK> is not <UNK> for her actions which amount to mind control rape if a male villain had done to one of the women what does to then he would have rightfully so painfully bought it at the end of the movie dying horribly and the audience would have <UNK> but not only does pay no price for her crimes <UNK> actually <UNK> and understands her actions no the real <UNK> would have <UNK> her for what had done to her beloved the audience i saw this with myself included all <UNK> <UNK> at this scene br br anime fans avoid this movie fans avoid this movie even harder
<START> this performance leaves you with no wishes we saw it in germany and it is breathtaking we only got the cheap tickets at the far back but still had a view over everything that happened if you ever get the chance to see this live then go it is worth the trip and if i were you i would wait a good half an hour after the show to <UNK> <UNK> the performances are breathtaking and all around the <UNK> there are dressed performers that are there to distract help smile and generally make the whole <UNK> come alive the music live music is as good as the cd version perfect i bought a dvd later but the show that was filmed had less colourful costumes it's the atmosphere in the <UNK> that <UNK> you from your feet a great trip for old and young and a great film too
<START> this move is bad on so many levels i don't even know where to start ok the good points <UNK> is beautiful as a dirty outlaw in black leather some of the landscape photography was stunning that's about it oh and it was a nice touch having the buffalo head above the bar door in i figure it was a nod to the buffalo soldiers the movie starts sort of ok but the characters are so flat so comic book so the bad guys are just over the top bad i choke trying to describe them further the spanish cuban american war was <UNK> <UNK> with america being involved only in april to august of <UNK> i think the movie said it took place in <UNK> i could be wrong but i don't want to look at it again to check a big part of this movie <UNK> on the <UNK> killing <UNK> daddy well boys the original <UNK> started in <UNK> and was destroyed by president andrew johnson in <UNK> the <UNK> wasn't even around during the time period of this movie of course the nasty <UNK> got busy again in <UNK> and we know the rest of that but for the purpose of the movie it is historically incorrect and that was a major part of the plot i think i could make myself crazy going into it a lot more so here a few <UNK> and i'm done i didn't know that and other bands like that got their inspiration from new orleans street singers from the <UNK> i also didn't know that fetish <UNK> were all the rage for <UNK> women in the <UNK> but then i was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing 1 nails we just about died laughing and i like a cheesy western more than most people do such a waste of talent and money this really had the chance to show a part of american history that isn't well known http www <UNK> net people <UNK> for some more information this could have been so good but it was just bad from 1 10 this gets a 1 instead of a zero because mario looks good in his hat and there was an <UNK> horse in the film
<START> who the heck had the bright idea of casting lucille ball in this film it should have been angela <UNK> baby all the way at the very least lucy should have had her singing dubbed br br there is some <UNK> in the fact that jerry <UNK> score is pretty well kept intact except for that's how young i feel and we do get performances by the original broadway cast members jane and <UNK> arthur br br i suppose robert preston had to be given a song hence the inferior loving you br br overall i think in this one the wrong <UNK> was cast
<START> a horrible horrible horrible film i saw the original when i was a kid and it gave me nightmares into my teens when i found out a remake was on the way i <UNK> why oh why remake a good film well we can thank dark castle for yet another classic horror film this time they've replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore slower than slow pacing and yawn inspired characters someone previously said that s he was surprised that paris hilton can act uh were you watching the film she plays a <UNK> little tramp sounds like <UNK> to me half of the people in the audience actually <UNK> when she died that tells you why people are seeing this film if that's your only reason then find a better one because like a black hole this thing will suck out more of your life than you'll want had i been alone i would have left 10 minutes into the boring exposition this thing is like a <UNK> guide to crap film making in <UNK> southern <UNK> stupid but attractive leads knives a plenty gore a plenty stock menacing truck i could go on after watching this film i began to really appreciate <UNK> <UNK> and i thought that film sucked save yourself and avoid this <UNK> at every cost
<START> i just saw checking out at the philadelphia film festival what a terrific combination of a heartwarming storyline and a great cast director jeff <UNK> has done an outstanding job of <UNK> the audience into the disjointed yet hilarious world of morris and family the family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy the crazy antics yet feel the real pain and concern they have for one another br br typically i am not a peter falk fan but he is morris and plays the role with great humor and humanity br br i hope that everyone gets to see this wonderful movie and enjoy it as i did br br hats off to the director cast and crew for a job well done
<START> john voight plays the title character in this movie based on author pat <UNK> prince of <UNK> autobiography a fine teacher film it tells the story of a naive pat <UNK> a young english teacher whose first assignment is in an <UNK> school on a rural island the only white man on the island he must battle internal and <UNK> <UNK> as he attempts to <UNK> education and values in children who for generations have been <UNK> denied such things a solid performance that really makes you think
<START> ram <UNK> <UNK> usually makes so so cookie cutter formula fare lifted from some hollywood flick his every film after <UNK> is in the cookie cutter genre occasionally he makes a truly horrible movie like this one br br for the first <UNK> minutes we are introduced to the only 2 characters a struggling <UNK> <UNK> as a skilled dancer go figure and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in bollywood they fall in love zero becomes hero dancer <UNK> gets no break <UNK> angst the usual <UNK> more <UNK> angst song dance angst some more <UNK> more ridiculous <UNK> and before you know it you're fast asleep and this despite the hot sexy hot hot sexy hot <UNK> of the leading lady <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dancer br br but hey you're not alone the editor director photographer in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru out the entire production only difference being they got paid to <UNK> while you paid money for this crap so you lose ha <UNK> on you don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high rise <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> and exercise wear <UNK> <UNK> when will the poor <UNK> get a break she's <UNK> br br cannot act <UNK> lost his <UNK> <UNK> tried hard but failed no plot no story nothing she must've paid <UNK> <UNK> to make this all nonsense stuff in addition to free <UNK> lessons on his casting couch what a super deal no need for an acting career br br such absolute rubbish can only be made in bollywood of course
<START> if i rate the film maybe a bit high you can blame it on sentiment this is one of the first movies that i remember seeing and totally loving i saw it at the drive ins here in california in the late 70s i was already a big fan of the muppet show on tv so i was <UNK> for the movie and the movie did not disappoint basically it takes the whole <UNK> <UNK> of the muppet show and <UNK> it from vaudeville into a road movie <UNK> the frog is on a quest to become famous not because he wants to take <UNK> <UNK> and ride in a private jet but because he wants to make millions of people happy of course br br along the way he picks up all his beloved muppet friends most <UNK> <UNK> bear who he meets at a seedy bar doing stand up they sing <UNK> right along a song that has always <UNK> me with its upbeat melody and its theme of friendship and shared discovery he also encounters enough hollywood movie stars to fill a stanley kramer movie including comedy <UNK> like richard <UNK> steve martin edgar <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and mel brooks brooks in particular has a rather dull bit and you are left feeling that <UNK> could have cut a few of these cameos out if he wasn't afraid of <UNK> the stars anyway as <UNK> a road trip movie like this the very first person he meets is dom <UNK> br br the ending is one of the more odd examples of literally breaking down the 4th wall that you will find in any children's movie the hollywood dream seems to be <UNK> all about them when a real <UNK> <UNK> the hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery i'm sure this was meant to relate to some of jim <UNK> own personal or spiritual experiences br br this is the best movie with muppets by a long shot if you or anyone else was wondering why the muppets were so popular back in the 70s considering how poor the movies have been for the last few decades i think this film has at least aged well enough to provide a clue
<START> for the most part i only enjoy the kind of movie that allows one to escape the current time into the future or past this movie is pure <UNK> the dancing starts almost immediately and debra <UNK> in her purple <UNK> bikini dress simply has no equal in film in my opinion her dancing while <UNK> is <UNK> by her dance in fritz <UNK> tiger of available on dvd where she played the temple dancer br br one problem with the movie is the closed setting there are few <UNK> scenes shot and they as well as other scenes are a bit claustrophobic the same locations are used over and over again but with some interesting secret <UNK> and her secret double identity is totally unbelievable with beauty of that <UNK> debra even <UNK> a <UNK> and holds 2 enemy soldiers at bay on a <UNK> she could do it all br br what does work is debra <UNK> as a princess with her beauty she certainly would be the center of attention anywhere at any time in history this movie when hopefully it becomes available on dvd will be a must buy overall taken with a bit of humor i loved it br br
<START> calling this film a decent or enjoyable horror tribute is far too optimistic heck you can't even refer to it as a nice spoof of the genre because it's way below average it's funny but not haha funny you know but still i'd say to give it a look if only for the huge amount of trivia elements in it by the way all those people <UNK> complaining about this movie here in their comments have only themselves to blame when you see the dvd cover of this film you should already know that it's not going to be on the same level as the piano for example so don't come complaining afterwards br br evil ed could've been something but the totally screwed it up i suppose the main idea behind this film is criticism towards the growing <UNK> in horror nowadays it shows an editor named edward who's slowly well not too slowly going nuts by seeing all the violence and gore in the movies produced by his company produced the big boss is named sam campbell funny isn't it personally i also expected a character named bruce <UNK> but to my surprise there wasn't anyway this guy became rich by making movies called loose limbs they feature and i'm not kidding you scenes in which a girl is getting raped by a <UNK> and then gets shot in the head by a <UNK> now who says horror isn't original anymore br br with all the gore and the it's hard to believe it but it really gets boring very quick after a decent first 25 minutes evil ed turns into complete boredom and never <UNK> from that the only think left to do then besides pushing the <UNK> button of course is look for the obvious amount of references to other much better horror films i saw scenes obviously stolen from the evil dead silence of the <UNK> <UNK> and several others and there's a huge amount of classic horror posters on the walls to admire as well br br evil ed finds it origin in sweden i'm convinced there's a lot up talent there far north take the danish as an example but none of them talents joined the cast or crew of evil ed only to see if you're in a dumb mood and you don't want to use your brain at all
<START> is one of the worst films direct to video films that i see ever br br i am not amazing that this product does not appearing at the cinema bad visual effects the start is dreadful bad actors i <UNK> understand why appear in this film the great dennis hopper and bad screen without sense my alternative or <UNK> sentence for do not watch this film
<START> well anne is way way too old <UNK> looks younger than she and he should not <UNK> is much too young and too cheerful oh sister mary is way too pretty she is supposed to be average not pretty when this actress complains the way mary should all i think is that she is too pretty to be a <UNK> lady russell is too old this is crazy if you read the novel she is <UNK> older more mature friend maybe as old as mother would be which would be around 18 20 years older than anne so around 50 not 70 its crazy doesn't fit how come anne is so darn happy in the beginning she smiles when she says oh the worst is over i've seen him now the worst has passed yeah right ok if anyone has seen the 1995 roger <UNK> version than you cant compare these two that one is right on this one is way off read the novel and you'll know what i mean
<START> this film says everything there is to say about religion i wish it were required viewing for all <UNK> and would be br br the story set in a turn of the century danish <UNK> is about two very religious sisters whose late father was a rigid priest who <UNK> all their dreams of love and exploring the world and its many beauty they are now old and their life and beauty spent their quiet new help whom they teach to cook is <UNK> played by the lovely <UNK> who <UNK> so many of her husband claude <UNK> films the life in the village is simple and the stark direction reflects that br br when <UNK> wins the <UNK> she <UNK> a chance to prepare a feast a true <UNK> of love the course of the feast and its chief guest reveal messages of love and <UNK> and how there are many ways to love god and life br br this is a must see for the devotion with which <UNK> <UNK> the feast and for the speech the general gives at the end possibly the best international film of the 1980's
<START> this is one of the best episodes from the entire x files series creepy beyond words the tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie this episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such <UNK> as home <UNK> bad blood and for being the best in their respective season br br <UNK> and growing relationship is put to the test in this episode can they really trust each other this episode also contains a tiny scene that will leave romantic viewers smiling br br <UNK> bring your
<START> the cure is one of the few movies i rated 10 out of 10 i mean everything is flawless for me in this motion picture i saw it almost a year ago and yet i remember many of the scenes especially the final touching scene that comes with the credits br br the two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and this greatly contributes the excellent storyline making the film perfect br br the message is clear friendship and it's displayed throughout the whole thing br br i have nothing more to say here simplicity is one of the things i love so much about this film and of course it's fun and moving at the same time <UNK> people of any age br br 10 10 nicely done
<START> this film which i rented under the title black voodoo should be avoided i was expecting a <UNK> horror flick but what i got was a very dull standard ghost <UNK> in this case the ghost was that of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment but who's <UNK> was ignored and he died in an operation the result his spirit nurse <UNK> and forces her to commit acts of murder the only voodoo connection was to one of the three black characters in this case a <UNK> ex football player who's mom <UNK> voodoo the film is very slow and very dull there is a very standard ending that provides on excitement followed by a <UNK> stupid ending warning spoiler br br in which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she was possessed this movie is slow and bad in a non funny just <UNK> way avoid it at all costs
<START> for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s its shocking how not a lot of people know about it br br this movie is definitely worth a look it has all the things you need for a horror movie especially the good old chills br br i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago but i couldn't remember the name of it so i came to imdb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title i eventually got the name of the title and bought the movie i still love it as much as i did all those years ago br br buy this movie
<START> this movie <UNK> there is not much more to it the final fight looked like walker taking on my grandmother not some supernatural demon with the strength of ten men i found the commercials more interesting the plot twists and jokes could be seen coming a mile away the only redeeming quality of this film was that it ended avoid this at all costs unless you enjoy bad chuck norris movies
<START> kudos to <UNK> for making this look like a real movie the first time that's happened in this series with the notable exception of the f x scenes in moving closer to movie production values however it lost most of the entertainment value of the first two they were very much in the <UNK> bad they're <UNK> category of horrendous film entertainment can an argument be made though that the were simply trying to make a generic action film with praying in it there are so many times in the film where they <UNK> their own belief system as to be annoying if everything that happens is according to god's will and they are simply his <UNK> than the people who are infected with the virus have that happen as a part of his plan right apply that to every situation where someone of faith doesn't submit to god's will and you get a fairly <UNK> little movie from the director of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i like the earlier description of this movie as a life poem i caught this totally at random on the movie channel last night and was captivated enough to stick with it the whole way there's really just a unique voice to the film a poetry of narration that's meaningful without <UNK> into <UNK> there's also many hilarious moments from middle school days that are crude without being <UNK> humor it's sad that this movie is so low rated the fact that there are so many <UNK> makes me think the numbers are <UNK> i can't see how anyone could see the movie as that abysmal sure this is by no means a typical romantic comedy but it is a very unique viewpoint of a very unique life of a man whose very appeal comes from his <UNK> a <UNK> he must overcome before it destroys him give this flick a chance it came out of nowhere for me and i feel the <UNK> for it
<START> i once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on turner classic movies about 6 months back i thought every minute of what i was watching was gold and because it was somewhere in the film's middle and i didn't want to spoil the whole thing if i were to watch it from the start i decided that i would rent it immediately well the video store which i frequent did not have a copy so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it i had previous to that experience only seen some chaplin shorts funny but not greatly <UNK> but after i saw the <UNK> of the great dictator i checked out three of his other films city lights the gold rush and modern times city lights was great i found the gold rush a little overrated but still worthwhile and i found modern times to be one of the funniest films i've ever seen second funniest behind keaton's sherlock jr more exactly br br finally the whole of the great dictator well to be honest it had its moments both of comedy and of drama but these moments don't always mix well <UNK> comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama city lights is the best example of this but it didn't always work with social commentary plus the fact that there was dialogue <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> talent don't get me wrong i liked the movie as a whole but i thought it of little consequence i would have given it a solid 7 10 on the ratings scale if not for the ending the final speech that the jewish <UNK> gives is enormously powerful yes it is to the et <UNK> of 1940 but his message is perfectly <UNK> to the world today the speech brought me to tears and i consider it one of the best endings i've ever seen final score 8 10
<START> <UNK> this one came directly from the jaws cookie cutter mold with some other bizarre cliches thrown in for good measure i was interested in seeing this after finding a still from it in a book about italian horror films and wow i guess i got what i deserved br br very slow moving and talky much of this killer shark movie takes place on land which isn't really that surprising it seems like the only method they had of showing a shark is through shots of a shark in an <UNK> the shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors and that's too bad most of the characters are so annoying that you actually wish they would get eaten br br the plot concerns a group of four kids who meet up with a mysterious indian on the beach one day while <UNK> <UNK> the indian for some reason gives them an ancient <UNK> that will allow them to track an ancient evil that assumed the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe supposedly because they were too good at fishing the ocean and the ocean god was worried they would take all the fish or something like that br br it's a good thing too because wouldn't ya know it years later a monster shark appears and starts <UNK> up people in the sleepy <UNK> community when one of the four guys are eaten by the shark the remaining three are determined to kill the thing especially since big shocker here the authorities have killed a shark and they think the threat is over yawn br br the obligatory death scenes are unbelievably tedious and you can see them coming a mile away my favorite was the girl who has a fight with her boyfriend while they're sitting in a van then jumps out and says i'm going for a swim immediately to be <UNK> up by the waiting shark they had a lot of nerve calling this film deep blood since you hardly see any just <UNK> water the actors handle their cliched roles like they're all thumbs and there is even a hilarious subplot involving a <UNK> rocker type bad boy who threatens our <UNK> <UNK> heroes then turns good in the end to help kill the shark br br it took me a really long time to find this film it is rather obscure so i don't think there's any danger of too many people wasting their time on this however if you should be <UNK> into it don't say you weren't warned
<START> a <UNK> dull mystery thriller which may sound pretty sound <UNK> but plays out very poorly the ludicrous script is full of minor spoiler people dying and then coming back to life when the plot requires them to and the director doesn't seem able to work up any energy and suspense the <UNK> sequence that kind of explains the film's title is the only halfway memorable one in this tiresome film 1 2
<START> every great once in a while you stumble upon a movie that <UNK> even your <UNK> expectations given the imdb rating of 4 0 i wasn't really expecting much with the <UNK> of satan i hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like the devil's rain or any of the other early 70s similarly themed satanic horror films i <UNK> have been more wrong what i got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast i really enjoyed speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away the film's style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early 70s the <UNK> of satan doesn't beat you over the head with plot points and explanations a lot is left to the viewer to fill in the <UNK> as a viewer you know something is <UNK> but for the longest period you're just not sure what it is the unknown helps make for a far <UNK> atmosphere than most similar films the ending is effective with its surreal imagery i sat in <UNK> as the final credits began to roll those wanting a big slam bang finale will be disappointed with the <UNK> simplicity a lesser film would have tried to pull out all the stops and would most likely have failed miserably br br there are moments in the film where it's easy to forget the director bernard had primarily worked in television before the <UNK> of satan there are a few scenes that are so well set up lit and shot that even the most accomplished of directors could learn a thing or two for example i've seen enough films over the years to realize that directors can sometimes seem to have trouble shooting widescreen shots <UNK> not here the scene where the men are discussing their plan of action in the <UNK> office is amazing we see all five men at once Â– each doing their own thing as in real life in a lesser film we might see all the men at once but each would be <UNK> quietly waiting their turn to deliver their dialogue it's a small scene but it looks so natural and is so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments of the <UNK> of satan br br finally i mentioned the acting in my opening so without going into a long <UNK> speech i'll just say that the <UNK> of satan features martin and l q jones any film with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me
<START> picture this someone makes a film about the <UNK> or virginia tech massacre only the film is directed by the guy who did home alone i know this isn't but bare with me and stars sean <UNK> off of <UNK> picture the terrorists being <UNK> by <UNK> of water on top of doors and <UNK> and this is why you need to see the film unfortunately it doesn't go all the way by actually having the <UNK> lying on the floor for the evil <UNK> to trip on but its halfway there you have to give it above 7 for that but not a 9 because it didn't go crazy enough pity its seemed like it would be comical cheesiness well worth a cult status
<START> i would ward off any temptation to view this movie it is quite simply dull the characters are predictable and mindless the assassin is quite there is no tension fun no style or even a <UNK> of originality to be found in this train wreck and the <UNK> of hollywood <UNK> are <UNK> oh and you have a movie that makes a hero of an ira terrorist cute and now i need to speak some more to fill up the ten lines and a little bit more is that enough not quite how about now no well further should do the trick but the is really not worth ten lines of exposition the original was great though
<START> great horror comedy from michael davis <UNK> laughing so hard i almost <UNK> great acting from eric as the good guy who saves the day great performance by the jack black esquire like performance from justin <UNK> he was just divine in this film this guy deserves to be a big star also <UNK> brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the guys from a killer reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> the gore to was given in <UNK> amounts i loved it i just hope they release a not rated version great low budget horror comedy the dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just <UNK> funny out of
<START> i've seen every episode and the characters have all remained the same self absorbed <UNK> little <UNK> thought out there's no character development in 5 years getting pregnant is not development if your still the same <UNK> girl only now <UNK> to danny because dad isn't around sam never changes or grows which makes her boring repetitive and just so annoying its sickening after season 3 danny is a typical soft character that gets ordered about by everyone in his life he has no principals morals of his own especially mary and the old boring clichÃ© will they wont they on and off relationship does get boring very fast indeed br br james <UNK> can act and his character is ok to watch only he is just another hack writers wet dream an ex cia man that has huge contacts and training etc so he can stop any thief or <UNK> known to man even though the cameras cant do half the stuff they make out its fun for a while however in 5 years the writers act very dumb why because they have all this expensive and advanced technology but no simple <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is fast and easy you never see security walking the floor only when there's a situation and suddenly everyone is just there br br the plots very quickly move from the cheating and robbing the casino in one way or another to awful typical american boy girl relation ships the same done to death material seen all over the world they have sex but i hate you i've always loved you i think i do but i love her him instead but what if maybe one day blah blah blah br br i'd recommend to people who like las vegas it has so much more going for it simply because the characters are interesting engaging and not forced down our throat for 6 months of the year br br i'm glad to be british Â– i'd rather see the same actors in 5 different shows rather than 5 years consistently getting worst in the same one
<START> the wind easily one of the worst films ever made the only good that comes from this kind of pointless drivel is the fact that seeing films like this get distribution makes <UNK> horror filmmakers like me confident that my upcoming feature will make the cut too i mean if this represents the market for <UNK> horror i could make a fortune <UNK> myself taking out the garbage for <UNK> minutes br br a complete list of what this film lacks would take way too long to write out but the are no story terrible acting awful cinematography and virtually no editing that last one bothered me the most as an editor myself this film drove me absolutely crazy because it had almost no editing at all every scene was shot in a master they had absolutely no coverage at all for anyone who doesn't know coverage is shooting a scene from multiple angles to have cutting <UNK> when editing to make for a <UNK> viewing experience yeah this movie had none of that i'm talking about even the <UNK> of scenes example an ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table would typically start out with a master establishing who's in the scene and where they are then as the conversation goes on you would cut back and forth to over the shoulder shots as the conversation continues you may even throw in a <UNK> shot or two of something on the table or in someone's hand anything this is film 101 stuff guys it seems as though these people had no idea this is how films work every shot was a camera lock down no movement no cutting no nothing if i was teaching a course in filmmaking this would be the visual aid for my what not to do lesson br br in closing don't waste your time folks the only amazing this about this film is that it ever scored distribution at all br br br br
<START> i watched the world premiere of this on the <UNK> action channel they call it vampires the turning the plot was a little confusing there is a voice over in the introduction about an <UNK> year war and i didn't quite understand the movie is about a young couple somewhere in asia maybe in china i don't think the movie <UNK> the couple has an argument and meredith monroe runs off and is kidnapped by a biker gang of vampires the boyfriend finds a group of vampires that don't kill humans and enters into a battle with the <UNK> a human group of <UNK> somehow get involved and the final fight sequence takes place during a <UNK> <UNK> this movie is not related to either vampires or vampires los <UNK> confusing but decent action four out of 10 stars
<START> this movie is based on a stephen king novel in which mysterious new <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> max von <UNK> offers each citizen of castle rock the item he or she most desires but there is a heavy price to be paid for these local sheriff alan <UNK> ed harris is soon forced to deal with a variety of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances br br below average for stephen king cinema i can see why some people would think it was boring it <UNK> along without offering genuine scares and forces the viewer to spend time yet again with a bunch of repulsive losers whose hatred of each other is spooky br br i do enjoy the novel and don't believe that this lackluster movie does it justice there are too many unfortunate changes from book to screen br br von <UNK> makes <UNK> much too charming we're supposed to be scared of <UNK> at the right times not amused by him i also hate it that the <UNK> primary deputy ray is written and portrayed as such an annoying barney <UNK> type moron star ed harris looks as if he was forced into doing this picture by his agent but professional that he is he really sinks his teeth into his dialog bonnie <UNK> as love interest polly and amanda plummer in one of her standard mentally <UNK> roles come the closest to creating characters who are likable br br yet it is also foul and mean spirited br br although i'll be <UNK> if it didn't feel a little <UNK> watching a bunch of unlikable movie characters tear each other to pieces the climax has some good explosions br br i often give movies a better rating than they probably deserve but in this case i feel i should really be honest and just say 3 10
<START> this movie could be a bit boring for some people but i find this film br br very interesting in terms of an attempt to reveal a tradition br br the director <UNK> has made two films about traditional music in korea before this film the film before this one was showing the music throughout the film and this film is trying to achieve similar things by having backgrounds in the movie just like a painting br br another thing is that the story is written by both director and a <UNK> kim who is well known <UNK> in korea holding a lot of degrees including doctor at i'm not saying that educated people make better films but that <UNK> is an expert in traditional culture in korea so it gives more credit on this film
<START> i always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a <UNK> <UNK> at some of the old movies that are re released on dvd before you purchase them that way you could save yourself some time money and a certain degree of when you feel so utterly let down br br the buddy holly story is such a movie br br i do not wish to go into the characterizations or the holes in the plot or the messing around with historical facts that this movie <UNK> for i had already come to terms with them twenty years ago when i first began watching it br br i had recorded it on the old <UNK> machine back in the early 1980s and liked it so much that it became a regularly played favourite the best part to my mind was gary <UNK> performance as the young buddy and his near perfect <UNK> and guitar playing br br i looked forward to the day when i could have it in <UNK> and that is where the disappointment comes in br br this dvd version is supposedly re <UNK> in both audio and video according to the shell information but i'm afraid it left me sadly let down and <UNK> at my watch wishing for it to end br br the sound is murky <UNK> on the <UNK> and so <UNK> mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal clarity <UNK> of my old <UNK> tape br br despite what you think of the images or the plot or the characters the real draw card here is the music and if you can't hear the lead <UNK> because they are drowned out by the or the backing <UNK> or other then there's not much left is there br br i'm going to <UNK> my old <UNK> version to <UNK> dvd for subsequent viewings and put this one where it belongs out with the rubbish br br <UNK> is the rule survival is the exception
<START> less than two hundred and fifty years ago the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of <UNK> history this is the story of a <UNK> captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of and <UNK> from the <UNK> of the <UNK> to the <UNK> houses of london br br hmm that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a movie doesn't it well it's not tho it's not totally without value as a <UNK> piece out of 20th century fox anne of the <UNK> is adapted by philip dunne arthur <UNK> from a short story written by herbert <UNK> direction is by jacques <UNK> the score is by <UNK> <UNK> and harry jackson is providing the technicolor photography jean peters is in the titular title role of anne aka captain <UNK> and support comes from louis debra <UNK> herbert marshall thomas <UNK> james robertson justice br br originally meant to be be based on true life pirate anne <UNK> the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity and finding herself in the <UNK> male led world of <UNK> and sea based <UNK> filled with clichÃ©s and over familiar set pieces the film also suffers from a cast that is largely <UNK> peters gives it a right good go and <UNK> lights up the screen with <UNK> beauty while robertson justice although underused actually looks the part and doesn't <UNK> like the rest of the male cast does some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings purely because it's <UNK> in the directing chair but there is no depth here this is merely a job for <UNK> a professional one granted but its <UNK> plotted and actually lacking <UNK> to go with the <UNK> in the action stakes br br <UNK> at best 4 10
<START> drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the safety <UNK> taken at a nuclear is directed well and a pretty interesting film from the late 70s its not amazing but its solid the acting is pretty good especially jack lemmon but douglas and fonda were good too it was a pretty good screenplay and direction was solid and suitable this is definitely not one of the best films of the 70s but its one of the better ones a good early michael douglas film and lemmon in his prime imdb rating 7 2 my rating so in simple words solid but not amazing thats what this film is solid but not amazing 8 10
<START> this happened to be just starting on tv when i opened it and as i felt too lazy to change the channel i ended up watching it man was that fortunate br br this film is more of a fairy tale than a demanding drama and at times openly sentimental one it is definitely what one could call a feel good movie and i usually find such either boring or irritating yet this film is so very well done i could not help but love it the script will not twist your brain it is conventional but flawless the actors are brilliant every single one is a perfect fit for the role there is not much of a score but the bits of music enhance the movie beautifully br br if you can appreciate other things than expensive <UNK> vicious murders or saving the world in a movie do watch this if you ever have the chance 5 5
<START> if you get a chance to get a hold of this lost for many years gem i doubt you will be disappointed ps has an odd blend of social satire and ultra cool <UNK> even hints of slapstick but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time nothing has been seen like it since br br i strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated especially with spike lee's <UNK> a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message good filmmaking disjointed script br br robert direction is brilliant allowing many of his actors to <UNK> the film gets better as it goes along and the jokes <UNK> from hit or miss one liners that are as forgiven as those found in a mel brooks comedy to sheer non pc 'i can't believe they just said <UNK> fun br br favorite parts the commercials the film switches from gritty black and white depictions of the ad agency to beautiful perhaps <UNK> color and gets away with it br br i refuse to hint at any spoilers but if you get the chance to see the dvd version be sure and watch the downey interview but leave it until after the movie br br my vote 10 10 most underrated film of the late 60's early 70's thank you prince
<START> okay now i know where all those boring cop homicide tv shows came from i do believe they can be <UNK> back to this movie scene of the crime feels more like a tv episode or an episode of a serial complete with stock characters and situations the <UNK> cop who <UNK> with his superiors the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job despite failing <UNK> the reckless rookie the double crossing dame etc br br i like many of the actors here and they do a good job but overall i found this movie dull as i'm not a fan of the genre i kept <UNK> out when they were discussing the case something about <UNK> and <UNK> and oh yeah there was a stripper played by the previously wholesome gloria <UNK> what i want to know is why did she keep calling van johnson uncle <UNK> wasn't uncle <UNK> a rabbit a character from a children's book what the heck does that have to do with anything i guess i just don't get tough guy film noir ish kinda <UNK> br br in fact much of the dialogue made me <UNK> nobody talks like that however i could relate to one scene where the <UNK> wife <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> every time he goes to work realizes that maybe she shouldn't have made her husband the center of her life yeah i know that feeling of loving someone so much being so <UNK> on them that there's a constant fear for their safety so there are moments of truth in this film underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self <UNK> to be gritty and real that it actually seems unreal to me br br a little background this movie was made when <UNK> took over mgm from louis b <UNK> and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made mgm so great <UNK> was determined to bring more realism to movies i kinda hate <UNK> maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious bleak movies being made today <UNK> in the ugly truths about life focusing on and in my opinion helping to <UNK> the worst of humanity rather than the best no longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do providing a necessary distraction during the great depression and world war ii br br well damn it we still need that kind of distraction today there's still plenty of depression and plenty of war and what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape trashy brain <UNK> reality tv thanks a lot <UNK>
<START> i was <UNK> through the movies on demand and saw underdog for free and it was only <UNK> minutes long so i decided to watch it i wasn't expecting much but it <UNK> my expectations of being awful everything about the movie was cringe worthy the dialogue was atrocious including many terrible <UNK> the jokes were also terrible i found myself yelling and flipping off my television screen while i was suffering through this trash it hit its target audience very well but i don't see how anyone else could enjoy this film it made me very angry and nearly cry because of everything terrible this film had going for it br br the only enjoyable thing about this movie was being able to give it a 1 10 after viewing it i beg you to avoid it at all costs i understand the fact that its made for kids but there is nothing likable about it at all
<START> final fantasy <UNK> children is and will remain a classic example of style over substance gone wrong instead of drawing upon the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game square <UNK> has <UNK> out a <UNK> montage of incomprehensible battle scenes yes i said incomprehensible did you know that knows <UNK> fast kung fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second that cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in <UNK> for a full minute while wildly swinging away with his 2 ton sword the english dub is mediocre while not bad it is far from well produced the quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub br br here is what i'd like to say to the die hard fans who can't stop <UNK> over this movie <UNK> children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from square <UNK> but even a trashy cg flick like had a better story you'll be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought in due time the days of its novelty are <UNK> br br movies like <UNK> children make me question whether square <UNK> <UNK> the potential of its <UNK> after all and no offense it's a japanese company japanese <UNK> can deliver fun games but most of their offerings are <UNK> shallow they are utter <UNK> however when it comes to production quality <UNK> children features some of the most breathtaking <UNK> in cg history but that doesn't save it from its convoluted plot and cardboard characters br br any fan who followed this film knows comes back <UNK> the story to <UNK> his <UNK> was a big mistake br br note the one point i give this film is in honor of the 10 000 <UNK> japanese animators who gave their lives to render each <UNK> blond hair on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> head
<START> there is no plot there are no central characters there are no moving cameras or close ups in fact this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream film however roy du is a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling it is a touching look at the human psyche br br comprised of a series of vignettes roy gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all human in perfectly framed static shots added with the perfectly in tune yet quirky music roy introduces us to a host of characters as they <UNK> their daily existence some <UNK> on tragic others hilarious we are taken on a <UNK> journey like no other br br it is a journey into the little things that make us human instead of over the top storytelling or visual techniques everything is stripped down to the bare minimum so that our sole focus is on the characters themselves it focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are our dreams our desperation it's through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals br br the washed out colours and <UNK> pale makeup of the characters only seems to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them we are all alive there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this film yet you walk out of the cinema with a sense of life much more accessible than his earlier film songs from the second floor du is a truly inspiring piece of cinema
<START> <UNK> of passion with the possible exception of <UNK> is <UNK> best film it displays his unique personality at its best and least <UNK> before he started going more mainstream <UNK> is just about the only modern director that can approach preston <UNK> wonderful brand of <UNK> it's pointless to try and explain what the movie is about the real point being <UNK> <UNK> and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sanity and sometimes of <UNK> and taste as well
<START> black <UNK> is roger batman which is cool and there is a lot of cool stuff in this movie like the being a cross between doctor doom and darth vader that's kind of cool the mind control gas in the was worthy of the mad <UNK> the b movie style is all over this puppy which is not always a good thing there are plenty of stunts and hot babes to make any action fan happy this movie the good out <UNK> the bad but if you aren't one for comic book movies then i would advise not watching black <UNK> however if you like comic book like movies and don't care if it was ever a comic before then check out black <UNK> as for me i give it 8 stars
<START> this is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos it is a superb comic gem with brilliantly funny writing <UNK> in the marvellous array of characters a wonderfully inventive and funny musical score and witty light direction from <UNK> himself this is one to watch over and over <UNK> is a bit part actor who finds himself assigned by his military <UNK> division to <UNK> a young home to discover the identity of her former beau a suspected jewel thief while the premise is rather preposterous the results are hilarious <UNK> is the <UNK> plant ann <UNK> is a marvel as the <UNK> obsessed terribly earnest <UNK> and the parade of comic characterizations from veteran stage actress jane lawyer mother to <UNK> <UNK> take charge maid are all fabulous br br oddly enough this only earned an oscar <UNK> for sound when it deserved top <UNK> for direction screenplay and musical score br br do not miss it it's one of hollywood's best
<START> romeo and juliet had been interpreted in so many ways but very few of the versions captured the of the play the ones i can think of that really nail the <UNK> spirit were west side story and <UNK> it or not troma film's <UNK> and juliet at first glance this is another mere <UNK> and many would think it the <UNK> classic however the film has an honest feel about it updated to appeal to the sick minded youth of today of course but not without merit yes the frequent <UNK> body <UNK> car crashes lesbian sex scenes masturbation and incest are in bad taste but what's the harm when you have such a sweet love story as the foundation as bad as most of the acting in this film is i mean it is troma after all the two leads have some genuine chemistry more so than in big budget <UNK> titanic and star wars episode two there's a great deal of <UNK> but much of the original text is in <UNK> especially when <UNK> and juliet are together there's a great scene where juliet <UNK> the famous <UNK> is such sweet sorrow and <UNK> quickly follows in mid nineties <UNK> fashion yeah it totally sucks i think it's truly unfortunate that this film isn't going to get the recognition or the wide release that it deserves i hop that people who see this on the video store shelves won't be turned off by the in the movie because they'd be missing out on quite a <UNK>
<START> there are good bad movies and bad bad movies and <UNK> bad movies this isn't one of them this is a movie that doesn't realize just how bad it is br br i saw this at a screening on november 14 2006 at the new beverly theater in los angeles as part of the <UNK> cinema this theater puts on every month hopefully <UNK> eric co will think twice before letting writer director anywhere near them again what a con man the guy got up to speak before the film you would think he was orson welles talking about touch of evil or some other lost classic hardly nice of him to take up 20 minutes of the <UNK> time with his incoherent rambling br br young warriors has been described as a cross between animal house and death wish but if you are expecting something along the lines of <UNK> like revenge of the <UNK> or the <UNK> you will be in for one sad disappointment the script makes zero sense the direction is so poor the actors looked embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is watching a car blow up br br poor richard <UNK> <UNK> in this movie he plays another character with the first name of john but that's about the only similarity his character here has to the aforementioned classic i hope this film allowed him to pay the rent for another month other actors who look like they wished they could be anywhere else included ernest <UNK> and linda day george br br this is a complete waste of time even the audience did not seem that into it except for the one <UNK> boy sitting in the back who <UNK> <UNK> every five minutes and his girlfriend who <UNK> with the <UNK> of a <UNK> talking <UNK> every time he opened his mouth br br for real films about <UNK> i would suggest the following br br death wish i ii iii <UNK> i vigilante force ms 45 rolling thunder the no mercy man the latter two being a pair of films presented at this theater a couple of years ago probably the same budget as young warriors but both were a million times better
<START> i never <UNK> when i started watching this dvd that i would be totally <UNK> by it within minutes the story was completely absorbing and entertaining the acting was superb the biggest surprise of all was how i would be so completely enchanted by the love these two young women <UNK> across the screen their initial physical encounter for me was by far the most tender romantic delightful <UNK> enthralling love scenes i have ever witnessed on film i literally stopped breathing i could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses with no nudity or graphic sex they conveyed more passion and <UNK> than any american production could ever hope to <UNK> bravo to the author the screenwriter the director and the cast
<START> i seldom see a film with such a cast such a potentially strong story and based on a <UNK> book that has been this weak and to some extent unwatchable br br the premise of a story reads like a brent <UNK> <UNK> novel a lot of drugs <UNK> and self induced tragedy as a young <UNK> played by christina <UNK> tries to cope with being a <UNK> loser that can't seem to accept that she is actually living a good life and that basically she is pathetic for being such a baby br br christina <UNK> is not only playing a tragic <UNK> but also a tragic actor whose <UNK> and <UNK> for the most part of the movie actually make you want to shout kill yourself already and let us get to the credits rolling the director is of no help as he supplies absolutely no pace and the story feels so disjointed you have no idea what this damn girl is actually on about the director apparently was on <UNK> when directing this imitation of a movie and hence let the movie go on <UNK> making it an unbearable mess br br the only redeeming features are a sympathetic jason <UNK> as boyfriend who thankfully decided to dump the self indulgent <UNK> <UNK> and an unbelievably good jessica lange as the cry babies mother lange apparently can not be brought down by terrible script directing and dire co actors pure class br br i don't know if this is really who is or was but the film has successfully made me totally <UNK> in her <UNK> br br in the end i finished watching this movie and instantly started to think ok time to watch something that actually is about real problems
<START> man with the screaming brain is a story of greed betrayal and revenge in the a small <UNK> town william cole wealthy <UNK> winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a russian cab driver the two couldn't be more different but they share one thing both were killed by the same woman brought back to life by a mad scientist william and form an unlikely <UNK> to track down their common nemesis br br bruce campbell returns to the b horror movie genre that gave him his cult status this time not only in front of the screen but behind the lens unfortunately for this time around the laughs don't deliver and campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film br br as a fan of campbell who has the movies the books and the action figures i was hoping for another hit to add to my collection although after seeing this film before the purchase i am glad that i don't have the pleasure of adding it br br the film first goes wrong in the story which at first sight seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out <UNK> which is a sad thing to say because it was written by mr campbell himself the comedy never really hits it only makes us scratch our heads it seems that campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen him fighting himself br br ted <UNK> the brother of evil dead director sam <UNK> is undoubtedly the highlight of the film he brings a <UNK> to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it it helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from evil dead to <UNK> which is why i felt compelled to like this film br br <UNK> experience as a director from directing episodes of the tv series <UNK> is apparent campbell makes the film work well enough even with the low budget in the end there aren't as many things going for this as one would hope for but the fans of campbell will stick behind it no matter what unfortunately for this fan i won't
<START> spoiler spoilers spoilers i found the film amusing it was weird and i enjoy it i laughed a lot so the bottom line is that i recommend the film however i have problems with what <UNK> wanted to say the plot is very simple betty <UNK> <UNK> a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen she follow her true love for a soap series character dr david greg kinnear simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film and here comes the big question what is the film all about the reference to the wizard of oz is obvious betty and dorothy are both from kansas however while dorothy come at the end of that film to the conclusion that there is no place like home betty doesn't come to any conclusion and by the end of the film we are left wonder what has she learned from her experience and the answer is simply nothing it seems not to affect her at all br br than is the film about the different between reality and fantasy could be but the scenes that are dealing with this subject are short and serve no more than a joke and not as a serious plot line that can take the film to other places and by the way the truman show dealt with this subject in a much better way br br the film could be about obsession betty is obsessed with the soap series and charlie morgan freeman is obsessed with betty <UNK> show two sides of obsession and he seems to forget that obsession in any form is dangerous and should be condemned he seems to have sympathy to <UNK> obsession because he sees it as a harmless one br br all a long the film we have scenes that in itself could have been a subject for a whole film but are left for us to think about without that they will have impact on the characters br br the ending is simply a make up that has nothing to do with what we saw before it's a shame because the film could have been <UNK> if he would have concentrate in one or two subjects as it is it's about a lot but actually say nothing br br what we are left with is the feeling that we have seen a little film amusing and weird that could have been much much more
<START> my guide for the quality of the a movie is if i'm still thinking about it after leaving the theater i'm still thinking about this one the next day which doesn't happen often br br the scenery a reasonable guess for <UNK> century italy costumes lighting cinematography are all excellent it is a beautiful film visually br br characters can never rise above the script they must <UNK> but these actors made the most of their material which is excellent this is one of shakespeare's best plays which people will still enjoy another 400 years down the road all of the principals were interesting and enjoyable br br those who say this is anti <UNK> must be deaf and blind if anything it is anti <UNK> century catholic while <UNK> plays a man controlled and tortured by the hurts he has suffered it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame the script clearly places his personal responsibility where it belongs as well br br a great film
<START> well the writing was very sloppy the directing was <UNK> and the editing made it worse at least i hope it was the editing the acting wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either pretty much none of the characters were likable at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending and what wasn't predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter the ending was not worth watching at all sandra <UNK> was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies the movie looked rushed also the movie just wasn't really worth seeing and had i paid for it i would have been very mad maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one the movie over all was not <UNK> bad but i wouldn't <UNK> it i gave it 2 out of 10 b c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character justin i believe the super smart one and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes it was like trying to cover a <UNK> with cheap <UNK> tape it was not pretty anyway if you see it wait for the 1 50 theater or video unless you like pretty much every movie you see then i guess you'll like this one
<START> in the eighties savage steve holland put out three movies two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre <UNK> teen comedies the third how i got into college does not measure up to better off dead and this one mainly because of it's lack of john cusack and curtis armstrong except for a tiny cameo br br one crazy summer is an underrated movie with lots of great characterizations and gags as i recall savage <UNK> movies were <UNK> as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he <UNK> into children's tv we could use more movies from the likes of him
<START> <UNK> <UNK> makes no apologies asks for no forgiveness it's a no holds <UNK> assault on the senses tarantino doesn't care if he <UNK> if he steps all over stereotypes and clichÃ©s this is film making at it <UNK> it's great to see a film maker whose work clearly isn't with by the powers that be tarantino is a master of effortlessly <UNK> up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with laugh out loud moments you're not sure if you should be looking away in disgust or rolling around laughing either way it's a roller coaster and one not to be missed it's not for everyone and i'm unsure how germans will take the film certainly if you're not a fan of <UNK> style this may be a little hard to swallow but never the less it is a film which simply has to be seen no self <UNK> film fan should miss this and the performance of <UNK> <UNK> oscar don't you dare ignore him
<START> hard justice is an excellent action movie the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot for the people who say they don't make shoot em ups and fighting films like they use to well this one is really hard core don 'the <UNK> wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie nicholas guest was very good as well and he arguably steals the show he really performs as a fantastic villain <UNK> smith was also good i think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated michael <UNK> was good it was really cool to see vince in this film as for the action it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the super cool fighting scenes the fighting in this picture is really some of the greatest i have seen there is so much that happens in the <UNK> minute run time for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and superb fighting that this film has to offer night hunter is a movie that isn't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper and plus the box is cool there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay half com amazon <UNK> z <UNK> and market place sellers in my opinion night hunter is one of the greatest fighting films that i have ever watched and the characters are so neat if you like don 'the <UNK> wilson and want to see nicholas guest in a great performance then i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot em ups fighting movies and vampire films and has been disappointed by other movies that has the look of a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get and buy night hunter today
<START> br br i tuned into this movie not because i am a fan of u s high school basketball in fact i only rarely watch <UNK> games but rather because i am a fan of gene hackman who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances in this case however i was sorely disappointed this was not one of the bright shining stars of <UNK> career br br in fairness to him he didn't have a lot to work with as norman <UNK> the new coach of a small town high school basketball team in indiana he wasn't called on to do much acting basically his performance consisted of pacing up and down basketball <UNK> <UNK> at the <UNK> i didn't find him particularly believable in the role to be honest i also was <UNK> with the requisite romance between <UNK> and myra barbara <UNK> quite honestly there was absolutely no chemistry between hackman and <UNK> the romance never captured my attention and neither did the basketball action which was altogether too predictable br br there were far too many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile i never did understand the depth of the sheer hatred that so many of the <UNK> had for <UNK> almost from before the time he arrived the character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed too much basketball and not enough human interaction in my opinion how many shots of kids shooting <UNK> do we need to see to get the point that this is a basketball movie there was no suspense is it even possible to doubt that <UNK> is going to win the big one i realize that this is based on a true story but i guess it proves that not every true story should be a movie quite frankly it just wasn't a very interesting movie definitely a movie gene hackman would like to forget br br no better than a 2 10 in my opinion
<START> finally a gangster movie worth watching br br jennifer should get nominated for her role as tough murdering femme fatal br br this movie flies like a bird just a fast paced non stop gangster mayhem br br jennifer is just so beautiful and bad in this movie br br i was shocked to find faye <UNK> still lives the cast in this movie are so <UNK> to their roles br br a real cool soundtrack rides along side and you get swept into the spanish soul of this film br br the story is original deep and poetic br br this flick has a lot of substance and never rests br br the gang of spanish fire just set everything on screen <UNK> br br <UNK> is a joy to watch and a movie star br br sit back and enjoy the ride
<START> this was a great movie something not only for black history month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child the performances by s was outstanding <UNK> <UNK> and his singing was off the hook had to do a double take when i saw that was <UNK> <UNK> there but the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching all the different stories they had was amazing and how <UNK> <UNK> jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence i can truly understand her being the <UNK> of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone cant wait for it to come out on dvd it would be a welcome addition to any movie library
<START> when i first heard that this movie was going to be made i was very excited to see it the ideas to make a movie of this caliber as good as it was must have been very difficult i wasn't really sure if anyone could <UNK> all of the many amazing qualities in a movie but the movie did his memory justice in my opinion the most important task was to reveal to the people who the <UNK> started out as to his days in <UNK> all the way to his last days in the <UNK> this movie followed every aspect of his life thomas <UNK> the man who played the <UNK> in his adult life and on did a very good job at getting the emotion across overall this movie was educational but also very entertaining
<START> i watched this short moments ago on the sundance film festival website and i must say it is absolutely astounding i expected it to be entertaining like all of the sundance shorts but i wasn't prepared for such deep sadness and yet also a sense of passion and beauty br br if you haven't yet seen any of this years entries to the festival i suggest you go onto the site and watch these mini masterpieces i have seen them all and can honestly say 'the youth in <UNK> is the one that has touched my heart the most i'm not the weakest audience member when it comes to romance in films but my eyes <UNK> up so much i'm surprised i could still see the screen br br i agree with it truly is a masterful piece of directorial work and the cinematography will just take your breath away br br i can't think of a better way to spend a spare 12 minutes
<START> this is the worst movie of all time no doubt and <UNK> list did in fact have more laughs this not only tells you how unfunny this movie is and how great <UNK> is considering it's heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh i wish i could meet <UNK> serious so i could personally <UNK> him for this and all the other very very very bad movies he's ever been in there is also very few things to say about australia seeing as they like this stupid fruit don't get me wrong people mel gibson from australia are great they brought us mad max it makes me very <UNK> that people like this garbage a review i just read said it was very funny sickening isn't it i personally will be this movie and will start a <UNK> online to <UNK> and burn all <UNK> <UNK> movies for being so and i emphasize this so retarded br br these are just my personal thoughts no <UNK> they are shared by everybody who has seen this movie br br note if you are forced to watch this movie clockwork orange style call me to commit <UNK> on you for free
<START> imaginary heroes is one fine little film written and directed by dan harris this story is classic theater <UNK> comedy and tragedy together so tightly that the climax of the film takes your breath away br br the travis family is an odd bunch no member is who each appears to be beginning with a suicide of the reluctant <UNK> child swimming champion matt <UNK> the father ben jeff daniels falls apart and <UNK> himself from his family and himself while the mother sandy <UNK> weaver turns to pot and rage and sarcasm the daughter penny michelle williams returns from school <UNK> by her family's behavior and the remaining son tim <UNK> <UNK> takes the <UNK> of all of the above by avoiding his classmates girlfriend and teams with his neighbor kyle ryan <UNK> to leap into drugs and sexual <UNK> throughout the film tim tries to hide <UNK> on his body that have a secret all their own yet lead his girlfriend to feel <UNK> his mother to rage against the trailer park trash bully she believes is the cause and finally open the window to the deep <UNK> this family has suffered for years secrets and lies here and the resolution of them is painfully dramatic br br this may be <UNK> <UNK> finest role although <UNK> jeff daniels ryan <UNK> and <UNK> despite the <UNK> of his role all contribute top notch performances the story begins slowly and seems to <UNK> and that fact may lose some <UNK> attention but stay with this little <UNK> film and the impact of the work will <UNK> you highly recommended grady <UNK>
<START> the snow queen is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by hans christian <UNK> about a girl <UNK> who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend <UNK> from the <UNK> of the snow queen this adaption attempts to capture that story's sense of adventure and <UNK> intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design but fails on a number of counts br br like so many hallmark productions the potential of the story is completely <UNK> by heavy handed scripting and direction the two actors playing <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> pleasant but forgettable bridget fonda as the snow queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role there's a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering three hour miniseries at least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters br br that said the snow queen would be just about ideal for pre teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience it's great eye candy without being scary and the acting is pitched at the sort of <UNK> over the top level that spells out the storyline in very very bold text just make sure you read them <UNK> story too
<START> it starts a little slow but give it a chance in the spirit of the ship in the arm and the pink sub this movie is about a not so <UNK> group engaged in not so <UNK> methods to <UNK> everyone rob schneider is priceless as a lt that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed <UNK> attempt and pirate crew makes him walk the <UNK> in contrast <UNK> <UNK> similar to cary grant does not take anything to serious except the job this movie is more about lines than plot from the up <UNK> in <UNK> harbor to the whale <UNK> their antics took me by surprise and i laughed out loud
<START> seriously engaging intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best mean gripping moody and captivating every home should have a copy don't take my word for it see it yourself one life stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema graphic experiences of the year john debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film this is a film that cares and has an honesty that is in recent years no car chases but a film packed with hum our and emotion i first saw this film screened at the <UNK> film festival in 2000 and am now delighted to be able to own a copy on dvd
<START> i cannot believe someone gave this movie a 1 rating and it is only a 3 average what is not to love about this film it is original it has lots of scare scenes that actually made me jump out of my seat and it has some great special effects the story is fresh there is some nudity and it is very campy the killer was scary in his own demented way and the end is very unexpected i must admit that i really love this film one of <UNK> best horror films ever if you consider yourself a true horror fan you need to get out there and try to find this film you will be pleasantly surprised to do so
<START> uma and travolta were very good together but unfortunately when they left the screen the movie was nothing but a bunch of very boring and <UNK> secondary characters wrapped in some extremely bad writing occasional glimpses of greatness like the dance scene between uma and travolta quickly <UNK> when the likes of harvey keitel and similar uninteresting thugs came on and the white dude who tried to act black got very very tiresome after way too much exposure in the picture he <UNK> down a fairly good performance by the rock the only secondary character who you couldn't wait to see leave the screen bad dumb plot the writers clearly couldn't figure out if they writing to generation x or the 12 15 year old rap crowd and the combination turned into a film that kept me staring at my watch
<START> i think andrew davies did an admirable job of taking a magnificent book which <UNK> the pace and <UNK> of a victorian novel and turning it into a moving and entertaining film i'm glad i read twice the book first which is usually the case for me i know that one must view a novel and a film as different media and judge them <UNK> but still it's often hard to read the original material after a film gives away the best parts br br i realize that davies is a very good <UNK> but i wish the producers had chosen a woman to write the screenplay davies as he admits in the commentary that <UNK> the film on dvd wanted particularly to emphasis the more <UNK> bits in the book i certainly enjoyed those on film as in the book but davies missed a half dozen moments that are so excruciatingly painfully tender which he could have <UNK> if his sensibility were more feminine br br i also would take issue with his use of the <UNK> primary symbol the rose br br as the screenplay was plotted by davies the denouement was inevitable and appropriate but i really think that author <UNK> final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting and i preferred way the novel let <UNK> come of age than the way davies chose br br one quick comment about the four actors who <UNK> the primary roles they are all wonderfully talented well except for the singing and dancing perhaps and moreover their physical <UNK> are so much what the <UNK> eye sees when reading the novel before seeing the film i thought they were all terrific br br i recommend that any lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction add both the book and the dvd of <UNK> the <UNK> to their
<START> the scariest thing about <UNK> director carter smith's new horror movie the ruins is the closing credits that list comedian ben stiller as one of the executive producers what was stiller thinking when he <UNK> his bucks into this <UNK> about cursed <UNK> that creeps up on its victims and <UNK> them oscar nominated <UNK> scott b smith of a simple plan adapting his own <UNK> novel sticks <UNK> to the standard clichÃ©s and conventions of all <UNK> scary <UNK> where reckless youth do everything but <UNK> signs begging the forces of evil to eat them were <UNK> characters not enough to <UNK> with in this <UNK> nonsense we're treated to yet another film where american tourists find themselves in <UNK> simply because they are americans furthermore unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters have a need to feed the ruins provides no explanation for the supernatural <UNK> of its villainous <UNK> br br the set up for the ruins resembles the 2006 horror movie where slimy south americans trapped brainless american and <UNK> them for their internal organs indeed generated some legitimate thrills and chills the ruins <UNK> nothing in the way of either thrills or chills a <UNK> that suddenly <UNK> on camera to <UNK> at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill br br the rest of the ruins borrows from another movie the descent a superb 2006 <UNK> about a bunch of babes <UNK> into a nightmare experience when they get lost in warren of <UNK> inhabited by <UNK> mutants with a blood lust for murder a couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind too they are the straightforward 1968 hammer horror classic the lost continent about murderous <UNK> that <UNK> innocent <UNK> in a sea of <UNK> ships and the roger corman cult class the little shop of horrors <UNK> about a new york <UNK> that grows a man eating plant in his shop br br the ruins unfolds in the <UNK> sunny mexico where four <UNK> american college kids eric shawn of the x men movies <UNK> laura <UNK> of the <UNK> jeff jonathan tucker of <UNK> and amy <UNK> malone of pride prejudice are <UNK> up their <UNK> <UNK> spring break <UNK> loses a <UNK> <UNK> in a motel swimming pool but a helpful <UNK> <UNK> tourist <UNK> joe anderson of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it and the group <UNK> him as <UNK> best friend these people live to party and they have already made friends with a trio of greek tourists <UNK> tells them about his <UNK> brother who has accompanied a cute female <UNK> to a remote <UNK> <UNK> that isn't listed in any he offers to take them with him and they accept br br first rule of horror movies if nobody knows about the place where you're going you'd be well advised to avoid it since they have only one day left and they haven't done anything adventurous our two couples along with their spanish speaking greek friend newcomer <UNK> decide to follow <UNK> and check the <UNK> out they catch a bus into the interior of mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey a <UNK> <UNK> at their map and warns them to stay away second rule of horror movies when the natives warn you to steer clear you steer clear a crisp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind and he them off to their destination and then he in a <UNK> br br no sooner have our heroes found the mysterious <UNK> <UNK> covered with that looks <UNK> like a variation of <UNK> in the jungle than <UNK> natives appear they know that the <UNK> is haunted and they kill without a <UNK> when he tries to <UNK> their fears the remaining protagonists <UNK> to safety <UNK> the <UNK> while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping eventually the <UNK> <UNK> out to <UNK> our heroes and eat them at this point the ruins turns into bug the recent and ridiculous ashley judd <UNK> movie about insects that get under your skin before long our heroes are <UNK> each other up in a <UNK> effort to <UNK> the <UNK> from under their skin one particularly gruesome scene shows the americans off the german guy's legs to save his life by comparison it makes the <UNK> of the spanish <UNK> look tame br br the ruins ranks as just another <UNK> mess with nothing to redeem it
<START> i don't understand where these bad comments are coming from the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night br br the part that gets you is that this could all happen not to the extent perceived in the movie but the whole idea is reality this movie took that reality and twisted it into a dee <UNK> nightmare br br three thumbs up the third one is from the dead body in my <UNK>
<START> who will love my children has changed my heart it made me cry all the way through the most i cried with was when the family had to say goodbye to the baby i cried the most with that and each time a child was adopted i cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother it was sad for them to lose their mother i felt sorry for the kid with <UNK> i was glad he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers to me that boy i thought was the special one because he was going in a home i feel that i am special because i am in a world with syndrome and sometimes when i feel down i sometimes like to cry i really enjoyed this movie 10 out of 10 a true story very good another movie that would bring tears to your eyes i think would <UNK> to be with http www imdb com title
<START> ok the show was a little uneven but i still loved it i found the main two <UNK> annoying but <UNK> were always amusing br br i really want the baby <UNK> episodes on dvd or even vhs please release those br br specifically the <UNK> years episode aired on 11 22 <UNK> the going up episode aired on 9 17 <UNK> and the minister golf episode in 11 <UNK> br br they are the funniest bits of the whole series and even over a decade later we still reference these bits br br i have nothing more to say please <UNK> the minimum to something like 5 lines and <UNK> us for <UNK>
<START> lush cinematography beautifully written and edited john <UNK> beyond is a must see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation it <UNK> a personal and political tale that continues to haunt me popping up in my <UNK> eye with <UNK> the story line is gripping and the inner and outer <UNK> are <UNK> carefully and <UNK> both <UNK> and in the story line i've watched this film at least six times and it really holds up to <UNK> it is particularly relevant today given world events check it out you won't regret it btw netflix does not yet carry it but you can request that they do
<START> i've only seen this film once when it was shown on tv but i can still remember it 15 years later so that must say something about it i thought it was an intelligent look into <UNK> friendship bullying and the influence it can have leading into adult life br br the title really refers to how being good or bad at sports can either make you the lowest of the low or you will be <UNK> by the <UNK> within school and even later on into <UNK> if you're good at it this is set in a private school in england but it could be anywhere br br the main character is bad at games seeks revenge in later life which all <UNK> in a climactic confrontation on a <UNK> pitch i must admit i was <UNK> by the ending it was powerful and <UNK>
<START> although the story is good and portrayals what i expected of sam elliot my dvd copy contained almost unbearable <UNK> problems the dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the whole film br br i would therefore be very careful in <UNK> any dvd of the film without checking for the problem br br i would also follow the recommended censors particularly in relation to language and drug usage br br this film could become a silent classic cop movie and with the above <UNK> notes i can recommend it to <UNK> viewers
<START> imagine every stereotypical <UNK> cliche from every movie and tv show set on the streets of brooklyn between 1930 and 1980 <UNK> it with a cast of <UNK> caricatures instead of actual characters throw in a mix of period music and <UNK> electric <UNK> during the <UNK> scenes then pass the time trying to figure out or care which of the <UNK> is going to be killed in the anti climactic final <UNK> br br i'll give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy teen slasher explosive action movie teen sex comedy kiddie musical or oscar nomination vehicle but bringing something new or interesting to the street gang tragedy genre <UNK> been nice
<START> i saw this at the 2004 <UNK> <UNK> film festival in ny and it was very <UNK> received in this pre ww2 film a pair of german rocket scientists are working on the scottish <UNK> of as war <UNK> on the horizon the characters encountered on the island are priceless in their creation and their portrayal macdonald is particularly memorable br br after getting up to speed on the accents the viewer feel right at home with these folk who watch with amusement as the germans work to link their <UNK> with the <UNK> via a rocket based mail delivery as implausible as it seems this film was based on an actual story br br all in all a memorable film that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting its story or its scenery
<START> i know a couple people who look just like the lead actress in this film or at least like the character she portrays they all give me the creeps and i would be the last person to ever lend one of them a gun or even a sharp knife she has one mean and ugly looking expression if you can <UNK> up a bit of sympathy for her let me know br br of course i might have the same expressions of concern and fear if i had an imaginary friend who had been killing off my real friends and <UNK> for the last 15 years br br and for our european friends on the imdb i'm <UNK> to say that yes some <UNK> and <UNK> in the us teach <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> relying on the pathetic defense that it represents academic freedom and open <UNK> br br this film is not worth your while you will have no sympathy for any of the characters except for aunt <UNK> who gets <UNK> pretty early and the plot makes no sense
<START> jimmy stewart brings the story of charles <UNK> to life as he almost <UNK> the entire film while he crosses the atlantic it well edited with flashbacks over life <UNK> <UNK> score is <UNK> brilliant and truly gives the picture a heroic feel one of <UNK> finest roles and this film can deliver time after time look for appearances by murray hamilton the mayor in the jaws movie as bud <UNK> comes out on dvd 8 15 <UNK> with the release of a few more of <UNK> classic films i consider jimmy stewart to be <UNK> greatest actor and never tire of seeing him in any film i see watch this picture and you'll agree
<START> br br this movie is best enjoyed amidst a large audience with the giggle fits br br very frequently the characters in are seen staring ahead intensely at nothing very intense unhappy faces very <UNK> very serious during these moments there is very serious sounding music just to make sure the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games br br the more entertaining portions of this film come in between the many <UNK> stares we learn that the women of the community have two duties one is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands the second is to stay employed so to free their husbands from having to work what do these men do with their ample free time they pray and we learn that at home they pray out loud i give you thanks for not creating me as a woman and at their place of worship they pray to give thanks for <UNK> <UNK> male <UNK> br br along with the praying there are many scenes of <UNK> antics screaming and endless head <UNK> and bodies <UNK> back and fourth and mixed in with everything are many intricate and bizarre or simple but just as odd <UNK> activities br br the cream of the unintentional comedy comes from the sex the imagery of an hot and bothered man <UNK> <UNK> body <UNK> with his wife in bed while attempting to keep his from falling off his <UNK> is unforgettable br br every sex scene is funny but one that stands out is when a husband <UNK> his face against his beautiful wife's feet oh yes we are finally entering the land of <UNK> but no the feet <UNK> stops before anything happens and the husband begins his <UNK> looking head <UNK> and body <UNK> until the scene ends br br there are three attractive females in near states of <UNK> however contains absolutely no nudity technically there is some interesting imagery and pleasing uses of light and colors by the director br br for a more believable educational and entertaining treatment of the plight of being an <UNK> female <UNK> of holding a book in a world where respect is <UNK> by the speed by which a man can <UNK> a phrase from ancient <UNK> i suggest barbra <UNK> <UNK> br br
<START> i respect mike <UNK> and liked get carter immensely for it's bleak <UNK> but the just seems like a particularly dull <UNK> drama br br the reserved cold acting isn't just the <UNK> of the lead character it's spread to the entire cast meaning there is nothing to contrast <UNK> character with br br none of the characters evoke any kind of feelings at all except boredom the ending of the film is also <UNK> at best br br the camera work etc is fairly good but if you want to see <UNK> best watch get carter don't bother with this uninteresting unimaginative through emotions he covered better 20 years ago
<START> if you don't mind subtitles you like comedy and truly interesting characters along with a taste of something different from mainstream american cinema then take a chance and rent this film br br two <UNK> friends one very neurotic <UNK> the other the strong quiet loner type working for a jerk butcher in a smaller danish town decide to strike out on they're own together and open a butcher shop themselves not successful at first they <UNK> something new to they're recipe and become an instant hit with the village br br that being an interesting story in itself this <UNK> humorous film is laced with even more friendship romance crime death personal tragedy that makes this film so funny yet <UNK> with numerous subtle interests that make it so interestingly funny yet warm and fuzzy br br a must mention is the characters created and the actors making them believable you can have the best script yet if the characters aren't believable it can sink a film and with this the directing acting character believability and story all <UNK> so well they make this a very entertaining film br br so if your in the mood to stretch a <UNK> want to see something very good yet done a bit differently then i suggest you rent this film while i'm on my way out to find more by director writer <UNK> thomas <UNK>
<START> there is a reason to call this a teen flick out of 100 possible points i would put it somewhere in the teens it is predictable the acting is horrible especially the minor roles and above all else it is super predictable the ending is so hokey that i should have left early and maybe it would have passed by the way could you call the male lead a <UNK> i bet if it really happened someone in my school district would have said so finally in the school i grew up in even though the average class had over 1000 students we could have picked out a <UNK> like <UNK> as being a fraud and we would have <UNK> her out of the crowd my final word is save your time when it comes on tv watch something better like the stock quotes
<START> i described woody allen's manhattan as perfect to someone the other day and she thought that it was an odd way to describe a movie br br i have seen only a handful of movies that i would call perfect manhattan is one <UNK> ms miller by robert altman is another and once upon a time in the west by sergio <UNK> is also another film that i think achieves perfection there are a few others but aside from the fact that i find no faults in the three i mentioned i must also admit that all three directors are acquired tastes br br if there is one film that i could stand behind and bet the house that anyone i would show it to would find it flawless it's shoulder arms br br city lights the great dictator the gold rush and even the <UNK> are <UNK> but not only did chaplin do everything right in this film everything he did is hilarious and touching to a level beyond explanation
<START> <UNK> serious is like a 3 bottle of wine had no substance to begin with and just gets worse with age this film proves he is completely toxic we can only hope that this is his final film and that its serious lack of success will <UNK> his chances of <UNK> <UNK> for any future <UNK> it is right up there with lightning jack and les <UNK> saves the world as the most abysmal example of australian comedy imaginable how tragic it is that with so many infinitely superior comedic talents in australia <UNK> is given such vehicles to express his brand of <UNK> school yard comedy and to think he had 7 years to come up with the script true genius
<START> i saw it in europe <UNK> great movie br br this film is an exploration of the spirit and the flesh in modern times protagonist jim kirk drives an <UNK> <UNK> across america stopping often to fill his gas <UNK> tank he is middle aged and confused he <UNK> his thick <UNK> body with <UNK> of coffee and radio <UNK> he is the flesh <UNK> and sometimes <UNK> out fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as of <UNK> br br the spirit the film through speeches and other sounds as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field the spirit eventually <UNK> with the flesh and kirk goes down unable to comprehend what has happened to him he's been in denial about just how bad things have become due to he of all of us because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh we're all in the same denial and so we like kirk are in danger of going down and being blown away by desert <UNK> just like him
<START> this video was my first introduction to the residents and i couldn't stop playing it for the past three days the visuals are dynamite and more inventive and technically complex than any i have ever seen on the big screen or small br br the dvd loses points however for the pointless addition of new music the original residents music is unlike anything else you've ever heard and will really <UNK> your brain in the best possible way the new music however is uniformly uninteresting and in most cases is rather bad in comparison to some of the classic tracks also the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> video feels very <UNK> and i could only <UNK> the plot of the story from extensive reading of the notes on the disc br br speaking of notes on the disc this dvd features lots of cool <UNK> eggs that will probably appeal to long time fans of the residents hint look for icons on the notes pages that shouldn't be there br br from a technical standpoint the disc is one of the best dvd <UNK> available there is virtually no and only a little <UNK> in strong contrast points br br kudos for a top notch presentation this disc really deserves your attention
<START> half of the movie is is flashing lights and shaky camera the rest is made up of predictable characters think science vs government vs authority etc br br what is the worst aspect about this movie is it the cars being thrown around in the first 5 minutes is the horrible accent of the is it the uninspired characters the poorly integrated top 40 hits or the us will save the world <UNK> no it's the fact that regardless of the sad ending there is very little suspense in this movie we basically know what's going to happen br br the one good part of this movie american <UNK> russian <UNK> all made in <UNK>
<START> i have never been as surprised by a film that was this old only the treasure of the <UNK> <UNK> holds up this well performance wise as someone that has seen heroin addiction first hand i was shocked at how realistic this film was frank sinatra's performance is completely <UNK> realistic and heart wrenching otto <UNK> direction is perfect for the film with long takes and a very mobile camera br br kim <UNK> performance is good as is <UNK> <UNK> in fact the entire supporting cast works very well with understated performances as <UNK> this film's style the documentary style is part of what keeps this film up to date highly recommended br br 8 0 out of 10
<START> 1 i've seen hamlet branagh is too old speaks frequently with a high pitched voice <UNK> funny not a convincing hamlet and his directors qualities poor see also much <UNK> about nothing from branagh the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts 2 i've seen hamlet 2000 i think the scenario is an interesting idea but such lousy actors all of them 3 orson welles hamlet is ok but this bbc hamlet is the best <UNK> is convincing seems a bit of a lunatic very suitable and <UNK> stewart wonderful and claire bloom is a very attractive queen you believe those actors what they are saying i think this is the best compliment
<START> i saw this drama by cable tv although i saw just two series i love this drama i'm waiting for more series will be aired by cable br br even though it describes horrible absurd situation in a camp this one shows us an <UNK> spirit warmth friendship and humanity they don't know whether they can survive or not but kept their hope strongly without being <UNK> by <UNK> br br i know this movie is not realistic like other war documentary but i don't want to blame for it it makes me believe the strong will of people in the most difficult situation br br <UNK> <UNK> especially this episode touched deep in my heart br br i remember every scene i always hate <UNK> but after seeing this drama i can understand something about <UNK> <UNK> is his connection between past and present also <UNK> eternity br br <UNK> light and memory framed in a circle ' br br like other victims of war he lost his lover by irresistible fate i'm immersed in his time and memory as if i experienced same thing br br he experienced the great loss but he has pure passion of study br br he started his study in the camp his joy of realize br br i believe his dedication of study <UNK> him br br i saw it several times but the meaning of this film never faded every time i saw it i feel same deep emotion br br their songs are beautiful <UNK> br br i'm sorry that i can't listen <UNK>
<START> dear mr <UNK> br br dude seriously the title of the show is masters of horror and be that as it may it is supposed to be an opportunity to show of your horror chops to show the world why you deserve to be called a master of the genre <UNK> you misunderstood the exercise <UNK> you thought it was your opportunity or worse your duty to <UNK> the american public on your political beliefs and your attempt comes off as disgusting overbearing and above all preachy br br the only reason anyone marked your short as a high score is because their political views match yours and they are the type of people that don't mind having that sort of politics shoved down their throat br br i on the other hand don't give a damn what you believe they believe or i believe i just want such obvious not subtle and unfunny not satire messages out of my horror and while there were certainly other masters of horror that were big time <UNK> or where i was just generally confused why that director william malone would be considered a genre master yours fails far beyond the rest for just missing the entire point of the series br br so next time can you please just keep your preachy politics to yourself
<START> well to each his own but i thought <UNK> hamlet was the most god awful rendition i had ever witnessed as subtly nuanced as a paper bag and as inspired as a call the only reason i watched the movie through to the end was that i held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny no luck br br no <UNK> for the supporting cast or for <UNK> staging but nothing can make up for the <UNK> of the main character i have seen hamlet well portrayed as an african prince as an animated lion as a rough and <UNK> warrior as a romantic poet etc etc etc but imho this portrayal was just a <UNK> lack of wit together with most weak <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is one of the best movies featuring a <UNK> as a hero who takes down the man meanwhile <UNK> up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide mind you that these women know karate and are fine <UNK> ladies br br spoiler the end fight scene is pretty crazy with <UNK> ripping the heart out of willy green make sure your copy is <UNK> br br plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mayor queen <UNK> and others the <UNK> is great and the sets are full of 70's style there are a few mess ups in the production such as boom <UNK> accidentally appearing among other things but that adds to the charm and laughs br br i would recommend drinking a 6 pack before and during this movie and keeping <UNK> and the man a far distance away
<START> this movie was trying to something but failed miserably all the attempts at suspense were cheap and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes i ended up laughing and making fun of it the whole way through at least i was entertained br br the ghosts are attempting to warn the family so why do they attack the girl whose name i didn't care to remember and what was with the black and white at the beginning i know what they were trying to do but they fell far short and where the heck did that guy john <UNK> character come from he just <UNK> in from no where in a vast field and why did he suddenly lose it again when the <UNK> came and if the <UNK> were a <UNK> of the spirits of his family then why did they attack him if it would make him try to kill the family makes no sense so many things in this movie just don't make sense and the acting ain't too pretty on the part of the main girl character it's not terrible just a little like her <UNK> movie days br br so all in all this movie wasn't brilliant but i had a good time ripping at it and sometimes that's all a horror movie needs to do rent for entertainment not quality
<START> uninspired pretty much all around the only exceptions were a couple emotional scenes with <UNK> <UNK> with whose performance i was pleasantly surprised and occasionally moved beyond that it ended up being little more than a bad flick
<START> based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it i think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a great movie it has its interesting moments for one thing it was filmed on location in <UNK> was it <UNK> or i can't remember but it is in the credits the location is absolutely stunning and spectacular it's beautiful even to me who lived in <UNK> for several years br br next it has disney's <UNK> for wonderful character actors harry morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a disney movie he is literally hysterical also remember the wonderful mary <UNK> although she has a bit part in this movie she is great as always if you don't know who she is think of the animated disney version of <UNK> from <UNK> dame she was one of the <UNK> and she was also the most interesting nun in sister act as well as the best nun in the trouble with angels she has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve br br in addition to character actors and all star casts in the 1960s 1970s disney may have not had the greatest movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will notice that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it the entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem at least 1 or 2 in every single live action movie disney ever made whether it's harry morgan in one of his <UNK> tones of voice or tim <UNK> <UNK> around or joe flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good the whole film may not be good but there are always hysterical moments in every disney film from this period that i have ever seen disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the <UNK> of the film br br on these comments i disagree with viewers who say every disney movie in this time period is awful that statement it not quite accurate rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots br br some live action disney movies are true classics old <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mary <UNK> but for those that aren't i am able to appreciate them for what they were good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive
<START> okay they tell you it's real they don't list any screenwriters or directors but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone it's not real in the way you were hoping for the speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk but also down not sound to be scripted possibly loosely scripted to me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad <UNK> which they almost always did poorly therefore they knew they were making a <UNK> not just collecting real natural footage so i'm sure these people knew what was going on knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up and they were just told to ad <UNK> around it all br br <UNK> br br okay it's so lame every item spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare is magically stumbled upon by these people let me list off the ridiculously obviously <UNK> things that happened that i remember br br 1 less than 2 minutes of entering the house they turn a light switch on the light sparks and a <UNK> almost falls on a guy br br 2 they happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife in it while exploring the <UNK> br br 3 they hear a noise in an so they open the door slowly <UNK> a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while <UNK> br br 4 then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall so let's stick our hand in wow they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape br br 5 let's go to the attic uh oh it feels <UNK> up here boom a chair flies across the room br br 6 time to eat oh no the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her <UNK> lol ridiculous br br 7 let's get out the board <UNK> one of the legs on the fell off the side of the board that couldn't be because the people were pushing it could it they find out a ghost there is named charles br br 8 wait what was that noise in the <UNK> <UNK> oh my <UNK> fell out i think she kept people up here br br 9 now <UNK> girl is going to brave looking up the <UNK> <UNK> oh what's this she sees something and is asking people who aren't looking up the <UNK> what it is <UNK> it falls off straight at her perfect camera shot she moves just in time it was more chain br br 10 now we have to separate and each our <UNK> rooms wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now okay br br chick 1 wow suddenly her room is shaking but no one <UNK> does br br dude 1 actually says to himself charles is that you charles it can't be you because you're just a <UNK> of my imagination aren't you charles well guess what he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor another lucky camera shot br br chick 2 hears things try to communicate and is standing there getting or something br br dude 2 he was in the attic reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a <UNK> i don't remember what else br br 11 dude 2 runs gets chick 2 they hear chick and dude 1 screaming they find them <UNK> to a wall and <UNK> to a table they leave cut to black final text tell us they escaped safely were treated for minor cuts they have since had nightmares and insomnia we also find out the next day a <UNK> call was made by they name a someone named charles br br <UNK> over br br okay when i first heard this movie was being made i couldn't wait i thought it was going to be real real real and more professional with more professional type people i love the idea of this type of thing i'd love to see real haunting footage before this movie was released i saw couple reviews of it by people online they both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were time passed i forgot about the film then i realized it was never released at theaters so i found out it went straight to video rented it found that every brutal review was completely true it's too bad i really wanted this to be good br br random thought the house didn't seem to have <UNK> <UNK> kitchen <UNK> that i recall which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time especially the house is truly known for being haunted im pretty sure no one lives there but it looks so clean and <UNK> and what was a cat doing there the property does not have near by neighbors br br all in all you'll only want to rent this if you and your friends wanna sit there and make fun of it or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued you you will will be disappointed if you are expecting a good film or real film br br random thought i believe the producer says the you see is real well technically it is real footage isn't it real footage of fake <UNK> maybe that was his loop hole br br i give this this movie one star strictly on the fact that they told the story of <UNK> a real new orleans story br br the best performance was by the guy who teaches the participants about the ghost hunting equipment in the beginning he was obviously actually real or a good actor br br
<START> <UNK> as written and directed by richard bell may have a few too many stories to tell simultaneously for a <UNK> minute movie to completely succeed but there is such a fine sense of commitment on the part of all the cast and crew that the viewer ends up wanting the movie to work and so it does yes aspects could have been if the producers had more money to spend on the final cut but as a small independent movie from canada this is a tender gently humorous very touching tale about vulnerability and communication and commitment it works on many levels br br in a very well choreographed opening we are <UNK> at a family dinner where obviously something has gone awry and results in a father and two sons taking off in a car and having an accident in which one of the sons is killed with an introduction like that the mood is set for the surviving 18 year old <UNK> son paul anthony looking far too old for credibility as a teenager to desert his family and live on the streets he meets clark clarence a male prostitute who gives <UNK> food and shelter jenny the very fine <UNK> <UNK> who saves him from a bashing by her associate derek ryan <UNK> and becomes <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and father chris alan <UNK> in a finely <UNK> sympathetic role as a priest it is 18th birthday and his father <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> down to give him a present from his deceased grandfather with <UNK> the gift should be opened on 18th birthday br br <UNK> though drinking too much and full of anger <UNK> the tape machine but keeps the tape and begins to listen to the words of his grandfather jason voice by ian <UNK> who <UNK> his own 18th birthday in <UNK> ii in france where he now the very sensitive actor brendan <UNK> has an experience with a wounded <UNK> named <UNK> mark <UNK> also superb and reflects on his one night marriage with a <UNK> singer hannah <UNK> <UNK> of as <UNK> fame and a fine singer and actress here only for something to live for during the war jason offers <UNK> to <UNK> as he dies with a beautiful scene of redemption for he two men at the end the parallels of <UNK> and grandfather jason interplay every time <UNK> <UNK> to the tape and lead <UNK> to ultimately alter his view of life and love subplots include <UNK> isolated existence as a hustler being altered by jeff david in a surprisingly fine film debut who simply wants to be loved by an unexpected <UNK> between jenny and <UNK> by the trust father chris <UNK> in both <UNK> and clark in a good <UNK> manner and by a flashback to the car accident where <UNK> could have saved his brother daniel paul from an abusive act at the hands of his father just before the accident but failed to do so opening his deep guilt and <UNK> misplaced anger <UNK> by his <UNK> taped experiences each of these subplots pulls together at the end creating a sense of closure for each of the people involved br br there are aspects of this film that make it seem like a big budget production the musical score by is performed by the <UNK> <UNK> members the cinematography by kevin van is <UNK> atmospheric and the general quality of acting by this canadian cast is very fine though paul anthony handles his role well casting a very young teenager in the pivotal main role would have made the story work much better and richard bell with only one other film <UNK> <UNK> on his resume gives promise of a young talent to watch despite the shortcomings <UNK> is a worthwhile film and deserves attention grady <UNK>
<START> another try another miss france may be doomed for not being able to produce a good horror movie i mean the least they could do was to shoot the movie in the forest of but even the forest is fake it was shot near paris the subject is useless the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you wish you were deaf nothing could save it br br bad to the bone i wasn't warned i want my money back
<START> this movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time if you suffer from insomnia it is a fool proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time as the movie slowly progresses the audience slips into a state of <UNK> and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain this effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action sweet babes br br also mr <UNK> was obviously unable to master the art of montage a prime example of this is the scene on the <UNK> steps for no apparent reason an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer this editing flaw <UNK> any sort of realism in the entire film honestly i've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons br br some individuals who have commented on this title have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as one of the greatest movies of all time and truly a masterpiece well i'm writing this comment to <UNK> readers to avoid watching this film at all costs my best guess is that my fellow <UNK> critics simply wrote the wrong words in their <UNK> surely what they meant to say was one of the greatest <UNK> <UNK> of all time and truly an epic fail br br in conclusion don't waste your time if you are interested in watching a movie of far superior quality go to www youtube com and watch a <UNK> 3 montage if i played the movie <UNK> <UNK> in a game of <UNK> on guardian i would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then its dead body peace
<START> <UNK> you big <UNK> br br this is the worst piece of crap i've seen in a long time i have just stumbled onto it on late night tv and it is painful to watch really painful how does something like this get made horrible horrible horrible <UNK> the toilet is <UNK> by itself again scary toilet scary toilet scary toilet 1992 doesn't seem like that long ago to me but watching this makes it seem like <UNK> i mean its horrible please don't waste your time on the drivel br br scary old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard scary scary how does this stuff get made
<START> the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors it isn't their outstanding acting and <UNK> chemistry either br br to me it is the <UNK> en scene of the entire movie the settings the lighting the props all add to the mood for love between the main characters a <UNK> of smoke from <UNK> cigarette tells us his state of mind the ever changing tight fitting of reflects the constraints of decision making the ruins of <UNK> <UNK> ties in with the <UNK> relationship of the two leads br br the excellent use of <UNK> en scene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters' relationship the film leaves the audience <UNK> yearning for more
<START> i don't ever remember reading sarah plain and tall in school but when my son told me about it and said they watched the movie in class i wanted to see it too i borrowed the video from the library and watched it as a family it was a wonderful story however i didn't know until a few months ago that there were sequels i finished watching those this week i discovered one small <UNK> in the second movie <UNK> is <UNK> when he was a boy and tells sarah my brothers and sisters and i would dream in <UNK> end those brothers and sisters don't exist in conversations between <UNK> and his father but it is a very small <UNK> and i only caught it watching the trilogy the second time around great movie a must see for good wholesome family viewing
<START> like the other guy said it <UNK> you can count the words that have been said in that entire movie on one of your hands too nudity she got naked like 7 or 8 times in a 1 and a half well past the nudity you'll find a porno behind that film he f <UNK> her all movie long bad acting bad story bad language carmen was swearing all movie long so you get out of that movie scenes and dirty language a lot of gaps in the movie a big silence every now and then the only good thing in that movie is the beautiful places were it has been shot otherwise it's an hour and a half of your life that you'll gonna waste so if u gonna watch that movie good luck it really <UNK>
<START> a spaceship in some <UNK> future where human beings are <UNK> for space travel and have laser guns for weapons crash lands on a strange young planet where dinosaurs are <UNK> also evolved and only on this world have not gone <UNK> yet the survivors of the crash roughly ten bland characters wearing blue white and yellow suits fight for survival against the alien <UNK> monsters br br planet of the dinosaurs is a peculiar movie like i said in my summary above the stop motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors the models are crude but effectively animated and they are much more fascinating and intriguing than these characters portrayed by inexperienced actors and speaking lines from a script that must have been written overnight without a single <UNK> obviously most of the budget was put into the dinosaurs and although there is a fair share of them there's not nearly enough to save us from our boredom these human characters are only there to scream run around and <UNK> these poorly written and <UNK> speeches about survival and unfortunately not nearly enough of them get eaten by the dinosaurs br br overall planet of the dinosaurs is not a film i plan on seeing again some people will simply love it for being so cheap and so poorly made sometimes i enjoy movies like this but this particular film is just too long too boring and very <UNK> on the mind
<START> i have not seen it since 1998 and yet i still can't get it out of my head or stop <UNK> people to find it so that shows what an impression it made br br just a wonderful story br br i just hope to see the <UNK> at least once in person br br i didn't know much about mr <UNK> before this movie as i hadn't seen any of his previous works but his subtle acting in this impressed me and i think his portrayal of <UNK> on <UNK> just shows more of the same he knows enough to let the character shine through instead of the actor shining through which makes him just that much better of an actor br br i can't remember enough about the poor accents to comment but i must say i have always enjoyed barbara <UNK> in all of her roles as well and i thought she also did a phenomenal job in this movie
<START> another decent offering from the pen of vince <UNK> br br a pre malcolm in the middle bryan <UNK> plays patrick <UNK> a deranged guy who eventually <UNK> <UNK> via <UNK> and has him driving west at high <UNK> it has something to do with his severe head <UNK> possible deadly <UNK> his wife just experienced it and the pressure only seems to be <UNK> by heading towards the left coast only <UNK> could relate to this guy's plight and actually bond with his <UNK> before the all night ride is completed br br meanwhile <UNK> seems to have solved the case with a possible <UNK> for mr <UNK> and will meet them at the ocean check it out to see if our dynamic duo can hook up at the pacific and somehow <UNK> mr big problem
<START> very shortly a bad film if you are looking for pure action and no brain or brain or you are under 15 years old and like bruce willis this is the movie also don't expect the scenario to be consistent or even <UNK> if you think a little so don't if you just want to enjoy yourself
<START> i was an extra on this film but wish i wasn't because its rubbish the worst thing about this film is the music but the acting script editing directing and story are terrible as well the main reason its bad is because the budget is so low and the only way to make good film on a low budget is to have a good script the script which should have been ripped up before the film was made isn't funny i didn't laugh once what did make me laugh is how makers probably think the most important thing was getting the film made who cares if its total rubbish the film needed about million pound more budget and a better writer the only reason i didn't give the film one out of ten is because i felt sorry for the guy who is gonna lose a few hundred grand making this if you do go and see it just make sure your drunk at the time ha ha
<START> this is without a doubt one of neil simon's best plays turned movies it's full of great characters and memorable dialog <UNK> silverman makes a great screen version of young eugene he was played by matthew <UNK> on stage this is the first of simon's <UNK> trilogy its followed by the wonderful blues and <UNK> with the tv movie broadway bound if i had to say the movie has any flaws it would maybe be that characters sometimes usually speak in obvious dialog but that's alright because it's great dialog rent this little gem you won't be sorry
<START> you should never ever even consider to watch this movie it is absolutely awful this isn't an <UNK> it is so unbelievable and exaggerated it gets boring it is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one they writer hasn't been able to pull it off in a good way br br if you'd like to see pretty girls in <UNK> and no brain this might be the movie for you but still you should plug your ears and just watch it's not worth listening p there are so many great movies out there and if i could choose one this would be the last movie i would pick but all in all it's your choice br br enjoy
<START> an intense thriller about a mute movie make up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night after she tries to get away from the murder scene she realizes she is in for more than she <UNK> for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat
<START> a four and a half hour o'neill play gets boiled down to a little under two and much of that running time is devoted to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their characters' thoughts in voice over it can work <UNK> but it looks hilariously stilted in this soap opera adaptation which soft its <UNK> bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men norma <UNK> and alexander <UNK> overacting <UNK> are <UNK> by a <UNK> clark gable he's the only one who makes the frozen face technique work it gets even funnier when <UNK> and <UNK> son a <UNK> <UNK> does the frozen face <UNK> there are also frank <UNK> brother ralph as an <UNK> <UNK> given to poor charlie over and over again and a young robert young and maureen <UNK> by the time they show up the voice overs have largely been abandoned and it plays as a <UNK> soap with a sentimental <UNK> that actually plays silver threads among the gold as background music robert <UNK> direction is <UNK> and he shows little facility for in <UNK> actors it's certainly entertaining there's nothing else like it unless you count <UNK> satirical parody in animal <UNK> or an old mad magazine satire that rendered shirley <UNK> sitcom <UNK> a la strange <UNK> but it isn't good
<START> i really seldom give either one or ten stars to any movie but this was so awful i had to make an exception br br i am a scifi fan and have seen a few comedic takes on scifi that i genuinely like there just wasn't anything here to like br br i realize this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student but even considering that the sets and effect are bad the cinematography is mediocre but may be the best part of the movie br br the acting is bad a sad state when the female voice over for the computer is the best actor the dialogue is bad the script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistent br br the humor is not just subtle and sublime it's nowhere to be found as an example a whole 20 minutes of the 80 minute film is spent on a lame 2 punch <UNK> joke with the alien <UNK> and the elevator br br this was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50's scifi to 2001 what we end up with though is just a slightly updated version of an old 50's scifi c movie at least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously
<START> i must have missed a part of this movie i found myself asking who is this and when did that happen it seemed to jump around but i kept watching for fear i was missing something and it would all be explained to me i loved <UNK> <UNK> but this movie made no sense to me at all i did love all the actors but what happened to the rest of the movie it made me go what at the beginning of each part as far as the scenery i thought it was fine it made me feel though like i was through a book and leaving pages out the ending had me a little confused too although i imagine the boy was waiting for his father and was meant to leave you wondering if his father would finally come home to his son and be a father since his mother was now gone i would like to read the book just to see what i missed in the movie i don't expect this one to win any awards
<START> first off i absolutely loved this movie as a billy crystal fan i must say that i was expecting more comedic situations than i actually got however it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion his portrayal of talent agent sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him in addition as <UNK> was superb in his first film role when sammy goes to romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down he never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life sammy and <UNK> journey is unique and moving and even humorous at times plus the location in czech republic where parts of the film were shot was absolutely beautiful i have to say this dramatic comedy had me feeling a variety of emotions i thought it was excellent and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone
<START> br br well great costumes and a wonderful <UNK> for pre wwii italy but what happened here br br great actors <UNK> scott thomas sean penn anne <UNK> james fox derek <UNK> if you can't get memorable performances out of this a <UNK> then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an <UNK> script i rented this on dvd after having liked angels insects 1995 also directed by philip <UNK> br br i can hardly believe how dull this thing was it just dragged on and on and no one was able to save the poor thing this is not even a good intriguing foreign <UNK> and young things in pretty clothes chick flick br br tea with <UNK> gone <UNK> br br
<START> what was i thinking when i rented this one what did the <UNK> think when he copied the tape and <UNK> it all the way to holland that anyone really wanted to see this s br br it's about some <UNK> getting into trouble outer space apollo 13 flashback but never even in the shadow of this fine film and they want to return to home if you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible br br this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and <UNK> and this one fails everywhere deep impact and <UNK> weren't perfect either far from it but they were at least worth watching once and maybe one more time when we're all old they gave some fun max q doesn't it gives <UNK> okay okay it's a tv movie but does that mean you're allowed to come up with such a mess br br if you haven't <UNK> in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time br br it gets at its worst at the end when the space <UNK> lands on no i can't <UNK> this one imdb <UNK> <UNK> it so you have to see for yourself no don't see it sorry but rent a movie which is worth renting like battlefield earth just kidding br br probably the worst one i have ever seen
<START> it was <UNK> with some degree of <UNK> that i sat down to watch what a friend had promised would be the worst best movie experience of my life the mighty blade 2 years on and i'm still in therapy oh yes my dear friends it really is that bad they obviously got about 40 minutes of footage in the can and then decided to use said footage endlessly and repeatedly to brain numbing effect my only fear of the kind of post apocalyptic world featured in this turkey is that somehow some way a print of this abomination would survive truly the living would envy the dead
<START> we've all seen bad movies well this one takes the cake i've seen that junior movie box staring back at many times from my many <UNK> to the horror section at the local video store and i was a little interested it looks like it pays some homage to texas chainsaw massacre so i thought i'd get it mistake junior sucks hard long and with commitment in other words it's really bad although it does win my award for most creative use of a bikini top avoid
<START> the quote above just about says it all for <UNK> i should have <UNK> out of this film after the first half hour but decided i ought to be fair and give it a chance i won't watch it again so if anyone with the <UNK> to do so can get back to me with the number of clichÃ©d lines in the movie i'm sure it will set a record br br some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this <UNK> mark <UNK> portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton is his <UNK> <UNK> character has <UNK> <UNK> prisoner an <UNK> taking his name from the poet byron bob peck <UNK> shoots <UNK> paxton with a <UNK> containing a tracking device so he and his companion kitty <UNK> can keep <UNK> on the pair the real question though is why didn't he just fire the device at byron thereby cutting out the br br if you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy <UNK> <UNK> then i suppose you'll find something of interest here but you can't convince me that the film makes sense on any level scenes of a futuristic stone age make way for high society <UNK> but the <UNK> of poor taste is reached when <UNK> character is displayed following a night of <UNK> with all over his <UNK> if anyone thinks there's some hidden meaning here you're really <UNK> br br <UNK> waiting for the frame <UNK> the end to come into view alas even that was denied if beauty is in the eye of the <UNK> then so is understanding this movie had neither yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run an awesome view of a half dozen hot air <UNK> apparently the film was keeping them <UNK>
<START> <UNK> i'm surprised this movie still exists in any form let alone it being available for rent br br this flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the t a and the cheap laughs the story line crosses a bit of texas chainsaw massacre with a <UNK> <UNK> back story reminiscent of psycho and a bit of the good old women in chains tough as nail ex con <UNK> tossed in for good measure in other words complete <UNK> wrapped up in half naked women <UNK> with a dash of utter idiocy looking on as the director attempts to make the <UNK> land of <UNK> pass off as southern u s <UNK> land is sad i tell ya br br funny thing for me is i was actually at the <UNK> of this flick as at the time i was pals with the film's star it was painful to watch on as jeremy <UNK> into his seat whilst the flick <UNK> its <UNK> wings br br i'm happy to see that after this <UNK> of a first flick has grown into one hell of an actor he can be seen regularly on the canadian cop drama blue murder has appeared on <UNK> not to mention his role in the classic clint eastwood film <UNK> we forgive ya jeremy it was a rocky start but you done good man br br t paul
<START> in my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash however the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band i recognized the music as being a band called and the album was just a nightmare and it was very well written and i am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it if can remember back that far i would appreciate the feed back i collect old movie and obscure movie sound tracks it is a very time <UNK> <UNK> but is very rewarding i have seen this bands music being sold in germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album not to bad hugh
<START> this movie <UNK> me i could not get a grip on it thought i might be missing something glad to see that most of you agree with me this isn't always the case see my recent review of re <UNK> br br to <UNK> upon the faults of this film any further would be a glorious waste of time so i will br br they're dressed like <UNK> but it's modern times right no i don't get it when i picked up the box i thought zombie western cool that's how it was presented haven't seen that yet hope they did a good job br br they didn't they tried to create an iconic character that would <UNK> a series they didn't br br they tried to make an aussie indie zombie flick on the caliber and perhaps riding on the coat <UNK> of the very well done undead they didn't br br okay maybe they just wanted to make a confusing disjointed mess of film <UNK> that might ultimately be edited into something watchable they didn't this is the new number 2 on my list of worst zombie movies ever there are really just the two so far day of the dead being the first not to be confused with day of the dead which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time if you're gonna make a zombie movie and i'm not a zombie movie maker i'm just a <UNK> make a good one flight of the living dead is a good example of decent recent zombie <UNK> <UNK> br br if you're really <UNK> you might think well didn't they at least throw in something to make us feel like we didn't want our money back guess what they didn't
<START> you have to have lived in japan for awhile to enjoy the beauty of this movie i lived on <UNK> for over 2 years and northern for 4 believe it or not what you see paints a very good and accurate picture of <UNK> east west <UNK> both from a sports as well as personal relationships perspective a funny funny and heartwarming movie that deserves better than americans viewing it can ever judge 8 out of 10
<START> definitely not a good film but nowhere as bad as some would paint it to be nightmare in wax tells the story of a man having had his face <UNK> in a typical flashback scene <UNK> his vengeance on those directly responsible and those <UNK> for the <UNK> in his life most notably the love and <UNK> of a beautiful young actress cameron mitchell plays the artist with his typical flair albeit limited flair actually i thought he gave one of his better performances what exactly does that mean mitchell wears an eye <UNK> endlessly <UNK> <UNK> wears a <UNK> <UNK> and talks to his creations in wax they are not your ordinary wax <UNK> but rather people still alive controlled by some serum that makes them lose control of all <UNK> function they become zombies in effect i thought the premise here was inventive if nothing else it has some ludicrous explanation but does serve the plot this is a film of the 60s to be sure with some psychedelic camera work by bud <UNK> and company the acting is mediocre but mitchell scott brady and barry give interesting turns the wax figures of hollywood's <UNK> era are done very effectively and most of the location shooting was very credible the end of the film <UNK> into something not quite real either another example of 60s cultural cinema or the end of the <UNK> creativity i'm <UNK> on the latter despite its many flaws i enjoyed the film the opening scene showing an actor being was effectively done as was a police chase on the <UNK>
<START> everyone wants duvall and jones back come on viewers are saying things like and urban aren't as deep were you as deep when you were young that's the whole point they have a lot to learn and urban pull off the shallow innocence they were directed to act and with superb commitment to <UNK> the nuances of duvall and jones' <UNK> into the characters is <UNK> perfect as the early gus and urban is subtly perfect as the early <UNK> what a bold move it must have been for them to take on such a position in the entertainment industry they must have known they would have everyone coming down on them for not actually being the beloved originals yet they clearly put the best effort forward i gave it a 7 because the editing was choppy in places and time lines were <UNK> but the acting was a joy to watch val kilmer was absolutely great one more thing i expect audiences would have been more accepting of the <UNK> implied by the appearances of a <UNK> and blue and gold <UNK> if more effort had been put into the way they appear and are so simply accepted by the characters
<START> i would rate this film high on my list of ingrid bergman films <UNK> beauty aside her talent is evident in scene after scene she was sad mean witty br br <UNK> <UNK> delightfully funny loving tender <UNK> <UNK> happy etc you name it she was all those things and more and so br br convincing ingrid plays a notorious woman <UNK> who comes back to new br br orleans and falls for a texas <UNK> gary cooper clint i especially loved the scene where they are sitting at the <UNK> table saying nothing just staring at each other she in an elegant white <UNK> and he in a handsome white cowboy br br outfit sitting there looking at her <UNK> what chemistry what love
<START> surprisingly good made for t v thriller i wasn't expecting too much from this one but i'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind it's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events br br the story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits you can't help but find the movie very interesting br br the background story of character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father br br the stranger concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society a serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family and this movie displays the sickness and crime in a perfect way br br my <UNK> with the movie was the non sense situation when character returns home with her deranged husband after he's released on <UNK> by that moment she knew what he did to his young relative played by the cute <UNK> <UNK> but that's just the typical hollywood scene that <UNK> more trouble br br the climax scene shows <UNK> following her husband when he's about to commit another rape then she calls the cops who come in time just to capture him the ending tells us that the husband was sentenced for 99 years in prison in real life br br the acting is also pretty good and <UNK> is great and gorgeous as always the direction is also very good
<START> this movie has to be the worst film of 2007 it was just really bad and i don't think i have ever seen a film that is just so bad i mean the don't make really bad hollywood films do they <UNK> really should stick to singing instead of acting cause he just can't act at all god he was just so bad i mean he was that bad in the film that he made <UNK> look like a better actress than him as for her performance she plays the same role in every movie god it is just so boring watching her i mean what do men see in this woman yeah she has a god body but where is that talent i have not seen it yet and at this rate i don't think that i ever will br br anyway <UNK> falls in love with <UNK> now this 15 year old girl can act my god she was the best actor in the film and she does not look 15 at all to me she looks about 21 but her performance was brilliant in the film bless her she was really good i hope to see more of her in the future so <UNK> falls in love with but her father wants her to marry someone else a typical bollywood film anyways there is a <UNK> can only happen in a bollywood film and the both get married in the end br br well i would give <UNK> music 10 10 it was superb that made the movie a hit the songs were truly amazing and brilliant anyways the only thing that i can say is to go and buy the music and not watch the film
<START> this story focuses on the birth <UNK> known as or <UNK> alcohol syndrome a disease <UNK> too often among native americans in spite of the down beat nature of this drama the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well this is arguably best performance
<START> <UNK> jack black runs away from home after being <UNK> by his father meat <UNK> years later he finally makes it to hollywood and comes across the greatest guitar player he has ever heard kyle glass br br after a little <UNK> the two decide join forces and perform at an open <UNK> night at what appears to be a less than popular bar to their shock they don't do that good br br back at their less than spectacular apartment the two are trying to figure out what the legends of rock have that they don't while looking at some old magazines it's only then that they realize that the <UNK> on the covers have the same guitar pick br br while trying to look for a similar pick an employee of the music shop ben stiller who is also the film's executive producer tells him the ancient story of the pick of destiny of which they seek this employee who has long gray hair and thick glasses also tells them that the pick which was made from <UNK> tooth is in a history of rock museum br br now the two pot smoking losers with <UNK> of <UNK> goes on a music filled adventure to steal the pick br br let me say this up front if you are not a fan of <UNK> d which gave us the comedy actor jack black then you should skip this one i am not a fan of these two and only watched it because it was suggested by com br br the jokes for the most part produce silence more than anything i laughed at maybe three of the jokes and <UNK> at a few others <UNK> d is only for a certain audience of which i am not br br this movie <UNK> in numerous places and this is where the worst jokes appear and let me say that when black and glass are not working off one another they are completely lost on screen br br all the songs in this movie is by and performed by <UNK> d many of the songs perfectly advance the storyline by describing their adventures at the time in the film however i felt that the songs sounded too similar to be told apart br br another problem with this film is that the language will turn off a lot of people there are a lot of four letter words in this film there are also some drug references i would not recommend this for children br br part of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is that black is in your face and glass stays in his shadows for the most part this is how they are in this movie and it doesn't really work now this may have been part of the act but i felt that glass just didn't want to be there in one scene he performs his background lyrics at a party and he just can't work alone br br <UNK> d are supposedly rock fans in real life and have maybe two rock legends in the movie i lost count because i was so bored with this film personally i would have liked to have seen more rock legends and icons in the film however we don't get that br br what we do get is a movie filled with completely lame jokes lots of foul language a lackluster script you also get horrible acting and an unoriginal story however you get some pretty good songs that pretty much sound the same br br the story could have been promising but many of the scenes appeared to have been added into the film at the last second this is somewhat similar to the blues brothers movie many years ago but the blues brothers had a much bigger following and two songs on the <UNK> music <UNK> <UNK> d only has a small following with a few hbo <UNK> under their belt and unlike the blues brothers the comedy is not well thought out at all br br if you are a hard core fan of <UNK> d then i suggest you check it out however like most of the movie audience when this film was released to theaters i would say avoid this one save your money on this one folks
<START> wow what a movie if you want to blow your budget on the title and have it look real bad ask the guys that made this movie on how to do that they could have spent the money on a good rewrite or something else or they could have spent it on beer when they made this movie at least it would have come out better
<START> this film has a premise that is good enough to get anyone talking and a sure fire conversation <UNK> you sleep with someone you dislike or don't know for one million dollars ' while the film had lots of potential poor execution turns it into a b grade soap opera the film has a great lead up and after the <UNK> is made we are really into the film but then it falls dramatically the last 3 quarters of the film is spent by characters <UNK> complaining and <UNK> what they have done the ending was so cliched it had me in tears this has a very similar premise to in <UNK> which is far better see that instead
<START> this was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen the acting was god awful the story line also was bad it was however a good idea if this movie would have had better <UNK> and a lot better actors i might of had something better to say edgar allen poe was a great gothic writer and this movie just destroyed it why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies the only good part was when the killer put the head under the floor with a tape going that was pretty good the swinging axe was just horrible there was absolutely no suspense and also when the killer is chasing everyone around in the end he was going from one place to another in just seconds it makes absolutely no sense
<START> have you seen all the big adventures of last few decades if you have don't bother with this one as you've already seen most of the scenes already and i can guarantee that those scenes were originally in much better movies br br the story i'm sure that true <UNK> will never forgive me is childish and stupid stupid in a way that making it play in a <UNK> would result in a bunch of angry walking dead every character is based in a clichÃ© and well they're nothing but the clichÃ© and yes again all you need to be a hero is to be american br br at least in <UNK> they advertised this to be the kind of movie the dvd was made for maybe i should sell my player then br br 1 10
<START> i woke up and it was a beautiful day the sun was shining the birds were singing and i <UNK> getting a movie something new a horror movie perhaps like many other reviewers i came across what can only be described as a piece of in a gold <UNK> the front cover is great and the comment on the back is <UNK> <UNK> will scare the crop out of <UNK> oh how i chuckle looking back at such <UNK> and ignorance br br one of the many things scarier than this movie is the acting skills of these <UNK> i think no i did actually cheer when they got <UNK> up by these <UNK> who were wearing some classic fancy dress costumes i used to drive quite quickly past <UNK> as i found them to be pretty scary at night but having seen this movie i nearly wet myself through laughing so much just at the sight br br i have seen scarier quite honestly not mine though i'm a <UNK> hand at cooking and if anyone associates this movie with my let's just say that i would create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row br br if anyone has any good corn crop not pop movies they can recommend feel free to inform me it's a great comedy if nothing else ok it is nothing else enjoy but a little advice before <UNK> the play button on your dvd player throw it out of the window
<START> br br this film was produced and released as a <UNK> to a ghastly although fairly popular slapstick <UNK> beach comedy called but it has little or no connection with the earlier film and is better <UNK> completely in its own right it is certainly better than i and is more closely related to films such as <UNK> and summer lovers which were also filmed during summer in the greek islands the combination of <UNK> <UNK> on blue <UNK> with beautiful bare <UNK> makes for seductive viewing but except for <UNK> just designed to help plan your next holiday even such films require an adequate story line if they are to hold a viewers attention for more than a very few minutes <UNK> was <UNK> by the legend of the re incarnation of the <UNK> and summer lovers had the <UNK> of a <UNK> a <UNK> as its theme in my view both these films were much more successful than ii which has a very <UNK> story line and depends too much on simplistic semi slapstick comedy the use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious it usually leads to a series of very short self contained cameo sequences that are hard to <UNK> into an ongoing story line mel brooks achieved this brilliantly with silent movie but few other films have succeeded in the same way and ii unfortunately does not there is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not co habit happily with the <UNK> and peaceful scenario in which the film is set the final airport sequences were no doubt intended to provide a hilarious ending for this film but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of <UNK> slapstick pseudo comedy they are also grossly overlong so i left the cinema with a bad taste left in my mouth this is a film which could have been much more successful with a stronger story line and with most of its slapstick sequences very heavily <UNK> as it was released it certainly does not warrant a viewers rating higher than 3 br br there is little memorable in the acting but the cast does its best within the limitations <UNK> by a <UNK> story line and poor direction it is in these latter areas that the failure <UNK> br br
<START> this movie has some of the worst acting i've ever seen dennis <UNK> performance was high school caliber while it's difficult to portray an off the wall character like jerry lee lewis it can be done just ask jamie foxx although ray charles had more depth to his personality and <UNK> than lewis ever <UNK> of <UNK> the phillips brothers portrayal <UNK> in the dukes of hazzard and alec baldwin playing jimmy is a bit like donald duck performing shakespeare when robert duvall played a country preacher i bought it baldwin never made me believe a single word <UNK> <UNK> part was the best and she was mediocre and can anyone figure out how she was 13 when lewis met her and still 13 more than a year later some checking on the internet reveals the essential facts presented by the film were true at least no more <UNK> up than most hollywood bio <UNK> this film did badly at the box office and it should have
<START> this movie is probably one of 3 worst movies made in history i rented this by chance without reading reviews and wow do i regret it really has no plot doesn't really follow the vampire genre just plain god awful watching this movie will <UNK> your enthusiasm for vampire movies i felt like the writer director producer went on this drug <UNK> and had hallucinations and tried to recreate it on film whole time i wanted the movie to end but the ending was even more whacked br br if this review can save just one person from watching this crap i felt my time spent on <UNK> and writing this review was well worth it
<START> i've loved this movie for a long time i hadn't seen it in a while so i again checked it out and actually found it even more enjoyable now i loved the <UNK> cartoon when i was young so naturally i <UNK> 'the <UNK> adventure ' br br i honestly can't think of a better plot to this movie it's not wildly creative but i've always wanted to travel all over the world and so i just have so much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more the part with <UNK> singing to the little penguin always makes me cry br br 'the <UNK> <UNK> will remain a favorite of mine forever i'm sure i guess it's because i saw it when i was so young i don't think it would make quite an impact on someone older seeing it for the first time unless of course they have a young heart
<START> this was an <UNK> bad film ashley rose <UNK> was horrible she had none of shirley <UNK> charm at all those ghastly smiles she would do when she up her <UNK> little eyes in a way that i think was <UNK> to be cute and make the audience go bless it just made me want to slap her she must have oh my about a hundred times throughout the film also she could barely utter a sentence without accompanying it with a fake giggle horrible horrible film if i could rate it minus 10 i would don't waste your money on this piece of rubbish go out and buy a genuine shirley temple film
<START> i watched the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death so i fast forward all the way through the end this movie must be the worst of all in the low budget sci fi movies category so far bad acting cast directions lara craft <UNK> imitation story plot everything through out the entire movie i think that there maybe only 6 to 7 people in the entire cast but only two of them started in the entire movie i was expecting something like the starship <UNK> but it was nothing close to it i was fooled by the movie title and the picture on the dvd cover don't waste your time watching this boring and bad movie come to think of it i wonder why did they even bother to put out bad movies like this one
<START> who's responsible for these behind the scenes things who are these actors did they crawl out from beneath rocks lots of <UNK> ' no no <UNK> for me only loathing and shame that i am a human being i have to <UNK> my eyes from the set it's so embarrassing in fact i changed the channel br br i've always had a problem with robin <UNK> non stop 'i forgot my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but at least he's funny once in a blue moon watching someone who isn't funny at all <UNK> robin williams is like having each tooth in your head pulled slowly and <UNK> without <UNK> for all eternity br br please stop making these absolutely horrifying tv movies please
<START> what more can i add this is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen terrible acting a <UNK> script <UNK> slow pace even visible <UNK> <UNK> from the top of the screen i could go on but i really can't be bothered i watched this for 90 minutes before the sense of losing the will to live became too great for me br br i can only assume that the first set of comments and votes were from people associated with the promotion of this insult to british film making br br and worst still i had to buy the mail on sunday to get it the only reason the dvd hasn't now been as a coaster is that it now takes pride of place in my top 10 worst films ever collection br br definitely one to be avoided
<START> <UNK> creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash some knowledge of movie making a mixed bag of aspiring actors and a lot of determination yet all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull off anything more than a fairly poor looking after school special in a bad way not a nostalgic good way i mean this is so so quality home movie student film stuff if you want to pass it around to family and friends for free thankfully i found it in a <UNK> bin somewhere sure there may be some sort of market out there for this kind of thing but it is a market that seems to only exist by <UNK> because there are so many poor b movies out there even more so now in this day and age br br the only people i would recommend this move to is aspiring <UNK> filmmakers first i would recommend that they watch the special feature making of thing included on the disc see the film <UNK> enthusiasm their hard work joy and very high opinions of their own product then watch the movie within a few frames you will hopefully understand what went wrong bored i went through the whole thing and clearly the director and cinematographer tried but just don't know enough about what they are doing they knew enough to have fun but in the long run without necessary skills this <UNK> to they knew enough to be dangerous this is like a bad <UNK> movie as <UNK> to a more decent one i guess a couple of the actors did ok and the cool <UNK> looking dude with the <UNK> real or fake <UNK> i know not was probably the best and most natural and i hope he makes it but their natural acting talent was what was coming through despite the bad movie bad script and so so directing principles if the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors to develop their characters studying successfully <UNK> camera techniques and lighting principles to direct his crew better and if the script had been actually worked on instead of written in a week or so according to the very indulgent documentary then maybe this could have been more of a film instead it's a film that has a feeling of some potential and has a few moments in it due more to the genre than the film itself but ends up showing nearly every frame what not to do if you want to see what a decent low budget horror movie can really look like watch phantasm or even <UNK> if you want a <UNK> home movie no joke get <UNK> creatures
<START> i am sitting here writing this review and the movie's not even over yet in fact i just checked and there are 45 more minutes to go but no matter there's no need to see it through to the end i'll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles <UNK> to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which i don't care to ever see or know br br what accounts for my <UNK> to this movie the characters are not believable the plot is not believable the <UNK> of the movie is sickening basically every element of the movie rings false <UNK> obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of movies which have already explored the well worn themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent <UNK> of life however <UNK> was badly mistaken because this movie contains nothing new it tries very hard to be depressing but fortunately no one can really be depressed by it because it's obvious that no people like this exist in the entire world br br what is depressing however is the knowledge that somehow this film was voted several <UNK> awards disgusting bottom line stay away from this worthless film at all costs
<START> even people who dislike the film usually because they find the ending confused should appreciate the strong acting of <UNK> wood joseph who played the two young leads in this movie br br spoiler warning at a literal level the ending makes no sense people who think the ending makes some sense at other levels are divided between those who 1 think the younger brother was killed by the step father either the one time mike the older boy was away dealing with the neighborhood gang or flew off the wishing spot in his <UNK> to escape the situation through death those 2 who think the younger brother is imaginary his flying off in the <UNK> transformed into a flying machine <UNK> his <UNK> the abusive situation br br i favor 2 it makes a lot of sense in terms of the way many children deal with abusive situations it is not <UNK> for an abused child to split his or her psyche project the abused self into something else a stuffed animal even an imaginary friend this way it makes a lot more sense that it is always the younger boy who is abused never mike in reality it is unlikely for one of two brothers to get all the abuse although that does happen also it is bobby the younger brother who is also the <UNK> one the one who insists that they can overcome the situation also the death of a real life sibling through abuse would have been too shattering for an adult with this in his history to <UNK> into as upbeat a fantasy ending as this
<START> being quite a fan of charlie chaplin following good <UNK> after seeing first 'the gold and then <UNK> i was eager to see 'the great as i had been told this was arguably his best film i was also intrigued at the fact it was a <UNK> my first one chaplin wise br br the start is typical chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound <UNK> can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking it's funny well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes it was good to draw the viewer in with this <UNK> opening and at the same time kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another what was also well done was the way in which hitler is <UNK> any scene involving hitler or in this film was funny and even now makes you think back as you know exactly who he's <UNK> and does create an internal reaction of some kind the way in which english in mixed in with the mock german during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way chaplin managed to adapt to the <UNK> era my favourite joke was the five minute speech gave only for the english <UNK> to translate it into a mere few words making you think back to footage of hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and indeed laugh at him br br historically the film got a few things right as well is seen getting his photograph taken with children something hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here is seen to yawn and act bored stabbing at hitler's <UNK> technique of winning over the german public through sympathy oh he <UNK> and kisses children he must be ok the film is also given a fantastic premise of a jewish <UNK> into the ghetto amongst all the going on but with the catch that he is oblivious films such as 'the and <UNK> and <UNK> are two good examples of nazi cruelty towards <UNK> people which nowadays we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed the fact he had the cruelty going on and was <UNK> it makes it even more an astounding achievement chaplin has managed to replace guns and <UNK> for tomatoes and and still pulls it off br br what i didn't like about the film however was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening this <UNK> the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat the film started to hint at stories and sub stories these included the <UNK> and the female <UNK> falling in love and the supposed destruction of palace whereas none of these were actually developed the a woman a and the has the <UNK> in their <UNK> does the gags were <UNK> at these plot paths but in the end just into nothing but excuses for drawn out unfunny gags which was disappointing br br during the final straight the great dictator gets a boost from the fact the italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film it works a treat as we see them argue and more <UNK> tactics are exploited when attempts to his italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks although they are <UNK> <UNK> despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact i felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat the great dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the <UNK> of <UNK> things nobody else really knew were there
<START> this was one of those films i would always come across be it on tv or cheap dvd but never struck me to give it a shot as i thought i wasn't missing out on much it was on one night and i thought oh <UNK> why not a good decision too as i would kick myself for taking so long to get around to it for me it left me impressed as it's up there with burt <UNK> best features <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> back to those 70s 80s gritty <UNK> urban crime thrillers that weren't afraid to be obscure and go out of their way to set up characters pack it with realistically brutal force and effectively <UNK> the local locations <UNK> being the case here to the <UNK> with grounded photography in certain shades it kind of reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> but that's loosely however it's <UNK> blues score with its <UNK> kicks funky shifts and unhinged sounds very much had me thinking of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> score he <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> the music soundtrack on the other hand is hit or miss br br sgt tom <UNK> was an atlantic <UNK> agent before a slip out during a bust saw him to vice work along with his new squad they come across a prostitution ring which catches their interest due to fact it's owned by one hard to track and to convict crime lord what they dig up involves a prominent government figure and a call girl which can give them some important names but they must get to her before she's made a target br br burt <UNK> acts but also directs in an firm and muscular fashion which would suit his <UNK> hard <UNK> performance and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hard bitten and taut screenplay that was adapted from william <UNK> novel well he does show some sort of heart insightful thoughts amongst that armor within the scenes involving the <UNK> able british actress rachel ward be it the stake out scenes when he's watching her from another building and slowly becoming <UNK> by her to when they finally come together but these latter interactions mid way through do slow up the momentum but give it noir like <UNK> the performances are fairly spot on with <UNK> a great <UNK> with exceptional actors charles <UNK> earl <UNK> brian keith richard <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> profanity and witty dialogues between these guys were a blast as for the corrupt villains <UNK> <UNK> builds <UNK> strength and power but it's henry <UNK> who seems born for these roles cunning and <UNK> turn that makes the show where his appearance seems to outline things to come and help them fall into place plus his <UNK> filled and violent cat and mouse climax with <UNK> and his team is brilliantly done br br the exciting action <UNK> might be quick and dry but remain <UNK> violent like an immensely teeth <UNK> <UNK> sequence some handy old fashion filming techniques add to the suspense the intriguing material keeps it quite <UNK> being character derived but when we think its smooth <UNK> it offers up a blunt surprise or two along with some intensely <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie reminds me of <UNK> sunshine of the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> not because of content but because it is one of those movies that you don't hear about except through word of mouth or you read the back of the dvd at the video store and think why not needless to say i was pleasantly surprised like the aforementioned films at how good it was and how much i enjoyed it br br best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with only intrigue <UNK> you to actually watch it also best seen with someone else or if you know someone else that has seen it you will want to talk about it it's a beautiful film that stays with you well after you watch it it's also an intelligent watch that requires little effort into <UNK> out parts for yourself br br just enjoy
<START> we get to see who the good guys are the union and who the bad guys are a rich man who steals <UNK> and his spoiled son the filmmaker forces us to see good from evil all the characters hate the bad guys so that when watching the film this can help us along on hating the bad guys this is the worst kind of film making manipulative and childish the plot centers on a cop who is in between the good and the bad and he's stuck in this ugly film it's boring and pointless the narration by star <UNK> is really bad and a good actor don <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> playing the guy no one likes and who we aren't supposed to like it takes a long time for this bore to take off and for the title to <UNK> itself then when it does take off it crashes a minute later boring one of the worst films ever made
<START> this was amongst the worst films i have ever encountered the cinematography was dull with long tedious shots like a camera on a <UNK> filming a stage play interspersed with dramatic angles that made little sense to the content on screen the editing was terrible scenes matched together with the <UNK> of a butcher the plot <UNK> on the viewer being familiar with the historical night in which mary shelley wrote <UNK> the acting was forced with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly the sooner the better

<START> the novel weapon which serves as the basis for this atrocious piece of garbage is one of the best <UNK> thrillers to come down the <UNK> in a long time the character of solo who is not supposed to look like a human is a wonderful creation and it was simply awful to see him reduced to just another terminator clone with mario van <UNK> <UNK> trying to act like a robot there is nothing worthwhile about this film br br why does hollywood insist on <UNK> up the rights to excellent novels and then <UNK> them there are so many things wrong with solo that listing them seems as unfair as <UNK> a man with no legs to a <UNK> game of avoid this awful film and seek out the 2 novels by robert mason that feature the awesome character of solo the books are weapon and an excellent sequel solo but don't pay any attention to this awful dreck of a film
<START> trying to catch a serial killer did they ever think of tracking the license plate number of the black van or <UNK> the video tapes he sent oh brother the plot of this movie was so full of holes it was pathetic now i know why there are bad movies in the world this one however was one of the worst
<START> this film has not been seen by me in quite a few years it came on the disney channel in the wee hours of the morning i stayed up to watch it and found it even more entertaining than the first time the story the scenery and the characters are as good as they come i know that if anyone takes the time to view this film they will find it definitely worth seeing a second time it's very memorable in more ways than one i would recommend this film to anyone because it is both entertaining and educational for all concerned br br s
<START> this is a little seen anti war film that has been ignored for too long the time is <UNK> of 1972 the place is a typical suburban home somewhere in texas the oldest son has just comeback from vietnam and he is having a hell of time <UNK> to the life he had left behind and the family does not know how to handle the problem i honestly don't think i'm <UNK> when i say this is one the most heart wrenching war films i've seen the funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie most of the story takes place inside a house over a period of a couple of days but the kind of war that takes place in this home is as intense as any real battlefield action the film does something that is difficult to accomplish somehow <UNK> and his team have created a film that <UNK> the entire vietnam experience and considering the similarities between vietnam and the current invasion of iraq the film is surprisingly relevant <UNK> does a magnificent job with material he gets a lot of help from a hand picked cast martin sheen and kathy bates in particular are superb as the parents a truly moving film highly recommended
<START> a friend of mine who has a mysterious knack for finding and horrors liking bad movies recommended i watch 'the <UNK> ' at the time unaware of just how truly pathetic his taste in movies was i decided to give it a try br br bad mistake br br the story although clearly ripped straight out of any sixth grade english <UNK> as far as the <UNK> theme goes would be amusing under the right conditions good actors writer director wardrobe and so on and so on to almost no end clearly these factors are absent br br 'the is supposed to be funny i think i say think because i let crack nothing more than a slight smile throughout the whole film not a <UNK> not a laugh not a chuckle not even a grin a smile at best and that happened so rarely while watching this film i even remember how often i did smile maybe 3 or 4 times at best br br so do yourself an immense favor never watch this movie avoid at all costs
<START> this movie is very modern and forward it is about 75 in english it is aimed at english speaking <UNK> going young audience basic plot is similar to <UNK> acting is below average br br unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters is shown drinking from a bottle or taking shots of <UNK> about 5 6 times in the movie the director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem all through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work at a beach or at a wedding the heroine of the movie doing this makes the youngsters feel this behaviour is acceptable br br the less that is said about failure of <UNK> doing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> role of arrogant girl <UNK> the better the movie is about <UNK> of <UNK> but <UNK> should not be about making the same mistakes instead about doing the right to do the right thing if men have been shown as <UNK> <UNK> in movies does not mean women should also portray same behaviour br br even though the movie is made in light hearted fun spirit it <UNK> so many wrong social notions in the name of being forward that fun part of the movie makes no impact not even in canada women dress like this or guys behave like they have shown in the movie it is certainly not a reflection of indian society or even canadian society perhaps they should have a <UNK> at the beginning stating all characters and events in the movie are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film the only good thing about this movie is the length 1 5 <UNK> thank god
<START> i share the same opinion regarding underworld as the previous comment br br i sat through the 1 5 hours of this movie wondering what this story was all about and more importantly why the author and or director had made certain decisions for the plot on the whole i found the movie to be <UNK> <UNK> of strange sub plots which imho actually had nothing to do with the movie furthermore when writing a thriller i'd say you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not about the way the story is filmed
<START> don't change your husband is on the one hand the beginning of a series of lightweight marital comedies from cecil b demille on the other it is his first picture to star gloria <UNK> probably the greatest actress of the silent era and is the film which made her a star br br although the old demille formula was beginning to change and his films were becoming and less purely visual with such an <UNK> performer as <UNK> we regain much of that silent storytelling style her character does very little but conveys volumes through subtle gesture and facial expression Â– with a particular talent for looks of disdain in real life <UNK> was herself coming towards the end of her disastrous marriage to wallace <UNK> and it's possible that this fact <UNK> her convincing performance br br as if to best <UNK> his leading <UNK> talents <UNK> use of framing and close ups is particularly strong here he uses cinematic technique to show off the acting Â– often holding <UNK> in lengthy close ups at key moments Â– and also to <UNK> the story visually for example when we are introduced to the character of she is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror her character disappears from the story only to become important towards the end that attention grabbing first shot of her helps us remember who she was later at the <UNK> dinner <UNK> and future husband number two <UNK> cody are framed together in one shot while elliot <UNK> is isolated in his own frame also Â– and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general Â– there is much use of reaction shots Â– for example the <UNK> glance of the bishop when cody acts out his intentions with the wedding figure dolls br br in contrast to <UNK> visual narrative method was the increasingly <UNK> screen writing of his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as i've <UNK> in several other comments <UNK> could put together a strong and dramatic story but like demille she tended to state her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style and so we get these very long quasi philosophical title cards about the <UNK> of married life which if they improve the story at all it is only because they are unintentionally funny for example only <UNK> <UNK> could come up with a line like fate sometimes <UNK> in christmas shopping fortunately though in this picture these titles mostly introduce scenes rather than break them up br br although the pictures he made around this time tended to be small scale it is at this point that demille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular you can see him start to sneak in excuses for a bit of <UNK> like the little fantasy scenes of <UNK> being <UNK> with pleasure wealth and love it wouldn't be until the early <UNK> after the <UNK> on historical pictures was lifted that he would get the chance to go all out with the grand spectacle br br all in all don't change your husband is a fairly decent demille silent picture although to be honest it is only really the presence gloria <UNK> that lifts it above the average it's curious though that this is supposedly a comedy and <UNK> was cast at least in part because of her background at mack <UNK> slapstick factory she hated comedy acting and here gives a dramatic rather than a comic performance it makes sense then that the only straight drama she did with demille male and female was by far the strongest of their <UNK>
<START> okay it is terribly and i mean terribly easy to pick apart this film what do you expect with the title synopsis and actors in leads such as carol <UNK> ralph baker jr dorothy davis bill thurman and my personal favourite roger ready yes b star john <UNK> is here as a sheriff out to rid the <UNK> landscape of a robot like ape from a <UNK> experiment gone awry the movie has dreadful performances dreadful scenery dreadful special effects and dreadful lighting i really cannot find much good to say about it other than as bad films go you could do a lot worse as far as finding something dreadful to sit through it is short and has many moments of <UNK> humor missed <UNK> lighting faux <UNK> off screen terror an unbelievably inane score and of course john <UNK> trying his level best to be the core of the film with an earnest performance amidst this <UNK> the beginning is the hardest part to sit through as it seems like it takes forever for these two teens to get their <UNK> for traveling in the woods down the texas back roads where great ape soon will <UNK> his vengeance in his own terrible way yeah right night fright <UNK>
<START> sadly a great opportunity to <UNK> a superb cast to bring king <UNK> up to date however instead we got a contrived family drama that appeared to <UNK> into <UNK> when the writer had run out of ideas the cast worked hard but it just didn't <UNK> recently stephen showed how to adapt and update the classics with his screenplay for the magnificent tv movie king of texas
<START> i saw the movie after checking its rating on imdb back then it was at 8 0 and i thought wow that must be a good one i thought wrong the beginning of the movie actually keeps what the plot promises but then it goes <UNK> down underneath its basement i think without the character of <UNK> <UNK> it might have been alright although he is the reason the story line takes the course it does the character is just too extreme for my liking and hard to endure also the journey the main character takes from the beginning of the story till its climax at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily have been <UNK> the alternative is i just did not understand the movie br br although i must admit that it is easy watching and i had no problems sitting through the whole movie when it had finished i was somewhat <UNK> by the ending all in all rather mediocre
<START> spoilers br br one of the worst films i've seen since last years the village an insult to anyone of any intelligence at all poorly written and astonishingly contrived nobody especially in los angeles talks the way these characters do no subtly at all if the point of this film is to say that we all have a little bit of <UNK> in us he does a horrible job of stating the obvious not only was his point clearly base but every character in this film was amazingly stupid the car <UNK> scene almost made me walk out along with the rescue and oh lets not forget the white off duty rookie cop picking up a <UNK> black thug and i could go on and on awful just awful
<START> think with <UNK> instead of <UNK> and you get the general idea for this picture a very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti climax ending to let the door open for a part 2 let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money <UNK> i'd suggest a the <UNK> because compared to this kicked ass and i only watched that show to please my girlfriend wait and watch it on dvd on a rainy sunday when you've got nothing better to do or better yet <UNK> it so you don't waste your money the first 15 minutes were alright but the funniest line from the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when reid says kiss my ass harry potter while driving of a cliff although they are not worthy to kiss <UNK> ass because potter is way <UNK> and at least his movies have a story the <UNK> of fire was even scarier than this
<START> spoilers ahead i have a saying kill insects and kill morons the ghost in this movie kills morons several of the people who get killed in this movie are actually asking to get killed by running into abandoned houses going after ghosts etc br br on a strictly cinematic aspect this movie sucks real bad the three story lines are shown to be parallel and suddenly we learn they are separated by at least a few days it's a cheap shot br br also the thrills are so cheap they are laughable even nightmare on elm street didn't sink so low as to show someone being attacked by his own <UNK> it's pathetic br br save your money stay home and you won't have a grudge against the filmmakers
<START> i love this movie a lot i must get this on dvd i have 2 vhs copies but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward i'm forever amazed that <UNK> did almost nothing afterward he made both dr and mr hyde totally believable br br the movie is plagued by it's low budget one atrocious edit jumps into mid word and was described on <UNK> ebert but there are a thousand jokes sight gags to subtle references that more than compensate i often find myself <UNK> lines or singing i've got nothing to hide and from time to time completely describe a scene which matches some conversation there are at least six scenes which are among my all time favorite comedy bits br br viewers with no history of cocaine use may miss a lot of gags br br here take it visual of driving while waving butt out the window i said <UNK> this seat taken ' nice burn visual of <UNK> <UNK> swim <UNK> yeah i'm right handed me me says the woman trying to sell <UNK> going to love these that's my feet jack says the black feet why should we tell you she's at the supermarket <UNK> on supermarket <UNK> <UNK> whole shopping <UNK> into <UNK> etc
<START> like a <UNK> country road tough luck takes the viewer for a ride there is nothing wrong with plot <UNK> as long as believability doesn't fly out the window unfortunately in the end the film does challenge an audience's belief tolerance nevertheless it is easy to forgive this fault due to the superior acting character development and wonderful carnival atmosphere do not expect to like any of the characters <UNK> norman and play shady con artists not exactly the type of person easily admired the double crosses come fast and furious and the final cross is a bit of a stretch recommended <UNK>
<START> i don't understand the many good reviews here i found the photography and scenery beautiful and the two lead actors appealing but there's little else here to recommend this movie most annoying are the fake southern accents and badly written dialog these do not sound like real people to me although it's refreshing to show men exploring various forms of sexuality without the usual <UNK> and stereotypical character traits most of the story is without motivation or logic the only thing that makes very much sense is the responsibility griffith feels toward his mentally ill aunt grossly over acted by karen black lee is an interesting character who would have been more compelling had the dialog he was made to speak been more natural and his motivations more clear yes i understand that he's a drifter but his actions as the movie draws to a rushed conclusion make no sense at all this movie is worth a look <UNK> because it has a nice atmosphere about it but it's slow moving and deeply flawed a serious rewrite and better editing might have saved it as the premise and story outline are promising
<START> a really good australian film beautifully <UNK> the look and feel of sydney as it was in the 1950s this movie greatly impressed me when i first saw it during it's initial cinema release and it still stands up very well fine directing job by phil wonderful camera work thoughtful lighting and some fine performances across the board an absolute must see for any students of 70's australian cinema one out of the box
<START> obviously it seems many people really enjoyed this movie and that's wonderful it is certainly a very well <UNK> film and i appreciate that in an era of heartless or emotionally <UNK> films unfortunately the film has a lot of problems and it was not something i enjoyed watching br br the primary problem is the writing it is just not very funny when something tries to be snappy or witty and fails that is far worse than when it hasn't attempted wit at all this film is to a great degree a series of snappy but gentle come backs between adult family members none of which seem imaginative or apt there is also a few central premises in the film that seem like too much of a stretch of coincidence or character motivation to be believable or really work some of the back story seemed more intriguing and did serve to <UNK> the story around the edges fairly well but it couldn't make up for the moment to moment <UNK> that <UNK> almost all of the movie br br the directing editing doesn't support the film well either although i don't know to explain how exactly somehow things always seemed to me rather fake and that the actors were forcing there way through unnatural material for the most part they tried and i don't fault any one person here there were also too many small and <UNK> roles in it outside the immediate family br br not a good rental in my opinion though again apparently a number of people found it very charming i am <UNK> i suspect that perhaps people over 60 might enjoy this film more
<START> i've just seen this film in a lovely air <UNK> cinema here in <UNK> and since the <UNK> outside is <UNK> somewhere around with very high <UNK> my was not wasted br br failing that i haven't seen such a piece of extremely well made junk in a long time this is the kind of film that provides a test of taste as it were anyone who claims to like or love it goes immediately onto the same list of tasteless <UNK> who still go around talking about the <UNK> of british television at least the <UNK> old broad in the wheelchair was good for a few <UNK> br br pseudo <UNK> and fat lips while characteristic of much french cinema really do not a good movie make i'd rather watch independence day 10 times in a row than sit through this stinker one more time
<START> i couldn't disagree more with those who says this is a lousy movie me and my friend went to see it during the <UNK> film festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival dolls being used in horror movies aren't something new but i haven't seen that many movies were it has been as well carried out as it is in this movie the atmosphere the setting the actors the camera work everything is just beautiful and they really work well with each other now if you expect this film to be another grudge or ring then you probably won't like it but if your out for a good stylized scare then it's perfect even though it's pretty predictable and at some times laughable i still recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks go see it now
<START> it starts off with a view of earth and <UNK> <UNK> br br where do we come from and where we are headed br br the story starts with the dawn of man a documentary like view of the pre historic grass eater ape that was facing its <UNK> due to no physical ability that would let him hunt to eat and the lack of grass and water in the africa the monkeys hadn't survived if it wasn't for the god like <UNK> of an alien <UNK> that somehow transformed the apes that touched it and gave them the ability to use tools that were first used as weapons that allowed them to kill pigs to eat for super and to kill other monkeys in fights for water that ape was man an enigmatic start for an enigmatic film br br after the fast forward that leaves the movie at the present days we see a magnificent dance of <UNK> at the sound of <UNK> the rest of the movie is about how tools got control of man the strange <UNK> appears once again to <UNK> man to his final stage the br br at 1968 the year this movie was released only <UNK> had idea of what was out there in space after this movie that changed it's <UNK> took 7 years to be explored the special effects are incredible they are completely realistic even today br br the directing along with excellent taste in music good acting and the fantastic filmography makes it an epic br br the plot with its vision of the year 2001 and the evolution of man tools with an <UNK> with the <UNK> end makes it the trip our lives br br if you have never seen this movie see it don't be scared with the lack of dialog sit back and enjoy it's a <UNK> of evolution it's terrific
<START> although not a big <UNK> brothers fan i am an admirer of their dark humor films like <UNK> and crossing ' i have been much less impressed by their other comic mode goofy camp or is that camp goofy unfortunately <UNK> brother where art <UNK> ' falls into the latter category and isn't even as good as 'the big or 'the <UNK> <UNK> ' br br <UNK> <UNK> is basically an episodic series of in jokes without much point and not all that much humor or <UNK> either as most reviewers have noted the film's plot is very loosely Â– and as far as i could tell quite <UNK> Â– based on the odyssey its main character <UNK> everett <UNK> george clooney is an like his <UNK> <UNK> and has as his <UNK> goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a <UNK> of course we don't discover that this is what the clooney <UNK> character really wants until long after we've stopped caring and what does homer have to do with cool hand luke chain gangs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a la indiana jones cult <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a talent for blue grass country music singing an association with baby face nelson a clark gable <UNK> <UNK> and other random and <UNK> character traits and encounters i leave that for others to <UNK> br br the <UNK> to preston <UNK> in <UNK> title is equally pointless yes viewers familiar with the <UNK> minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan <UNK> hollywood and comedy hoping to make and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot scene <UNK> e g <UNK> <UNK> cars and the chain gang <UNK> into view a movie but so what the <UNK> brothers don't seem to have anything to add to the art for <UNK> sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art they obviously fall into the former school but that doesn't seem to <UNK> the reference in the slightest is it an homage if so why make it i like post modern pop culture reference and <UNK> play as much as the next person but it's a lot <UNK> when it amounts to something at least <UNK> if not <UNK> consistent Â– and not just an <UNK> <UNK> br br this screenplay is simply a silly mess the only consistent and consistently pleasing element is the folk country music soundtrack it doesn't have much to do with homer or preston <UNK> but considering the rest of the film that's probably a good thing on the other hand i'd recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd
<START> after seeing forever hollywood it would be natural to want to see a john waters film at least one get to say that they have joined the <UNK> of cinema <UNK> who have experienced the unique cinematic <UNK> of perhaps the best known non mainstream director it's worth the effort and <UNK> is a lot better than <UNK> and there is a certain <UNK> about his films which his followers find <UNK>
<START> one of my favorite westerns and one of john ford's best in my opinion no major stars but ben johnson shines in most everything he appears and here he gets a rare lead as the title character matching him is ward bond as the <UNK> mormon elder leading his people west john ford's stock of character actors including harry carey jr jane <UNK> russell simpson and hank <UNK> provide ample support as does <UNK> silent james <UNK> a member of the outlaw <UNK> clan that joins up with the <UNK> train the mormon trail into <UNK> was one of the most <UNK> and demanding <UNK> ever <UNK> we can't really get the feel of that but we do see <UNK> that had to be overcome by <UNK> on the way west river <UNK> long stretches of dry desert encounters with indians and the like all set to glorious song by the sons of the <UNK> the <UNK> actually did dig sections of the trail with picks and <UNK> as depicted in the movie my main regret is that it wasn't made in color but i believe there is a <UNK> version by the way those <UNK> rocks featured in various scenes are called the fisher towers located near highly recommended viewing
<START> spoilers every major regime uses the country's media to it's own ends whether the nazi <UNK> of certain <UNK> or the <UNK> chinese alternative of square <UNK> have tried to influence the people through different <UNK> since the beginning of time in <UNK> though celebrating the failed <UNK> of <UNK> the russian communist government supported the creation of this film <UNK> a major piece of cinematic history it remains powerful and beautiful to this very day br br set aboard the <UNK> the crew are unhappy in miserable living conditions and with <UNK> <UNK> food they are angry at their upper class now though after the rotten food enough is enough led by <UNK> the crew turn upon their masters and fight for their freedom br br as far as propaganda goes <UNK> is perfect presenting a positive light on the first <UNK> communist <UNK> the film was a useful soviet tool <UNK> years after the films release though and the <UNK> has disappeared completely off the map the amazing thing about this film though is that whilst the country it's message was intended for has disappeared the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema br br written and directed by <UNK> <UNK> the film is surprisingly a joy to watch it is true that it is far from what we would nowadays consider <UNK> but the film is a beautiful piece of art br br whether it be the scenes aboard the boat or the often talked about scene on the steps of <UNK> everything about this film is perfectly made the music is powerful and dramatic the lighting is flawless even the acting whilst slightly overdone is perfect for the piece basically there is no way to fault this film's end product br br it's impossible to know how the russian people received this film upon it's release <UNK> a country which has not existed for fifteen years it's difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film <UNK> as a piece of art though it is magnificent beautiful from start to finish it is far from an easy watch but it is well worth the effort
<START> this stan laurel comedy short is a cute little parody of the <UNK> film blood and sand if you've seen blood and sand then you'll probably appreciate this film and laugh at a few of the scenes that mock the <UNK> film however if you have not see that movie and just watch this film you'll probably not be very impressed though i really liked the title cards us the word bull was used repeatedly in very funny ways br br <UNK> plays a <UNK> who seems pretty dim witted and wins only because the <UNK> seem to lazy and non aggressive even the bull at the end of the film who has supposedly killed ten men is obviously just a <UNK> bull br br not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but still a cute and harmless film
<START> i saw this film when it came out let me see now this guy who had earlier down <UNK> <UNK> manages to <UNK> the funding and hire <UNK> to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and daring act to <UNK> down the world's highest peak well and here comes the spoiler what happens see after a large crew of people manage to help him get near the top and a life is lost in the bargain he gets on his <UNK> manages to make it down a very very short way at which point his <UNK> opens and that's that and instead of burning the footage to hide this amazingly <UNK> ending to an embarrassing <UNK> the guy goes ahead and releases it spoiler ends i do admire the amazing courage and effort it must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning shots they got another spoiler oh yes one of the is killed by falling into a the narrator who is <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> casually remarks that according to the religion since this man's body cannot be <UNK> his soul will <UNK> the world forever and never know rest is it worth it the narrator <UNK> yes he answers because it served the purpose of letting this clown <UNK> down <UNK> i can't remember ever seeing a more <UNK> piece of celluloid this is one to miss at all costs
<START> was written by and starred vivian <UNK> it also starred joe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and robert as the angel of death br br the story begins with introduction to played by joe <UNK> we quickly learn what role will be in this movie br br next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival <UNK> named in this film the battle of the classes is <UNK> present throughout the film the girls come from a wealthy class and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class the class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason which isn't really clear or <UNK> to the story br br at we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why <UNK> isn't encouraged to date natalie makes an appearance as well with apparently his boss the angel of death here character points out who is to die and who's souls are to be taken it's revealed as well that will have a character conflict regarding natalie and how he deals with her because of someone in his past br br meanwhile natalie is <UNK> by her ride to and <UNK> convinces her to ride home with them during the ride home takes an active role causing them to wreck horribly at high <UNK> br br the rest of the story <UNK> the collecting the souls of the dead passengers and <UNK> and natalie trying to <UNK> him to return to their bodies so they can continue to live the class and character conflicts lay in the story but are really never brought to the <UNK> or resolved br br there's an attempt towards the end to drag out some of the drama there's a lot of chasing and running which does tend to be really boring it's not really acceptable and it would've been nice had this been dealt with differently somehow to maybe increase the drama but not bore the audience br br the story and acting are decent the soundtrack is ok and even the production values are good br br robert in his brief on screen appearances does a nice job as the angel of death joe <UNK> does ok however sometimes his role acting a bit flat vivian is pretty and does a decent job as natalie although perhaps over acting a bit in a few scenes br br this may sound odd but this movie definitely could've <UNK> from some pointless nudity vivian <UNK> us a bit but that wasn't enough br br in my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie the results it's worth watching just don't expect a perfect production br br 3 10
<START> more of a near miss than a flop mr stars as alex heir apparent to and later king of a small european nation who falls in love with a willing american actress and entertainer <UNK> turner but due to <UNK> by the sly prime minister of alex as king nicely played by cedric <UNK> the lovers are separated for 12 years before being reunited in palm springs where their love is director don <UNK> who also scripts is not able to fully <UNK> his talent for snappy dialogue because of <UNK> english usage and the requisite <UNK> coupled with less than total <UNK> in evidence between the two stars results in a somewhat <UNK> tone to the screenplay <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> cutting of many scenes leading to a confusing ending the <UNK> <UNK> his scenes with turner but both performers score with good work while <UNK> main is impressive with her <UNK> effects as written with debbie reynolds placed on track by louis b <UNK> for <UNK> in the rain as a result of her <UNK> performance here only barry sullivan is heavily <UNK> by the <UNK> cutting <UNK> filmed largely in <UNK> beach california and other county <UNK> the film is <UNK> with iron strong operatic <UNK> in <UNK> as well as with original songs by harold <UNK> and dorothy fields with douglas <UNK> <UNK> handling the sound recording and notice must be made of the fine set <UNK> by <UNK> willis and the effective costume designs by walter
<START> sorry this movie was a bad made for tv movie are the rest of you on drugs when you watched it i thought the hair make up and characters were poor 2 dimensional types the story is <UNK> especially since all of the main characters are dead or nearly dead i think it's not well acted either what was up with that hair on the main guy in the <UNK> it looked glued on badly and the <UNK> looked like they were going to fall off at any moment it didn't feel like anything new was revealed in the story of the band and how the members met other bands and people i laughed all the way through it frank <UNK> looked stupid so did mama <UNK> and so did the beatles they were made out to look stupid and ridiculous also the other band people like jim <UNK> <UNK> also took a big hit at looking stupid too kind of terrible if this is how you remember these people it's a poor history lesson on music it's fictional the way it was made
<START> this neo film noir is one of a genre of late <UNK> century american films that all seem to involve corrupt characters fast cars a <UNK> of highway and of course plenty of guns <UNK> by people who appear never to have taken a gun safety course the actors are the best reason to see black day blue night there is the late great j t walsh swing blade <UNK> red rock west the last seduction and many more who did many neo films <UNK> see also breakdown then there is <UNK> forbes of the tv series star trek the next generation and homicide in a supporting role there is even the late who also appeared on a star trek episode titled the naked now a spoiler of sorts a clue really only the most innocent survive but innocence is a very relative term in a movie like this and you probably won't guess who is innocent before the final reel
<START> this show is awesome i love all the actors it has great story lines and characters it is the perfect drama james <UNK> and josh have great dialogue they both can be really funny i miss vanessa on general hospital but she's great on here james is great he can be hilarious molly <UNK> plays a <UNK> very well the writing is awesome they keep up an excellent pace the show can really leave you hanging which is one of my favorite elements of a show i cannot wait until the new season starts this show makes it to the top ten of all my shows i hope this show stays on for a really long time if people know what good is it will i never want the show to end ever
<START> kinda boring kinda gross kinda unsettling this wasn't horrible but not too good there's a good creepy bit when the statue comes to life though props to this scene not much happens and the movie just feels sort of <UNK> i was happy when it ended and don't believe anything about this being a true story very surprised this is <UNK> around 6
<START> this movie should go down in the <UNK> of as one of the worst of all time i will stop short of saying it's the worst movie ever only because i have yet to see every movie ever made i cannot make such <UNK> claims until then the story is stale the acting is horrible at best the special effects are no more than a couple of <UNK> of dry ice and a fan somebody must have been related to someone to get this movie made mr busey <UNK> this one in the dog is well trained and cute making it the only redeeming quality in this never should have made it movie two hours and 3 of my life i will never get back
<START> most of the <UNK> on this flick have been pretty damn accurate it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high <UNK> <UNK> and cry about life there is about twenty minutes of magic and absolutely no scary or thrilling moments our actress are treated like pieces of ass and seem to be perfectly happy with their position the lead characters these sons of are walking poster boys for any pop culture clothing store you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them the story steps all over itself and when it finally gets to the final battle its no more than a <UNK> match that doesn't last long enough to make up with this <UNK> script raped from the o c
<START> ray is interesting in parts and technically it's very well made but ray is often <UNK> and forgets some important details about <UNK> life all the movie shows us is parts where he's in his prime and most successful which is good it's just i wanted to see some bits about his older life too jamie fox <UNK> ray charles to a t at times it's absolutely uncanny i have to say jamie is the reason i got through this movie the 1st half is a lot better then the 2nd it's more interesting it has more <UNK> and it's nowhere near as <UNK> as the 2nd i wasn't a big fan of ray charles to begin with to be honest so i really didn't have any expectations for the film what so ever <UNK> biggest problem had to be the over length this could've been cut very easily with more relevant scenes other then the ones they used i found the early part of <UNK> life when he was just starting to get successful the most interesting he was humble back then and somewhat a gentleman and while the film may have over exaggerated his actions he got a bit too full of himself for me to care br br performance jamie fox gives a performance for the ages as ray he looks like ray talks like ray acts like ray he even sings like ray this is much more then an impression i truly believed he was ray charles he was the heart of the film and without his presence this film would've been a complete and utter bore br br bottom line ray is interesting at times dreadfully dull at others when all was said and done i was disappointed by how routine it seemed at times just because it's a film <UNK> mean it's automatically oscar worthy jamie fox deserved his oscar but the movie is above average at best worth a watch but if i were you i'd keep my expectations at a rather comfortable level br br 7 10
<START> the movie starts out with three people on a play it by ear holiday who decide to first visit a crocodile farm and then go on to a little lighter activity a fishing tour br br you pick up some interesting information about <UNK> during their visit to the farm and the information adds just enough to increase the suspense later during the movie as you recall what was told earlier on br br the action in the movie is well timed and not over done suspense is built through the what <UNK> the unknown and the sometimes gut wrenching decisions the characters make in the movie br br i found myself wondering what i would do if i was in the same boat no pun intended br br the film quality was really good and the effects where realistic believable and not over the top or cartoon looking and out of place the way you sometimes get with cgi br br as a horror movie buff i watch just about every horror movie i can get my hands on in just about every genre and this is one of the best crocodile horror movies if not the best i have seen br br watch this movie and you will not be disappointed
<START> this movie stinks imdb needs negative numbers in its rating system to properly <UNK> this turkey the acting is either wooden or over the top the film was apparently not written by anyone in particular and the monster scenes were mediocre at best even as a movie driven solely by the monster scenes those shots were so disappointing that they could not inspire any sympathy for the rest of the movie i want the 80 minutes of my life back that this movie stole
<START> on this <UNK> of mediocrity you are so much better than this br br simply put <UNK> is worthless bad acting and i use that term loosely <UNK> plot <UNK> humor and lackluster there's not even a sufficient display of feminine to spark the <UNK> interest of socially inept but red blooded males br br top gun had spectacular flight sequences to <UNK> at days of thunder had heart <UNK> racing action even point break had scenes to its credit <UNK> has none of these it's not worth your time my time <UNK> time carmen <UNK> time nor the time of anyone involved with this destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly <UNK> on something worthwhile had it not been wasted on this fodder for the <UNK> center br br the world will be a better place when we forget that <UNK> ever existed
<START> quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to <UNK> br br a group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna <UNK> as diana all do well with the scripts they were given br br so much for the good the average would include the sets <UNK> is nothing like the house described in the book although <UNK> the house they use for the <UNK> house looks remarkably like it it is clear then that the <UNK> house is far too big in the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk presumably to save money although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have <UNK> <UNK> br br now to the bad the screenplay this is such an <UNK> bad adaptation is hard to find words to <UNK> it edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives <UNK> he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide why <UNK> has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible <UNK> wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than brief encounter gus a man <UNK> and <UNK> in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint walter <UNK> in the book turns from a shallow <UNK> husband to a devoted family man jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak aunt <UNK> still has a drink problem but now without any justification the <UNK> house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers whilst miss <UNK> breasts are utterly delightful i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward the delightfully named <UNK> becomes the mundane <UNK> the word limit <UNK> me from continuing the list br br there is a sequel which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story it is difficult to image that <UNK> <UNK> would have <UNK> this grotesque <UNK> of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased
<START> how offensive those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible i can imagine those at nbc saying ok let's make a movie to <UNK> those <UNK> christians but they'll never know the difference if we don't have anything factual or in the correct <UNK> order well they were wrong anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and <UNK> for their involvement in this <UNK> atrocity i only gave this movie a 1 because i couldn't give it a 0
<START> a bored television director is introduced to the black arts and <UNK> projection by his girlfriend learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body the man finds a <UNK> interest in his life and a sense of <UNK> unfortunately the man discovers while he is sleeping his spirit leaves his body and his <UNK> body <UNK> the streets in a murderous rampage according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br the synopsis isn't entirely correct as it turns out br br anyway the movie opens with a <UNK> out of body example of handsome director winston as paul <UNK> 's newly discovered <UNK> body experience it also <UNK> an upcoming <UNK> young andrew as matthew <UNK> being a kid draws pictures of the blue man as his murder spree begins handsome detective john novak as stewart kaufman discovers the victims are connected to mr mr <UNK> investigation leads to the supernatural a prime example of which is karen black as <UNK> with whom fears he is falling in love br br several in the cast perform well but the blue man winds up <UNK> itself up in a <UNK> aka eternal evil its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good
<START> i absolutely loved every minute of this film jack black and kyle <UNK> most definitely brought the thunder in this epic tale of friendship hard <UNK> and destiny br br filled to the <UNK> with unnecessary swearing in every sentence toilet humour and the general rule breaking attitude this movie is a must see for the hard core <UNK> d fans of the world br br we follow the journey of young jack black and <UNK> kyle <UNK> as they try and recover the pick of destiny to win the open <UNK> night and to become the greatest band on the planet the duo have to overcome obstacles such as a room full of <UNK> a man with one leg and the devil to accomplish their task i'll let you see whether they make it or not br br the soundtrack itself is awesome enough and now we see the d in person making the experience even more magical a must see for anyone who calls themselves a <UNK> d fan watch out for the inside jokes from the first album
<START> travis and sandy ben johnson and harry carey jr are horse <UNK> <UNK> into selling their animals to a mormon group and <UNK> them across the frontier to a <UNK> what they do not expect is to encounter the notorious <UNK> murderers with their wounded leader uncle <UNK> charles <UNK> ward bond portrays elder the main voice for the mormon group moving the <UNK> train to the <UNK> destination along the way they also encounter doctor a hall and his <UNK> and lend them help br br lovingly directed by ford who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems any group would encounter during a rugged <UNK> trail the film has a wonderful cast made up of character actors with <UNK> a true star in the film which is actually a <UNK> to see if just not for a change of pace young johnson and carey jr come off real well but this is <UNK> film to shine as he has the best lines johnson is the one who seems to understand <UNK> and <UNK> like <UNK> and will certainly come in handy when certain conflict might develop as the <UNK> boys ride along side them a piece br br i'd have to say this is one of his best and most least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well
<START> <UNK> with spike is one of those shows that will definitely audiences either you like it or you don't personally i find most of the bits hilarious but it does have some huh moments br br <UNK> like idiot <UNK> are always good for a laugh but my all time favorite bit has to be the one off hollywood <UNK> comedy for <UNK> is the only regular bit that generally leaves me confused which is part of the point spike and his team of writers manage to <UNK> out loads of fresh comedy time after time so the show never feels stale brand of humor may not be for everyone but it's definitely worth trying br br the masses have spoken we like this show and want more please note i am not a friend of or <UNK> in any way with spike <UNK> with spike staff or fox network and it's just plain funny
<START> i'm an <UNK> to me history and truth mean a lot br br this film is made after a novel published in <UNK> which is still being updated up to this day as if it was a history book well it's not the movie is about the novels 1950s version some actors were great but that doesn't cover the plot br br in short man <UNK> a super bomb so god and his friends hold a <UNK> to see if they must <UNK> the devil <UNK> man and for defense we have the spirit of man what is the spirit of man anyway and why was the first <UNK> adam eventually you just get us christian propaganda in a <UNK> grade history book of the time though other <UNK> are mentioned only european christianity is explored br br first we get the <UNK> story the women are <UNK> stereotypes of <UNK> in distress real cave women were as strong as men and just as <UNK> hard times hard life adapt and survive all this is watered down by mid century stereotypes br br next we get first <UNK> construction today we see a different story and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well <UNK> mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it as if there was only one <UNK> build br br the part about <UNK> and one true god was as if the spanish <UNK> was asking nicely <UNK> itself was never even mentioned in the movie br br helen of <UNK> evil grim was so vile that i didn't see why so many were even interested in her in reality they were just soldiers following <UNK> orders who were discussing a political issue of power she was just an excuse br br the <UNK> story was were i saw this film was to inaccurate and filled with propaganda here brother was a lot younger she was not obsessed with poison was quite educated to <UNK> library content and was politically <UNK> to drag beaten down egypt out of dirt br br the part with <UNK> and praying christians in a cave were disgusting yes rome burned down yes there was <UNK> christianity but the way they portray it was as if the <UNK> build itself and there was no to <UNK> rome br br <UNK> the <UNK> appears in a short seen and than we jump to king arthur the <UNK> are mentioned with minimal bloodshed and there is no mention of the <UNK> east to russia that ended in an ironic battle the knights just went home and started <UNK> for fun of it a lot of stuff is put down like no <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br then they cover joan of <UNK> where she always has to much makeup and looks like a <UNK> <UNK> politics were replaced with an <UNK> court the alone on a <UNK> makes me want to ask how someone could follow here at here burning i wanted to yell now die already cheap special effects where is the fire br br by the time they mentioned <UNK> i already got fed up with the movie <UNK> spanish slaughter of america yelling queen <UNK> kick the spanish <UNK> and so on and so on br br the only reason i wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 marks brothers and all they got was the scene with manhattan and indians amusing but no more than a smile br br the witch <UNK> are mentioned briefly as well as <UNK> after <UNK> when they start portraying <UNK> things gut power hungry and <UNK> the us revolution was pursued by the french revolution <UNK> and incompetence are bad but you can't just blow the old way up out of anger you must replace it with something so they replaced the french <UNK> with new french <UNK> so we get <UNK> and his ambitions to go to india by land but they replace his motives with <UNK> and band him for only the title emperor the <UNK> in europe defeat in russia are <UNK> to <UNK> br br the us civil war the english rich <UNK> not included mister watson come here i want you almost made me laugh for teenage reasons technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic <UNK> br br eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime but none of its horrors <UNK> words i <UNK> russia this is my last <UNK> demand were hilarious it was his last <UNK> demand br br to build suspense god puts a <UNK> clock to <UNK> on the wall for the final words all mighty cant pause the universe for a second there was no need for the <UNK> speech but the defense made one last throw br br last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense apparently a <UNK> man because the bomb was to go of today his toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a <UNK> box sword now that is so <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> drew so many weapon <UNK> that its kill count surpasses the <UNK> bomb and making music out of a weapon <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> make music out of weapon fire so the man of tomorrow is already a monster br br the way i see it all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true <UNK> for mans demise and case closed and honestly compared to all <UNK> stuff our <UNK> did centuries ago we are pretty <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> these days br br to <UNK> all i will just quote <UNK> s episode it's my <UNK> that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another ain't about you <UNK> it's about what they need
<START> jane russell was an underrated <UNK> and singer see son of <UNK> and gentlemen prefer <UNK> but you'd never guess it from her display here a real stinker produced by howard hughes in his all too successful effort to kill off rko radio pictures br br the movie kills its first opportunity to show off sexy jane when it places her in a bubble bath and then has her singing i'll be switched if i ain't <UNK> <UNK> and it's all downhill from there in her autobiography russell <UNK> for the movie's number <UNK> for trouble because it was supposedly so <UNK> nowadays you could show it on the disney channel by the way said autobiography has a jaw dropping photo of russell in a bikini far <UNK> than anything
<START> i like to think i have seen it all ss the one about a family of <UNK> <UNK> the one about a family of goat eater demon child a child's rubber doll with <UNK> glued on its head several sasquatch flicks none of them good a couple of giant spider <UNK> flicks endless <UNK> sequels endless sequels endless jason sequels a <UNK> scarecrow <UNK> 'em which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's camcorder and so on i watched part of an <UNK> the other night about folks stranded on a desert island <UNK> to the death with a group of badly animated <UNK> i have even sat through <UNK> as recently again as last night well i should say i sat through parts of it having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago but nothing <UNK> to predator island about a group of <UNK> trapped on an island during a storm forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a <UNK> the <UNK> looks like it came out of a superman cartoon from the 1940s so do the aliens for that matter the photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad i turned it off halfway through good luck
<START> this film has some flaws and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening possibly the greatest film to show the within fly over country rolling kansas is a film in which nothing happens and you don't care about anybody like life it starts it moves and then it ends a few attempts at humor are made but everything falls very flat the occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance br br do yourself a favor and go see a good movie this is free and repeatedly frequently on comedy central because nobody went to see it nobody wants to see it and it's <UNK> better than dead air not to damn with faint praise but the movie's one rock song is worth listening to too bad the movie isn't worth watching
<START> i was on my way out one morning when i was checking something on the t v and came across this film i don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it what a fun and interesting one to watch well my meeting was pushed back because i couldn't get out of this film it had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty well there was a lot of realism in it the acting was good for a 1954 film subtle and genuine actions on the part of the characters that had me watching what they were going to do next that is why i ended up watching it i don't know why they don't show it more often i would rather watch this than some films they play more than necessary for history buffs people who like period films and those that are in the film appreciation groups will like this one the egyptian has a variety of <UNK> dealing with a lot of things to look at in human nature that has not changed since it's time what does that say about us those that don't like movies that take their time to unfold and tell a good story are not into film br br i haven't had the time to rent it if it is available but if i get a chance to see it again i would probably vote it a 10
<START> this show is really great it's smart it's funny it's great acting and writing this show is really the <UNK> show i've ever seen the dialogues are really funny and well acted lauren graham and <UNK> have a great chemistry you really do believe they are mother and daughter this show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with and emily just watch this show i highly recommend it it's great and definitely the best show on the air season 7 stars <UNK> september <UNK> 2006 8 on the new the <UNK>
<START> director lo <UNK> was known to read the racing papers and take <UNK> on the set tells us something about his approach to film making huh the reviews i've read fall into two categories 1 this is a film so bad it is funny or 2 this is a film so bad it is boring br br so let's get to the point we all agree on this film is really bad br br i vote for category 2 the story is almost <UNK> complex and it is further <UNK> and twisted by the remarkably poor camera work and editing yet lo <UNK> was so in love with it that he slows the pacing so we can all have a long look at it whether we want to or not br br maybe lo <UNK> was upset the day or two this film was made he just wanted to make everybody suffer cast crew and audiences alike br br spare yourself the agony
<START> this is by far the worst <UNK> adaptation ever rock hudson was badly miscast and entirely unbelievable as a hard bitten soldier <UNK> drawn to war jennifer jones was far too old for her part and <UNK> de <UNK> seemed to think he was acting in some other movie altogether they tried to make a large scale epic out of a low key romantic novel and the result is terrible as if that were not enough the whole thing is so slow overlong and dated that it is practically unwatchable rock must have kicked himself for turning down <UNK> and ben <UNK> in order to make this ghastly crap br br 0 10 to be avoided
<START> it is such a shame when actors and actresses of high quality get involved with pure crap probably because they were offered a great deal of money not one of helen <UNK> better career moves the acting of the teens is simply appalling not helped by a script that is in parts simply inept br br most of kevin <UNK> work is above average box office <UNK> but this is really below par br br this is the sort of movie that you watch on tv when there is nothing better on and you have had half a bottle of wine to drink and are waiting for the pizza to be delivered so you can drink the other half
<START> another well done moral ambiguity pieces where the anti hero makes it hard to decide who to root for br br if nothing else the <UNK> <UNK> anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies at least in 1971 there were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed br br <UNK> <UNK> did a fine job as amy and would go on to play <UNK> june this must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve year old girl on camera wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time it was probably <UNK> favorite scene given the fate of <UNK> turtle randolph it is no surprise that <UNK> grew up to be a hardcore animal rights <UNK> br br <UNK> page was likewise excellent playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint it is interesting that she died just three days after elizabeth <UNK> committed suicide throwing herself through a fifth floor window as they had also worked together in you're a big boy now br br <UNK> who looks like she could be blair <UNK> sister was wonderful as <UNK> and should have gotten an oscar no other performance was even close that year but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her <UNK> shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch like marilyn <UNK> incredible performance in the <UNK> the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing br br finally there is jo ann harris who is stunningly perfect as the <UNK> carol for my money harris was the <UNK> actress of the 1970's combining <UNK> with intelligence and humor she was the best reason to watch the most wanted television series and the only reason to watch wild wild west <UNK> hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star
<START> the future of fantasy never looked so dark christopher <UNK> gets to fight the evil demon grendel in this grim looking trashy fantasy <UNK> <UNK> i said er there's only one location so you can't really call it an epic adventure can you the location is a medieval futuristic 5 inch tall castle so how did they manage to <UNK> in all the actors oh i get it those where special effects a <UNK> silly me br br here's some reasons why you might want or not want to watch this motion picture br br <UNK> gets to do his sword swinging tricks over again like he did in <UNK> br br the sets and costumes are amazingly cool if you're a 12 year old br br has a <UNK> pair of <UNK> which she likes to show off through out the whole movie br br er christopher <UNK> has white hair br br every time they start fighting this over the top raving <UNK> soundtrack gets going so why are these medieval <UNK> <UNK> fighting while they should be dancing br br they don't have electricity in this castle but they do have <UNK> <UNK> which seem to work fine so where's the i guess they borrowed it from the <UNK> dj who delivered the soundtrack br br watch it for the climax in the end which features an outrageous cgi creature coming straight out of any <UNK> 2 survival horror game br br if all this got you interested then go watch it at your own risk but don't tell anyone i told you to i strongly suspect <UNK> visiting the set while shooting because this movie has no soul anyway if you want to see beautiful really show some skin then watch paul verhoeven's hollow man
<START> gone with the wind and scarlett are two different films they were never meant to be compared obviously the original actors in <UNK> are all passed away and deserved their own separate award and praise i loved <UNK> and never really expected a sequel to be made or ever live up to half the praise of <UNK> but to my shock scarlett was just as well written directed and acted as <UNK> scarlett in its own right deserves just as much award i now can honestly say i don't know which i like better i think the script for scarlett was a number 1 as a sequel bravo writer director producer and all actors bravo as sequels rarely live up to their name sake this one runs equal to its predecessor to those who don't like it you miss the point and a great ending to phenomenal beginning
<START> i say sadly because if you see this movie now you realize how low our media has sunk all the warning signs are in this movie br br it's a great film i think the last great james brooks film but others may disagree it has rich characters who are believable as well great acting great writing and although the music got a little cheesy i even liked that br br william hurt has never been better holly hunter is stunning and albert brooks walks away with every scene he's in this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and compelling and made the whole movie <UNK> above it's vital and important topic of the news and how it's slowly being <UNK> in our nation br br watch this with network for a truly fun and frightening evening
<START> stephen is a genius he is the king of geniuses watching this movie makes me feel dumb but it's a great movie not highly entertaining but very very intriguing the movie centers around wheelchair bound stephen a man who makes einstein look average and his theories and scientific <UNK> about the universe time the galaxy and black holes everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think got the universe and the <UNK> figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they'll write it all down well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours here is a man who despite suffering from lou <UNK> disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen watch this and listen in on how he has <UNK> theories on black holes awesome you won't be the same after you see it
<START> i see it when i was 12 year old and i dream to see it again br br what marvelous sammy davis jr singing it ain't necessarily so
<START> the best part in this movie is the first one located in <UNK> i suppose shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising the rest of the story is quite boring <UNK> insists on stereotypical situations and characters trying to melt <UNK> and video music technique <UNK> and a very annoying and completely off topic soundtrack leading the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an <UNK> long story cut abruptly short frankly this is a real overrated movie and is a real overrated director
<START> don't be greedy sums up the depth of this movie all the rest of the <UNK> is big budget window dressing the movie <UNK> through hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much none of the potentially interesting plot <UNK> are developed yet the trite ones are <UNK> and <UNK> to excess br br the charm of <UNK> as others have pointed out was in the <UNK> device the humor woven into the fabric of the movie and most importantly the acting there is enough wooden acting in the box to attract a giant <UNK> of martian <UNK> br br the biggest problem with <UNK> disbelief during this mess is the glaring question why would a <UNK> superior power capable of taking over the government need to do any testing at all awful failure of a movie
<START> i can get over the political parody even if this was suppose to be a masters of horror flick br br but what i can't get over is the blatant usage of our war heroes and their sacrifice as <UNK> in some washed up horror <UNK> political statement br br to me it was purely insulting to <UNK> and our heroes i have family at <UNK> the idea that this guy <UNK> would even portray the <UNK> graves being disturbed just makes me want to <UNK> br br i'm done with <UNK> and done with <UNK>

<START> if regarded as an independent feature i can't say it's too bad at all but from where i'm standing this sequel and the original lady and the tramp don't agree with each other they are two completely different movies with different style different voice personalities different <UNK> and about the only thing that they share with each other is the visuals e g the town house of jim dear darling lady and tramp and none of those have changed br br if you're seeking any kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like <UNK> <UNK> and the cats song this sequel won't give you any at all just about every song has a little pop to it and those good old characters like jock and <UNK> jim dear and darling and aunt sarah and her cats may well be seen but they're seeming to be somehow replaced by new characters not to mention <UNK> not appearing at all whose voices are quite annoying even lady and tramp don't appear often enough and as for <UNK> he is so <UNK> and treats his father tramp with utter <UNK> then runs away with no <UNK> even after hearing how much he's being missed at home and they called his shameless <UNK> an adventure i'd say scott wolf truly brought out the abusive bad boy in <UNK> <UNK> out the typical cute disney animal even the old characters just drive you mad in this <UNK> sounds like goofy sick in bed jock jeff stupid bennett and his voice sound neither scottish nor worth hearing <UNK> him off as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the dumb <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dogs somebody put them down br br lady and the tramp 2 isn't completely bad if you're not already having a tough day but i expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic <UNK> is so is his girlfriend angel and there is a feeble storyline still i think you should try it at least once because as i say there are much worse movies around
<START> this version of <UNK> park while being extremely accurate to the novel lacked the compassion i felt for <UNK> which is crucial and central to this jane austen story this was due to the total lack of acting ability by the actress le she had no appeal and at times appeared to be either lost in space or out of her depth the scene she has with her uncle where she breaks down in <UNK> was hysterical she badly <UNK> that crucial scene and i actually felt sorry that henry crawford ever cared for her br br the polar opposite is the portrayal of mary crawford by jackie smith wood what a wonderful actress in a very difficult part to make that character witty and self centered selfish yet vulnerable to love br br i have always loved <UNK> she is mild mannered but with an <UNK> sense of what is right and who she thinks is worthy of respect and admiration the <UNK> in this adaptation is too meek and <UNK> with hardly a thought of her own until near the end of the series as much as i wanted to like this <UNK> i just could not br br i suggest skipping this version of <UNK> park for the real thing the novel <UNK> will not disappoint you will love her
<START> jewel thief is one of those suspense thrillers in which the viewers are left guessing till the end who the villain is suspense builds from the very first scene when the jewel thief becomes a national problem and there are cleverly <UNK> clues in the film so that you can guess who is the jewel thief the story portrays that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the film and the jewel thief have identical faces but you get a 1000 <UNK> shock when you finally come to know the villain there are many surprises and a lot of <UNK> stuff going on but there is time for romance and six <UNK> ever lasting songs sung by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kumar and <UNK> br br this film was also talked about for its <UNK> videos consider the <UNK> and counter <UNK> in <UNK> or the <UNK> of road by <UNK> <UNK> when <UNK> was going out with her friends in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or the romantic <UNK> are are in the beautiful or the wonderful dance by in <UNK> add to it <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and you will never forget this film for any reason br br able acting by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kumar <UNK> and and direction by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> younger brother makes this one of the best loved hindi films of all times even today
<START> when i think bollywood i think of <UNK> feel good musical dance numbers with gorgeous outfits on the men and women and catchy tunes horror thrillers mystery and suspense don't come to mind though and this to my western eyes is like an abstract comedy br br i think it would have been a better movie shorter even if the writer and the director had made a definite choice either gone for outright thriller horror comedy mystery supernatural suspense or musical romance instead of an awkward mixture of them all br br i'll have to say more than once i thought the director must have seen i know what you did last summer and tried to give it a bollywood twist my first film was bride prejudice which i thought was acted well br br this seemed like what a western audience would consider a straight to video cheese fest br br the acting was over the top at times it felt like they were intentionally trying to parody western thrillers but when you saw them try to <UNK> the dramatic crying screaming or fear it felt out of place br br the viewer was left wondering when one of the actors would <UNK> at the camera more than a few times when the audience was supposed to be horrified we could only <UNK> a the absurdity br br i watch a lot of foreign films and even though i don't know hindi i have to say they did a poor job <UNK> the film sometimes it was difficult to read the white <UNK> against the bright background br br the villain was particularly amusing at least to me because he came with his own mood music the supposed surprising twist actually felt like a cop out br br the lead couples were handsome pretty enough and the musical numbers made it worth my rental <UNK> i'd suggest it to someone as a musical comedy but i'd tell them to just fast forward the rest of the movie because it wasn't worth the effort of reading if you're determined to read a whole subtitled hindi flick then check out the superior romantic drama <UNK> br br but i was not scared unless that's really what they think is horrifying in india 1 out of 10 for what it's being <UNK> as 6 out of 10 for it's unintentional <UNK> ability to <UNK> lots of laughs and it's musical dance numbers enjoy
<START> how often do you see a film of any kind that has a talent show with <UNK> last stand is a <UNK> here <UNK> is selling <UNK> but isn't making any money <UNK> <UNK> mickey and <UNK> come to visit him which is ironic because in both 3 men in a <UNK> and came the <UNK> where there was competition between and <UNK> for affection back to the story the gang taste the <UNK> to see if <UNK> made it right one funny moment is when gets a glass cup for <UNK> and <UNK> fills is and gives it to <UNK> and has an angry expression on his face <UNK> <UNK> a floor show to go with the <UNK> and even mickey agrees ever so cute when the floor show begins there is no one at the <UNK> but then a <UNK> comes in <UNK> asks him if he wants <UNK> but all he does is nod no <UNK> asks him numbers of time in the short and every time <UNK> no <UNK> displays many expressions on his face which is funny <UNK> tries many ways to make him <UNK> one way is when after mickey said ever so <UNK> those <UNK> are <UNK> and they made me <UNK> there is also many entertain musical bit is this short the opening number is by <UNK> which she tap dances and sings the second includes singing off key as usually with mickey leonard <UNK> and <UNK> about how dry i am i believe they sing that to make <UNK> it also made me laugh the closing number includes boys and girls all dressed up in an old fashion way this was last our gang short a grand musical short that is a pure 10 out of 10
<START> charlotte <UNK> arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full time nurse there she is confronted with a <UNK> group of <UNK> and a seemingly <UNK> <UNK> is dr masters all she seems to be br br don't look in the basement is one of the best low budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me the acting is excellent my favorite performance being by betty chandler as <UNK> the <UNK> the chills just jump right off the screen you probably won't have to say it's only a movie it's only a movie it isn't that scary but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low budget horror genre which i do it is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed axe is another cheap film that is looked down upon maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesn't have excellent effects and or isn't considered a classic doesn't have a chance with an audience but i think that after people see this movie they will see how important the low budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish
<START> <UNK> is yet another <UNK> this do ' entry into the brit <UNK> genre and is sure to keep <UNK> who aren't expecting too much moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers however for anyone seeking intelligent quality entertainment it's really best avoided br br there are so many in the appalling script that even an actor of the <UNK> of colin <UNK> is left looking <UNK> the action is set in the 1980s but it's never clear why especially when they haven't been able to pull off any convincing feel for that decade it takes more than a few 80s soul records on the soundtrack the occasional <UNK> suit and a handful of 30 year old cars then we see central characters studying <UNK> such as sun the art of war and speaking about how violence should be a last resort while the same characters seem only too willing to start <UNK> out punches with all the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> abandon of a bunch of fighting over a bag of <UNK> br br character development does not exist in <UNK> nor does irony subtlety or pathos this is a film which <UNK> on fond memories of guy <UNK> early gangster films which despite their flaws certainly had much more wit better editing dialogue and packed more emotional punch than this limp little saga they're a decade old now anyway isn't it time we moved on from trying to <UNK> them
<START> pretty bad this film about a <UNK> and frankly rock stupid old <UNK> and his i e <UNK> as well as an annoying kid whose name i can't recall at the moment at the beginning of the movie the old <UNK> has deliberately buried himself in some sand so that the poor dog will have to dig him out why did he hate the dog <UNK> somehow or other this idiot has managed to strike gold and goes to tell his partner but the man has died and his sleazy other partner is happy to assist old jonathan in digging up the gold the <UNK> tries to leave is dog with the dead guy's son but not even the retarded <UNK> wants to stay with this kid there's quaint old preacher for quaint read <UNK> and the <UNK> guy finished off the old guy surprise surprise and tries to steal all the gold plus he <UNK> the dog and tries to kill the kid too so i suppose its okay that a <UNK> and crazy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does this the guy in at the end although its pretty disturbing in what is basically a children's movie there are extremely stereotypical to the point of racial <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who speak without using <UNK> as in me make camp fire type speech and that's pretty much the extent of the cast because apparently <UNK> <UNK> was too big for them to hire anyone else kind of dull not very interesting and a tad too dark not a great movie in any way
<START> the film is a gross <UNK> of <UNK> lifestyle and practice never will a jewish court <UNK> a divorce between <UNK> couples although the concept exists in jewish law the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place <UNK> couples do find it difficult to cope with their in a community where children are a very important part of life but nowhere are they rejected by their community as depicted in the film they are treated with extreme sensitivity in fact many great <UNK> have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce br br the depiction of a horrible human being is meant to perhaps <UNK> show the behavior of a typical <UNK> male in reality it is as typical as a violent <UNK> rapist is typical of <UNK> society both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable br br it is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a movie by someone who is personally biased against a community i have always thought that it is only the <UNK> because of their narrow <UNK> and <UNK> lifestyle who judge all <UNK> people based on the violence and <UNK> conduct they read about in <UNK> or see in the movies
<START> warning reading this entry after watching the movie like released a year before <UNK> tries to illustrate what happens when the <UNK> and mainstream albeit right wing america meet a violent end ensues although this film is for the most part a slow moving display of traditional old fashion american morals versus the 60's do what feels good lifestyle it is also a commentary on upper class vs lower middle class and their inability to meet in the middle as illustrated when the meet the <UNK> joe represents a generation stuck in the 1940s and 50s where <UNK> a <UNK> for <UNK> or <UNK> or hippie for that matter is okay so long as it helps and saves america joe and wife mary jo are clearly the <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> wife edith this movie which will forever be known for it's violent but not bloody no blood is seen at all ending is uneven however joe <UNK> <UNK> the hippie generation then literally lays down with them to <UNK> their numbers to locate daughter when clearly he should have been <UNK> by the idea but <UNK> the idea for the sake of sex when he is betrayed through <UNK> read trust of the older generation to the newer generation he <UNK> out through an <UNK> chain of murder perhaps it is due to the of hollywood that the watcher expects blood <UNK> death in the end scene but the <UNK> shootings long for any sort of impact or realism <UNK> is not a great movie but it is an interesting display of class and culture alienation and the <UNK> underlying extremes to the generation gap
<START> i have always been a fan of bottom grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states the chemistry between and is always genius and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail i thus sat down to watch this movie with great <UNK> and was utterly disappointed by the end br br the first 3 4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed sorry but with some utterly brilliant moments unfortunately these laugh out loud moments make you realize how less than brilliant the rest of the movie is the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous br br the end of the movie the scenes for those of you who've seen it was perhaps the worst ending i've seen in the past decade honestly it was one joke repeated about thirty times followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense which didn't bother me and wasn't funny which did br br to sum up i was sorely disappointed by this movie i shall <UNK> to the few brilliant moments in it to retain the memories that i can but i have to warn you if you're about to for your <UNK> <UNK> tape from the local don't there are far better things to spend your money on
<START> robert jordan is a television star robert jordan likes things <UNK> on time and properly executed in his world children are to be seen not heard so why would mr jordan want to become the master of a <UNK> band of boy <UNK> ratings his staff figures that if learns how to interact with the youth they will be more inclined to watch his show of course watching jordan cope <UNK> most of the fun br br like mr and mr goes to college this one is sure to please br br anyone interested in <UNK> a copy of this film please write to me at <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> this is not a great movie as tho the cast especially the kids admirably help to carry along this very sad yet contrived plot it is filled with clichÃ© upon clichÃ© poor family in 50's mid america dying mother alcoholic father 10 children 1 of whom has <UNK> and an awful decision to be made its very easy to watch and some of the kids performances are moving without being <UNK> or <UNK> and little frank and steal the show for me with the last scene leaving me <UNK> no matter how many times i see it a great rainy afternoon movie i recommend to all only those with the hardest of hearts could fail to be moved by it not on a par to choice but a good tv movie equivalent
<START> the love letter is one of those movies that could have been really clever but they wasted it focusing on a letter <UNK> havoc in a small town the movie has an all star cast with nothing to do tom <UNK> and alice <UNK> had so recently co starred in the super hilarious in out also about an upset in a small town in which they were both great but here they look as though they're getting drug all over the place i can't tell what the people behind the camera are trying to do here if anything but they sure didn't accomplish anything how tragic that a potential laugh riot got so <UNK> wasted
<START> this movie is the most moving and funny movie i've seen in a very long time as a housewife <UNK> and a fan rupert i found it to be sympathetic anyone who <UNK> angry <UNK> has it wrong kathy bates is not really an actress i know but she is perfect the whole cast is perfect for their roles julie andrews had me in <UNK> i am watching it after reading auto biography so the inclusion of her was even more fun it is at times terribly moving i am not really a fan of the type of music in the film but you get drawn in to the romance and find you are singing the songs for days this movie deserves to be more widely available our favourite scene involves <UNK> and a gun and his <UNK> watch it and see
<START> jack black and kyle <UNK> play fantasy versions of themselves in this comic showcase for their side band <UNK> d an art rock outfit with satirical <UNK> lyrics an ex runaway obsessed with heavy metal and a <UNK> living pot smoking <UNK> who pretends he's a rock god meet and form a band the <UNK> on both their butt <UNK> form the <UNK> <UNK> opening with a funny prologue which apes a twisted sister video from the '80s the pick of destiny is a fairly well produced movie aimed at older kids it occasionally resembles nothing more than a middle aged variation of wayne's world with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a climactic bout with himself yet black and <UNK> have an enormously comfortable <UNK> they also acted as producers co wrote the script and all the music the target audience will obviously go for it though inspiration is a bit low particularly in the second half just about the time our heroes <UNK> <UNK> the cops in a student driver car the music sequences are far more successful than the attempts at movie satire and for the first thirty minutes or so jack <UNK> manic enthusiasm is <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> david lynch's <UNK> full length feature film <UNK> drive is a deeply touching story about betrayal and jealousy if anything it brutally <UNK> our ambitions and hopes to the often bitter truth every frame of this movie has importance and <UNK> to other parts and to themselves at the same time nothing is what it first appears to be and you're left with a real puzzle as you end up trying to put the pieces together it is a movie that does not compromise nor does it fail to fully handle the challenging form and camera language as might have been the case earlier with lost highway br br although one clearly <UNK> classic <UNK> <UNK> and devices the movie remains highly original even in the light of it being a lynch movie lost highway marked a new way of telling a story <UNK> an unconventional mean of setting emotions on to the screen with <UNK> drive lynch not only managed to control this technique but takes it to new levels in making it much more complex and multi dimensional in doing this he creates a <UNK> of different layers in time and of the human mind in a press <UNK> on the cannes film festival 2001 david lynch said that <UNK> for perfection at best could give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts talking about like this becomes highly relevant to <UNK> dr where the different sequences and many details contribute to the total <UNK> and parallels <UNK> to create the story in some art the beauty of it lies in its this is not the case with <UNK> drive and has never been with lynch it is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds lynch creates the same complexity that <UNK> the real world br br it never gets forced like in my opinion for example <UNK> does using an original way of <UNK> with the viewers further comparing <UNK> drive to other movies i think it proves david lynch as a master of what he does and bridges art and film making in a way that no one has ever done compared to for example <UNK> <UNK> or contemporary matthew barney i do believe that lynch more clearly manages not letting the artist dominate the film maker or more likely david lynch better understands and <UNK> film making as an art form br br understanding the plot is no small feat but lynch's way of working with sound perspective <UNK> and form paints a work of art so dark and frightening that it sometimes feels more realistic than real life the <UNK> cinema is often and most definitely in <UNK> drive a <UNK> of human emotions working with emotions is a delicate craft that demands understanding and depth as lynch puts it a little bit too much and the emotion goes away a little bit too little and it doesn't happen in <UNK> drive david lynch has no problem making this balance lynch's <UNK> span all kinds of <UNK> and take different directions creating incredibly realistic characters and situations watching <UNK> drive is a journey through the <UNK> it is a truthful and naked movie with <UNK> artistic value that is why i love <UNK> drive and what's taken it to the <UNK> of cinema history the ultimate movie
<START> there was nothing remotely funny about this movie it makes fun of various sports movies and clichÃ©s but nothing about it is remotely funny most of the movies they parody doesn't even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it non the main actor was well cast in it but that's really the only good thing about this film also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage thank goodness i only spent 4 on it as this is not something worth spending money on only watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes
<START> this movie was fun especially if your between 8 and 15 frankie and amanda <UNK> make a believable team of <UNK> <UNK> getting back at an adult who really deserves it paul <UNK> makes a great adult who you really want to <UNK> my 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it parents no really bad words or any sex to worry about recommend it for the <UNK> crowd <UNK>
<START> this is not a movie that i would typically watch at 2 30 in the morning but i got into it and couldn't stop until it was over br br <UNK> <UNK> demonstrated that he is not just a young actor here but could handle more demanding roles the fact that he has been handed those roles in the last two years is testament to his ability br br it was really his movie sure there were others involved but they pale in comparison to his role br br this was a time when gold was reserved for the <UNK> this victory opened it up to the masses much the way that tiger woods has opened golf to all races br br like harry stephen said to lord peter <UNK> if mr <UNK> <UNK> wins tomorrow it's because he's the best because of who he is not who his father was not how much money he's got because of who he bloody is and i'll thank you to remember that go get charged up
<START> i thought this film was amazing and i laughed so much that i had to see it twice to catch the bits i missed whilst <UNK> over holding my stomach the critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an iq over their shoe size to find this film funny well my iq is <UNK> <UNK> i challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words this film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant br br the musical numbers were so imaginative everyone when watching any film about that period of time will notice men in <UNK> and realise how different it is to today's <UNK> and how funny we would find today's male population if they wore <UNK> day in day out the idea of <UNK> a song to butch men dancing in <UNK> was so fresh how can anyone not laugh plus also seeing hip hop <UNK> doing ballet is always hysterical as a dancer also i've done ballet and hip hop and <UNK> with men who've had to do both it still cracks me up each time br br i love this film if anyone hasn't seen it yet don't listen to the critic above watch it and then decide for yourself
<START> im a die hard <UNK> army fan and nothing will ever change that i got all the tapes dvd's and and every time i watch listen to them its brand new br br the film the film is a re run of certain episodes man and the hour enemy within the gates battle school and numerous others with a different edge introduction of a new general instead of captain square was a brilliant move especially when he wouldn't cash the <UNK> something that is rarely done now br br it follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms starting up and training all in all its a great film for a boring sunday afternoon br br two draw backs one is the germans bogus dodgy accents come one germans cant <UNK> the letter w like us and two the casting of liz <UNK> instead of the familiar janet davis i like liz in other films like the carry <UNK> but she doesn't carry it correctly in this and janet davis would have been the better choice
<START> matthew <UNK> this is a name worthy of <UNK> this is the individual that took fingers to keyboard and came up with one of the worst scripts of all time clichÃ© predictable an insult to the <UNK> intelligence br br is he the sole of blame of course not <UNK> <UNK> took this abysmal excuse for a script and made it into a movie sam jackson and ed harris actually read it or not and chose to star in it <UNK> <UNK> br br this is the denise richards of film scripts there aren't enough <UNK> in the universe to give proper recognition to how truly horrible this writing really is br br in all fairness samuel jackson's profession is incredibly novel and the manner in which it's presented is highly creative but at the end of the day it's all just <UNK> pretty <UNK> br br package it any way you want garbage writing is still garbage writing
<START> when i first <UNK> that there was going to be the world is not enough video game for the <UNK> 64 i was so excited when it finally came out i was one of the first ones to rent it i rented it for 7 days and i got through the whole game the game was to easy and gave out too much hints a <UNK> sequel to <UNK> take my advice and do not rent this game br br sure the guns and <UNK> are cool but one gets tired of a watch <UNK> that looks like it was taken right from <UNK> with the exception of being a red color instead of a blue color a poor excuse for a <UNK> gun horrible <UNK> and a stupid <UNK> hook that can only <UNK> itself to things that are yellow and black br br i think that rare should of made this game instead of <UNK> who should stick to games there good at making like sport games and should clear of first person <UNK> and let the masters do the work
<START> this would definitely not have been my kind of movie but my husband saw it on tv and said it was really good so on his recommendation i bought a copy since i didn't know if it would ever be on tv again i had never heard of anybody in it except <UNK> <UNK> at first i had a hard time getting into the story because the first part of the movie is a <UNK> of images and it doesn't make much sense it is only later in the movie that it all comes together the scene cutting if that's what it's called is a bit jarring it sometimes looks as if a few frames have been cut out of each scene and the scenes are jerky but i guess that was done to add to the if that's a word the story <UNK> here and there and just about the time you have it all figured out everything turns upside down and you have to <UNK> your thinking as to who is the bad guy and who is not or bad woman the acting is very good i kept thinking how much norman <UNK> looks like leo <UNK> the ending was a real twist totally unexpected which i liked a good show
<START> well not much really to say about this but it is really good very good job from directing and the movie have good cast of acting movies plot is also believable and <UNK> good so the good is main word in this case i just hope there would be more this kind scifi movies thats why this one s pointed out in the crowd i give it 8 5 of 10
<START> i managed to avoid reading <UNK> in college from what i could tell along with his <UNK> <UNK> he offered <UNK> story lines this film of into a simplistic <UNK> <UNK> narrative does not <UNK> me of my <UNK> a guy who barely sees action on the european battlefield hudson falls in with a nurse jones and they <UNK> to spend time together <UNK> big contribution to narrative was the romantic <UNK> who knows what these two lovers have in common they're so utterly generic the movie never even brings up the utter <UNK> it takes to abandon the front in favor of a <UNK> adventure the two have a season on the <UNK> straight out of a j crew <UNK> a number of better scenes are <UNK> by corny conventional melodrama elsewhere the movie keeps <UNK> on tiny improbable <UNK> details that fight the epic treatment the <UNK> hospital that miss <UNK> works in is virtually empty so that no secondary plot line can possibly distract from the flimsy main story complicated it is not br br the camera work is better than average with some amazing location photography director charles <UNK> or maybe huston does striking things in the first hour with an on location wide screen camera there are no second unit cop outs <UNK> shows massive <UNK> <UNK> pans over a line of hundreds of soldiers through the mountains and then with a 90 degree of his camera catches up with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> down on him br br hudson looks great he's a better actor than he gets credit for but with material like this he can become very mechanical <UNK> plays a one dimensional <UNK> jennifer jones is <UNK> and miscast in the lackluster female lead the movie is best when she's off screen the love scenes are about as affecting as a coffee commercial
<START> this is one of the best films i've seen in the last years and <UNK> shine in their respective roles he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic <UNK> words won't do this masterpiece justice suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain <UNK> and capacity for self <UNK> that go with it although it's dressed as a film noir forget that feeble remake with jolie and <UNK> see the genuine instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty
<START> telling the story wouldn't be the point at all would it spelled almost like <UNK> is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people including myself br br children's island is the title and what an island in the book <UNK> the main character has the <UNK> world record book as his own bible and he's keen on breaking new records himself in particular the youngest person under water for three minutes br br the story is as most swedish films and books of the time deep <UNK> provocative and awe inspiring bergman was beginning his final film and cries and <UNK> was barely out expectations for any swedish film were pretty high they taught us then that great theatre great actors superb writers and gifted directors made a <UNK> team of perfection in cinema br br all this said is a story of discovery it is too a story of alienation cities are <UNK> and living in one of them make us aliens to most of its residents it is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny it is a film of overwhelming hope and desperation of feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and <UNK> from a world that couldn't care less br br this approach in itself is a pretty difficult way to <UNK> a convincing narrative here the masterful <UNK> of kay <UNK> on <UNK> script of p c novel turns it not only in a possibility but in one of those master pieces of cinema br br i may disagree a bit with someone who said that this work was all but forgotten it is not even as i write this in 2009 discussions on p c story are <UNK> all over the world and the film shown at many film schools and small theatres br br why <UNK> philosophical on all of it would be difficult and many have already done it <UNK> through writing and <UNK> the reason why was and is a special story is the <UNK> feeling you get from the start when you discover that everything is told through the eyes of a small child and that's where it ends too maybe it's a <UNK> view as someone else pointed out but deeply disturbing moving and satisfying the concept is deep as long as we have no <UNK> hair we still can live one more day as an angel afterwards we'll become what <UNK> reflects as the of his experiences men are pigs he finds his fears when he's <UNK> he finds love when the world is <UNK> around him he discovers a reason not to behave like the grown ups because he <UNK> from committing crimes he let go his inner <UNK> and confidence in others without <UNK> just to learn how rotten the soul of a man can be br br where love is expected he finds hatred where compassion is needed he finds suspicion and cold hearts it's a film of <UNK> a film to think and to raise questions that are hard to ask but harder to answer br br in the end the satisfaction of witnessing such a superb work that really <UNK> the <UNK> for any other swedish film after is a ride of joy and hope be aware that it is a film full with the dark side of our nature but alas a film of hope and deep joy <UNK> will still be an island in <UNK> but there is the big hope of living today in full even when we found our first signs of sexual maturity show
<START> any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in to this god awful college experiment it was lousy slow and painful to watch running time of only about <UNK> minutes it felt like three and half hours the only person to blame is the director who knows nothing on how to direct a scene where to place the camera 95 of this dreadful movie was shoot by long master shots two or three people in the frame talking or yelling forever or what seems like forever no close ups no medium shots there are two so called fight scenes that any filmmaker with a brain would have shoot some close ups or medium shoots for them they looked very amateurish the scenes with the father and son screaming at each other would have worked better if there was a cut away of just the father or just the son acting or <UNK> <UNK> c must be very <UNK> to show this any where i have seen a bunch of bad movies in my time some of them are fun because they so bad this is not one of them
<START> this mini series is iconic of the australian spirit while there may be what are perhaps considered glaring inconsistencies the film portrays a spirit that is unique to australia and one that should be <UNK> if anything this mini series demonstrates the aussie sense of humour the ability to laugh at the <UNK> ridiculous our <UNK> to have a laugh in even the most dire of situations while a large part of this series focuses on and how humour can be used as a means of survival it also has elements of drama that are evoke real emotions the main actors who appear are absolutely sensational and very convincing in their different roles capturing the essence of their characters perfectly this mini series should be mandatory viewing for all <UNK>
<START> some people may remember ms russell from films such as black widow which had some appeal and critical acclaim boy she must have really needed a rent check when she signed on to do this dog br br yes there will be those who like the gratuitous violence and nudity but one must sit back and wonder in retrospect what possessed anyone to spend money and time to make this in the first place i just saw this movie on one of the <UNK> and i can't believe they picked it up br br in 1996 ms <UNK> didn't have the physical <UNK> she did earlier in her career but come on having her play ma barker her sons all look like they could be her brothers it's also creepy in that you think there are going to be incestuous relationships occurring thank goodness there aren't hope that doesn't count as a spoiler with eric roberts and <UNK> <UNK> added into the cast this one is b movie <UNK> to <UNK> all the way br br the scenes between <UNK> and ma barker either in person or on the phone are a <UNK> in terrible terrible acting oh wait i forgot terrible terrible writing as well <UNK> this one up to experience a bad experience
<START> i loved this movie and i never knew it was this old it came out the day n year i was born in and now i am 19 now i still love this movie especially the songs like my mother and boys and girls of rock n roll and i remember as a kid i believe i was 5 n my sister was 6 and my cousin boy was 6 as well we used to pretend to be the characters in the movie i was and <UNK> and my sister was and my cousin was alvin simon and theodore those were good times and i miss it and having this movie reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for this stuff and so am i and my <UNK> we are not going to forget about the <UNK> and the <UNK> movie i still even remember the songs and the words off by heart even though i haven't seen this movie for 12 years but now starting to love it again alvin and the <UNK> and 3 3 3 3
<START> let me say first off that i am a huge fan of the original series <UNK> <UNK> and the book it was based from i have put off watching this sequel for the better part of 10 years due to the bad reviews i'd heard about it if tommy lee jones wasn't playing capt call i didn't see the point if larry wasn't involved why should i care how wrong i was br br this is in so many ways a worthy sequel to <UNK> <UNK> maybe even more so than the dark mood of streets of the story acting production cinematography are all top notch of course the script isn't as colorful as <UNK> <UNK> but it has it's moments and much to my surprise there are bits of <UNK> done in this series the relationship between july and clara completely <UNK> in the prequel is brought up here almost identical to the book a most welcome surprise the story isn't all <UNK> it has it's surprises too by far the biggest surprise is jon <UNK> interpretation of capt call while not a direct copy of tommy lee jones' his is both faithful and unique to <UNK> credit the cast is fantastic all across the board and i don't think rick <UNK> has done a better job of acting than in this series oliver reed practically steals the show here he is superb in a role that makes you care for his character as equally as you hate him br br it is worth it to watch this if you haven't due to bad criticisms especially that the dvd is so <UNK> i got the 2 disc set for 10 99 you can probably find it cheaper it is in no way the disappointment that dead man's walk turned out well it was for me and was involved with that one
